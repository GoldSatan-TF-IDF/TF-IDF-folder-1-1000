brave new worlds dystopian stories for christie introduction by john joseph adams nineteen eightyfour fahrenheit and of course the book this anthology is named forbrave new worldare the cornerstones of dystopian literature in novel form but there has never to my knowledge been an anthology collecting all the best classic works of dystopian short fiction in one volume this book aims to do exactly that spanning from to the present day from what is perhaps the classic dystopian short storythe lottery by shirley jackson to stories just published in the last two years but which will surely stand the test of time the roots of the word dystopia dys and topia are from the ancient greek for bad and place and so we use the term to describe an unfavorable society in which to live dystopia is not a synonym for postapocalyptic it also is not a synonym for a bleak or darkly imagined future in a dystopian story society itself is typically the antagonist it is society that is actively working against the protagonists aims and desires this oppression frequently is enacted by a totalitarian or authoritarian government resulting in the loss of civil liberties and untenable living conditions caused by any number of circumstances such as world overpopulation laws controlling a persons sexual or reproductive freedom and living under constant surveillance whether or not a society is perceived as a dystopia is usually determined by ones point of view what one person may consider to be a horrible dystopia another may find completely acceptable or even nighutopian for instance if you dont care about procreating then living in a world in which the birth rate is strictly regulated wouldnt seem very dystopic to you to someone who values that very much however having society tell you how when or how often you can procreate would seem like something out of a nightmare or a person who doesnt enjoy reading or intellectual thinking might not care if books are banned or even hunted down and destroyed as in fahrenheit whereas you dear reader would probably care very much many societies in fiction are depicted as utopias when in fact they are dystopias like angels and demons the two are sides of the same coin this seemingly paradoxical situation can arise because in a dystopia the society often gives up a in exchange for b but the benefit of b blinds the society to the loss of a it is often not until many years later that the loss of a is truly felt and the citizens come to realize that the world they once thought acceptable or even ideal is not the world they thought it was thats part of what is so compelling and insidious about dystopian fiction the idea that you could be living in a dystopia and not even know it dystopias are often seen as cautionary tales but the best dystopias are not didactic screeds and the best dystopias do not draw their power from whatever politicalsocietal point they might be making the best dystopias speak to the deeper meanings of what it is to be one small part of a teeming civilization and of what it is to be human and so here are thirtythree such stories representing the best of what dystopian fiction has to offer so read

act bnwa of save the state report all pinks the lottery by shirley jackson shirley jackson best known for penning this classic story was the author of several novels such as we have always lived in the castle and the haunting of hill house the latter of which has been adapted to film twice both times as the haunting she is also the author of dozens of short stories which appeared in magazines including the new yorker colliers good housekeeping harpers mademoiselle the new republic and the magazine of fantasy science fiction frequently anthologized and taught in classrooms around the world the lottery is a masterwork of dystopian fiction and is a story whose influence can be felt in several of the other stories in this anthology literature of the early twentiethcentury is rich with characters struggling to understand the dwindling importance of rural life whether the small towns and agrarian communities were rejected by the characters or if their loss left them pining there could be no doubt that rural communities were drying up from sherwood anderson to john steinbeck to the stage of thornton wilder writer after writer tried to capture the end of era science fiction and fantasy writers tackled the topic too many of ray bradburys greatest pieces are saturated with nostalgia for lost times in little country towns in our first story we offer you one of those small towns a place not so different from bradburys beloved green town illinois like green town its full of ordinary people working hard to get by who are drawn together by an annual ritual the morning of june th was clear and sunny with the fresh warmth of a fullsummer day the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green the people of the village began to gather in the square between the post office and the bank around ten oclock in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on june th but in this village where there were only about three hundred people the whole lottery took less than two hours so it could begin at ten oclock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner the children assembled first of course school was recently over for the summer and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher of books and reprimands bobby martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones and the other boys soon followed his example selecting the smoothest and roundest stones bobby and harry jones and dickie delacroix the villagers pronounced this name dellacroy eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys the girls stood aside talking among themselves looking over their shoulders at the boys and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters soon the men began to gather surveying their own children speaking of planting and rain tractors and taxes they stood together away from the pile of stones in the corner and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed the women wearing faded house dresses and sweaters came shortly after their menfolk they greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands soon the women standing by their husbands began to call to their children and the children came reluctantly having to be called four or five times bobby martin ducked under his mothers grasping hand and ran laughing back to the pile of stones his father spoke up sharply and bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother the lottery was conducted as were the square dances the teenage club the halloween program by mr summers who had time and energy to devote to civic activities he was a roundfaced jovial man and he ran the coal business and people were sorry for him because he had no children and his wife was a scold when he arrived in the square carrying the black wooden box there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers and he waved and called little late today folks the postmaster mr graves followed him carrying a threelegged stool and the stool was put in the center of the square and mr summers set the black box down on it the villagers kept their distance leaving a space between themselves and the stool and when mr summers said some of you fellows want to give me a hand there was a hesitation before two men mr martin and his oldest son baxter came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while mr summers stirred up the papers inside it the original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before old man warner the oldest man in town was born mr summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box there was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here every year after the lottery mr summers began talking again about a new box but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anythings being done the black box grew shabbier each year by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color and in some places faded or stained mr martin and his oldest son baxter held the black box securely on the stool until mr summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded mr summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations chips of wood mr summers had argued had been all very well when the village was tiny but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box the night before the lottery mr summers and mr graves made up the slips of paper and put them in the box and it was then taken to the safe of mr summerss coal company and locked up until mr summers was ready to take it to the square next morning the rest of the year the box was put away sometimes one place sometimes another it had spent one year in mr gravess barn and another year underfoot in the post office and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the martin grocery and left there there was a great deal of fussing to be done before mr summers declared the lottery open there were the lists to make up of heads of families heads of households in each family members of each household in each family there was the proper swearingin of mr summers by the postmaster as the official of the lottery at one time some people remembered there had been a recital of some sort performed by the official of the lottery a perfunctory tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse there had been also a ritual salute which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box but this also had changed with time until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching mr summers was very good at all this in his clean white shirt and blue jeans with one hand resting carelessly on the black box he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to mr graves and the martins just as mr summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers mrs hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square her sweater thrown over her shoulders and slid into place in the back of the crowd clean forgot what day it was she said to mrs delacroix who stood next to her and they both laughed softly thought my old man was out back stacking wood mrs hutchinson went on and then i looked out the window and the kids was gone and then i remembered it was the twentyseventh and came arunning she dried her hands on her apron and mrs delacroix said youre in time though theyre still talking away up there mrs hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front she tapped mrs delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd the people separated goodhumoredly to let her through two or three people said in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd here comes your missus hutchinson and bill she made it after all mrs hutchinson reached her husband and mr summers who had been waiting said cheerfully thought we were going to have to get on without you tessie mrs hutchinson said grinning wouldnt have me leave mdishes in the sink now would you joe and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after mrs hutchinsons arrival well now mr summers said soberly guess we better get started get this over with sos we can go back to work anybody aint here dunbar several people said dunbar dunbar mr summers consulted his list clyde dunbar he said thats right hes broke his leg hasnt he whos drawing for him me i guess a woman said and mr summers turned to look at her wife draws for her husband mr summers said dont you have a grown boy to do it for you janey although mr summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally mr summers waited with an expression of polite interest while mrs dunbar answered horaces not but sixteen yet mrs dunbar said regretfully guess i gotta fill in for the old man this year right mr summers said he made a note on the list he was holding then he asked watson boy drawing this year a tall boy in the crowd raised his hand here he said im drawing for m mother and me he blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like good fellow jack and glad to see your mothers got a man to do it well mr summers said guess thats everyone old man warner make it here a voice said and mr summers nodded a sudden hush fell on the crowd as mr summers cleared his throat and looked at the list all ready he called now ill read the names heads of families first and the men come up and take a paper out of the box keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn everything clear the people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions most of them were quiet wetting their lips not looking around then mr summers raised one hand high and said adams a man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward hi steve mr summers said and mr adams said hi joe they grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously then mr adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper he held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd where he stood a little apart from his family not looking down at his hand allen mr summers said anderson bentham seems like theres no time at all between lotteries any more mrs delacroix said to mrs graves in the back row seems like we got through with the last one only last week time sure goes fast mrs graves said clark delacroix there goes my old man mrs delacroix said she held her breath while her husband went forward dunbar mr summers said and mrs dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said go on janey and another said there she goes were next mrs graves said she watched while mr graves came around from the side of the box greeted mr summers gravely and selected a slip of paper from the box by now all through the crowd there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hands turning them over and over nervously mrs dunbar and her two sons stood together mrs dunbar holding the slip of paper harburt hutchinson get up there bill mrs hutchinson said and the people near her laughed jones they do say mr adams said to old man warner who stood next to him that over in the north village theyre talking of giving up the lottery old man warner snorted pack of crazy fools he said listening to the young folks nothings good enough for them next thing you know theyll be wanting to go back to living in caves nobody work any more live that way for a while used to be a saying about lottery in june corn be heavy soon first thing you know wed all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns theres always been a lottery he added petulantly bad enough to see young joe summers up there joking with everybody some places have already quit lotteries mrs adams said nothing but trouble in that old man warner said stoutly pack of young fools martin and bobby martin watched his father go forward overdyke percy i wish theyd hurry mrs dunbar said to her older son i wish theyd hurry theyre almost through her son said you get ready to run tell dad mrs dunbar said mr summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box then he called warner seventyseventh year i been in the lottery old man warner said as he went through the crowd seventyseventh time watson the tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd someone said dont be nervous jack and mr summers said take your time son zanini after that there was a long pause a breathless pause until mr summers holding his slip of paper in the air said all right fellows for a minute no one moved and then all the slips of paper were opened suddenly all the women began to speak at once saying who is it whos got it is it the dunbars is it the watsons then the voices began to say its hutchinson its bill bill hutchinsons got it go tell your father mrs dunbar said to her older son people began to look around to see the hutchinsons bill hutchinson was standing quiet staring down at the paper in his hand suddenly tessie hutchinson shouted to mr summers you didnt give him time enough to take any paper he wanted i saw you it wasnt fair be a good sport tessie mrs delacroix called and mrs graves said all of us took the same chance shut up tessie bill hutchinson said well everyone mr summers said that was done pretty fast and now weve got to be hurrying a little more to get done in time he consulted his next list bill he said you draw

summers said gently you know that as well as anyone else it wasnt fair tessie said i guess not joe bill hutchinson said regretfully my daughter draws with her husbands family thats only fair and ive got no other family except the kids then as far as drawing for families is concerned its you mr summers said in explanation and as far as drawing for households is concerned thats you too right right bill hutchinson said how many kids bill mr summers asked formally three bill hutchinson said theres bill jr and nancy and little dave and tessie and me all right then mr summers said harry you got their tickets back mr graves nodded and held up the slips of paper put them in the box then mr summers directed take bills and put it in i think we ought to start over mrs hutchinson said as quietly as she could i tell you it wasnt fair you didnt give him time enough to choose everybody saw that mr graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground where the breeze caught them and lifted them off listen everybody mrs hutchinson was saying to the people around her ready bill mr summers asked and bill hutchinson with one quick glance around at his wife and children nodded remember mr summers said take the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one harry you help little dave mr graves took the hand of the little boy who came willingly with him up to the box take a paper out of the box davy mr summers said davy put his hand into the box and laughed take just one paper mr summers said harry you hold it for him mr graves took the childs hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly nancy next mr summers said nancy was twelve and her school friends breathed heavily as she went forward switching her skirt and took a slip daintily from the box bill jr mr summers said and billy his face red and his feet overlarge nearly knocked the box over as he got a paper out tessie mr summers said she hesitated for a minute looking around defiantly and then set her lips and went up to the box she snatched a paper out and held it behind her bill mr summers said and bill hutchinson reached into the box and felt around bringing his hand out at last with the slip of paper in it the crowd was quiet a girl whispered i hope its not nancy and the sound of the whisper reached the edges of the crowd its not the way it used to be old man warner said clearly people aint the way they used to be all right mr summers said open the papers harry you open little daves mr graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and everyone could see that it was blank nancy and bill jr opened theirs at the same time and both beamed and laughed turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads tessie mr summers said there was a pause and then mr summers looked at bill hutchinson and bill unfolded his paper and showed it it was blank its tessie mr summers said and his voice was hushed show us her paper bill bill hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand it had a black spot on it the black spot mr summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coalcompany office bill hutchinson held it up and there was a stir in the crowd all right folks mr summers said lets finish quickly although the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box they still remembered to use stones the pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready there were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box mrs delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it up with both hands and turned to mrs dunbar come on she said hurry up mrs dunbar had small stones in both hands and she said gasping for breath i cant run at all youll have to go ahead and ill catch up with you the children had stones already and someone gave little davy hutchinson a few pebbles tessie hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now and she held her hands out desperately as the villagers moved in on her it isnt fair she said a stone hit her on the side of the head old man warner was saying come on come on everyone steve adams was in the front of the crowd of villagers with mrs graves beside him it isnt fair it isnt right mrs hutchinson screamed and then they were upon her red card by s l gilbow s l gilbow is a relatively new writer with five stories published to date four in the magazine of fantasy science fiction and one in my anthology federations gilbow served twentysix years in the air force and has been on dozens of deployments and has flown more than hours as a b navigator he currently makes his living by teaching english at a public high school in norfolk virginia everyone knows that james bond has a license to kill as an international spy he must sometimes fight for his life but hes a trained government employee specially selected for her majestys service but could you trust just anyone with a license to kill what about your neighbor or your boss in fact what if the government gave everybody one free pass to shoot one person any person for whatever reason thats the premise of our next story s l gilbow says that the idea for red card actually came from a conversation he had with his daughter mandy one day after a driver cut me off in heavy traffic i turned to my daughter and said everyone should be allowed to shoot one person without going to prison my daughter thought for a second then turned to me and said dad if that were true you would have been dead a long time ago mr gilbow might have lived to write this story but in the world hes imagined not everyone is so lucky late one april evening linda jackson pulled a revolver from her purse and shot her husband through a large mustard stain in the center of his tshirt the official after incident survey concluded that almost all of merry valley approved of the shooting sixtyfour percent of the townspeople even rated her target selection as excellent a few however criticized her pointing out that shooting your husband is a little too obvious and not very creative dick andrews who had farmed the fertile soil around merry valley for over thirty years believed that larry jackson more than anyone else in town needed to be killed i never liked him much he wrote in the additional comments section of the incident survey he never seemed to have a good word to say about anybody excellent use of a bullet scrawled jimmy blanchard born and raised in merry valley he had known larry for years and had even graduated from high school with him most overbearing person ive ever met he deserved what he got im just not sure why it took so long of course a few people made waves jenny collins seemed appalled i can hardly believe it she wrote we used to be much more discerning about who we killed and we certainly didnt go around flaunting it the way linda does jenny was the oldfashioned kind linda would never have called her actions flaunting it of course she knew what to do after shooting larry she had read the enforcement handbook from cover to cover six times poring over it to see if she had missed anything scrutinizing every nuance she had even committed some of the more important passages to memory call the police immediately after executing an enforcement always keep your red card in a safe dry place never reveal to anyone that you have a red card be proud youre performing an important civic duty but flaunting it no linda blended in better than anyone in town rarely talked and never called attention to herself she spent most of her days at the merry valley public library tucked between rows of antique shelves alone organizing a modest collection of old books in the evening she fixed dinner after larry had eaten cleaned up and left the house for some time alone linda would lie in bed reading jane austen no linda never flaunted anything never had much to flaunt after she shot her husband linda returned the revolver to her purse and collapsed onto her oversized couch she then picked up the telephone set it in her lap and tugged at her long pale bangs a nervous habit that drove larry crazy she had once considered cutting them to make him happy but sarah hall from across the street had commented on how nice they looked they really bring out your eyes sarah had said they make you look as pretty as a princess linda would never have called herself pretty but she always looked as nice as she could her makeup tasteful and modest came straight off of page twentyseven of the current issue of truly beautiful she applied her eyeliner mascara lipstick and blush precisely according to the instructions copying every detail of the models face framing each eye with two delicate taupe lines but she realized she could do no better than pass as the models homely cousin linda let go of her bangs lifted the receiver and dialed a number from a yellow sticker plastered across the phone the sticker doubled as an ad for bobs pizza heaven so she dialed carefully merry valley police department id like to report an enforcement said linda linda yes she replied trying to recognize the voice this is officer hamilton oh thank goodness she said unable to hide her relief she admired officer hamilton once while making his usual patrol through merry valley he had pulled over to help her carry two bags of groceries heavy with the dead weight of frozen meat and canned vegetables he was probably just fighting boredom but she still appreciated the help you rarely found that kind of service anymore linda paused wondered what tone to strike and settled on matteroffact ive just shot someone the enforcement handbook says im supposed to call you thats right said officer hamilton chapter three i think who did you shoot my husband is he dead he asked linda studied larry sensitive to any movement the slightest twitch hes not moving she said he hasnt moved since i shot him how many times did you shoot him once she said id recommend you shoot him one more time just to be sure said officer hamilton no said linda im sure hes dead enough the enforcement handbook recommended at least two shots but the thought of shooting larry again bothered linda the first shot hadnt been easy in spite of what the handbook said fine then but youll need to come down to the station to fill out the paperwork of course she said do i need to call someone to pick him up the handbook hadnt mentioned how to remove the body well take care of that said officer hamilton just come down to the station and dont forget to bring your red card you do have a red card dont you i do she said wonderful said officer hamilton and ill bring the revolver she said paraphrasing a portion from chapter two of the handbook and any spare ammunition you didnt use said officer hamilton we can reissue it with the card linda hung up set the phone on the floor and rose from the couch she looked at larry and the longer she looked at him the more she expected him to move it seemed so unnatural for him to be so still so silent he had always been in motion early in their courtship she pictured him as a hummingbird a large gawky hummingbird but lately she saw him as something else perhaps a mongoose larry she said without taking her eyes off him she wondered if she should follow officer hamiltons advice and shoot him again but there was no movement no sound she thought he looked like he was asleep but then she remembered the constant rolling and snoring that marked his nights no second shot would be needed linda felt an urge to wash she stepped around larrys body crossed the living room and passed through the spare bedroom into the bathroom linda filled the sink with warm water adding a delightful mixture of strawberry and watermelon soap the crimson color had never bothered her before but now she braced herself as she plunged her hands into the water she scrubbed her hands for more than minute it seemed like the right thing to do after she dried her hands on a monogrammed towel linda went to her bedroom larry and linda referred to it as the spare bedroom but it was the one room linda had all to herself her refuge from larry when he got wild even wilder than usual the room became her sanctuary and larry rarely entered it not that linda forbid him to do so its just that linda had filled it with things that made him uncomfortable a large fourposter bed dominated the center of the room on top of the bed were a handmade quilt a pile of embroidered throw pillows and a stuffed animal larry had given to linda years ago linda called the animal sally cat but lately had considered the possibility that it might be a ferret beside the bed stood an antique vanity bordered by two windows each framed with lace curtains adorned with a delicate tea rose pattern the room radiated linda there was nothing about larry in it linda scanned her closet and filtered through a row of clothes she had worn only once a wedding dress a pink prom dress and an evening gown she finally settled on a gathered lavender dress she had once worn it to the merry valley bistro the one restaurant in town linda looked forward to larry criticized her for being overdressed and she hadnt worn the dress since but tonight it seemed right the lavender dress and a matching pair of high heeled shoes linda wasnt sure who might be at the police station but crowds had a way of forming in merry valley and she wanted to be presentable besides she thought theres no chance of larry objecting when she finished dressing linda gathered the red card the government revolver and the last two rounds of ammunition and dropped them into her purse she checked her makeup in the vanity mirror and then deciding she was in no mood to drive called a taxi she opened the front door paused and surveyed the living room one last time damn it larry she said i gave you fair warning linda stepped into the dark night of a new moon her outdoor light had burned out weeks ago but the porch light on sarah halls house across the street blazed like a beacon allowing linda to navigate her steps safely sarah swaying in time to a big band tune coming from her living room deadheaded flowers that grew in large pots that framed her house she was a large nocturnal woman with a strong jaw and an unmistakable silhouette as linda neared the street sarah was attracted by the unexpected movement and gave a friendly wave linda wished she hadnt been noticed but if she had to deal with anyone tonight besides the police which at this point seemed inevitable it might as well be sarah linda liked sarah and believed sarah liked her too she liked the way she complimented her bangs she liked the cheesecakes she occasionally brought over she liked her sisterly advice often linda would call sarah when larry acted up you should get help sarah would say linda would agree and then tell her how she was starting to get things under control how she and larry were going to work things out with just a little more time but linda knew that the time needed to work things out with larry was most aptly measured in geological terms linda stopped between two small pear trees to wait for the taxi she stooped under one and felt the soil she would need to water it tomorrow larry had purchased the trees on the way back from their honeymoon five years ago the trees were the only fond memory she had of that week larry had surprised her with a caribbean cruise although linda thought they had decided to go to new york they spent two days in the bahamas but linda refused to count it as one of the places she had actually visited since she never left the ship you ever been on a cruise before larry asked as they entered their suite the question surprised linda surely they had discussed cruises in the five months they had known each other she thought for a moment but no such conversation came to mind no she said this will be my first time youre going to love it here he said but she didnt within two hours she was heaving into the toilet you should give it more of a chance larry said ill try she said its all in your attitude i think im feeling a little better she whispered trying to prove him right then she grabbed the rim of the toilet and vomited again larry spent the rest of their honeymoon pacing the ships deck occasionally between doses of dramamine linda would look out the cabin window she had never seen so much water larry refused to join her refused to eat with her refused to talk to her he had decided to boycott any activity that included linda linda stood under the pear tree until the taxi arrived as it pulled over sarah dropped her pruning sheers and dashed across the street sarah i would to love talk but i need to go i would say so sarah opened the taxi door and slid into the back seat she waved for linda to join her linda crawled in just tell me dear said sarah why did you shoot him where to asked the driver the police station said linda the taxi sped into the night linda stared out the window as the simple homes of merry valley slipped by she felt sarahs strong hands grab her arm and pull her close now dont you worry said sarah youre not worried are you a little admitted linda theres nothing to it really i had a cousin once who used a red card and he said it was the easiest thing he ever did whod he use it on asked linda i dont remember its been years at least five and it wasnt around here he said it was easy i think he shot a speeder he always hated careless drivers linda buried her face into the fat flesh of sarahs right arm she wanted to cry the handbook had mentioned thisshooters regret it will pass the handbook stated just trust your decision trust your instincts when i was young i used to drive around with my cousin said sarah he would yell at people all the time yell at them for going too slow for going too fast for cutting him off i wasnt surprised when i heard he had used a red card it wasnt easy said linda think he got an award for it used the card the same week he got it a lot of people like to see the cards circulate lets more people take part in the system howd you know i used a red card why dear i heard it on the radio they broke into phils follies theres nothing as exciting as one of the cards being used i guess said linda she didnt mind excitement she just didnt want the excitement to revolve around her by the time linda and sarah arrived at the police station a small crowd had already gathered sarah wrapped an arm around linda and pulled her close ok dear you ready for this linda nodded you stay by me she snapped with authority linda pulled in close for protection linda recognized several faces in the crowd jerry miles freddy nevers and ann davidson she knew them well enough to carry on casual conversation at the happy druggist jerrys store or mels fill em up where freddy and ann worked there were also half a dozen people not quite as familiar to her but she had seen them all around town at one time or another freddy nevers called her name and jerry miles even shouted a little encouragement way to go deputy williams met linda and sarah at the entrance to the police station and escorted them to the reception counter at one point jerry excited at having his monotonous evening livened up a little dashed toward linda to congratulate her but deputy williams reached out and shoved him back linda gave the deputy an appreciative glance where were you when i needed you she thought barry giles lead reporter for channel seven moved as close to linda as he could microphone in hand ready to broadcast the details to all of merry valley how did it happen mrs jackson he called out linda started to answer but the deputy interrupted in a low forceful voice he saved for his most serious duties therell be time for that later officer hamilton was waiting for linda behind a mahogany reception desk linda pulled a revolver out of her purse and laid it gently in front of him after officer hamilton confirmed the revolver to be official government property the crowd giving linda some space out of politeness while inching forward out of curiosity waited for the inevitable linda reached into her purse and pulled out the red card the card didnt seem special it was small only half the size of a postcard with rounded corners and a smooth edge the one mark on it was an ordinary bar code son of a gun said barry killed by a librarian with a red card said jerry thats got to be embarrassing i knew she had it said a voice linda didnt recognize like hell you did came a muffled response officer hamilton slid the card under an electronic reader and with a nod confirmed its authenticity how long you been holding it asked someone from the crowd officer hamilton checked the reading four years he said impressed at lindas selfrestraint the crowd nodded its approval my goodness said barry most of the other tickets have been circulating a lot faster than that sure have said officer hamilton how long have they been out barry asked a couple have been out for almost a year and one for about nine months im not sure about the other two id have to look it up looks like another ones going back into circulation someone said the crowd hummed with excitement officer hamilton led linda away from the crowd linda glanced back at sarah who signaled that she would be in the waiting room an unimpressive area set off by grey partitions it contained little more than four chairs a television dangling from the ceiling and two ash trays thanks mouthed linda they ended up in a small secluded room in the back of the station linda took her place in a wooden chair behind an aging table on a corner shelf stood a drip coffeepot containing the last few drops after a long day officer hamilton held up a styrofoam cup coffee looks like theres enough for one more cup no thanks said linda she could have actually used a cup of coffee but not from that pot officer hamilton sat in the chair across from linda well he said the enforcement isnt over until the paperworks done finished linda quoting the handbook this is the hard part isnt it theres no hard part he said its all easy he smiled placed an official looking form on the table and put on a pair of bifocals he read the form quickly to himself vocalizing a few key phrases orienting himself on how to proceed are you ready he finally asked linda nodded what is your name linda gave him a youve got to be kidding me look these are standard questions linda just humor me linda jackson gender linda didnt even answer female said officer hamilton in response to his own question marital status widowed said linda oh yes he said thats kind of why were here isnt it it is where did you execute the enforcement in my living room why did you execute the enforcement is that important asked linda we track these things for statistical purposes i think the real question should be why didnt i do it sooner why didnt you youve had the red card for almost four years i dont know at first i didnt want to use it because then i wouldnt have one but later it just became a challenge a challenge sometimes he would egg me on dare me to use it he knew you had a red card linda wasnt sure how to answer this she knew she wasnt supposed to tell larry about the red card just answer honestly said officer hamilton you have nothing to worry about you performed an enforcement while in possession of a valid red card thats it its that simple these questions are just to help us improve the program he knew said linda hes known for years it was a mistake to tell him because then he would test me it was like russian roulette officer hamilton made a quick note is that alright am i in trouble well some people view it as having an unfair advantage over other citizens but in this case it doesnt seem to have made a difference but it should have made a difference linda looked at officer hamilton and wondered if she was getting through to him she wanted to tell him how things were supposed to be different how they were supposed to get better slowly incrementally but better her plans were never to kill larry but to keep him alive to keep him alive forever it should have made a big difference she said he knew i had a card had he been drinking hed been out messing around he always seemed to be going someplace why did you shoot him asked officer hamilton trying the question one more time i really dont know said linda i think i just snapped linda he said his eyes narrowed people with red cards are allowed to snap its their duty to snap officer hamilton pressed on with questions for almost half an hour how did you feel where did you keep your card did the handbook prepare you for your role as an enforcer linda answered as best she could but she was ready for it all to end finally officer hamilton put down his pencil thats it he said really that wasnt so bad was it not too bad anything else just a word of advice said officer hamilton if you ever get another red card dont tell anyone i dont even know who has them the program is random and anonymous thats what makes it work if you start taking those factors out the program loses its effectiveness of course she said a little embarrassed at having made such a careless mistake officer hamilton released linda and led her to the hallway out do you need a ride he asked ill go back with sarah she said i could use a restroom though in the restroom linda checked herself in the mirror her lipstick had faded from the right side of her upper lip and black mascara crept up towards her eyebrow her blush had cracked except for the glow on her nose the night had been hard on her face she looked old and tired she freshened her lipstick brushed her hair and killed the shine on her nose it seemed futile she would need to check truly beautiful for a look that could hold up better linda left the restroom and walked down the long hall to join sarah in the waiting area she paused at the end of the hall dwarfed by the grey partitions that separated the waiting area from the rest of the police station she could hear voices several of them mingling sarahs dominant among them linda looked above the partition and saw a small television muted and pathetic hanging from the ceiling the televisions color had shifted long ago and a bald blue man in a sweater dispensed advice she thought she might have seen him before he seemed vaguely familiar was his name richard she wasnt sure but he seemed like a richard to her maybe it wasnt advice he could be warning her about something some disaster some great flood well i know what ill do if i get the card next she heard jerry miles say shoot yourself asked freddy nevers never mind i just changed my plan cackled jerry well if either of you get a card let me know said sarah you tend to live a lot longer if you know who has the cards richard now held a green spray bottle he was selling something of course why advise or warn when you can sell linda decided to wait until the conversation settled down a little more before joining sarah conversations tended to die once linda entered into them i never know who has the cards said jerry i try to make it my business said sarah i try to make everything my business she spit out the words as if they were rehearsed richard energetic and passionate now waved the bottle about in his left hand he held up a shirt and sprayed it linda moved closer to the television but she couldnt tell if the spray had any effect richard sprayed the bottle on the floor and then on himself he was obviously proud of its versatility he looked straight at linda and urged her to buy his product she needed it she needed to have what he was selling what about linda asked jerry ive known linda for years said sarah her husband too i knew her said freddy but not like i knew her dear linda hated to interrupt sarah seemed to be enjoying herself she wondered what it would be like to enjoy yourself linda continued to watch the commercial one of those long ones one of those that could go on for five minutes richard had toned down the sell and appeared to be whispering enunciating every word he had two bottles now one cradled under each arm and he was talking to linda directly to linda only to linda well she shops at my store said jerry buys a lot of makeup careful shopper always did like her sweetheart you have to like someone who has a red card said sarah kind of dangerous not to how would i have known she had a red card asked jerry i knew said sarah you knew she had a red card of course she had the card i suspected but i was never sure said a voice linda didnt recognize he seemed to be acting more important than he actually was ive known it for years im surprised you all didnt know sarah paused for effect oh i forgot you all werent sleeping with her husband the crowd laughed well i guess i wont have to like her anymore said sarah richard made his final plea under him flashed a phone number barely legible followed by the wordsmiracle madness for when clean isnt clean enough linda listened for the conversation to continue but it had stalled even sarah was silent linda pulled back into the hall found a phone near the ladies restroom and called the toll free number i want to place an order said linda which product miracle madness oh you are going to love it and with that you get miracle madness plus after linda had provided her billing information she joined sarah and the others in the waiting room sarah she said as she rounded the partition im all done now wonderful said sarah youve had a hard day and its time to get you home when the taxi dropped them off at lindas place well after midnight sarah was in full motion feeding off the energy of the evening linda had been quiet during the drive home but she didnt need to speak since sarah had rambled on without stopping sarah had pretty well resolved most of lindas problems she had told her how to improve her careerafter all you cant stay a librarian your entire life she had told her how to improve her looksthose bangs just have to go they do absolutely nothing for you she had told her how to improve her general dispositionyou have got to stop moping about finally linda asked what do i do now what do you mean the handbook never talked about this part i dont know what to do next well said sarah tomorrow we need to plan mr jacksons funeral i guess that would be next of course said linda then we bury him and then you get on with your life we need to plan a funeral said linda now dont be afraid to call if you need anything said sarah as they entered the house really anything at all anything absolutely whatever you need can i stay with you asked linda stay with me linda nodded at my house for a while at least a day or two longer if i could you really need to get back on your feet said sarah this is your home and it doesnt do any good to run from it this is your place my place said linda she stood over the spot where larry had lain now that he was gone the room seemed much more open almost cavernous sarah joined her is this it she asked he fell right here next to the coffee table replied linda they really are quite efficient the enforcement program is run so well it is agreed linda noticing that even the blood had been cleaned up all that remained was a small stain barely noticeable no worse than the tea spill on the other side of the room but linda would get all the stains out the blood the tea everything after all miracle madness was on its way i can stay for a bit said sarah turning on the television she folded onto the couch pried her shoes off and clicked through channels looking for the television version of phils follies stay for as long you can said linda ill be with you in a moment after i change the lavender dress was beginning to weigh on her in her bedroom linda slipped off her high heels and set them in her closet she then pulled off her dress and hung it neatly on a padded hanger she lay down on her bed closed her eyes and folded her hands over her face she exhaled bathing her eyes and nose in the warmth of her own breath she opened her mouth and made a guttural sound that echoed off her cupped hands she rolled onto her stomach grabbed her stuffed cat sally and pulled her close she wanted to be a cat no a ferret she would rather be a ferret linda slid off the bed and crouched on her hands and knees almost feral she could sleep here she could sleep on the carpet once it was clean that would be soon miracle madness was coming when clean isnt clean enough she moaned linda reached under the bed and felt around blindly she pulled out a shoe box adorned with a lavender bow a beautiful bow she had tied nine months earlier she loved tying bows and she was proud of this one bold and perfectly proportioned lavender she loved lavender linda untied the bow and carefully slid the ribbon off the box she opened the box pulled out a red card and a small revolver and finally cried for the first time that night ten with a flag by joseph paul haines joseph paul haines is the author of several stories which have appeared in magazines such as interzone aeon magazine and abyss apex he is also the editor with samantha henderson of the anthology from the trenches and his short story collection ten with a flag and other playthings came out in november this story first appeared in interzone and was adapted to audio on the transmissions from beyond podcast newly pregnant women face a great deal of difficult decisions and modern medical procedures have only made those decisions more complex once women expected to struggle through forty uncomfortable weeks drive to the hospital and go through the rigors of labor with their babies entire future being a mystery boy or girl no one knew healthy or ailing no one could guess but today a woman is confronted with medical technology almost from her first obstetric appointment should she have an ultrasound what kinds of blood tests should she take should she ask for maternal serum screening is amniocentesis in order these are the questions facing todays pregnant woman what about the mothers of the future what kind of tests will be offered to them what kind of choices will they need to make our next story takes us into that future here is a world where it is possible to know too much about your babys potential or at least a place where the government knows too much johnnie didnt talk while he was driving normally it would drive me a little crazy sitting there in traffic and not saying a word but this time it didnt bother me there was too much on my mind truth was i hoped he wouldnt talk so that i could have some time to think but when he pulled onto the freeway i knew i wasnt going to get that lucky it only took him a couple of seconds to connect to the traffic web johnnie didnt like being out of control it was one of the things id found endearing in him quaint even this time though he didnt even double check the connection the steering wheel folded and collapsed into the dash and he turned to face me what does that mean exactly he asked did the doctor say anything else i shook my head he said hed have to check but hed never heard of the combination coming up before hed have to check yeah did he say anything else i told you he said hed have to check i didnt know what to say it was still sinking in johnnie leaned back in his seat and stared out his window i could tell he was getting ready to turn around and go back wed only been married three years but i could read some of his expressions like a book hows that even possible he asked i mean is the baby okay the baby is fine now i wish we didnt know i turned away from him you agreed we should get the test done i know but damn dont you think its better knowing how do you get a ten and a flag he asked he said hed have to check i repeated but the babys fine yes are you sure he said ten i nodded ten johnnie crossed his arms and chewed on his bottom lip i think he mumbled something but at that point i didnt want to hear it we didnt talk for a while after that i was contented to sit and watch the other transports as we cut in and out of traffic it was like watching a school of fish swimming together weaving at the same time we rushed along at speeds of over two hundred kilometers with no more than a meter separating our vehicles our safety in the control of the central traffic computer sometimes it was easier to let something bigger than yourself take control it had a plan and although you couldnt always see it you knew youd never wreck it wasnt until we sped past our offramp that i began to get concerned where we going i asked johnnie didnt answer he punched up the navigation screen and sighed what the hell what weve been redirected we have an appointment with human services now now yeah theyve even rescheduled my workshift for this afternoon and notified the office do you think its about the test results i had expected some reaction from human services just not this quick i folded my hands in my lap to keep from tapping my fingers johnnie didnt like to see me get nervous it doesnt say great there was nothing else to do but sit back and enjoy the ride we were just passengers central had control i understand you must be apprehensive the agent said he was a small man this mr white and the huge empty desk he sat behind made him look even smaller results like these can cause a great deal of confusion johnnie started to say something i squeezed his hand before he could the last thing we needed was to anger a government official particularly one as high up as mr white seemed to be it was best to remain compliant until he finished the important thing to remember is that your baby rated a ten your child will be an asset to the nation only one in fifty thousand couples who go through the procedure come up with these results its a credit to the two of you as citizens as such the state has raised both your rating to eight effective immediately congratulations johnnie and i stared at each other eights that was two levels higher than our current rating eight meant ten hours of work as opposed to forty eight meant no more scraping by between allowance periods eight meant a much bigger apartment eight meant no more late nights while johnnie stayed at work to improve his production numbers eight meant no more looking over our shoulders thank you mr white but of course johnnie couldnt keep his mouth shut ive just one question though the flag how can there be a flag with a rating of ten mr white pursed his lips it was quite an odd gesture almost feminine and i had to keep myself from giggling eight didnt mean you could just randomly disrespect government officials well he said there is that question to be perfectly honest ive never seen it come up before but in your case i dont think its something to worry about your child rated a ten and you are now eights i dont see how there could be a problem the government wont of course stand in the way if you decide to invoke your option what if we do johnnie asked i squeezed his hand tighter but he just pulled his away from my grasp and continued what would happen to us mr white smiled there was little humor in it happen sir if we use the option to terminate the pregnancy what would happen to us why would you do that sir your child is a ten he or she will be a great credit to the nation and improve life for all of the citizenry what citizen would even consider that johnnie shook his head well the flag im worried about it worried about it mr white picked up his pen and scribbled something on his tablet yes johnnie answered your child is a ten sir mr white repeated that should be enough to make you forget about the flag well it doesnt it certainly didnt keep central from issuing the flag why would they have issued a flag unless there was some concern mr white tapped his pen on his desk a few times and leaned forward how much do you know about the cdp test central looks into the future and determines the babys community viability johnnie said thats really all there is to it right mr white chuckled well thats not really accurate central cant look into the future thats impossible he said chuckling what it does do is predict the future based off of the childs cellular past the parents cellular past and other environmental factors you see once you can witness the cellular history of an individual you can predict future activity through sheer computational power central has an over ninetynine percent success rate with this test we dont question the results i knew johnnie wasnt going to take the hint so i cut him off before he could do more damage its just so confusing mr white i said smiling as wide as i could arent flags usually reserved for children with well problems actually he said the flag is just an indication that the parents will have to make a sacrifice sometimes it means that the child will be handicapped and the parents will have to work additional hours to make up for the extra burden on the state all we know is that when a flag comes up the sacrifice necessary from the parents is sufficient to warrant giving them the option to terminate the pregnancy its how we protect your freedoms as individuals the state values that highly he smiled but our child is a ten i said tens cant be a burden on the state by definition they are the ones that make the state better thats true which is why im not overly concerned with the flag and neither should you your child will be an asset to the state youll have to make a sacrifice but what parent doesnt i knew i had to phrase my next question carefully and theres no indication as to what form that sacrifice might take you know i cant answer that mr white said and you know you shouldnt even be asking knowledge of the results can affect their outcome i see well thank you you didnt answer my question johnnie said what happens if we take the flag option mr white fidgeted in his chair well your promotion will be cancelled for one thing he grabbed a folder from the stack of papers and flipped it open youre a six now correct johnnie nodded hmm mr white said flipping through pages did you know that your boss had put in for a rate reduction excuse me johnnie leaned forward in his seat i could see his cheeks turning red i work harder than says here mr white interjected that your boss seems to think that although you spend fifty hours a week on the job your production levels only account for thirty hours worth of work he recommended you be downgraded to a five so that you can actually accomplish forty hours worth of work in sixty hours time thats not right i work harder than but you dont have to worry about that anymore mr white said smiling wider youve been promoted to an eight johnnies mouth hung open it was time to get out of there thank you mr white we both appreciate your time johnnie was still dazed by the time we got back to the transport it didnt help matters any that it wasnt the same one we had left in the parking garage it was bigger longer it was a transport belonging to a couple of eights there was no drivers seat central had control a demotion johnnie said i cant believe that no i said nodding toward the speaker panel on the dashboard a promotion what great luck doubt gnawed at my insides but this wasnt the place to discuss it we sat quietly while central directed the car onto the freeway once again we passed our offramp without slowing central johnnie said list destination the soft voice of central command filled the cabin your new residence sir new residence of course you have eighteen voice messages sir all offering congratulations on your promotion and the impending boon to the nation that your sons birth will deliver would you like to hear them so it was a boy neither of us felt much like celebrating not now central i said just take us home wed managed to go a full week without appearing in public the raise meant johnnie could work from home so we didnt have to go out if we didnt want but we both knew wed stayed hidden as long as we could id convinced johnnie to show our faces at the opera id never been to the opera it was one of the perks of the promotion and i was looking forward to the evening but even that had been a struggle since wed come home from human services hed spent all his free time in front of the computer he wouldnt even discuss the test results with me my wardrobe had picked out a deepblue chiffon evening gown for me i dressed in front of the full length mirror and once i was ready the lights dimmed while the environmental controls chose the scent of roses to fill the room it was the first time in weeks id felt relaxed a night out would do us good i only hoped johnnie would be in a similar mood instead i found johnnie still sitting in front of the computer he hadnt yet started to get ready well be late i said he glanced my direction and did a doubletake you look beautiful i crossed one ankle over the other dipped my chin and looked up at him then get up get dressed and take me on a date he sighed took a deep breath and said i do so very love you you know then get dressed he pushed himself away from the desk and walked toward his dressing room and dont even try i called after him to pick something out yourself just wear what your wardrobe chooses youd never match this color if you had all night im not completely useless oh honey i know that i said smiling as sweetly as possible youre only useless when trying to dress yourself now hurry up we made it out the door on time our new transport was no where to be seen an older model pulled up in front of our building i requested a downgrade for the evening johnnie said i felt like driving i shook my head as long as you get us there on time he held my door open and closed it behind me i waited until we left the parking lot and slid my hand onto his leg it was good to be out again even though the new apartment had plenty of room it just felt great to get out from behind the walls to get back into the world again once wed turned onto the surface streets johnnie engaged the autodrive and leaned back in his seat i thought you said you wanted to drive i lied i just wanted to talk to you without a speaker my good mood evaporated do we have to do this now did you know he asked without acknowledging my question that in the four cases where a mother has died in childbirth over the last ten years the flag option had been available in every case my stomach turned so that doesnt mean no no it doesnt mean so why are you bringing this up i asked dont you think im frightened enough already johnnie leaned closer to me but it doesnt mean it isnt possible either weve got to consider it it could also mean that our son will have a learning disability and well have to work particularly hard to get him through it my cheeks were burning i understood his concern but i couldnt believe he was going to ruin our first night out together in ages he crossed his arms and it could mean youre in danger how are we supposed to know whos to say the child actually needs us to be a ten we cant know knowledge of future events can change the outcome hes a ten thats all thats important bullshit my jaw dropped thats not all thats important by a longshot of course it is instinct made me look around to see that no one was in the car with us you dont interfere with something like that its almost treasonous of course it isnt treasonous the state wouldnt have given us the flag otherwise its our right my eyes filled with tears but hes going to be a ten hes going to be a perfect little boy yes he will johnnie replied taking my hand in his he brushed a tear from my cheek and added but perfect for who i knew we werent going to the opera even before we sped past the turnoff to the cultural district but it didnt get any easier once we were sitting inside dr jones office waiting for him to finish his examination well he said looking down at me from over the edge of his bifocals theres no genetic contra indicators no signs of pretoxemia no anemia nothing that would give me even a moments hesitation about your health or that of your child he seemed tired and his thin grey hair puffed up more on one side of his head than the other johnnie ran his fingers through his hair i just dont get it maybe its not for us to get i offered but theres nothing wrong with me im not in any danger so we can stop worrying that doesnt mean that something couldnt show up later though right johnnie i nothing is certain sir dr jones replied johnnie i grabbed his wrist and clamped down he whipped his head around to look at me and thats when i finally saw it he was terrified sweat beaded his upper lip and he couldnt keep his eyes on any one thing but its still your choice dr jones said no one is going to stop you from choosing to exercise your option the flag is there for a purpose i stared johnnie in the eye hoping hed notice the slight sidetoside shake i was giving him i think we should use the flag he said my skin froze no i whispered there will be other babies he said ones without a flag we dont need the raises i cant stand the thought of losing you tell her she can have other babies doctor of course you can have other babies dr jones said but lets not overlook why should we have to make a sacrifice johnnie asked kneeling down in front of me weve been given the option there wouldnt be a flag if there wasnt a problem you know that i tried to speak but nothing came out of my mouth he was right there was something wrong some kind of difficulty wed have to face if we had this baby difficulties we most likely wouldnt have to face with another baby but this one was a ten he could be a great composer or an artist he could discover medicine that cured the last remaining diseases he could do anything i knew that felt it with every beat of my heart the state knew that too but what was the cost i looked at johnnie and felt very cold i cant make this decision i said i pulled him in close and rested my cheek against his and whispered in his ear you make it make it for both of us he kissed my temple then my cheek then my ear his warm breath caught in his throat he pulled away turned to dr jones and said well take the option what little air remained in my chest rushed out of me the room spun very well dr jones said he removed a gown from a drawer beneath the examination table and handed it me ill give you a moment to get ready he said and left the room we didnt talk i changed into the dressing gown and sat back up on the table the longer we sat waiting the smaller the room seemed to get i wanted johnnie to say something anything but he just sat there trying his best to smile when i looked at him after a few minutes dr jones rejoined us he wasnt alone mr white from human services stood in the doorway flanked by a half dozen constables that will be all doctor johnnie stepped in front of me what are you doing this is our decision and you made it mr white said he appeared even smaller out from behind his desk johnnie shook his head and held his arms to the side trying in vain to shield me from the constables you said you wouldnt interfere mr white smiled we didnt we allowed you to make your decision of your own free will he stepped inside the door and removed a stungun from behind his back no one ever said wed let you go through with it though the flag is an option not a right arrest him the constables fell on him them johnnie tried to resist but one kick in the stomach was all it took to end that within ten seconds they had him out of the room leaving only myself and mr white go ahead and get changed he said ill wait for you outside i dressed slowly it was as if every memory i had of johnnie came back to me right then the dates our wedding the fights the makeups all of it id just stood there and let them take him i wanted to cry but held it back whatever happened to us id be strong i pulled my shoulders back and opened the door mr white was waiting for me he was still alone we understand this wasnt your choice thats correct isnt it my flesh raised with a sudden chill thats right good he said lips drawn tight and thin with his smile whats going to happen to johnnie mr white offered me his hand and helped me step down from the examination table hell be reduced to a one or two of course put to manual labor if he keeps himself clean he could even work back up to a four or five i knew johnnie wouldnt want me to live that way of course your marriage is annulled youre free to choose whomever youd like to replace him from the other eights or nines replace him mr white grimaced im sorry im afraid im not terribly good with certain social graces please forgive me of course youll want to take some time to yourself but when youre ready choose who you will by the time we walked outside the constables had johnnie packed into a separate transport and were pulling out into traffic i watched them drive away wondering if id ever see him again either way i knew hed want me to take care of our baby mr white i asked my senses beginning to return can you tell me anything about the flag it seems like i deserve to know something what flag dear the flag on my baby of course there is no flag on your baby you made your sacrifice just as central predicted you would you mean mr white chuckled of course we knew what your husband would do central is over ninetynine percent accurate remember we dont question its results my transport pulled up to the curb and mr white helped me inside central he said take the lady home shes had a hard night mr white i asked one last thing he folded his hands in front of him yes my baby can you give me any hint about what makes him so important mr white glanced over his shoulder then leaned into the car i cant be specific you know that right of course lets just say that i wouldnt be surprised to see him in human services that i hadnt expected human services well look at it this way dear hes already uncovered one traitor to the state and he hasnt even been born yet he then leaned back with that tight thin smile still stretched across his face and slammed shut the door the transport sped away whisking me home there was no driver central was in control the ones who walk away

an anthology edited by the legendary robert silverberg unusual for its story structure which includes no protagonist its exceptional narrative voice and purposeful reader engagement have made it a landmark american short story reprinted many times the ones who walk away from omelas brilliantly captures life in a perfect society a total utopia until you do a little digging omelas which if youre curious is derived from salem spelled backwards le guin is a longtime oregonian and has a selfproclaimed quirk of reading road signs backward is a city of joy and beauty and the tale is careful to unfold each of its splendors there has never been such a resoundingly happy place to live there is no crime no war and even the drugs are harmless but how is it possible for any place to achieve this level of easy delight and at what price does it come or more importantly if you lived in omelas would you be willing to pay it with a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring the festival of summer came to the city omelas brighttowered by the sea the rigging of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags in the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls between old mossgrown gardens and under avenues of trees past great parks and public buildings processions moved some were decorous old people in long stiff robes of mauve and grey grave master workmen quiet merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked in other streets the music beat faster a shimmering of gong and tambourine and the people went dancing the procession was a dance children dodged in and out their high calls rising like the swallows crossing flights over the music and the singing all the processions wound towards the north side of the city where on the great watermeadow called the green fields boys and girls naked in the bright air with mudstained feet and ankles and long lithe arms exercised their restive horses before the race the horses wore no gear at all but a halter without bit their manes were braided with streamers of silver gold and green they flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one another they were vastly excited the horse being the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his own far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling omelas on her bay the air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the eighteen peaks burned with whitegold fire across the miles of sunlit air under the dark blue of the sky there was just enough wind to make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then in the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding through the city streets farther and nearer and ever approaching a cheerful faint sweetness of the air that from time to time trembled and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells joyous how is one to tell about joy how describe the citizens of omelas they were not simple folk you see though they were happy but we do not say the words of cheer much any more all smiles have become archaic given a description such as this one tends to make certain assumptions given a description such as this one tends to look next for the king mounted on a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble knights or perhaps in a golden litter borne by greatmuscled slaves but there was no king they did not use swords or keep slaves they were not barbarians i do not know the rules and laws of their society but i suspect that they were singularly few as they did without monarchy and slavery so they also got on without the stock exchange the advertisement the secret police and the bomb yet i repeat that these were not simple folk not dulcet shepherds noble savages bland utopians they were not less complex than us the trouble is that we have a bad habit encouraged by pedants and sophisticates of considering happiness as something rather stupid only pain is intellectual only evil interesting this is the treason of the artist a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain if you cant lick em join em if it hurts repeat it but to praise despair is to condemn delight to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else we have almost lost hold we can no longer describe a happy man nor make any celebration of joy how can i tell you about the people of omelas they were not naive and happy children though their children were in fact happy they were mature intelligent passionate adults whose lives were not wretched o miracle but i wish i could describe it better i wish i could convince you omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale long ago and far away once upon a time perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids assuming it will rise to the occasion for certainly i cannot suit you all for instance how about technology i think that there would be no cars or helicopters in and above the streets this follows from the fact that the people of omelas are happy people happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary what is neither necessary nor destructive and what is destructive in the middle category however that of the unnecessary but undestructive that of comfort luxury exuberance etc they could perfectly well have central heating subway trains washing machines and all kinds of marvelous devices not yet invented here floating lightsources fuelless power a cure for the common cold or they could have none of that it doesnt matter as you like it i incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming in to omelas during the last days before the festival on very fast little trains and doubledecked trams and that the train station of omelas is actually the handsomest building in town though plainer than the magnificent farmers market but even granted trains i fear that omelas so far strikes some of you as goodygoody smiles bells parades horses bleh if so please add an orgy if an orgy would help dont hesitate let us not however have temples from which issue beautiful nude priests and priestesses already half in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any man or woman lover or stranger who desires union with the deep godhead of the blood although that was my first idea but really it would be better not to have any temples in omelas at least not manned temples religion yes clergy no surely the beautiful nudes can just wander about offering themselves like divine soufflés to the hunger of the needy and the rapture of the flesh let them join the processions let tambourines be struck above the copulations and the glory of desire be proclaimed upon the gongs and a not unimportant point let the offspring of these delightful rituals be beloved and looked after by all one thing i know there is none of in omelas is guilt but what else should there be i thought at first there were no drugs but that is puritanical for those who like it the faint insistent sweetness of drooz may perfume the ways of the city drooz which first brings a great lightness and brilliance to the mind and limbs and then after some hours a dreamy languor and wonderful visions at last of the very arcana and inmost secrets of the universe as well as exciting the pleasure of sex beyond all belief and it is not habitforming for more modest tastes i think there ought to be beer what else what else belongs in the joyous city the sense of victory surely the celebration of courage but as we did without clergy let us do without soldiers the joy built upon successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy it will not do it is fearful and it is trivial a boundless and generous contentment a magnanimous triumph felt not against some outer enemy but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls of all men everywhere and the splendor of the worlds summer this is what swells the hearts of the people of omelas and the victory they celebrate is that of life i really dont think many of them need to take drooz most of the processions have reached the green fields by now a marvelous smell of cooking goes forth from the red and blue tents of the provisioners the faces of small children are amiably sticky in the benign grey beard of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry are entangled the youths and girls have mounted their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line of the course an old woman small fat and laughing is passing out flowers from a basket and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair a child of nine or ten sits at the edge of the crowd alone playing on a wooden flute people pause to listen and they smile but they do not speak to him for he never ceases playing and never sees them his dark eyes wholly rapt in the sweet thin magic of the tune he finishes and slowly lowers his hands holding the wooden flute as if that little private silence were the signal all at once a trumpet sounds from the pavilion near the starting line imperious melancholy piercing the horses rear on their slender legs and some of them neigh in answer soberfaced the young riders stroke the horses necks and soothe them whispering quiet quiet there my beauty my hope they begin to form in rank along the starting line the crowds along the racecourse are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind the festival of summer has begun do you believe do you accept the festival the city the joy no then let me describe one more thing in a basement under one of the beautiful public buildings of omelas or perhaps in the cellar of one of its spacious private homes there is a room it has one locked door and no window a little light seeps in dustily between cracks in the boards secondhand from a cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar in one corner of the little room a couple of mops with stiff clotted foulsmelling heads stand near a rusty bucket the floor is dirt a little damp to the touch as cellar dirt usually is the room is about three paces long and two wide a mere broom closet or disused tool room in the room a child is sitting it could be a boy or a girl it looks about six but actually is nearly ten it is feebleminded perhaps it was born defective or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear malnutrition and neglect it picks its nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals as it sits hunched in the corner farthest from the bucket and the two mops it is afraid of the mops it finds them horrible it shuts its eyes but it knows the mops are still standing there and the door is locked and nobody will come the door is always locked and nobody ever comes except that sometimes the child has no understanding of time or interval sometimes the door rattles terribly and opens and a person or several people are there one of them may come in and kick the child to make it stand up the others never come close but peer in at it with frightened disgusted eyes the food bowl and the water jug are hastily filled the door is locked the eyes disappear the people at the door never say anything but the child who has not always lived in the tool room and can remember sunlight and its mothers voice sometimes speaks i will be good it says please let me out i will be good they never answer the child used to scream for help at night and cry a good deal but now it only makes a kind of whining ehhaa ehhaa and it speaks less and less often it is so thin there are no calves to its legs its belly protrudes it lives on a halfbowl of corn meal and grease a day it is naked its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered sores as it sits in its own excrement continually they all know it is there all the people of omelas some of them have come to see it others are content merely to know it is there they all know that it has to be there some of them understand why and some do not but they all understand that their happiness the beauty of their city the tenderness of their friendships the health of their children the wisdom of their scholars the skill of their makers even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies depend wholly on this childs abominable misery this is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve whenever they seem capable of understanding and most of those who come to see the child are young people though often enough an adult comes or comes back to see the child no matter how well the matter has been explained to them these young spectators are always shocked and sickened at the sight they feel disgust which they had thought themselves superior to they feel anger outrage impotence despite all the explanations they would like to do something for the child but there is nothing they can do if the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place if it were cleaned and fed and comforted that would be a good thing indeed but if it were done in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight of omelas would wither and be destroyed those are the terms to exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in omelas for that single small improvement to throw away the happiness of thousands for the chance of the happiness of one that would be to let guilt within the walls indeed the terms are strict and absolute there may not even be a kind word spoken to the child often the young people go home in tears or in a tearless rage when they have seen the child and faced this terrible paradox they may brood over it for weeks or years but as time goes on they begin to realize that even if the child could be released it would not get much good of its freedom a little vague pleasure of warmth and food no doubt but little more it is too degraded and imbecile to know any real joy it has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear its habits are too uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment indeed after so long it would probably be wretched without walls about it to protect it and darkness for its eyes and its own excrement to sit in their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the terrible justice of reality and to accept it yet it is their tears and anger the trying of their generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives theirs is no vapid irresponsible happiness they know that they like the child are not free they know compassion it is the existence of the child and their knowledge of its existence that makes possible the nobility of their architecture the poignancy of their music the profundity of their science it is because of the child that they are so gentle with children they know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark the other one the fluteplayer could make no joyful music as the young riders line up in their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the first morning of summer now do you believe in them are they not more credible but there is one more thing to tell and this is quite incredible at times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go to see the child does not go home to weep or rage does not in fact go home at all sometimes also a man or woman much older falls silent for a day or two and then leaves home these people go out into the street and walk down the street alone they keep walking and walk straight out of the city of omelas through the beautiful gates they keep walking across the farmlands of omelas each one goes alone youth or girl man or woman night falls the traveler must pass down village streets between the houses with yellowlit windows and on out into the darkness of the fields each alone they go west or north towards the mountains they go on they leave omelas they walk ahead into the darkness and they do not come back the place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness i cannot describe it at all it is possible that it does not exist but they seem to know where they are going the ones who walk away from omelas evidence of love in a case of abandonment one daughters personal account by m rickert m rickerts stories have been appearing regularly in the magazine of fantasy science fiction for several years starting in with her first publication the girl who ate butterflies her work has also appeared in sci fiction and the anthologies wastelands poe and feeling very strange a new collection of her short fiction holiday came out in november her first collection map of dreams won the world fantasy award and the william l crawford award for best first booklength work of fantasy and her story journey to the kingdom won her another world fantasy award and was a finalist for the nebula award this story was a finalist for the stoker british sf and shirley jackson awards in ruhollah khomeini islamic scholar and fundamentalist became the supreme leader of iran in this position khomeini served as the highest political and religious figure of the nation under his leadership a revolution swept across the country brushing aside years of western influences women with college educations stepped down from their work as doctors educators and business associates and returned to their traditional place in the home they put on their veils and scarves and became invisible to everyone except their closest family members rickert says that our next story was meant to take a sort of sideways look at what has already happened to women in countries where their freedom is denied its a story set in an america that has made its own conservative revolution its a world with harsh rules for women and a strict delineation of acceptable behavior in a such a place where women have given up their reproductive freedoms there are only two choices be a good girl or die when i or people like me are running the country youd better flee because we will find you we will try you and well execute you i mean every word of it i will make it part of my mission to see to it that they are tried and executed randall terry founder of operation rescue it took a long time to deduce that many of the missing women could not be accounted for executions were a matter of public record then and it was still fairly easy to keep track of them they were on every night at seven oclock filmed from the various execution centers it was policy back then to name the criminal as the camera lingered over her face yet women went missing who never appeared on execution rumors started right around then some of the policies changed the criminals were no longer named and execution centers sprung up all over the country so it was no longer possible to account for the missing the rumors persisted though and generally took one of two courses agents were using the criminals for their own nefarious purposes or women were sneaking away and assembling an army when my mother didnt come home my father kept saying she must have had a meeting hed forgotten about after all she volunteered for homeland securitys mothers in schools program as well as did work for the church and the library thats my mom she always has to keep busy when my father started calling hospitals his freckles all popped out against his white skin the way they get when hes upset and i realized he was hoping shed had an accident i knew the next morning when i found him sitting in the rocker staring out the picture window their wedding album in his lap i really knew of course i am not the only abandoned daughter even here there are a few of us we are not marked in any way a stranger could see but we are known in our community things are better for those whose mothers are executed they are a separate group from those of us whose mothers are unaccounted for who may be so evil as to escape reparation for their crimes so sick as to plan to attack the innocent ones left behind i am obsessed with executions though there are too many to keep track of hard as i try to flip through the screens and have them all going on at once i search for her face there are many faces some weeping some screaming some with lips trembling or nostrils flaring but i never see her face jenna offeren says her mother was executed in albany but shes lying jenna offeren is a weak annoying person but i cant completely blame her even my own father tried it one morning he comes into my room sits at the edge of my bed and says lisle im sorry i saw her last night your mother they got her i just shook my head dont try to make me feel better i said i know shes still alive my mother and i we have that thing some twins have thats how close weve always been once when i was still a little kid i fell from a tree at sarah t s house and my mom came running into the backyard her hair a mess her lipstick smeared before mrs t had even finished dialing the cell i just knew mom said i was washing the windows and all of a sudden i had this pain in my stomach and i knew you needed me i came right over my wrist was broke and to this day hurts when its going to rain and i couldnt do my sewing or synchronized swimming for weeks but i almost didnt mind because back then i thought me and mom had something special between us and what happened with my wrist proved it now im not so sure everything changes when your mother goes missing i look for her face all the time not just on the screens but on the heads of other women not here of course but if we go to milwaukee or on the school trip to chicago i look at every womens face searching for hers im not the only one either i caught jenna offeren doing the same thing though she denied it not mine of course hers before she left us mom was not exactly a happy person but what normal american girl goes around assuming that her own mother is a murderer she even helped me with my project in seventh year cutting out advertisements that used that model heidi eagle who was executed the year before and i remember so clearly mom saying that heidis children would have been beautiful so how was i to know that my own mother was one of the evil doers but then what did i think was going on with all that crying my mother cried all the time she cried when she was doing the dishes she cried when she cleaned the toilets she even cried in the middle of laughing like the time i told her about mr saunders demonstrating to us girls what its like to be pregnant with a basketball the only time i can ever remember my mom saying anything traceable anything that could be linked from our perfect life to the one im stuck in now was when she found a list of boys names on my t s o and asked if they were boys i had crushes on i dont know what she was thinking to say such a thing because there were seven names on that list and i am not a slut but anyhow i explained that they were baby names i was considering for when my time came and she got this look on her face like maybe shed been a hologram all along and was just going to fade away and then she said when i was your age i planned on being an astronaut my cheeks turned bright red of course i was embarrassed for her to talk like that she tried to make light of it by looking over the list letting me know which names she liked liam and jack and which she didnt paul and luke if the time ever comes and i am beginning to have my doubts that it will im going to choose one of the names she hated its not much but its all i have theres only so much you can do to a mother who is missing my father says im spending too much time watching screens so he has insisted that we do something fun together as a family he said trying to make it sound cheerful like we arent the lamest excuse for family youve ever seen just me and him theres plenty of families without mothers of course apparently this was initially a surprise to homeland security it was generally assumed that those women who had abortions during the dark times never had any children but a lot of women of my mothers generation were swayed by the evil propaganda of their youth had abortions and careers even before coming back to the light of righteous behavior so having an executed mother is not necessarily that bad theres a whole extra shame in being associated with a mother who is missing however out there somewhere in a militia or something with the vague possibility that she is not stockpiling weapons and learning about car bombs but captured by one of the less ethical agents but whats the real chance of that isnt that just a fantasy kids like jenna offeren came up with because they cant cope at any rate to counteract the less palatable rumor and the one that puts the agents in the worse light homeland security has recently begun the locks of hair program now they send strands of criminals hair to the family and its become a real trend for the children to wear it in seethrough lockets none of this makes sense of course the whole reason the executions became anonymous in the first place was to put to rest the anarchist notion that some women had escaped their fate but homeland security is not the department of consistency i think i can say that and seems to lean more towards a policy of confusion the locks of hair project has been very successful and has even made some money as families are now paying to have executed womens corpses dug up for their hair at any rate you guessed it jenna shows up at execution with a lock of hair necklace that she says comes from her mother but i know its jennas own hair which is blonde and curly while her moms was brownish gray thats cause she dyed it jenna says i give up nobody dyes their hair brownish gray jenna has just gone completely nuts it seems like the whole town is at execution and i realize my fathers right ive been missing a lot by watching them on screen all the time besides its starting to not look right never going it was different when your mother was still with us he said so i agreed though i didnt expect much i mean no way would they execute my mom right here in her home town sure it happens but it would be highly unlikely so whats the point i expected it to be incredibly boring like church or the meetings of the young americans or home ec class but it wasnt anything like any of that screens really give you no idea of the excitement of an execution and if you like me think that youve seen it all because youve been watching it on screen for years i recommend you attend your own hometown event it just might surprise you besides its important to stay active in your community we dont have a stadium of course not in a town of a population of eight thousand and dwindling so executions are held on the football field the first wednesday of every month i was surprised by the screens displayed around the field but my father said that was the only way you could get a real good look at the faces and he was right it was fascinating to look at the figure in the center of the field how small she looked to the face on the screen freakishly large just like on screen at home the women were all ages from grandmothers to women my mothers age and a few probably younger the problem is under control now no one would think of getting an abortion theres already talk about cutting back the program in a few years and i feel kind of sentimental about it ive grown up with executions and cant imagine what kids will watch instead not that i would wish this on anyone its a miserable thing to be in my situation maybe no one will even want me now i ask my dad about this on the way to execution what happens to girls like me and for a while he pretends he doesnt know what im talking about until i spell it out and he cant act all homeland security he shakes his head and sighs its too soon to say lisle daughters of executed moms theyve done all right maybe you know not judges wives or agents or anyone like that but theyve had a decent time of it for the most part daughters of missing moms well its just too soon to tell hey maybe youll get to be a breeder he says it like its a good thing giving up my babies every nine or ten months i hate mom i say he doesnt scold me after all what she did she did to both of us it seems like the whole town is here though i know this cant be right because its the first time ive come since i was a kid and that would be statistically improbable if we were the only ones who never came back but even though i am certain its not the whole town id have to say its pretty close to it funny how in all these faces and noise and excitement i can see whos wearing locks of hair lockets as if they are made of shining light which of course they are not i could forgive her i think and im surprised by the tears in my eyes if shed just do the right thing and turn herself in maybe im not being fair after all maybe shes trapped somewhere held prisoner by some agent and theres nothing she can do about it i too take comfort in this little fantasy from time to time each execution is done individually she walks across the entire field in a hood the walk takes a long time cause of the shackles i can think of no reasonable explanation for the hood beyond suspense it is very effective the beginning of the walk is a good time to take a bathroom break or get a snack thats how long it takes no one wants to be away from his seat when the criminal gets close to the red circle at the center of the field the closer she gets to the circle led by one of the junior agents or as is the case tonight by one of the children from the towns various civic programs the more quiet it gets until eventually the only noise is the sound of chains ive heard this on screen a million times but then there is neighborhood noise going on cars maybe someone talking on a cell dogs barking that sort of thing but when the event is live theres no sound other than maybe a cough or a baby crying i have to tell you all those people in the same space being quiet the only sound the chains rattling around the criminals ankles and wrists well its way more powerful than how it seems on screen she always stands for a few seconds in the center of the circle but she rarely stands still once placed in position hands and feet shackled she displays her fear by wavering or the shoulders go up sometimes she is shaking so bad you can see it even if youre not looking on screen the child escort walks away to polite applause and the executioner comes to position he unties the hood pauses for dramatic effect and it is dramatic then plucks the hood off which almost always causes some of her hair to stand out from her head as though shes been electrocuted or taken off a knit cap on a snowy day and at that moment we turn to the screen to get a closer look i never get bored of it the horror on their faces the dripping nostrils the spit bubbling from lips the eyes wet with tears wide with terror occasionally there is a stoic one but there arent many of these and when there is its easy enough to look away from the screen and focus on the big picture what had she been thinking how could she murder someone so tiny so innocent and not know shed have to pay when i think of what the time from before was like i shudder and thank god for being born in the holy times in spite of my mother i am blessed i know this even though i sometimes forget right there in the football field bleachers i fold my hands and bow my head when i am finished my father is giving me a strange look if this is too upsetting we can leave he says he constantly makes mistakes like this sometimes i just ignore him but this time i try to explain i just realized how lucky i am i cant think of what else to say how to make him understand so i simply smile right then the stoic woman is shot when i look i see the gaping maul that was her head right where that evil thought was first conceived to destroy the innocent life that grew inside her now she is neither stoic nor alive she lies in a heap twitching for a while but those are just nerves its getting late some people use this time to usher their young children home when we came all those years ago my mom letting me play with her gold chain while i sat in her lap we were one of the first to leave though i was not the youngest child in attendance my mother was always strict that way time for bed she said cheerfully first to me and then by way of explanation pressing my head tight against her shoulder trying to make me look tired pressing so hard that i started crying which i now realize served her purpose my father says he has to use the bathroom there is a pocket of space around me when he leaves my father is gone a long time this is unusual for the mens bathroom and i must admit i get a little worried about him especially as the woman approaches the target circle but right when i am starting to think hes going to be too late he comes his head bent low so as not to obstruct the view he sits beside me at what is the last possible second he shrugs and looks like hes about to say something horrified i turn away it would be just like him to talk at a time like this the girl from the young and beautiful club dressed all in white with a flower wreathe on her head and a locks of hair locket glimmering on her chest walks away from the woman the tenor of applause grows louder as the executioner approaches we are trying to show how much weve appreciated his work tonight the executioners are never named they travel in some kind of secret rotation so no one can ever figure it out but over time they get reputations they wear masks of course or they would always be hounded for autographs but are recognized when they are working by the insignia on their uniforms this one is known as red dragon for the elaborate dragon on his chest the applause can be registered on the criminal who shakes like jello she shakes so much that it is not unreasonable to wonder if she will be one of the fainters i hate the fainters they mess with the dramatic arc all that build up of the long walk the rattling chains the executioners arrival only to have the woman fall in a large heap on the ground sometimes it takes forever to revive her and some effort to get her to stand at which point the execution is anticlimatic the executioner perhaps sensing this very scenario says something to jello woman that none of us can hear but she suddenly goes still there is scattered applause for red dragons skill he turns towards the audience and though he wears his mask there is something in his demeanor which hushes the crowd we are watching a master at work next he steps in front of the woman reaches with both hands around her neck creating the effect of a man about to give a kiss we are all as still as if we are waiting for that kiss with one gesture he unties the string and in the same breath reaches up and pulls off the hood we gasp mrs offerens face fills the screen someone screams i think it is jenna i am torn between looking for her in the crowd and keeping my attention on her mother whose head turns at the sound so there is only a view of her giant ear but the executioner says something sharp and she snaps her head back to attention the screen betrays that her eyes peer past the executioner first narrow than wide and her lips part at the moment she realizes she is home her eyes just keep moving after that searching the crowd looking for jenna i figure until suddenly how can it be suddenly when it happens like this every time but it is suddenly her head jerks back with the firecracker sound of the shot she falls from the screen she lies on the ground twitching the red puddle blossoming around her head jenna screams and screams it is my impression that no one does anything to stop her nor does anyone use this break to go to the snack shop or the bathroom or home i dont know when my fathers hand has reached across the space between us but at some point i realize it rests gently on my thigh when i look at him he squeezes lightly almost like a woman would as though there is no strength left inside him they quickly cut some of mrs offerens hair before it gets too bloody and bag it lift her up clumsily so that at first her arm and then her head falls towards the ground the assistants are tired by this time of night load her into the cart we listen to the sound of the wheels that need to be oiled and the faint rattle of chains as the cart lumbers across the field jenna weeps audibly the center of the red circle is coated in blood i pretend it is a rorschach and decide it looks exactly like a pterodactyl the cleaning crew comes and hoses it down thats when people start moving about talk rush to the bathroom take sleeping children home but it goes mostly silent again when the offeren family stands up the seven of them sidle down the bleacher and walk along the side of the field i watch the back of jennas head her blonde curls under the lights almost golden like a halo though no one not even the most forgiving person is ever going to mistake jenna for someone holy her mother was a murderer after all yet i realize shell soon replace that stupid fake locket with a real one while i have nothing she might even get to marry a police or a trash collector even a teacher while the best i can hope for is a position at one of the orphanages my dads idea that i might be a breeder someday seems highly optimistic lets go i say are you sure maybe the next one but he doesnt even finish the thought he must see something in my face that tells him i am done with childish fantasies shes never coming back whatever selfish streak caused her all those years ago to kill one child is the same selfish streak that allows her to abandon me now we walk down the bleachers everyone turns away from us holding their little kids close my father walks in front of me with his head down his hands in his pockets by the time we get to the car in the parking lot we can hear the polite applause from the football field as another woman enters the circle he opens his door i open mine we drive home in silence i crane my neck to try to look up at the sky as if i expect to find something there god maybe or the living incarnation of the blood pterodactyl but of course i see neither there is nothing i close my eyes and think of my mother oh how i miss her the funeral by kate wilhelm kate wilhelm is the winner of three nebulas two hugos and

westfall was when she finally died at least one hundred twenty it was estimated at the very least for twenty years madam westfall had been a shell containing the very latest products of advances made in gerontology and now she was dead what lay on the viewing dais was merely a painted funereally garbed husk she isnt real carla said to herself its a doll or something it isnt really madam westfall she kept her head bowed and didnt move her lips but she said the words over and over she was afraid to look at a dead person the second time they slaughtered all those who bore arms unguided mindless now but lethal with the arms caches that they used indiscriminately carla felt goose bumps along her arms and legs she wondered if anyone else had been hearing the old teachers words the line moved slowly all the girls in their long grey skirts had their heads bowed their hands clasped the only sound down the corridor was the sushsush of slippers on plastic flooring the occasional rustle of a skirt the viewing room had a pale green plastic floor frostedgreen plastic walls and floortoceiling windows that were now slits of brilliant light from a westering sun all the furniture had been taken from the room all the ornamentation there were no flowers nothing but the dais and the bedlike box covered by a transparent shield and the teachers two at the dais others between the light strips at the doors their white hands clasped against black garb heads bowed hair slicked against each head straight parts emphasizing bilateral symmetry the teachers didnt move didnt look at the dais at the girls parading past it carla kept her head bowed her chin tucked almost inside the v of her collarbone the serpentine line moved steadily very slowly she isnt real carla said to herself desperately now she crossed the line that was the cue to raise her head it felt too heavy to lift her neck seemed paralyzed when she did move she heard a joint crack and although her jaws suddenly ached she couldnt relax the second green line she turned her eyes to the right and looked at the incredibly shrunken hardly human mummy she felt her stomach lurch and for a moment she thought she was going to vomit she isnt real its a doll she isnt real the third line she bowed her head pressed her chin hard against her collarbone making it hurt she couldnt swallow now could hardly breathe the line proceeded to the south door and through it into the corridor she turned left at the south door and with her eyes downcast started the walk back to her genetics class she looked neither right nor left but she could hear others moving in the same direction slippers on plastic the swish of a skirt and when she passed by the door to the garden she heard laughter of some ladies who had come to observe the viewing she slowed down she felt the late sun hot on her skin at the open door and with a sideways glance not moving her head she looked quickly into the glaring greenery but could not see them their laughter sounded like music as she went past the opening that one the one with the blue eyes and strawcolored hair stand up girl carla didnt move didnt realize she was being addressed until a teacher pulled her from her seat dont hurt her turn around girl raise your skirts higher look at me child look up let me see your face shes too young for choosing said the teacher examining carlas bracelet another year lady a pity shell coarsen in a years time the fuzz is so soft right now the flesh so tender oh well she moved away flicking a red skirt about her thighs her redclad legs narrowing to tiny ankles flashing silver slippers with heels that were like icicles she smelled carla didnt know any words to describe how she smelled she drank in the fragrance hungrily look at me child look up let me see your face the words sang through her mind over and over at night falling asleep she thought of the face drawing it up from the deep black trying to hold it in focus white skin pink cheek ridges silver eyelids black lashes longer than she had known lashes could be silverpink lips three silver spots one at the corner of her left eye another at the corner of her mouth the third like a dimple in the satiny cheek silver hair that was loose in waves about her face that rippled with life of its own when she moved if only she had been allowed to touch the hair to run her finger over that cheek the dream that began with the music of the ladys laughter ended with the nightmare of her other words shell coarsen in a years time after that carla had watched the changes take place on and within her body and she understood what the lady had meant her once smooth legs began to develop hair it grew under her arms and most shameful it sprouted as a dark coarse bush under her belly she wept she tried to pull the hairs out but it hurt too much and made her skin sore and raw then she started to bleed and she lay down and waited to die and was happy that she would die instead she was ordered to the infirmary and was forced to attend a lecture on feminine hygiene she watched in stonyfaced silence while the doctor added the new information to her bracelet the doctors face was smooth and pink her eyebrows pale her lashes so colorless and stubby that they were almost invisible on her chin was a brown mole with two long hairs she wore a straight bluegrey gown that hung from her shoulders to the floor her drab hair was pulled back tightly from her face fastened in a hard bun at the back of her neck carla hated her she hated the teachers most of all she hated herself she yearned for maturity madam westfall had written maturity brings grace beauty wisdom happiness immaturity means ugliness unfinished beings with potential only wholly dependent upon and subservient to the mature citizens there was a truefalse quiz on the master screen in front of the classroom carla took her place quickly and touchtyped her id number on the small screen of her machine she scanned the questions and saw that they were all simple declarative statements of truth her stylus ran down the true column of her answer screen and it was done she wondered why they were killing time like this what they were waiting for madam westfalls death had thrown everything off schedule paperlike brown skin wrinkled and hard with lines crossing lines vertical horizontal diagonal leaving little islands of flesh hardly enough to coat the bones cracked voice incomprehensible they took away the music from the air voices from the skies erased pictures that move boxes that sing and sob crazy talk and only one left that knows only one madam trudeau entered the classroom and carla understood why the class had been personalized that period the teacher had been waiting for madam trudeaus appearance the girls rose hurriedly madam trudeau motioned for them to be seated once more the following girls attended madam westfall during the past five years she read a list carlas name was included on her list on finishing it she asked is there anyone who attended madam westfall whose name i did not read there was a rustle from behind carla she kept her gaze fastened on madam trudeau name the teacher asked luella madam you attended madam westfall when two years ago madam i was a relief for sonya who became ill suddenly very well madam trudeau added luellas name to her list you will all report to my office at eight a m tomorrow morning you will be excused from classes and duties at that time dismissed with a bow she excused herself to the class teacher and left the room carlas legs twitched and ached her swim class was at eight each morning and she had missed it had been sitting on the straight chair for almost two hours when finally she was told to go into madam trudeaus office none of the other waiting girls looked up when she rose and followed the attendant from the anteroom madam trudeau was seated at an oversized desk that was completely bare with a mirrorlike finish carla stood before it with her eyes downcast and she could see madam trudeaus face reflected from the surface of the desk madam trudeau was looking at a point over carlas head unaware that the girl was examining her features you attended madam westfall altogether seven times during the past four years is that correct i think it is madam you arent certain i i dont remember madam i see do you recall if madam westfall spoke to you during any of those times yes madam carla you are shaking are you frightened no madam look at me carla carlas hands tightened and she could feel her fingernails cutting into her hands she thought of the pain and stopped shaking madam trudeau had pasty white skin with peaked black eyebrows sharp black eyes black hair her mouth was wide and full her nose long and narrow as she studied the girl before her it seemed to carla that something changed in her expression but she couldnt say what it was or how it now differed from what it had been a moment earlier a new intensity perhaps a new interest carla ive been looking over your records now that you are fourteen it is time to decide on your future i shall propose your name for the teachers academy on the completion of your current courses as my protégée you will quit the quarters you now occupy and attend me in my chambers she narrowed her eyes what is the matter with you girl are you ill no madam i i had hoped i mean i designated my choice last month i thought madam trudeau looked to the side of her desk where a records screen was lighted she scanned the report and her lips curled derisively a lady you would be a lady carla felt a blush fire her face and suddenly her palms were wet with sweat madam trudeau laughed a sharp barking sound she said the girls who attended madam westfall in life shall attend her in death you will be on duty in the viewing room for two hours each day and when the procession starts for the burial services in scranton you will be part of the entourage meanwhile each day for an additional two hours immediately following your attendance in the viewing room you will meditate on the words of wisdom you have heard from madam westfall and you will write down every word she ever spoke in your presence for this purpose there will be placed a notebook and a pen in your cubicle which you will use for no other reason you will discuss this with no one except me you carla will prepare to move to my quarters immediately where a learning cubicle will be awaiting you dismissed her voice became sharper as she spoke and when she finished the words were staccato carla bowed and turned to leave carla you will find that there are certain rewards in being chosen as a teacher carla didnt know if she should turn and bow again or stop where she was or continue when she hesitated the voice came again shorter raspish go return to your cubicle the first time they slaughtered only the leaders the rousers would be enough to defuse the bomb leave the rest silent and powerless and malleable carla looked at the floor before her trying to control the trembling in her legs madam westfall hadnt moved hadnt spoken she was dead gone the only sound was the sush sush of slippers the green plastic floor was a glare that hurt her eyes the air was heavy and smelled of death smelled the lady drank in the fragrance longed to touch her pale silverypink lips soft shiny with two high peaks on the upper lip the lady stroked her face with fingers that were soft and cool and gentle when their eyes become soft with unspeakable desires and their bodies show signs of womanhood then let them have their duties chosen for them some to bear the young for the society some to become teachers some nurses doctors some to be taken as lovers by the citizens some to be carla couldnt control the sudden start that turned her head to look at the mummy the room seemed to waver then steadied again the tremor in her legs became stronger harder to stop she pressed her knees together hard hurting them where bone dug into flesh and skin fingers plucking at the coverlet plucking bones brown bones with horny nails water girl give me water pretty pretty you would have been killed you would have pretty the last time they left no one over ten no one at all ten to twentyfive pretty carla said it to herself pretty she visualized it as prity pity with an r scanning the dictionary for prity nothing pretty afraid of shiny pretty faces young pretty faces the trembling was all through carla two hours eternity she had stood here forever would die here unmoving trembling aching a sigh and the sound of a body falling softly to the floor soft body crumbling so easily carla didnt turn her head it must be luella so frightened of the mummy shed had nightmares every night since madam westfalls death what made a body stay upright when it fell so easily take it out the thing that held it together and down down just to let go to know what to take out and allow the body to fall like that into sleep teachers moved across her field of vision two of them in their black gowns sushsush returned with luella or someone between them no sound sushsush the new learning cubicle was an exact duplicate of the old one cot learning machine chair partitionedoff commode and wash basin and new the notebook and pen carla never had had a notebook and pen before there was the stylus that was attached to the learning machine and the lighted square in which to write that then vanished into the machine she turned the blank pages of the notebook felt the paper between her fingers tore a tiny corner off one of the back pages examined it closely the jagged edge the texture of the fragment she tasted it she studied the pen just as minutely it had a pointed smooth end and it wrote black she made a line stopped to admire it and crossed it with another line she wrote very slowly carla started to put down her number the one on her bracelet then stopped in confusion she never had considered it before but she had no last name none that she knew she drew three heavy lines over the two digits she had put down at the end of the two hours of meditation she had written her name a number of times had filled three pages with it in fact and had written one of the things that she could remember hearing from the grey lips of madam westfall noncitizens are the property of the state the next day the citizens started to file past the dais carla breathed deeply trying to sniff the fragrance of the passing ladies but they were too distant she watched their feet clad in shoes of rainbow colors pointed toes stiletto heels rounded toes carved heels satin sequined slippers and just before her duty ended for the day the males started to enter the room she heard a gasp luella again she didnt faint this time merely gasped once carla saw the feet and legs at the same time and she looked up to see a male citizen he was very tall and thick and was dressed in the blueandwhite clothing of a doctor of law he moved into the sunlight and there was a glitter from gold at his wrists and his neck and the gleam of a smooth polished head he turned past the dais and his eyes met carlas she felt herself go lightheaded and hurriedly she ducked her head and clenched her hands she thought he was standing still looking at her and she could feel her heart thumping hard her relief arrived then and she crossed the room as fast as she could without appearing indecorous carla wrote why did he scare me so much why have i never seen a male before why does everyone else wear colors while the girls and the teachers wear black and grey she drew a wavering line figure of a man and stared at it and then xed it out then she looked at the sheet of paper with dismay now she had four ruined sheets of paper to dispose of had she angered him by staring nervously she tapped on the paper and tried to remember what his face had been like had he been frowning she couldnt remember why couldnt she think of anything to write for madam trudeau she bit the end of the pen and then wrote slowly very carefully society may dispose of its property as it chooses following discussion with at least three members and following permission which is not to be arbitrarily denied had madam westfall ever said that she didnt know but she had to write something and that was the sort of thing that madam westfall had quoted at great length she threw herself down on the cot and stared at the ceiling for three days she had kept hearing the madams dead voice but now when she needed to hear her again nothing sitting in the straight chair alert for any change in the position of the ancient one watchful afraid of the old teacher cramped tired and sleepy half listening to mutterings murmurings of exhaled and inhaled breaths that sounded like words that made no sense mama said hide child hide dont move and stevie wanted a razor for his birthday and mama said youre too young youre only nine and he said no mama im thirteen dont you remember and mama said hide child hide dont move at all and they came in hating pretty faces carla sat up and picked up the pen again then stopped when she heard the words they were so clear in her head but as soon as they ended they faded away she wrote hating pretty faces hide child only nine she stared at the words and drew a line through them pretty faces madam westfall had called her pretty pretty the chimes for social hour were repeated three times and finally carla opened the door of her cubicle and took a step into the anteroom where the other protégées already had gathered there were five carla didnt know any of them but she had seen all of them from time to time in and around the school grounds madam trudeau was sitting on a highbacked chair that was covered with black she blended into it so that only her hands and her face seemed apart from the chair deadwhite hands and face carla bowed to her and stood uncertainly at her own door come in carla it is social hour relax this is wanda louise stephanie mary dorothy each girl inclined her head slightly as her name was mentioned carla couldnt tell afterward which name went with which girl two of them wore the blackstriped overskirt that meant they were in the teachers academy the other three still wore the grey of the lower school as did carla with black bordering the hems carla doesnt want to be a teacher madam trudeau said dryly she prefers the paint box of a lady she smiled with her mouth only one of the academy girls laughed carla you are not the first to envy the paint box and the bright clothes of the ladies i have something to show you wanda the film the girl who had laughed touched a button on a small table and on one of the walls a picture was projected carla caught her breath it was a lady all gold and white gold hair gold eyelids filmy white gown that ended just above her knees she turned and smiled holding out both hands flashing jeweled fingers long gleaming nails that came to points then she reached up and took off her hair carla felt that she would faint when the golden hair came off in the ladys hand leaving short straight brown hair she placed the gold hair on a ball and then one by one stripped off the long gleaming nails leaving her hands just hands bony and ugly the lady peeled off her eyelashes and brows and then patted a brown thick coating of something on her face and with its removal revealed pale skin with wrinkles about her eyes with hard deep lines beside her nose down to her mouth that had also changed had become small and mean carla wanted to shut her eyes turn away and go back to her cubicle but she didnt dare move she could feel madam trudeaus stare and the gaze seemed to burn the lady took off the swirling gown and under it was a garment carla never had seen before that covered her from her breasts to her thighs the stubby fingers worked at fasteners and finally got the garment off and there was her stomach bigger bulging with cruel red lines where the garment had pinched and squeezed her her breasts drooped almost to her waist carla couldnt stop her eyes couldnt make them not see couldnt make herself not look at the rest of the repulsive body madam trudeau stood up and went to her door show carla the other two films she looked at carla then and said i order you to watch i shall quiz you on the contents she left the room the other two films showed the same lady at work first with a protégée then with a male citizen when they were over carla stumbled back to her cubicle and vomited repeatedly until she was exhausted she had nightmares that night how many days she wondered have i been here now she no longer trembled but became detached almost as soon as she took her place between two of the tall windows she didnt try to catch a whiff of the fragrance of the ladies or try to get a glimpse of the males she had chosen one particular spot in the floor on which to concentrate and she didnt shift her gaze from it they were old and full of hate and they said let us remake them in our image and they did madam trudeau hated her despised her old and full of hate why were you not chosen to become a woman to bear young i am not fit madam i am weak and timid looks at your hips thin like a males hips and your breasts small and hard madam trudeau turned away in disgust why were you not chosen to become a professional a doctor or a technician i am not intelligent enough madam i require many hours of study to grasp the mathematics so weak frail not too bright why do you weep i dont know madam i am sorry go to your cubicle you disgust me staring at a flaw in the floor a place where an indentation distorted the light creating one very small oval shadow wondering when the ordeal would end wondering why she couldnt fill the notebook with the many things that madam westfall had said things that she could remember here and could not remember when she was in her cubicle with pen poised over the notebook sometimes carla forgot where she was found herself in the chamber of madam westfall watching the ancient one struggle to stay alive forcing breaths in and out refusing to admit death watching the incomprehensible dials and tubes and bottles of fluids with lowering levels watching needles that vanished into flesh tubes that disappeared under the bedclothes that seemed to writhe now and again with a secret life listening to the mumbling voice the groans and sighs the meaningless words three times they rose against the children and three times slew them until there were none left none at all because the contagion had spread and all over ten were infected and carried radios radios a disease infected with radios spreading it among young people and mama said hide child hide and dont move and put this in the cave too and dont touch it carlas relief came and numbly she walked from the viewing room she watched the movement of the black border of her skirt as she walked and it seemed that the blackness crept up her legs enveloped her middle climbed her front until it reached her neck and then it strangled her she clamped her jaws hard and continued to walk her measured pace the girls who had attended madam westfall in life were on duty throughout the school ceremonies after the viewing they were required to stand in a line behind the dais there were eulogies to the patience and firmness of the first teacher eulogies to her wisdom in setting up the rules of the school carla tried to keep her attention on the speakers but she was so tired and drowsy that she heard only snatches then she was jolted into awareness madam trudeau was talking a book that will be the guide to all future teachers showing them the way through personal tribulations and trials to achieve the serenity that was madam westfalls i am honored by this privilege in choosing me and my apprentices to accomplish this end carla thought of the gibberish that she had been putting down in her notebook and she blinked back tears of shame madam trudeau should have told them why she wanted the information she would have to go back over it and destroy all the nonsense that she had written down late that afternoon the entourage formed that would accompany madam westfall to her final ceremony in scranton her native city where her burial would return her to her family madam trudeau had an interview with carla before departure you will be in charge of the other girls she said i expect you to maintain order you will report any disturbance or any infringement of rules immediately and if that is not possible if i am occupied you will personally impose order in my name yes madam very well during the journey the girls will travel together in a compartment of the tube talking will be permitted but no laughter no childish play when we arrive at the scranton home you will be given rooms with cots again you will all comport yourselves with the dignity of the office which you are ordered to fulfill at this time carla felt excitement mount within her as the girls lined up to take their places along the sides of the casket they went with it to a closed limousine where they sat knee to knee unspeaking hot to be taken over smooth highways for an hour to the tube madam westfall had refused to fly in life and was granted the same rights in death so her body was to be transported from wilmington to scranton by the rocket tube as soon as the girls had accompanied the casket to its car and were directed to their own compartment their voices raised in a babble it was the first time any of them had left the school grounds since entering them at the age of five ruthie was going to work in the infants wards and she turned faintly pink and softlooking when she talked about it luella was a music apprentice already having shown skill on the piano at an early age lorette preened herself slightly and announced that she had been chosen as a lover by a gentleman she would become a lady one day carla stared at her curiously wondering at her pleased look wondering if she had not been shown the films yet lorette was blueeyed with pale hair much the same build as carla looking at her carla could imagine her in soft dresses with her mouth painted her hair covered by the other hair that was cloudsoft and shiny she looked at the girls cheeks flushed with excitement at the thought of her future and she knew that with or without the paint box lorette would be a lady whose skin would be smooth whose mouth would be soft the fuzz is so soft now the flesh so tender she remembered the scent the softness of the ladys hands the way her skirt moved about her redclad thighs she bit her lip but she didnt want to be a lady she couldnt ever think of them again without loathing and disgust she was chosen to be a teacher they said it is the duty of society to prepare its noncitizens for citizenship but it is recognized that there are those who will not meet the requirements and society itself is not to be blamed for those occasional failures that must accrue she took out her notebook and wrote the words in it did you just remember something else she said lisa asked she was the youngest of the girls only ten and had attended madam westfall one time she seemed to be very tired carla looked over what she had written and then read it aloud its from the school rules book she said maybe changed a little but the same meaning youll study it in a year or two lisa nodded you know what she said to me she said i should go hide in the cave and never lose my birth certificate she said i should never tell anyone where the radio is she frowned do you know what a cave is and a radio you wrote it down didnt you in the notebook lisa ducked her head i forgot again i remembered it once and then forgot again until now she searched through her cloth travel bag for her notebook and when she didnt find it she dumped the contents on the floor to search more carefully the notebook was not there lisa when did you have it last i dont know a few days ago i dont remember when madam trudeau talked to you the last time did you have it then no i couldnt find it she said if i didnt have it the next time i was called for an interview shed whip me but i cant find it she broke into tears and threw herself down on her small heap of belongings she beat her fists on them and sobbed shes going to whip me and i cant find it i cant its gone carla stared at her she shook her head lisa stop that crying you couldnt have lost it where theres no place to lose it you didnt take it from your cubicle did you the girl sobbed louder no no no i dont know where it is carla knelt by her and pulled the child up from the floor to a squatting position lisa what did you put in the notebook did you play with it lisa turned chalky white and her eyes became very large then she closed them no longer weeping so you used it for other things is that it what sort of things lisa shook her head i dont know just things all of it the whole notebook i couldnt help it i didnt know what to write down madam westfall said too much i couldnt write it all she wanted to touch me and i was afraid of her and i hid under the chair and she kept calling me child come here dont hide im not one of them go to the cave and take it with you and she kept reaching for me with her hands i they were like chicken claws she would have ripped me apart with them she hated me she said she hated me she said i should have been killed with the others why wasnt i killed with the others carla her hands hard on the childs shoulders turned away from the fear and despair she saw on the girls face ruthie pushed past her and hugged the child hush hush lisa dont cry now hush there there carla stood up and backed away lisa what sort of things did you put in the notebook just things that i like snowflakes and flowers and designs all right pick up your belongings and sit down we must be nearly there it seems like the tube is stopping again they were shown from a closed compartment to a closed limousine and whisked over countryside that remained invisible to them there was a drizzly rain falling when they stopped and got out of the car the westfall house was a threestoried pseudovictorian wooden building with balconies and cupolas and many chimneys there was scaffolding about it and one of the three porches had been torn away and was being replaced as restoration of the house turning it into a national monument progressed the girls accompanied the casket to a gloomy large room where the air was chilly and damp and scant lighting cast deep shadows after the casket had been positioned on the dais which also had accompanied it the girls followed madam trudeau through narrow corridors up narrow steps to the third floor where two large rooms had been prepared for them each containing seven cots madam trudeau showed them the bathroom that would serve their needs told them goodnight and motioned carla to follow her they descended the stairs to a secondfloor room that had black massive furniture a desk two straight chairs a bureau with a wavery mirror over it and a large canopied bed madam trudeau paced the black floor silently for several minutes without speaking then she swung around and said carla i heard every word that silly little girl said this afternoon she drew pictures in her notebook this is the third time the word cave has come up in reports of madam westfalls mutterings did she speak to you of caves carlas mind was whirling how had she heard what they had said did maturity also bestow magical abilities she said yes madam she spoke of hiding in a cave where is the cave carla where is it i dont know madam she didnt say madam trudeau started to pace once more her pale face was drawn in lines of concentration that carved deeply into her flesh two furrows straight up from the inner brows other lines at the sides of her nose straight to her chin her mouth tight and hard suddenly she sat down and leaned back in the chair carla in the last four or five years madam westfall became childishly senile she was no longer living in the present most of the time but was reliving incidents in her past do you understand what i mean carla nodded then said hastily yes madam yes well it doesnt matter you know that i have been commissioned to write the biography of madam westfall to immortalize her writings and her utterances but there is a gap carla a large gap in our knowledge and until recently it seemed that the gap never would be filled in when madam westfall was found as a child wandering in a dazed condition undernourished almost dead from exposure she did not know who she was where she was from anything about her past at all someone had put an identification bracelet on her arm a steel bracelet that she could not remove and that was the only clue there was about her origins for ten years she received the best medical care and education available and her intellect sparkled brilliantly but she never regained her memory madam trudeau shifted to look at carla a trick of the lighting made her eyes glitter like jewels you have studied how she started her first school with eight students and over the next century developed her teaching methods to the point of perfection that we now employ throughout the nation in the males school as well as the females through her efforts teachers have become the most respected of all citizens and the schools the most powerful of all institutions a mirthless smile crossed her face gone almost as quickly as it formed leaving the deep shadows lines and the glittering eyes i honored you more than you yet realize when i chose you for my protégée the air in the room was too close and dank smelled of moldering wood and unopened places carla continued to watch madam trudeau but she was feeling lightheaded and exhausted and the words seemed interminable to her the glittering eyes held her gaze and she said nothing the thought occurred to her that madam trudeau would take madam westfalls place as head of the school now encourage the girls to talk carla let them go on as much as they want about what madam westfall said lead them into it if they stray from the point written reports have been sadly deficient she stopped and looked questioningly at the girl yes what is it then i mean after they talk are they to write or should i try to remember and write it all down there will be no need for that madam trudeau said simply let them talk as much as they want yes madam very well here is a schedule for the coming days two girls on duty in the viewing room at all times from dawn until dark yard exercise in the enclosed garden behind the building if the weather permits kitchen duty and so on study it and direct the girls to their duties on saturday afternoon everyone will attend the burial and on sunday we return to the school now go carla bowed and turned to leave madam trudeaus voice stopped her once more wait carla come here you may brush my hair before you leave carla took the brush in numb fingers and walked obediently behind madam trudeau who was loosening hair clasps that restrained her heavy black hair it fell down her back like a dead snake uncoiling slowly carla started to brush it harder girl are you so weak that you cant brush hair she plied the brush harder until her arm became heavy and then madam trudeau said enough you are a clumsy girl awkward and stupid must i teach you everything even how to brush ones hair properly she yanked the brush from carlas hand and now there were two spots of color on her cheeks and her eyes were flashing get out go leave me on saturday immediately following the funeral you will administer punishment to lisa for scribbling in her notebook afterward report to me and now get out of here carla snatched up the schedule and backed across the room terrified of the teacher who seemed demoniacal suddenly she bumped into the other chair and nearly fell down madam trudeau laughed shortly and cried clumsy awkward you would be a lady you carla groped behind her for the doorknob and finally escaped into the hallway where she leaned against the wall trembling too hard to move on something crashed into the door behind her and she stifled a scream and ran the brush madam had thrown the brush against the door madam westfalls ghost roamed all night chasing shadows in and out of rooms making the floors creak with her passage echoes of her voice drifting in and out of the dorm where carla tossed restlessly twice she sat upright in fear listening intently not knowing why once lisa cried out and she went to her and held her hand until the child quieted again when dawn lighted the room carla was awake and standing at the windows looking at the ring of mountains that encircled the city black shadows against the lesser black of the sky they darkened and suddenly caught fire from the sun striking their tips the fire spread downward went out and became merely light on the leaves that were turning red and gold carla turned from the view unable to explain the pain that filled her she awakened the first two girls who were to be on duty with madam westfall and after their quiet departure returned to the window the sun was all the way up now but its morning light was soft there were no hard outlines anywhere the trees were a blend of colors with no individual boundaries and rocks and earth melted together and were one birds were singing with the desperation of summers end and winters approach carla lisa touched her arm and looked up at her with wide fearful eyes is she going to whip me you will be punished after the funeral carla said stiffly and i should report you for touching me you know the child drew back looking down at the black border on carlas skirt i forgot she hung her head im im so scared its time for breakfast and after that well have a walk in the gardens youll feel better after you get out in the sunshine and fresh air chrysanthemums dahlias marigolds no the small ones there with the brown fringes luella pointed out the various flowers to the other girls carla walked in the rear hardly listening trying to keep her eye on lisa who also trailed behind she was worried about the child lisa had not slept well had eaten no breakfast and was so pale and wan that she didnt look strong enough to take the short garden walk with them eminent personages came and went in the gloomy old house and huddled together to speak in lowered voices carla paid little attention to them i can change it after i have some authority she said to a still inner self who listened and made no reply what can i do now im property i belong to the state to madam trudeau and the school what good if i disobey and am also whipped would that help any i wont hit her hard the inner self said nothing but she thought she could hear a mocking laugh come from the mummy that was being honored they had all those empty schools miles and miles of school halls where no feet walked desks where no students sat books that no students scribbled up and they put the children in them and they could see immediately who couldnt keep up couldnt learn the new ways and they got rid of them smart smart of them they were smart and had the goods and the money and the hatred my god they hated thats who wins who hates most and is more afraid every time carla forced her arms not to move her hands to remain locked before her forced her head to stay bowed the voice now went on and on and she couldnt get away from it rained every day cold freezing rain and daddy didnt come back and mama said hide child hide in the cave where its warm and dont move no matter what happens dont move let me put it on your arm dont take it off never take it off show it to them if they find you show them make them look her relief came and carla left in the wide hallway that led to the back steps she was stopped by a rough hand on her arm damme heres a likely one come here girl lets have a look at you she was spun around and the hand grasped her chin and lifted her head did i say it i could spot her all the way down the hall now couldnt i cant hide what shes got with long skirts and that skinny hairdo now can you didnt i spot her he laughed and turned carlas head to the side and looked at her in profile then laughed even louder she could see only that he was redfaced with bushy eyebrows and thick grey hair his hand holding her chin hurt digging into her jaws at each side of her neck victor turn her loose the cool voice of a female said then shes been chosen already an apprentice teacher he pushed carla from him still holding her chin and he looked down at the skirts with the broad black band at the bottom he gave her a shove that sent her into the opposite wall she clutched at it for support whose pet is she he said darkly trudeaus he turned and stamped away not looking at carla again he wore the blue and white of a doctor of law the female was a lady in pink and black carla go upstairs madam trudeau moved from an open doorway and stood before carla she looked up and down the shaking girl now you understand why i apprenticed you before this trip for your own protection they walked to the cemetery on saturday a bright warm day with golden light and the odor of burning leaves speeches were made madam westfalls favorite music was played and the services ended carla dreaded returning to the dormitory she kept a close watch on lisa who seemed but a shadow of herself three times during the night she had held the girl until her nightmares subsided and each time she had stroked her fine hair and soft cheeks and murmured to her quieting words and she knew it was only her own cowardice that prevented her saying that it was she who would administer the whipping the first shovelful of earth was thrown on top of the casket and everyone turned to leave the place when suddenly the air was filled with raucous laughter obscene chants and wild music it ended almost as quickly as it started but the group was frozen until the mountain air became unnaturally still not even the birds were making a sound following the maniacal outburst carla had been unable to stop the involuntary look that she cast about her at the woods that circled the cemetery who who would dare only a leaf or two stirred floating downward on the gentle air effortlessly far in the distance a bird began to sing again as if the evil spirits that had flown past were now gone madam trudeau sent this up for you luella said nervously handing carla the rod it was plastic three feet long thin flexible carla looked at it and turned slowly to lisa the girl seemed to be swaying back and forth i am to administer the whipping carla said you will undress now lisa stared at her in disbelief and then suddenly she ran across the room and threw herself on carla hugging her hard sobbing thank you carla thank you so much i was so afraid you dont know how afraid thank you how did you make her let you do it will you be punished too i love you so much carla she was incoherent in her relief and she flung off her gown and underwear and turned around her skin was pale and soft rounded buttocks dimpled just above the fullness she had no waist yet no breasts no hair on her baby body like a baby she had whimpered in the night clinging tightly to carla burying her head in the curve of carlas breasts carla raised the rod and brought it down as easily as she could anything was too hard there was a red welt the girl bowed her head lower but didnt whimper she was holding the back of a chair and it jerked when the rod struck it would be worse if madam trudeau was doing it carla thought she would try to hurt would draw blood why why the rod was hanging limply and she knew it would be harder on both of them if she didnt finish it quickly she raised it and again felt the rod bite into flesh sending the vibration into her arm through her body again the girl cried out and a spot of blood appeared on her back carla stared at it in fascination and despair she couldnt help it her arms wielded the rod too hard and she couldnt help it she closed her eyes a moment raised the rod and struck again better but the vibrations that had begun with the first blow increased and she felt dizzy and couldnt keep her eyes off the spot of blood that was trailing down the girls back lisa was weeping now her body was shaking carla felt a responsive tremor start within her eight nine the excitement that stirred her was unnameable unknowable never before felt like this suddenly she thought of the lady who had chosen her once and scenes of the film she had been forced to watch flashed through her mind remake them in our image she looked about in that moment frozen in time and she saw the excitement on some of the faces on others fear disgust and revulsion her gaze stopped on helga who had her eyes closed whose body was moving rhythmically she raised the rod and brought it down as hard as she could hitting the chair with a noise that brought everyone out of his own kind of trance a sharp cracking noise that was a finish ten she cried and threw the rod across the room lisa turned and through brimming eyes red swollen ugly with crying said thank you carla it wasnt so bad looking at her carla knew hatred it burned through her distorted the image of what she saw inside her body the excitement found no outlet and it flushed her face made her hands numb and filled her with hatred she turned and fled before madam trudeaus door she stopped a moment took a deep breath and knocked after several moments the door opened and madam trudeau came out her eyes were glittering more than ever and there were two spots of color on her pasty cheeks it is done let me look at you her fingers were cold and moist when she lifted carlas chin yes i see i see i am busy now come back in half an hour you will tell me all about it half an hour carla never had seen a genuine smile on the teachers face before and now when it came it was more frightening than her frown was carla didnt move but she felt as if every cell in her body had tried to pull back she bowed and turned to leave madam trudeau followed her a step and said in a low vibrant voice you felt it didnt you you know now dont you madam trudeau are you coming back the door behind her opened and one of the doctors of law appeared there yes of course she turned and went back to the room carla let herself into the small enclosed area between the second and third floors then stopped she could hear the voices of girls coming down the stairs going on duty in the kitchen or outside for evening exercises she stopped to wait for them to pass and she leaned against the wall tiredly this space was two and a half feet square perhaps it was very dank and hot from here she could hear every sound made by the girls on the stairs probably that was why the second door had been added to muffle the noise of those going up and down the girls had stopped on the steps and were discussing the laughter and obscenities they had heard in the cemetery carla knew that it was her duty to confront them to order them to their duties to impose proper silence on them in public places but she closed her eyes and pressed her hand hard on the wood behind her for support and wished they would finish their childish prattle and go on the wood behind her started to slide she jerked away a sliding door she felt it and ran her finger along the smooth paneling to the edge where there was now a sixinch opening as high as she could reach and down to the floor she pushed the door again and it slid easily going between the two walls when the opening was wide enough she stepped through it the cave she knew it was the cave that madam westfall had talked about incessantly the space was no more than two feet wide and very dark she felt the inside door and there was a knob on it low enough for children to reach the door slid as smoothly from the inside as it had from the outside she slid it almost closed and the voices were cut off but she could hear other voices from the room on the other side of the passage they were not clear she felt her way farther and almost fell over a box she held her breath as she realized that she was hearing madam trudeaus voice be there too many independent reports of the old fools babbling about it for there not to be something to it your men are incompetent trudeau shut up you scare the living hell out of the kids but you dont scare me just shut up and accept the report weve been over every inch of the hills for miles and theres no cave it was over a hundred years ago maybe there was one that the kids played in but its gone now probably collapsed we have to be certain absolutely certain whats so important about it anyway maybe if you would give us more to go on we could make more progress the reports state that when the militia came here they found only martha westfall they executed her on the spot without questioning her first fools when they searched the house they discovered that it was stripped no jewels no silver diaries papers nothing steve westfall was dead dr westfall dead martha no one has ever found the articles that were hidden and when the child again appeared she had true amnesia that never yielded to attempts to penetrate it so a few records diaries what are they to you there was silence then he laughed the money he took all his money out of the bank didnt he dont be ridiculous i want records thats all theres a complete ham radio complete dr westfall was an electronics engineer as well as a teacher no one could begin to guess how much equipment he hid before he was killed carla ran her hand over the box felt behind it more boxes yeah yeah i read the reports too all the more reason to keep the search nearby for a year before the end a close watch was kept on the house they had to walk to wherever they hid the stuff and i can just say again that theres no cave around here it fell in i hope so madam trudeau said someone knocked on the door and madam trudeau called come in yes what is it speak up girl it is my duty to report madam that carla did not administer the full punishment ordered by you carlas fists clenched hard helga explain madam trudeau said sharply she only struck lisa nine times madam the last time she hit the chair i see return to your room the man laughed when the girl closed the door once more carla is the golden one trudeau the one who wears a single black band the one you manhandled earlier yes insubordination in the ranks trudeau tut tut and your reports all state that you never have any rebellion never very slowly madam trudeau said i have never had a student who didnt abandon any thoughts of rebellion under my guidance carla will be obedient and one day she will be an excellent teacher i know the signs carla stood before the teacher with her head bowed and her hands clasped together madam trudeau walked around her without touching her then sat down and said you will whip lisa every day for a week beginning tomorrow carla didnt reply dont stand mute before me carla signify your obedience immediately i i cant madam carla any day that you do not whip lisa i will and i will also whip you double her allotment do you understand yes madam you will inform lisa that she is to be whipped every day by one or the other of us immediately madam please you speak out of turn carla i madam please dont do this dont make me do this she is too weak she will beg you to do it wont she carla beg you with tears flowing to be the one not me and you will feel the excitement and the hate and every day you will feel it grow strong you will want to hurt her want to see blood spot her bare back and your hate will grow until you wont be able to look at her without being blinded by your own hatred you see i know carla i know all of it carla stared at her in horror i wont do it i wont i will they were old and full of hatred for the shiny young faces the bright hair the straight backs and strong legs and arms they said let us remake them in our image and they did carla repeated madam trudeaus words to the girls gathered in the two sleeping rooms on the third floor lisa swayed and was supported by ruthie helga smiled that evening ruthie tried to run away and was caught by two of the blueclad males the girls were lined up and watched as ruthie was stoned they buried her without a service on the hill where she had been caught after dark lying on the cot openeyed tense carla heard lisas whisper close to her ear i dont care if you hit me carla it wont hurt like it does when she hits me go to bed lisa go to sleep i cant sleep i keep seeing ruthie i should have gone with her i wanted to but she wouldnt let me she was afraid there would be males on the hill watching she said if she didnt get caught then i should try to follow her at night the childs voice was flat as if shock had dulled her sensibilities carla kept seeing ruthie too over and over she repeated to herself i should have tried it im cleverer than she was i might have escaped i should have been the one she knew it was too late now they would be watching too closely an eternity later she crept from her bed and dressed quietly soundlessly she gathered her own belongings and then collected the notebooks of the other girls and the pens and she left the room there were dim lights on throughout the house as she made her way silently down stairs and through corridors she left a pen by one of the outside doors and very cautiously made her way back to the tiny space between the floors she slid the door open and deposited everything else she carried inside the cave she tried to get to the kitchen for food but stopped when she saw one of the officers of law she returned soundlessly to the attic rooms and tiptoed among the beds to lisas cot she placed one hand over the girls mouth and shook her awake with the other lisa bolted upright terrified her body stiffened convulsively with her mouth against the girls ear carla whispered dont make a sound come on she half led half carried the girl to the doorway down the stairs and into the cave and closed the door you cant talk here either she whispered they can hear she spread out the extra garments she had collected and they lay down together her arms tight about the girls shoulders try to sleep she whispered i dont think theyll find us here and after they leave well creep out and live in the woods well eat nuts and berries the first day they were jubilant at their success and they giggled and muffled the noise with their skirts they could hear all the orders being issued by madam trudeau guards in all the halls on the stairs at the door to the dorm to keep other girls from trying to escape also they could hear all the interrogations of the girls the guards who had not seen the escapees they heard the mocking voice of the doctor of law deriding madam trudeaus boasts of absolute control the second day carla tried to steal food for them and more important water there were blueclad males everywhere she returned empty handed during the night lisa whimpered in her sleep and carla had to stay awake to quiet the child who was slightly feverish you wont let her get me will you she begged over and over the third day lisa became too quiet she didnt want carla to move from her side at all she held carlas hand in her hot dry hand and now and then tried to raise it to her face but she was too weak now carla stroked her forehead when the child slept carla wrote in the notebooks in the dark not knowing if she wrote over other words or on blank pages she wrote her life story and then made up other things to say she wrote her name over and over and wept because she had no last name she wrote nonsense words and rhymed them with other nonsense words she wrote of the savages who had laughed at the funeral and she hoped they wouldnt all die over the winter months she thought that probably they would she wrote of the golden light through greenblack pine trees and of birds songs and moss underfoot she wrote of lisa lying peacefully now at the far end of the cave amidst riches that neither of them could ever have comprehended when she could no longer write she drifted in and out of the golden light in the forest listening to the birds songs hearing the raucous laughter that now

this volume what is the role of violence in society is there a place for it is there a way to make violence socially acceptable or should it be eliminated at any price our next dystopia gives violence a cold lookingover and after the examination is complete no one is left innocent like goldings lord of the flies where the wrong conditions turn harmless school boys into malevolent brutes o happy day watches people we often stereotype as gentle innocents turn beastly women prove themselves as capable of mindless cruelty as men homosexual men succumb to fisticuffs and infighting just as nastily as any straight men no one is immune to the temptation of violence what this story really probes is the borderline that divides violence from evil the line where aggression becomes a true stain of wickedness and it asks is there anything we can do to wash away the stain theyre fooled by history they think they wont be killed until they get into camps so when we load them onto a different train they go willingly they see an old country railroad station with a big red hill behind it and they think its just a stop along the way they slip down from the cars and cant keep their feet on the sharpedged rubble of the track theyre all on testosterone specifics a really massive dose theyre passive and confused and their skin has a yellow taint to it and their eyes stare out of patches of darkness and they need a shave they smell they look like a trainload of derelicts it must be easier to kill people who look like that easier to call them stiffs as if they were already dead were probably on specifics too but a very mild dose we have to work after all we load the stiffs into cars the cars with the special features and the second train goes off and ten minutes later it comes back and we unload them dead and that is life under what we call the grils we are the boys we get up each morning and we shave were male so we shave some of us do our makeup then a bit of lipstick and slap and an earring maybe big lou always wore an earring and a tight shortsleeved tshirt that showed off his arms it was very strange all those muscles with his pudding basin haircut and hatchet face all pressed and prim around the lips big lou thought what was happening was good i remember him explaining it to me my first day the day he recruited me men are violent he said all through history you look at violence and its male that was ok in the jungle but not now with the gangs and the bombs and everything else what is happening here is simple evolutionary necessity its the most liberating event in human history and were part of it then he kissed me it was a political kiss wet and cold then he introduced me to the work after we unload the trains we strip the corpses there are still shortages so we tie up the clothes in bundles and save everything else of value money watches cigarette lighters and send them back on the train it would be a terrible job for anyone but its worse for a faggot most of the bodies are young you feel tender toward them you want them to wake up again and move and you think surely there must be something better to do with this young brown body than kill it we work very quickly like ants on a hill i dont think were mad i think the work has become normal for us and so were normal within it we have overwhelming reasons for doing it as long as we do this work as long as there is this work to do we stay alive most of the boys volunteered but not for this at first it was just going to be internal deportation work camps for the revolution they were just going to be guards me i was put on that train to die and i dont know why they dope whole areas and collect the people they want lou saw me on the platform and pulled me in recruited me he called it i slept with him out of gratitude and fear i still remember sleeping with him i was the one who recruited royce he saw me first he walked up to me on the gravel between the trains nothing out of the ordinary just a tall black man in rumpled khaki he was jingling the keys in his pockets housekeys as if he was going to need them again he was shaking and he kept blinking and swaying where he stood and he asked in a sick and panicky voice its cold its cold isnt there any food the information that he was goodlooking got through slowly the reaction was neutral like youd get from looking at a model on a billboard then i thought in ten minutes time hes going to be dead you always promise yourself just once just once youll tell the boss off just once youll phone in sick and go out to the lakes just once so here i thought is my just once im going to save one of them are you gay i asked him i did it without moving my lips the cameras were always on us what incomprehension oh god i thought hes going to be difficult this is dumb i got scared what did you ask me nothing go on i nodded toward the second train am i gay he said it quickly glancing around him i just nodded the last of the other stiffs were being loaded on the old ones who had to be lifted up i saw big lou look at us and start walking toward us sauntering amiable with a diamanté earring yes said royce why make like you know me my names richard royce he said but i couldnt catch it then lou was standing next to us a little têteàtête he asked hi lou i said i leaned back on my heels away from him we got ourselves a new recruit dont need one rich he said still smiling lou look we were lovers we lived together for two years we did a lot of work for the movement together hes ok really lou was looking at royce at royces face being black was in royces favor ideologically all the other boys were white no one wanted the station to be accused of racism i dont believe a word of it said lou but ok lou walked toward one of the cameras hey he shouted up to it the camera was armed it turned toward him slowly weve got a new recruit what was that asked the camera or rather the voice of the gril behind it the sound was flat and mechanical the tone offhand and bored a new recruit a new boy hes with us so dont burn him ok ok ok said the camera lou turned back and patted royces bare goosepimpled arm royce lurched after him and i grabbed hold of his shirt to stop him i was frightened he was going to get back onto the train i waited until it was pulling out creaking and crashing so that the noise would cover what i said its terrible here i told royce but its better than dying watch what you say the cameras dont always hear but usually they can its all right to look disgusted they dont mind if you look a bit sick they like us to do the job with distaste just dont ever say you think its wrong whats wrong he asked and i thought oh god he doesnt know he doesnt know whats going on here and i thought now what do i do with him i showed him around the station its a small oldfashioned building made of yellow and black brick with no sign on it to tell us where we are one hundred years ago women in long dresses with children would have waited on its platform for the train to take them shopping in the city there would have been a ticketseller behind the counter who knew all the women by their last name and who kept a girlie calendar pinned on the wall his booth still has ornate iron bars across it the word tickets in art nouveau scrolling still slightly gilded the waiting room is full of temporary metal beds the walls are painted a musty pistachio and the varnish on the wooden floor has gone black there are games machines in the corner and behind the ticket counter is an electric cooker we eat sitting on our beds there are cold showers outside by the wall and there are flower boxes in the windows james the tape head hes one of the boys keeps them full of petunias and geraniums all around it and the hill behind are concentric rows of wire mesh thirty feet high and thirty feet deep to keep the stiffs controlled and us in it isnt a station its a mass graveyard for them and probably for us i tried to get royce to go to bed but he wouldnt he was frightened to be left alone he followed me out onto the platform where we were unloading the stiffs rolling them out sometimes the bodies sigh when they hit the concrete royces eyes went as wide as a rabbits thats been run over by a car what are you doing what are you doing he yelped over and over what the fuck does it look like i said we strip them on the platform and load them into trolleys we shake them out of their trousers and go through the pockets getting them out of their shirts is worse their arms flop and their heads loll were allowed to leave them in their underwear theyre doing it oh god oh jesus theyre killing them nobody knows that nobody believes that help me carry them i said i said it for his sake he shook his head and stepped back and stumbled over arms and legs and fell into a tangle of them only the worst were told only the most violent of men that means the poor bastards who had to pick up a gun or join a gang or sign up for the police or the army in other words most of the people we kill are either black or latino i tried to tell them i tried to tell the women that would happen royce was suddenly sick it was partly the drugs wearing off charlie and i hoisted him up and dragged him as limp as a stiff into the showers we got him cleaned up and into bed my bed there wasnt any other and after that he was very quiet everybody was interested in him new dog in the pound harry offered him one of his peppermints harry came up smiling but then harry is always smiling like the man who laughed yellow teeth in a red beard hed got the peppermints off a stiff royce didnt know how precious they were he just shook his head and lay there staring under the blanket as one by one we all came back from the platform lou was last thumping in and sighing like he was satisfied with something he slumped down on my bed next to royces knees and i thought uhoh lou likes him too bad day huh lou said listen i know the first day is poison but you got to ask yourself why its happening why is it asked royce his face and mouth muffled in the crook of his elbow he sounded like he was going to be sick again why lou sounded shocked royce you remember how bad things got the assassinations the military buildup the bombs only in america the gangs got hold of tactical nuclear weapons they punched out their rivals turf parts of detroit miami houston chicago and then the big dc i know said royce i used to live in los angeles los angeles came later i sometimes wonder now if los angeles wasnt a special case ever hear of the reichstag fire lou went respectful and silent and he sat back head bowed i am really sick at heart to hear that i am so sorry it must be like your whole past life has been blown away what can i say you probably know what im talking about better than anyone else here it just had to be stopped didnt it it did stop said royce yeah i know and that was because of the testosterone specifics the women gave us that do you remember how great that felt royce how calm you felt thats because youd been released from your masculinity the specifics set men free from themselves it was a beautiful thing to do lou rocked back on the bed and recited the old doggerel slogan tsi in the water supply a yearround high i remember the first day i could leave my gun at home man i got on the subway and there was this big kahuna all beads and tattoos and he just smiled at me and passed me a joint i really thought the specifics were the answer but they hurt women not many but thats enough so the specifics were withdrawn and look what happened six months later los angeles went up the violence had to stop and thats what were going for here royce not men per se but violence the military the police criminals gangsters pornographers once they go this whole thing here stops its like a surgical operation could you let me sleep royce asked yeah sure said lou gently and leaned forward and kissed him dont worry royce we take care of our own here these guys are a really great bunch of people welcome home the boys went back to playing computer games in the waiting room bleep bleep bleep one of the guys started yelling because a jack was missing from his deck of cards james the tape head sat on his bed mozart hissing at him through his headphones i looked at royce and i thought of him you are a good person thats when i began to have the fantasy we all have the fantasy of someone good and kind and strong who sees who we really are when were not messed up without knowing i was doing it i began to make royce my fantasy my beautiful kind good man the strange thing was that in a way the fantasy was true so was it a fantasy at all the next day it was the very next day royce began his campaign i volunteered us both to get the food the food comes down the tracks very early in a little automatic car someone has to unload it and take it into the kitchen i wanted to get royce and me away from the boys to talk he was unsure of me he pulled on his socks and looked at me solemnly in the eye fair enough i thought he doesnt know me lou loaned him a big duffle coat and royce led us both out through the turnstiles and onto the platform we didnt have our talk like he was stepping out onto a stage under the cameras royce started to play a part i dont like to say this but he started to play the part of a black man it was an act designed to disarm he grinned and did a joe cool kind of movement hey how are you he said to one particular camera the camera stayed still and silent you cant fool me i know theres someone there whats your name he asked it silence of course aw come on you can tell me that cant you listen i have got a terrible name its royce how would you like to be called after a car your name cant be as bad as that what is it grizelda hortensia my favorite aunts called hortensia how about gertrude ever read hamlet what about lurleen there was a hollow sound like in a transatlantic phone call when you talk over someone and it cuts out what theyre saying for a couple of seconds afterwards the camera did that it had turned off its voice and i thought i didnt know it could do that and i thought why did it do it look i have to call you something my sister is called alice you dont mind if i call you alice like in wonderland royce stepped forward the camera did not have to bristle its warmup light went on you see alice i uh have a personal question the camera spoke what is it the voice was sharp and wary i had the feeling that he had actually found her real name alice uh i dont want to embarrass anyone but um you see i got this little emergency and everywhere i look there are cameras so um where can i go a pause from the camera im sorry it said there are toilet facilities but im afraid we have to keep you under observation really i dont do anything that much different from anyone else im sure you dont i mean sometimes i try it standing on the seat or in a yoga position fine but im afraid youll still have to put up with the cameras well i hope youre recording it for posterity cause if you get rid of all the men itll have real historical interest there was a click from the camera again i stepped out of the line of fire royce presented himself at the turnstiles and they buzzed to let him through he made his way toward the john singing thats entertainment all the cameras turned to watch him just before he went into the shed he pulled out his pecker and waggled it at them wave byebye he said hell get us all killed i thought the john was a trench with a plywood shed around it open all along one side i went to the wire mesh behind it to listen alice i heard him ask through the plywood im not alice said another voice from another camera she meant in more ways than one she was not alice uh hortensia uh theres no toilet paper hortensia i know gee i wish youd told me first there are some old clothes on the floor use some of them and throw them over the side dead mens shirts i heard a kind of rustle and saw a line of shadow under the boards waddling forward crouched i must look like a duck huh a roast one in a minute royce was quiet for a while after that finally he said grumbling trust me to pick tweed he kept it up all morning long talking to the grils during breakfast he talked about home cooking and how to make tostadas and enchiladas he talked about a summer job hed had in los angeles working in a diner that specialized in kosher mexican food except for royce everyone who worked there including the owners was japanese that said royce shaking his head was la he and his mother had to move back east to get away from the gang wars as the bodies were being unloaded royce talked about his grandmother hed lived with her when he was a child and his father was dying his grandmother made ice cream in the bathtub she filled it full of ice and spun tubs of cream in it then she put one of the tubs in a basket with an umbrella over it on the front of her bicycle she cycled through the neighborhood selling ice cream and singing rock of ages she kept chickens which was against the zoning regulations and threw them at people who annoyed her especially policemen royce had a cat and it and a chicken fell in love they would mew and cluck for each other and sit for contented hours at a time the chickens neck snugly and safely inside the cats mouth it was embarrassing hearing someone talk usually we worked in silence and the talk was confusing we didnt think about things like summer jobs or household pets anymore as the bodies were dumped and stripped royces face was hard and shiny with sweat like polished wood that afternoon we had our talk since wed gotten the food it was our turn to cook lunch so i got him away from the boys we took our soup and crackers up to the top of the mound the mound is dug out of a small hill behind the station james makes it in his bulldozer listening to mozart he pulls the trolleys up a long dirt ramp and empties them and smooths the sandstone soil over each days addition of stiffs i get the feeling he thinks he works like mozart the mound rises up in terraces each terrace perfectly level its slope at the same angle as the one below it the dirt is brick red and there are seven levels it looks like babylon there are cameras on top but you can see over the fence you can see the new england forest it looks tired and small maybe even dusty as if it needed someone to clean the leaves theres another small hill you can hear birds royce and i climbed up to the top and i gathered up my nerve and said i really like you uhhuh he said balancing his soup and i knew it wasnt going to work leave it i thought dont push its hard for him he doesnt know you you come here a lot he said it was a statement i come here to get away royce blew out through his nostrils a kind of a laugh get away you know whats under your feet yes i said looking at the forest neither one of us wanted to sit on that red soil even to eat the soup i passed him his crackers from my coat pocket so why did you pick me out of all the other stiffs i guess i just liked what i saw why i smiled with embarrassment at being forced to say it it was as if there were no words for it that were not slightly wrong because i guess youre kind of goodlooking and i just thought i would like you a lot because im black you are black yes are most of your boyfriends black bullseye that was scary i uh did go through a phase where i guess i was kind of fixated on black people but i stopped that i mean i realized that what i was actually doing was depersonalizing the people i was with which wasnt very flattering to them but that is all over it really isnt important to me now so you went out and made yourself sleep with white people he does not i thought even remotely like me i found white people i liked it didnt take much you toe the line all the way down the line dont you he said i thought i didnt understand is that why youre here a blank from me you toe the line the right line so youre here yes i said in a way big lou saw me on the platform and knew me from politics i guess you dont take much interest in politics i was beginning to feel like hitting back depends on the politics he said briskly well youre ok i guess you made it out out of where i just looked back at him los angeles he gave a long and very bitter sigh mixed with a kind of chortle whenever i am in this situation there is the conversation i always end up having the same conversation i reckon youre going to tell me im not black enough you do kind of shriek i am middle class uhhuh you use that word class so that means its not racist right i mean youre being loyal to your class to which most black people do not belong hey bro you cant fool me were from the same neighborhood that sort of thing it was imitation ghetto you want somebody with beads in his hair and a beret and a semi who hates white people but likes you because youre so upfront movement is that your little dream a big bad black man i turned away from him completely he said in a very cold still voice do you get off on corpses too this was a mistake i said lets go back i thought you wanted to talk why are you doing this because he said you are someone who takes off dead mens watches and you look like you could have been a nice person i am i said and nearly wept a nice person thats what scares the shit out of me you think i want this you think i dont hate this i think thats when i threw down the soup i grabbed him by the shirt sleeves and held him i remember being worried about the cameras so i kept my voice low and rapid like it was scuttling look i was on the train i was going to die and lou said you can live you can help here and live so i did it and im here and so are you i know he said softly so ok you dont like me i can live with that fine no problem youre under no obligation so lets just go back you come up here because of the forest he said yes brilliant even mass murderers need love too right yes brilliant and you want me to love you when you bear the same relation to me as lou does to you i dont know i dont care i was sitting down now hugging myself the bowl of soup was on the ground by my foot tomato sludge creeping out of it i kicked it sorry i hassled you you didnt hassle me all i want is one little part of my life to have a tiny corner of goodness in it just one little place i probably wont but i feel like if i dont find it soon i will bust up into a million pieces not love not necessarily just someone nice to talk to who i really like otherwise i think one day i will climb back into one of those trains when i said it i realized it was true i hadnt known i was that far gone i thought i had been making a play for sympathy royce was leaning in front of me looking me in the face listen i love you bullshit what kind of mindfuck now he grabbed my chin and turned my head back round no true not maybe in the way you want but true you really do look right now like one of those people on the train like someone i just unloaded i didnt know quite what he was saying and i wasnt sure i trusted him but i did know one thing i dont want to go back to that bunkhouse not this afternoon ok well stay up here and talk i felt like i was stepping out onto ice but can we talk nicely a little bit less heavy duty nicely sounds sweet doesnt mean anything like the birds yes i said like the birds i reckon that altogether we had two weeks a lullaby in birdland hum along if you want to you dont need to know the words every afternoon after the work royce and i went up the mound and talked i think he liked talking to me ill go as far as that i remember one afternoon he showed me photographs from his wallet he still had a wallet full of people he showed me his mother she was extremely thin with dark limp flesh under her eyes she was trying to smile her arms were folded across her stomach she looked extremely kind but tired there was a photograph of a large red brick house it had white window sills and a huge white front door and it sagged in the way that only very old houses do whose is that i asked ours well my familys not my mothers my uncle lives there now its got a confederate flag over it royce grinned and folded up quietly his laughter was almost always silent well my greatgrandfather didnt want to lose all his slaves did he one half of royces family were black one half were white there were terrible wedding receptions divided in half where no one spoke the white people are all so embarrassed particularly the ones who want to be friendly theres only one way a black family gets a house like that grandfather messed around a whole bunch he hated his white family so he left the house to us my uncle and aunt want to open it up as a civil war museum and put their picture on the leaflet royce folded up again i mean this is in georgia can you imagine all those rednecks showing up and finding a nice black couple owning it and all this history about black regiments whos that my cousin she came to live with us for a while shes from the white half nope shes black royce was enjoying himself the photograph showed a rather plump very determined teenage girl with orange hair slightly wavy and freckles oh i was getting uncomfortable all this talk of black and white its really terrible everything cyndi likes i mean everything is black but her father married a white woman and she ended up like that she wanted to be black so bad every time she met anyone shed start explaining how she was black really shed go up to black kids and start explaining and you could see them thinking who is this white girl and is she out of her mind we were both on this program so we ended up in a white high school and that was worse because no one knew theyd been integrated when she was around the first day this white girl asked her if shed seen any of the new black kids then her sister went and became a top black fashion model you know features in ebony and that was it it got so bad that whenever cyndi meant white shed say the half of me i hate what happened to her i think she gave up and became white she wanted to be a lawyer i dont know what happened to her she got caught in la i flipped over the plastic there was a photograph of a mother and a small child whos that my son said royce thats his mother now she thinks shes a witch an ordinary looking girl stared sullenly out at the camera she had long frizzy hair and some sort of ethnic dress shell go up to waiters she doesnt like in restaurants and whisper spells at them in their ears how long ago was this i felt an ache as if id lost him as if i had ever had him oh ten years ago before i knew anything i mean i wouldnt do it now id like any kid of mine to have me around but his mother and i dont get on she told my aunt that shed turned me gay by magic to get revenge were they in la too royce went very still and nodded yes im sorry i said he passed me back the wallet here thats all of them last time we got together there was a tiny photograph full of people the black half on the far right was a very tall gangling fifteenyearold looking bristly and unformed shy and sweet three of the four people around him were looking at him bursting with suppressed smiles i wish id known him then as well i wanted to know him all his life i got a crazy crazy family he said shaking his head with affection i hope theyre all still ok it was best not to think about what was happening outside or inside here it was autumn and the sun would come slanting through the leaves of the woods it would make a kind of corona around them especially if the boys were burning garbage and there was smoke in the air the light would come in shafts like god was hiding behind the leaves the leaves were dropping one by one there was nothing in the station that was anything to do with royce everything that made him royce that made him interesting is separate it is the small real things that get obliterated in a holocaust forgotten the horrors are distinct and do not connect with the people but it is the horrors that get remembered in history when it got dark we would go back down and i hated it because each day it was getting dark earlier and earlier wed get back and find that there had been oh a macaroni fight over lunch great handprints of it over the windows and on the beds that had been left to dry once we got back to the waiting room and there had been a fight a real one lou had given one of the boys a bloody nose to stop it there was blood on the floor lou lectured us all about male violence saying anyone who used violence in the station would get violence back he took away all of toms clothes tom was beautiful and very quiet but sometimes he got mad lou kicked him out of the building in punishment it was going to be a cold night long after the grils had turned out the lights we could hear tom whimpering just outside the door please lou its cold lou im sorry lou i just got carried away please i felt royce jump up and throw the blanket aside oh god i thought dont get lou mad at us royce padded across the dark room and i heard the door open and i heard him say ok come in sorry lou royce said but we all need to get to sleep lou only grunted ok he said in a voice that was biding its time and royce came back to my bed i would hold him and he would hold me but only i think to stop falling out of the bed it was so narrow and cold royces body was always taut like each individual strand of muscle had been pulled back tightly from the shoulder it was as tense through the night as if it were carrying something and nothing i could do would soothe it what i am trying to say and i have to say it is that royce was impotent at least with me at least in the station as long as i cant do it he told me once on the mound i know i havent forgotten where i am maybe that was just an excuse the boys knew about it of course they listened in the dark and knew what was and was not happening and the day would begin at dawn the little automatic car the porridge and the bread the icy showers and the wait for the first train james the tape head harry with his constant grin gary who was tall and ropey and who kept tugging at his pigtail hed been a trader in books and he talked books and politics and thought he was lous lieutenant lou wasnt saying and bill the brylcreem and charlie with his still and tom the boys hating each other with no one else to talk to waiting for the day when the grils would burn us or the food in the cart would have an added secret ingredient when they were done with us royce talked learning who the cameras were there were only four grils dividing the day into two shifts royce gave them names there was alice and hortensia and miss scarlett who turned out to be from atlanta only one of the grils took a while to find a name and she got it the first day one of the cameras laughed shed been called greta i think because she had such a low deep voice sometimes royce called her sir then one morning lou was late and as he came royce said uhoh here comes the rear admiral lou was very sanctimonious about always taking what he assumed was the female role in sex the cameras knew that they watched all the time the camera laughed it was a terrible laugh a thin high wailing helpless shriek hey sir thats really butch said royce and the name butch stuck so did rear admiral god bless all who sail in him hiya admiral gasped the camera and even some of the boys laughed too lou looked confused a stiff and awkward smile on his face its better than being some macho prick he said that night he took me to one side by the showers look he said i think maybe you should get your friend to ease up a bit oh lou come on its just jokes you think all of this is a joke yelped lou no dont think i dont understand whats going on the light caught in his eyes pinprick bright what do you think is going on lou i saw him appraising me i saw him give me the benefit of the doubt what youve done rich and maybe it isnt your fault is to import an ideological wild card into this station oh lou i groaned i groaned for him for his mind hes not with us i dont know what these games are that hes playing with the women but hes putting us all in danger yeah sure theyre laughing now but sooner or later hell say the wrong thing and some of us will get burned cooked and another thing these little heart to heart talks you have with each other very nice but thats just the sort of thing the station cannot tolerate we are a team we are a family weve broken with all of that nuclear family shit and you guys have reimported it youre breaking us up into little compartments you royce james even harry youre all going off into little corners away from the rest of us we have got to work together now i want to see you guys with the rest of us no more withdrawing lou i said helpless to reply lou fuck off his eyes had the light again careful rich lou we are with you guys twentytwo hours a day can you really not do without us for the other two what is wrong with a little privacy lou there is no privacy here he said the cameras pick up just about every word now look i took on a responsibility i took on the responsibility of getting all of us through this together show that there is a place in the revolution for good gay men i have to know what is going on in the station i dont know what you guys are saying to each other up there i dont know what the cameras are hearing now you lied to me rich you didnt know royce before he came here did you we dont know who he is what he is rich is royce even gay yes of course then how does he fuck thats none of your business everything here is my business you dont fuck him he doesnt fuck you so what goes on i was too horrified to speak look said lou relenting i can understand it you love the guy you think i dont feel that pull too that pull to save them we wouldnt be gay if we didnt so you see him on the platform and he is very nice and you think dear god why does he have to die yes i feel it i feel it too lou made a good show of doing so its not the people themselves but what they are that we have to hold onto remember rich this is just a program of containment what we get here are the worst rich the very worst the sex criminals the transsexuals the media freaks so what you have to ask yourself rich is this what was royce doing on that train same thing i was he got pulled in by mistake lou looked at me with a kind of blank pity then he looked down at the ground there are no mistakes rich theyve got the police files then what was i doing on the train lou looked back up at me and sighed i think you probably got some of the women very angry with you theres a lot of infighting particularly where gay men fit in i dont like it its why i got you out it may be something similar with royce on the train because i disagreed with them everything felt weak my knees my stomach its possible only possible this is a revolution rich things are pretty fluid oh god lou whats happening you see why we have to be careful people have been burned in this station rich not lately because ive been in charge and i intend to stay in charge look lou took me in his arms this must be really terrible for you i know all of us were really happy for you when you and royce started but we have to protect ourselves now lets just go back in and ask royce who and what he is what do you mean just ask him in front of the others what he was and not take no for an answer he was stroking my hair hell hate me if i do that i tried to push him away he grabbed hold of my hair and pulled it smiling almost as if he were still being sexy and affectionate then hell just have to get over that kind of mentality what has he got to hide if he needs privacy come on rich lets just get it over with he pulled me back into the waiting room royce took one look at us together as we came in and his face went still as if to say uhhuh this is coming now is it his eyes looked hard into mine and said are you going to put up with it i was ashamed i was powerless rich has a confession to make said lou a friendly hand still on the back of my neck dont you rich they all seemed to sit up and close in an inquisition and i stood there thinking dear god what do i do what do i do rich lou reminded me we have to go through this we need to talk this through royce sat there on our bed reclining waiting well i had lied i dont really know who royce is we werent lovers before we are lovers now but you dont know what he was doing or who he was do you rich i just shook my head dont you want to know that rich dont you want to know who your lover was doesnt it seem strange to you that hes never told you no i replied we all did what we had to do before the revolution what we did back then is not who we are see i wanted to say to royce im fighting see im fighting but there are different ways of knuckling under arent there rich you taught history you showed people where the old system had gone wrong you were a good gay man royce stood up abruptly and said i was a prison guard the room went cold and lous eyes gleamed and there are different ways of being a prison guard it was a detention center for juveniles young guys who might have had a chance not surprisingly most of them were black i dont suppose you know what happens to black juvenile prisoners now do you id like to know their records are looked at said lou so you were a gay prison guard in charge of young men is that so impossible so you were a closet case for a start no i told my immediate superior immediate superior you went along with the hierarchy patriarchy i should say did you have a good time with the boys this camp is a hierarchy in case you hadnt noticed and no i kept my hands off the boys i was there to help them not make things worse helping them to be gay would be worse every word was a trap door that could fall open the latch was hatred did you ever beat one of the boys up did you deal dope on the side royce was still for a moment his eyes narrow then he spoke about four years ago me and the kids put on a show we put on a show for the girls center the girls came in a bus and theyd all put their hair in ringlets and they walked into the gym with too much makeup on holding each others hands clutching each others forearms like this because they were so nervous and the kids the boys theyd been rehearsing oh for weeks theyd built and painted a set it was a street with lights in the windows and a big yellow moon there was this one kid jonesy jonesy kept sticking his head through the curtain before we started hey everybody im a star royce said it again softly hey everybody im a star and i had to yell at him jonesy get your ass off that stage the girls sat on one side of the gym and the boys on the other and they smiled and waved and threw things at each other like gum wrappers it was all they had royce started to cry he glared at lou and let the tears slide down his face they didnt have anything else to give each other the show started and one of the kids did his announcing routine hed made a bow tie out of a white paper napkin and it looked so sharp and then the music came up and one of the girls just shouted oh theyre going to dance and those girls screamed they just screamed the boys did their dance on the stage no mistaking what those moves meant the record was its a shame his face contorted suddenly perhaps with anger and i had to keep this goddamned aisle between them the whole time so said lou unmoved so said royce and gathered himself in he wiped the moisture from his face so i know a lot about prisons so some of those kids are dead now the boys and the girls wanted each other that must be an ideological quandary for you lou heres a big bad guard stopping people doing what they want but what they want to do is heterosexuality he turned it into a mock dirty word his eyes round no problem said lou all women are really lesbians royce stared at him for a moment then he began to laugh i wouldnt expect you to understand but the first experience of physical tenderness that any woman has is with her mother gee im sure glad my old aunt hortensia didnt know that she would be surprised hey alice are you a dyke lou went pale and lines of shadow encircled his mouth yes said alice the camera well im a faggot but it doesnt mean everyone else is lou launched himself from the bed in a fury he was on his feet and shouting flecks of spit propelled from his mouth you do not use demeaning language here his voice cracked alice had been working nine hours and now she was alone on the night shift she had been watching silently for nine hours now she wanted to talk i had a girlfriend once who was straight she said no matter how hard she tried women just didnt bring her off mind you thats better than those lust lesbians they just want your body me im totally dedicated to women but its a political commitment its something i decided i dont let my body make my decisions for me yeah i know what you mean said royce its these lust faggots i cant stand he cast his eyes about him at the boys and they chuckled we do not use the word dyke in this station said lou royce looked rather sad and affectionate and shook his head lou you are such a prig not only are you a prig you are a dumb prig the floor seemed to open up under my feet with admiration only royce could have said that to lou i loved him even though i did not love myself the boys chuckled again because it was funny and because it was true and because it was a little bit of a shock alice said lou he has just insulted women funny said alice i thought hed just insulted you lou looked like he was in the middle of a nightmare you could see it in his face alice is being very tolerant royce but from now on you talk to and about the women with respect if you want to live here with us there are a few ground rules like what no more jokes royce was leaning against the bar at the foot of our bed and he was calm and his ankles were crossed he closed his eyes and smiled no more jokes he asked amused you mess around with the women you put us all in danger you keep putting us in danger you got to go lou said alice can i remind you of something you dont decide who goes on the trains we do i understand that alice he slumped from the shoulders and his breath seeped out of him he seemed to shrink lou said royce i think you and i are on the same side it was a question wed better be said lou then you do know why i talk to the women yeah said lou you want to show off you want to be the center of attention you dont want to take responsibility for anything he didnt understand lou was dangerous because he was stupid ive been a prison guard said royce carefully i know what its like youre trapped even worse than the prisoners so he was going to make royce say it in front of a camera he was going to make him say that he was talking to the grils so that they would find it hard to kill us when the time came im talking to the women so that theyll get to know us said royce and see that there is a place for gay men within the revolution they cant know that unless we talk to them can they bullseye again that was the only formulation lou was ever likely to accept i mean can they lou i think were working with the women on this thing together theres no need for silence between us not if were on the same side ok so maybe i do it wrong i dont want to be the only one who does all the talking we all should talk to them lou you me all of us and the women should feel that they can talk with us as well oh yeah i am so bored keeping schtum said alice lou went still and he drew in a deep breath ok he said we can proceed on that basis we all communicate with each other and with the cameras but royce that means no more withdrawing no more going off in a corner no more little heart to hearts on the mound i didnt know that was a problem lou there will be no more of those ok then said lou murmurous in defeat royce strode toward him both hands outstretched and took lous hand in both of his this is really good lou im really glad we talked lou looked back at him looking worn and heavy but he was touched big lou was moved as well and he gave a slightly forlorn flicker of a smile so royce became head of the station he gave me a friendly little nod and moved his things away from our bed he slept in toms tom never did it didnt matter because i still had my little corner of goodness even if we didnt talk royce was still there telling jokes i was happy with that because i knew that i had deserted him before he had deserted me and i understood that i was to be the visible victory he gave to lou none of that mattered royce had survived i didnt cry the first night alone i stopped myself i didnt want the boys to hear things started to change the cameras stopped looking at us on the john we could see them turn and look away then one morning they were just hanging dead hey rich harry called me it was me and harry unloading the food cart as winter finally came harry was hopping up and down in front of the camera he leapt up and tapped it and the warmup light did not even go on theyve turned it off rich the cameras off its dead he grabbed my arms and spun me around and started doing a little dance and i started to hoot with laughter along with him it was like someone had handed you back part of your pride it was like we were human enough to be accorded that again hey royce the camera in the johns off shouted harry as we burst through the canteen doors with the trolley maybe theyre just broken said gary who was still loyal to lou naw man theyd be telling us to fix it by now theyve turned it off that so alice royce asked the camera in the canteen oh yeah said alice odd how a mechanical voice could sound so much more personal than a real one closer somehow as if in the middle of your ear thanks alice s ok said alice embarrassed we explained it to the wigs we told them it was like pornography you know demeaning to us they bought it believe me you guys are not a lovely sight first thing in the morning i could see royce go all alert at that word wig like an animal raising its ears he didnt mention the wigs again until later that afternoon alice is our talking ever a problem for you how dyou mean well if one of the wigs walked in alice kind of laughed huh they dont get down this far what do you know about them anyhow nothing who are they mind your own business the people who run things well if someone does show up and you want us to shut up just sneeze and well stop talking sneeze well you could always come right out and say cool it guys theres someone here hey scarlett said alice can you sneeze achooo said miss scarlett delicately just testing guys said alice big lou hung around trying to smile trying to look like somehow all this was going on under his auspices nobody was paying attention the next day the train didnt show it was very cold and we stood on the platform thumping our feet as the day grew more sparkling and the shadows shorter hey butch whats up royce asked ill check ok said the camera there was a long silence the trains broken down its in a siding itll be a while yet you might as well go back in have the day off thats how it would begin of course no train today fellas sorry no need for you fellas not today not ever and with what you know can you blame us what are ten more bodies to us trains did break down of course it had happened before wed had a holiday then too and the long drunken afternoon became a long drunken day well lets have some fun for a change said lou charlie you got any stuff ready lets have a blowout man lou said royce i was kind of thinking we could get to work on the hot water tank hot water tank said lou are we going to need it royce there was a horrified silence so much for talking go on charlie get your booze then lou came for me how about a little sex and romance rich hand on neck again no thanks lou you wont get it from him you know thats my problem lou lay off at least i can do it grin surprise surprise i said his face and body were right up against mine and i turned away you cant get at him through me you know lou you just cant do it lou relented he pulled back but he was still smiling youre right he said for that hed have to like you sucker he flicked the tip of my nose with his fingers and walked away i went and sat down beside royce i needed him to make everything seem normal and ordinary he was leaning on his elbows plucking at the grass hi i said it was the first time wed spoken since the inquisition hi he said affectionate and distant royce what do you thinks going to happen the train will come in tomorrow he said i hate it when it comes in i said my breath rattling out of me in a kind of chuckle and i hate it when it doesnt i just hate it royce do you think we could go to work on the tank he considered the implications ok he said charlie want to come work with us on the tank charlie was plump with a gray beard and had a degree in engineering a coffee tin and a copper coil he was a sort of santa claus of the booze not today he said cheerily i made all of this i might as well get to drink some of it myself it was clear and greasylooking and came in white plastic screwtop bottles charlie had sacrificed one of the showers to plumb in a hot water tank wed hammered the tank together out of an old train door it was more like a basin really balanced in the loft of the station there were cameras there too royce sat looking helplessly at an electric hot plate purloined from the kitchen stove wed pushed wiring through from the floor below charlie should be here he said i really love you royce he went very still for a moment i know he said rich dont be scared youre afraid all the time i know i said and felt my hand tremble as i ran it across my forehead you gotta stop it one day youll die of fear its this place i said and broke down and sat in a heap i want to get out he held me gently someday well get out he said and the hopelessness of it made me worse someday itll be all right no it wont hi guys said alice theyre really acting like pigs down there theyre scared said royce were all scared alice is that train going to come in tomorrow yup she said brightly good you know anything about electricity plenty i used to work for bell telephone royce disengaged himself from me ok do i put the plate inside the tank or underneath it inside good lord no so royce went back to work again and said to meyou better go back down rich the agreement i asked and he nodded yes the agreement between him and lou when i got down the boys looked like discarded rags there was piss everywhere and blood on lous penis i went up to the top of the mound all the leaves were gone now for about the first time in my life i prayed dear god get me out of here dear god please please make it end but there wasnt any answer there never is there was just an avalanche inside my head i could shut it out for a while i could forget that every day i saw piles of corpses bulldozed and mangled and that i had to chase the birds away from them and that i peeled off their clothes and looked with inevitable curiosity at the little pouch of genitals in their brightly colored underwear and the leaking and the sudden hemorrhaging and the supple warmth of the dead with their marble eyes full of seeming questions how many had we killed was anybody keeping count did anyone know their names even their names had been taken from them along with their wallets and watches harry had found his policeman father among them and had never stopped smiling afterwards saying hi like a cartoon chipmunk without a tail i listened to the roaring in my head as long as i could and then i went back down to the boys is there any booze left charlie i asked and he passed me up a full plastic bottle and i drank myself into a stupor it got dark and cold and i woke up alone and i pulled myself up and walked back into the waiting room and it was poison inside it was as poison as the stuff going sour in our stomachs and brains and breath we sat in twitchy silence listening to the wind and our own farts nobody could be bothered to cook royce was not there and my stomach twisted around itself like a bag full of snakes where was he what would happen when he got back you look sick said lou in disgust go outside if you have to throw up im fine lou i said but i could feel a thin slime of sweat on my forehead you make me sick just looking at you he said funny i was just thinking the same about you our eyes locked and there was no disguising it we hated each other it was then that royce came back in rubbing his head with a towel well there are now hot showers he announced well tepid showers you guys can go clean up the boys looked up to him smiling the grins were bleary but they were glad to see him phewwee he said and waved his hand in front of his face thats some stuff you come up with charlie what do you make it out of burnt tires charlie beamed orange peel and grass he said proudly i thought it was going to be all right then lou stood up out of his bed and flopped naked toward royce you missed all the fun he said yeah i know i can smell it now whos being a prig said lou come on man i got something nice to show you he grabbed hold of royces forearm and pulled him toward his own bed tom was in it lying face down like a ruin and lou pulled back the blanket go on man tom was bleeding royces face and voice went very hard and he pulled the blanket back up hes got an anal fissure lou he needs to be left alone it could get badly infected lou barked like a dog a kind of laugh hes going to die anyway royce moved away from his bed with tom in it he had no place to sit down lou followed him come on royce come on no more pussy footing he tried to put his hand down the front of royces shirt royce shrugged it away with sudden annoyance not tonight not ever asked lou amused come on royce give it up man said harry he grabbed royce playfully about the waist you cant hold out on us forever he started fumbling with the belt buckle hell i havent eaten all day oh yes you have said lou and chuckled harry please let go said royce wearily the belt was undone and lou started pulling out his shirt let go warned royce i said let go and he moved very suddenly his elbow hit harry in the mouth and he yelped hey you fucker you turkey said lou and all the poison rose up like a wave oh this was going to be fun pulling off all of royces clothes gary and charlie they all came smiling there was a sound of cloth tearing and suddenly royce was fighting fighting very hard and suddenly the boys were fighting too grimly they pulled him down and he tried to hit them and they held his arms and they launched themselves on him like it was a game of tackle football i thought there is a word for this the word is rape alice i shouted up to the camera alice stop them alice burn one of them stop it then something slammed into the back of my head and i fell the floor scraping the skin of my wrists and slapping me across the cheeks then i was pulled over and lou was on top of me forearm across my throat booby booby booby booby he said all blubbery lips and then he kissed me well he bit my upper lip he bit it to hold me there he nearly bit through it with his canine teeth and my mouth was full of the taste of something metallic blood the sounds the boys made were conversational with the odd laugh royce squealed like a pig it always hurts beyond everything the first time it finally came to me that royce wasnt gay at least not in any sense that we would understand i looked up at the camera at its blank glossy eye and i could feel it thinking these are men this is what men do we are right we are right to do this to them for just that moment i almost agreed lou got up and charlie nestled in next to me fat and naked white hairs on his chest and ass and he was still beaming like a baby and i thought dont you know what youve done i tried to sit up and he went no no no and waggled a finger at me it was lous turn to go through him rear admiral am i asked lou when he was through charlie helped me to my feet you might as well have a piece he said with a friendly chuckle lou laughed very loudly pulling on his tshirt the others were shuffling back to their beds in a kind of embarrassment royce lay on the floor i knelt next to him my blood splashed onto the floor can you get up royce i asked him he didnt answer royce lets go outside get you cleaned up he didnt move royce are you hurt are you hurt badly then i called them all bastards it was just fun man said harry fun it started out that way he shouldnt have hit people he didnt want to do it royce please do you want anything is anything especially painful just his ass said lou and laughed hell be ok said charlie a shadow of confusion on his face like fuck he will that was some way to say thanks for all hes done well are any of you going to give me a hand harry did he helped me to get royce up royce hung between us like a sack its that fucking poison you make man said harry to charlie dont blame me you were the first remember i was just playing they began to realize what theyd done he was all angles like a doll that didnt work anymore what the fuck did you do i shouted at them he didnt seem to be bruised anywhere jesus christ i began to cry because i thought he was dead you fucking killed him uhuh no said gary we didnt pisshead charlie came to help too and we got him outside and into the showers and he slumped down in the dark i couldnt find a rag so we just let the lukewarm water trickle down over him all we did was get him wet on an evening in november its cold out here we got to get him back in said harry royce rolled himself up onto his knees and looked at me you were there i wasnt part of it i tried to stop it you were there you didnt help i couldnt he grunted and stood up we tried to help him but he knocked our hands away he sagged a bit at the knees but kept on walking unsteadily he walked back into the waiting room silently people were tidying up straightening beds royce scooped up his clothes with almost his usual deftness he went back to his bed and dropped down onto it next to tom and began to inspect his shirt and trousers for damage the least you could have done i said i dont know what i meant lou was leaning back on his bed he looked pleased elbows sticking out from the side of his head look at it this way he said it might do him some good he shouldnt be so worried about his little problem he just needs to relax a bit more try it on for size the worst thing you can do with a problem like that is hide from it if id had an axe i would have killed him he knew that he smiled then the lights went out without warning as always but two hours early there was snow on the ground in the morning a light dusting of it on the roof and on the ground there was no patter royce did not talk to the cameras he came out wearing his jacket there was a tear in his shirt under the armpit he ate his breakfast without looking at anyone his face closed and still hardly anyone spoke big lou walked around with a little halfgrin he was so pleased he was stretched tight with it hed won he was boss again no one used the showers then we went out and waited for the train we could see its brilliant headlight shining like a star on the track we could see the layers of wiremesh gates pulling back for it like curtains and close behind it we began to hear a noise coming from it it was a regular steady drumming against metal a bit like the sound of marching feet a sound in unison yup said charlie the drugs have worn off its going to be a bastard said gary lou walked calmly toward the cameras alice what do we do no answer we cant unload them alice do we just leave them on the train or what silence alice we need to know what you want done dont call me alice said the camera could you let us back in then asked lou no answer the train came grinding into the platform clattering and banging and smelling of piss we all stood back from it well back away from us at the far end of the platform james stood looking at the silver sky and the snow in the woods his back to us his headphones on we could hear the thin whisper of mozart from where we stood still looking at the woods james sauntered toward the nearest carriage james wailed charlie dont open the door jim jimmy stop james dont he waved all he heard was mozart and a banging from the train not much louder than usual with a practiced muscular motion he snapped up the bolt and pulled it back and began to swing open the door it burst free from his grasp and was slammed back and a torrent of people poured down out of the carriage onto him his headphones were only the first thing to be torn from him the stiffs were all green and mottled like leaves oh christ oh jesus uniforms army we turned and ran for the turnstile alice goddamn it let us in raged lou the turnstile buzzed angrily and we scrambled through it caught up in its turning arms crammed ourselves into its embrace four at a time and we could hear feet running behind us i squeezed through with gary and heard charlie behind us cry out hands held him clawed at his forehead gary and i pulled him out and lou leapt in after us and pulled the emergency gate shut they prowled just the other side of a wire mesh fence thick necked as mad as bulls with asses as broad as our shoulders well get you fuckers one of them promised me looking dead into my eyes they trotted from door to door of the train springing them they began to rock the turnstile back and forth not electric one of them called they began to pull at the wire mesh we had no weapons hey hey help we shouted alice scarlett help no answer as if in contempt the warmup lights went on were using gas said alice her voice hard get your masks the masks were in the waiting room we turned and ran but the cameras didnt give us time suddenly there was a gush of something like steam in the icy morning out from under the platform i must have caught a whiff of it it was like a blow on the head and my feet crossed in front of each other instead of running i managed to hold my breath and royces face was suddenly in front of me as still as a stone and he pushed a mask at me and pulled on his own walking toward the gate i fumbled with mine harry or someone all inhuman in green helped me i saw royce walking like an angel into white a blistering white that caught the winter sunlight in a blaze he walked right up to the fence and stood in the middle of the poison and watched the gas billowed and the people billowed too in waves they climbed up over each other in shifting pyramids to get away piling up against the fence those on top balanced waving their arms like surfers and there were sudden flashes of red light through the mist and bars of rumpled flesh appeared across their eyes one of them had fine light hair that burst into flame about his head he wore a crown of fire the faces of those on the bottom of the heap were pressed against the fence into diamond shapes and they twitched and jittered the whole wave began to twitch and jitter and shake against the fence it must have been the gas in my head i was suddenly convinced that it was nerve gas and that meant that the nerves of the dead people were still working even though they were dead even though they were dead they would shake and judder against the fence until it fell and then they would walk toward us and take us into their arms and talk to us in whispers and pull off the masks i spun around and looked at the mound because i thought the dead inside it would wake it did seem to swim and move and i thought that babylon would crack and what had been hidden would come marching out the dead were angry because they had been forgotten then the mist began to clear blown i thought of dandelion seeds that i had blown like magic across the fields when i was a child hockey games i said i thought there had been a game of hockey the bodies were piled up in uniforms they were still we waited harry practiced throwing stones what a mess said gary there were still wafts of gas around the bottom of the platform we didnt know how long we would have to wait before it was safe suddenly lou stepped forward come on lets start he said his voice muffled by the mask he pulled back the emergency gate weve got masks he said none of us moved we just didnt have the heart we cant leave them there lou shouted still none of us moved then royce sat down on the grass and pulled off his mask and took two deep breaths he looked at the faces in front of him a few feet away purple against the mesh alice he said why are we doing this no answer its horrible its the worst thing in the world horrible for us horrible for you thats why what happened last night happened alice because this is so terrible you cage people up you make them do things like this and something goes something inside something will give with you too alice you cant keep this up either do you have dreams alice do you have dreams at night about this while the wigs are at their parties making big decisions and debating ideology i dont believe anyone could look at this and not feel sick you need to hear any more lou asked the cameras with a swagger i mean how did it happen royce was crying how did we get so far apart there were problems sure but there was love too men and women loved each other people love each other so why do we end up doing things like this can you give me a reason alice you do realize what hes saying dont you asked lou he pulled off his mask and folded his arms just listen to what is coming out of his closet i am not going to move those bodies alice said royce i cant i literally cannot move another body i dont think any of us can you can kill us all if you want to but then youd have to come and do it yourselves wouldnt you lou waited we all waited nothing happened theyll uh start to stink if we dont move them said gary and coughed and looked to lou if we dont move them said harry and for once he wasnt smiling another train cant come in alice said lou alice louder outraged you hear what is happening here there was a click and a rumbling sound a sort of shunting a gate at the far end of the platform rolled back then another and another all of them opening at once go on said alice we all just stood there we werent sure what it meant we didnt even know that all those gates could open at once go on get out hurry before one of the wigs comes you mean it harry asked we were frightened we were frightened to leave well say you got killed in the riot that you were gassed or something theyll never know the difference now move alice goddamn it what are you doing are you crazy lou was wild no she aint crazy you are that was royce he stood up well you heard her haul some ass charlie harry you go and get all the food there is left in the canteen the rest of you go get all the blankets and clothes big coats that havent been shipped back and harry fill some jugs with water lou didnt say anything he pulled out a kitchen knife and he ran toward royce royce just stood there i dont think he would have done anything i think he was tired tired of the whole thing i mean he was tired of death lou came for him the grils burned him they burned lou he fell in a heap at royces feet his long strong arms all twisted aw hell said royce sad and angry aw hell and a voice came cutting into my head clear and blaring i was crazy the voice saidthis is radio station kerb broadcasting live from the first baptist church of christ the redeemer with the reverend thomas wallace robertson and the inglewood youth choir singing o happy day and i heard it i heard the music i just walked out onto the platform reeling with the sound the mass of voices inside my head and i didnt need any blankets o happy day when jesus wash and los angeles might be gone and detroit and miami a lot of things might be gone but that sunday night music was still kicking shit and if there wasnt a god there was always other people and they surprised you maybe id been fooled by history too i said goodbye to the cameras as i passed them goodbye alice goodbye hortensia see ya scarlet butch im sorry about the name they were making funny noises the cameras were weeping i walked on toward the open gate for america pervert by charles coleman finlay charles coleman finlay is the author of the novels the prodigal troll the patriot witch a spell for the revolution and the demon redcoat finlays short fiction most of which appears in his collection wild thingshas been published in several magazines such as the magazine of fantasy science fiction strange horizons and black gate and in anthologies including the best of all flesh and my own by blood we live the way of the wizard and the living dead he has twice been a finalist for the hugo and nebula awards and has also been nominated for the campbell award for best new writer the sidewise award and the theodore sturgeon award sexuality is more than just bodily urges its more than who you ask on a date sexuality permeates almost every aspect of the lives we lead and our cultural experiences will influence our sexual choices we dream of love at first sight but find that society not only influences who we will see but the kind of love we are allowed to fall into this next tale is the story of a man torn between the passion within him and the strictures of a society very different from our own in his world religion and biology have colluded to make people with his sexual urges not only uncommon but unacceptable duty and temptation catch him in a gordian knot even the most hardened dominatrix would find too binding this story was a finalist in the gaylactic spectrum awards for its thoughtful discussion of sexuality and how society regulates our sex lives here is all the passion of sex the melancholy of unexpressed love and the bitterness of a life lived in perversion there are two kinds of people in the world homosexuals and hydrosexuals and then there are perverts like me so far as i know there is not a word not even a bit of slang to describe my particular depravity but then i have never spoken of it to anyone nor written of it before now and we do not invent words for the things we dare not speak or write everyone knows i am different though they can tell jamin and zel stroll through the corridor of the apartment building where we all live i can tell its them coming because i leave my door cracked open to show everyone i have nothing to hide zels distant voice caroms off the walls fluctuating in pitch with the peaks and rhythms of the stories he tells jamins subdued distinctive laugh barks out at regular intervals for thirty or forty seconds before they arrive i hear their approach and dread it they are my best friends i sit in the exact center of the cerulean blue sofa arms resting on its bellshaped back palms damp against the silky fabric the voice of noh sis last years most popular singer warbles from the stereo speakers making a dirge of joy amid the interweaving of sitar and clarinets closing my eyes i count the notes and halfnotes by measure now the sorrowful tone in the endrhyme of love zels exclamation a series of mournful sitar chords jamins laugh and the tap at the door i lift my head as if surprised to see them smile as if happy hey zel throws wide his arms in an extravagant gesture of greeting and says with dead seriousness arise arise like the evening star and brighten the way into night for us jamin grins nods at me hello they are both tall and handsome and completely at ease in themselves jamin is balding so he shaves his head he has quiet wolfish features and always wears plain businesslike clothes immaculately tailored and pressed zel is the shaggy adorable puppy all awkward limbs and endless energy i wipe my hands on my thighs arise and embrace them in turn with only a dry quick kiss on the cheek where are you going we zel exclaims we for surely you are joining us we wont have a speck of fun without you jamin grins he always grins and says heart nouveau heart nouveau is our club weve been hanging out there since it opened just around the time that we were finishing school all our friends go there its the kind of place so packed and dark you cant see any decor beyond the dance floor not tonight i answer work exhausted me today my work itself is not hard but while im working my soul dances like a dervish until i think i will collapse zel immediately begins pleading making dance gyrations beckoning me to join but jamin with his hands folded at his waist in front of him says quietly thinking about marrying this weekend are you ah zels eyes widen at this revelation and he ceases the call to fun the two of them are a happy couple they know that i am different from them and do their best to fit me into their view of the world and the way it works been thinking about it i admit pshaw dont think about it just do it says zel as jamin backs out the doorway whispering to me ill call you tomorrow their voices resume their previous pattern as they continue their journey down the corridor toward the stairs pushing the door closed i let my face lean against it eyes shut for a moment while i twist the lock then i go and fall onto the sofa lifting my head only long enough to replay the previous song at a higher volume the chorus opens the song i want to set myself on fire and plunge into the oceans of your love my face presses against the water blue color of the pillows trying to drown in them thats it im only nervous about marrying this weekend i lie aloud to myself its natural to be nervous about it the first time ill just do it like zel says and then everything will be better you would think as much as i practice lying to myself id be better at it by now in the morning i swath myself in my work robes cheery layers of nectarine and lemon fabric sherbet smooth covering my head and face i walk down to the street and catch the bus into the city the road bridges a green river of trees and grass that divides one quarter of the city from another through the buss window i watch the women emerging from their apartment blocks and little homes when the bus reaches the corner they climb onboard taking seats on their side and evening out the ride so it doesnt feel so much like well tip over we rattle along past road construction the men working behind screens so their presence out of robes wont disturb weaker minds the sun already pelts down mercilessly and they will have to leave off working soon we arrive at the childrens center a long concrete brick of a building with windows shielded from the sun by an open grid of deep squares made of the same material the morning light turns it into a chessboard of glaring white and dark shadow i dont even work with the children who are on the lower floors and the sheltered playground of the courtyard but toil away with records on the upper floors unlike jamin or zel the job permits me to work alongside women but only because i completed my theological studies and am a candidate for the priesthood my superiors do not know of the taint on my soul do not know yet i should say for if they discover it i will never be ordained or promoted to an position in the lower floors today i am verifying and recording the dna strands of a recent set of births my cubicle sits closer to the outer windows and their view only of the rigid cement grid than the inner but is blocked from the light of either nevertheless i jump immediately when the slightest shadow passes by looking up i see her i see ali ah ali ali my all my everything the eye of the hurricane that is my heart ali that ails me ali who alone can heal me ali ai this is silliness of course yet it is how i feel she stops and stares at the floor what are you looking for i ask she turns her head this way and that the button i accidentally stepped on that gave you that electric shock ali is wearing coffee colored robes cream and roasted bean the same as many of the other women in her department and as she is a perfectly average height with her head and almost all her face covered i am still puzzling out how i always recognize at once its her whether theres something specific in her posture or gestures or presence that makes me know her instantly so i say huh and her head lifts up so that her eyes turn toward me glinting with amusement i would recognize those stormy seagrey eyes anywhere you are mocking me she shakes her head its very difficult not to i blush the heat rising through my face to my forehead she chuckles and then walks to another cubicle several spaces over where she speaks to one of our sister workers about a particular child whose progress they are following how can i describe her effect on me in a single second i suffer pangs and longings which have no name an overwhelming need to peel away the layers of her robes like shells off a bean and root through her flesh until i find the hard nut the seed core of my perverse unnatural desire when i was studying theogenetics in preparation for the priesthood we were taught that everything in the world was black and white right or wrong and i learned to give all the answers i was expected to provide all i have ever seen of ali are her eyes the white of her eyes and the black pupil are just like everyone elses but that cloudy wavetossed grey is wholly hers and all my world is grey now too as if something swirling deep within me since the moment of my conception has finally taken shape the way clouds form when wind swirls in a clear sky the things i know are wrong feel right deep within my heart and every right thing i do feels wrong jamin calls me at work later that day just as he had promised he would his voice warm and resonant as always i hope you dont mind he says but ive arranged for you to join me and a friend for dinner tonight sounds great will zel be joining us no just us jamin is looking out for me the way he has always tried to he is a very good friend i am filled with trepidation well i say i might be working late thats fine pick you up in a taxi at quitting time sure i say and disconnect i look up from my desk but ali is nowhere to be seen in the breakwater of cubicle ways sometimes i may see her no more than once in a day though it feels like she is always with me since i cannot stop thinking of her for the rest of the day i cannot concentrate on genetic sequences at all and my work is useless when the taxi crosses into the mens quarter jamin and i remove our veils although the driver leaves his own jamin relaxes instantly more happily himself making small talk about work i smile too but inside i am tense were dropped off in a neighborhood where fruit trees shade the narrow streets the houses are neat and tidy and old the kind owned by government officials and couples who both have excellent jobs jamin leads me to a door by an elaborate garden that appears to be both lovingly created and recently neglected the man who answers is not quite twice our age perhaps a little younger his beard looks new as though his chin has gone untended for about as long as the garden outside he wears a comfortable tailored suit jamin embraces him saying hello hodge this is the friend i was telling you about somehow i cheerfully complete the introductions jamin and i sit at a counter in the kitchen while hodge finishes cooking the dinner the room smells of garlic and oil jamin and hodge discuss work they are both employed in law and i avoid nearly all the personal questions directed at me the songs of noh sis stream from the speakers to fill most of the awkward silences we are seated around hodges elegant antique table having finished a delightful chick pea soup and a satisfying pepper salad a platter of mouthwatering spinachfeta pastries rests between us as i am helping myself to a second serving and laughing heartily at an anecdote that hodge is telling about the prosecution of a man whose pet dog kept straying into the womens quarter jamin rises and wipes his mouth with his napkin please forgive me he says i didnt realize how late it has gotten and i promised to meet zel this evening but weve scarcely begun hodge says evincing real dismay and all i can do is think jamin you beast but jamin insists and i stand to go with him but both men persuade me to stay by making promises of transportation then hodge bustles around putting together a plate of food for jamin to take with him growing particularly distressed because his cake hasnt cooled sufficiently and falls apart when cuts a slice to go the whole time jamin smiles at me and refuses to meet my eyes finally hes gone and hodge and i sit back to our meal sometime during this the music has fallen silent and hodge is too distracted to reset it how long have you known jamin he says after a sip of wine all my life i say we grew up in the same childrens center and then attended the same hes wellmeaning but what a beastly thing to do i think he means it as a joke but im not sure so i stare at my plate and concentrate on eating making extravagant praise of the food between the clinks of silverware on porcelain so hodge says after another drink of wine youre the marrying kind yes my heart trips and stumbles yes i am it wont be bad will this coming ceremony be your first time yes i mean i havent decided yet youll be nervous your first time it wont be bad i choke out laughter arent you supposed to tell me how good it will be he winces folding his napkin he leans his elbows on the table and looks directly at me look jamin thinks that were both the same type i just lost my partner oh im sorry i say he holds up his hand no its all right wed been together for ten years or so but hed been unhappy for a very long time im glad he ran off where hed go to i ask desperate to change the subject hodge shook his head look thats not important im happy by myself right now i hope you understand he didnt sound happy at all of course i mean i im not like you he said in a low whisper and then drank the rest of his wine oh the story about the man with the dog did i ever finish that no i had forgotten it already the last time they caught him they stoned him to death and set his body on fire that kind of perversion cant be tolerated you know we arent animals with animal passions i know that my voice is strained because i am scared well then good he rises abruptly ill call you a taxi he fumbles at the counter frowning the cake is a disappointment but ill send some with you when the taxi arrives and i step off the stoop into darkness i hear him say good luck with the marrying its over quickly he reminds me of a piece of topiary a plant forced by wires and pruning into a facsimile of something else so twisted over time that he no longer resembles himself i can feel myself being twisted misshapen more each day but ill resist it the taxi door slams and whisks me away i dont see ali at work the next day or the following morning at lunch i am standing by the inner windows overlooking the courtyard below while the children the weave an endless pattern of joy amid the trees and joys untroubled by impossible choices pressed to the window i am only slightly aware of someone next to me the lobby is busy many people rushing by so several minutes pass before i look up and realize that it is ali beside me she taps her foot on the tiles rubber floor very smart they arent able to zap you here im sorry i blurt out sorry that i havent noticed her sorry that i hadnt talked to her earlier ali lowers her long eyelashes and looks away well if you want to be zapped you could always go back to your desk wait she pauses in midstep im waiting and because i dont know what else to say because there is only one thing besides her on my mind i ask will you be marrying this weekend thats a very improper thing for you to ask she says and walks quickly away to the other side of the lobby where she stands by a tub of polished stones and bubbling water watching the children below i want to run after her take her by the elbow and make her understand i want her to feel for me the way i feel toward her i want her to peel off her gloves and sink her bare hands into my flesh stripping it away to the bone until she reaches my heart and can soothe away the ache i feel for her instead i also turn and look out the window again from this height i cant tell if the children below are boys or girls heart nouveau is even more crowded than normal tonight because of the bachelors party jamin and zel have brought me here to celebrate just as all the other normal men have brought their friends who will be marrying tomorrow smoke swirls across the bar and dance floor eddying with the currents of moving people and the crashing waves of music zel has taken off his shirt and is dancing halfnaked under the strobe lights with the others in an orgy of arms and hands im standing off to one side of the dance floor beside jamin who doesnt dance but nevertheless gazes on zel adoringly our scripture says and in his own image god made them man and woman and bade them be fruitful and multiply and set them apart from the beasts and gave them dominion over the beasts and also it is good for a man never to touch a woman nor a woman touch a man lest they be tempted to behave as the beasts of the field do in their passions i have never even seen beasts in the field theology classes glossed over that only teaching us that before god gave people the wisdom of science we behaved as they did with peace and prosperity and time we have become a very secular people falling into relationships doing our work and living our lives with questions zel grabs me by the hand pulling me onto the dance floor where the lights are flashing music pumping and ecstatic faces surround me he only wants me to be happy and he only knows what makes him happy and so he tries to bring me to that too i resist him i resist everything these days and pull away smile he shouts at me above the din have some fun im having fun i shout in reply are you excited by marrying tomorrow i mumble my answer to him but he doesnt hear me and leans forward sweat dripping from his forehead on my shoulder shouting what i said scripture says its better to marry than to burn he laughs as if this is the wittiest thing in the world and spins around arms and fists pumping in beat with the music but i am burning already the thought of ali is a fire in my mind and a searing pain in my flesh an unquenchable flame even though i know all my feelings for her are wrong still i will go do my duty tomorrow and marry rather than burn the next morning i arise with the other bachelors before dawn many have hangovers and some are too sick to marry this time their absences are noted by the priests assistant in his white jacket as we board the bus those who have not made it are roundly mocked by even the sickest of those aboard the other men are hugging wishing each other well but i hold myself apart there are only a dozen of us so it is easy to take a seat away from the others my stomach is queasy as we head for the temple of the waters and not just from last nights drinking our route takes us along the edge of the womens quarter and none of us are wearing veils i slouch in my seat several of the men pull their robes up over their noses others put their hands on their heads or pretend to rub their faces the priests assistant who misses nothing points this out to them and they all laugh but i can only think that perhaps ali is sitting in another bus without her veil on either and i wonder if her mouth is as round and full as her eyes if the arch of her lips matches that of her brow if the curve of her neck is as graceful as the bridge of her nose would i even recognize her i do not know the temple of the waters sits at the center of the government quarter across from the palace of congress it is an oasis of green and blue marble in a desert and steel and concrete and sandstone the giant telescreens that surround it show images of the ocean the surge of waves in calm weather but they remind me of the stormtossed gray of alis eyes and i breathe faster as were climbing off the bus the priests assistant steps in front of me and grips me by the shoulder instantly i know that he saw how i stayed apart he knows that i am different from the others but he only says why dont you smile this is going to be a good thing think of the pride youll feel i force myself to smile and pull away from him to follow the others we strip in the anteroom a few of the men are as young as i am but they range in age up to a solemn grayhaired old man who goes about his preparations with all the grim seriousness of a surgeon in a touchy operation the room is as hot as a sauna and several men grow visibly excited one man a boy almost younger than me cant help himself and spills his seed there on the floor the others chastise him until he starts to cry but the priest enters through a second door and all falls silent noticing the mess he says dont worry im sure theres more where that came from everyone laughs and the boy rubs his tears from his cheeks and grins and everyone is at ease again everyone but me the priest asks how many of us have married before and most of the men raise their hands yours is a sacred trust the priest tells us there are two kinds of people in the world those to whom society is given and those who have the sacred duty to give to society to perpetuate it you have been called to that latter it is a holy trust a gift from our heavenly father who spilled his seed in the primal ocean and brought forth all the manner of life this is the standard speech words except for the calling that weve heard all our lives it is meant to be calming we were taught but i feel a rising surge of panic earlier this morning the priest continues the women entrusted with their half of this sacred duty came down from their quarter they entered the main chamber of the temple a short while ago and even now immerse themselves in the pool in just a moment it will be your turn to enter look to the older men who have been here before and do what comes naturally to you some nervous laughter follows this the priest looks at the boy who spilled himself who is already excited again and says hold on to that a little longer friend now a madness is upon me this fire burning within me is hell itself i look at the doors seeking a way to extinguish the flame of my desire the priest checks the door hurry now it is time he says and the men press forward somehow scooping me up so that i the most reluctant of them am at the head of the phalanx the doors swing open one group of acolytes stand there with towels as we enter while a second set waits to collect the results of our labor a door identical to ours but opposite clicks shut as the last of the women leave a wombshaped pool of bodywarm water fills the center of the circular room the women have ejaculated their eggs into it already however they do that i do not know but they float in a few tiny gellatinous clumps on the surface hurry now the priest in the white coat says timing is important an acolyte reaches out his white gloved hand to help me down the steps and into the pool the other bachelors crowd the waters edge there are two kinds of people in the world homosexuals and hydrosexuals but i am neither i lunge across the room dodging the outstretched hands and shocked eyes of the panicked acolytes my hand falls on the latch of the door into the womens anteroom i will run through there searching for ali and if i dont find her out into the streets and through the womens quarter until i do ai ali my all my everything the eye of the only hurricane whose deluge can drown the unnamed flame of sin that burns

strip and a graphic novel it originally appeared in in the comic anthology a a r g h edited by alan moore and was recently reprinted in the glbt anthology the future is queer edited by richard labonte and lawrence schimel the story is a response to a piece british legislation that had a decidedly antihomosexual flavor this story uses scathing sarcasm to present a future without homosexual influences no art no plays no books no cultural referents to anything gay lesbian transsexual or remotely queer for the storys masked narrator its a perfect world but the images behind him suggest something a little darker the narrator of this piece speaks through a mobile white mask with very abstracted features strikingly reminiscent of a guy fawkes mask its interesting to note that at the time v for vendetta a s british comics series featuring a character who wears a guy fawkes mask and written by alan moore the first editor of this piece was very popular different motivations different details but moores character gaimans narrator and guy fawkes were all men perfectly willing to destroy the world for their own black purposes amaryllis by carrie vaughn carrie vaughn is the bestselling author of the kitty norville series which started with kitty and the midnight hour her latest books are kitty goes to war a young adult novel voices of dragons and a standalone fantasy novel discords apple her short work has appeared many times in realms of fantasy and in a number of anthologies such as by blood we live the mammoth book of paranormal romance fast ships black sails and warriors she has a story forthcoming in my anthology the mad scientists guide to world domination and this story first appeared in my online science fiction magazine lightspeed amaryllis gives us a world that compared to some dystopias feels downright wholesome no one is tortured no one lives under scrutiny no one is executed but the characters are caught in a society that has taken away their reproductive control for most of us thats a pretty basic human right but theres a good reason to take family size out of individual control with the worlds population spinning out of control as the author says in the industrialized world at least a financially successful family or individual can stay pretty isolated from their community if they so choose but if theres ever a cataclysmic loss of resources that could change and in the future carrie vaughn spins a desperate community must contain its population or die our next storys debatable dystopic quotient aside this story explores the idea that while one never sets out to create a dystopia in order for a society to survive sometimes it is necessary to become one i never knew my mother and i never understood why she did what she did i ought to be grateful that she was crazy enough to cut out her implant so she could get pregnant but it also meant she was crazy enough to hide the pregnancy until termination wasnt an option knowing the whole time that shed never get to keep the baby that shed lose everything that her household would lose everything because of her i never understood how she couldnt care i wondered what her family thought when they learned what shed done when their committee split up the household scattered them broke them because of her did she think i was worth it it was all about quotas theyre using cages up north i heard off shore anchored nina said fifty feet across twice as much protein grown with half the resources and wed never have to touch the wild population again we could double our quota i hadnt really been listening to her we were resting just for a moment she sat with me on the railing at the prow of amaryllis and talked about her big plans wind pulled the sails taut and the fiberglass hull cut through waves without a sound we sailed so smooth garrett and sun hauled up the nets behind us dragging in the catch amaryllis was elegant a foot sleek vessel with just enough cabin and cargo space an antique but more than seaworthy she was a good boat with a good crew the best marie nina said pleading i sighed and woke up weve been over this we cant just double our quota but if we got authorization dont you think were doing all right as it is we had a good crew we were well fed and not exceeding our quotas i thought wed be best off not screwing all that up not making waves so to speak ninas big brown eyes filled with tears id said the wrong thing because i knew what she was really after and the status quo wasnt it thats just it she said weve met our quotas and kept everyone healthy for years now i really think we should try we can at least ask cant we the truth was no i wasnt sure we deserved it i wasnt sure that kind of responsibility would be worth it i didnt want the prestige nina didnt even want the prestige she just wanted the baby its out of our hands at any rate i said looking away because i couldnt bear the intensity of her expression pushing herself off the rail nina stomped down amaryllis port side to join the rest of the crew hauling in the catch she wasnt old enough to want a baby she was lithe fit and golden running barefoot on the deck sunbleached streaks gleaming in her brown hair actually no she was old enough shed been with the house for seven years she was twenty now it hadnt seemed so long whoa sun called there was a splash and a thud as something in the net kicked against the hull he leaned over the side the muscles along his broad coppery back flexing as he clung to a net that was about to slide back into the water nina petite next to his strong frame reached with him i ran down and grabbed them by the waistbands of their trousers to hold them steady the fourth of our crew garrett latched a boat hook into the net together we hauled the catch onto the deck wed caught something big heavy and full of powerful muscles we had a couple of aggregators large buoys made of scrap steel and wood anchored fifty miles or so off the coast schooling fish were attracted to the aggregators and we found the fish mainly mackerel sardines sablefish and whiting an occasional shark or marlin found its way into the nets but those we let go they were rare and outside our quotas that was what i expected to see something unusually large thrashing among the slick silvery mass of smaller fish this thing was large yes as big as nina no wonder it had almost pulled them over but it wasnt the right shape sleek and streamlined a powerful swimmer silvery like the rest of the catch what is it nina asked tuna i said by process of elimination i had never seen one in my life bluefin i think no ones caught a bluefin in thirty years garrett said sweat was dripping onto his face despite the bandanna tying back his shaggy dark hair i was entranced looking at all that protein i pressed my hand to the fishs flank feeling its muscles twitch maybe theyre back wed been catching the tunas food all along after all in the old days the aggregators attracted as many tuna as mackerel but no one had seen one in so long everyone assumed they were gone lets put him back i said and the others helped me lift the net to the side it took all of us and when we finally got the tuna to slide overboard we lost half the nets catch with it a wave of silvery scales glittering as they hit the water but that was okay better to be under quota than over the tuna splashed its tail and raced away we packed up the rest of the catch and set sails for home the californian crew got their banner last season and flew its red and green power and fertility from the top of the boats mast for all to see elsie of the californian was due to give birth in a matter of weeks as soon as her pregnancy was confirmed she stopped sailing and stayed in the household sheltered and treasured loose hands resting atop mountainous belly she would sometimes come out to greet her households boat as it arrived nina would stare at her elsie might have been the first pregnant woman nina had seen as least since surviving puberty and developing thoughts of carrying a mountainous belly of her own elsie was there now an icon cast in bronze before the setting sun her body canted slightly against the weight in her belly like a ship leaning away from the wind we furled the sails and rowed to the pier beside the scale house nina hung over the prow looking at elsie who was waving at californians captain on the deck of the boat solid and dashing everything a captain ought to be he waved back at her their boat was already secured in its home slip their catch weighed everything tidy nina sighed at the image of a perfect life and nobody yelled at her for not helping best thing to do in a case like this was let her dream until she grew out of it might take decades but still my amaryllis crew handed crates off to the dockhand who shifted our catch to the scale house beyond that were the processing houses where onshore crews smoked canned and shipped the fish inland the new oceanside community provided sixty percent of the protein for the whole region which was our mark of pride our reason for existing within the community itself the ten sailing crews were proudest of all a fishing crew that did its job well and met its quotas kept the whole system running smoothly i was lucky to even have the amaryllis and be a part of it i climbed up to the dock with my folk after securing the boat and saw that anders was the scalemaster on duty the weeks trip might as well have been for nothing then thirtyfive years ago my mother ripped out her implant and broke up her household might as well have been yesterday to a man like anders the old man took a nailbiting forty minutes to weigh our catch and add up our numbers at which point he announced youre fifty pounds over quota quotas were the only way to keep the stock healthy to prevent overfishing shortages and ultimately starvation the committee based quotas on how much you needed not how much you could catch to exceed that to pretend you needed more than other people showed so much disrespect to the committee the community to the fishing stock my knees weak i almost sat down id gotten it exactly right i knew i had i glared at him garrett and sun a pair of brawny sailors helpless before the scalemaster in his dull gray tunic of authority glared at him some days felt like nothing i did would ever be enough id always be too far one way or the other over the line of just right most days id accept the scalemasters judgment and walk away but today after setting loose the tuna and a dozen pounds of legitimate catch with it it was too much youre joking i said fifty pounds really anders said marking the penalty on the chalkboard behind him where all the crews could see it you ought to know better an experienced captain like you he wouldnt even look at me couldnt look me in the eye while telling me i was trash what do you want me to do throw the surplus overboard we can eat those fifty pounds the livestock can eat those fifty pounds itll get eaten dont worry but its on your record then he marked it on his clipboard as if he thought wed come along and alter the public record might as well not sail out at all next week eh i said the scalemaster frowned and turned away a fifty pound surplus if it even existed would go to make up another crews shortfall and next week our catch would be needed just as much as it had been this week however little some folk wanted to admit it we could get our quota raised like nina wanted and we wouldnt have to worry about surpluses at all no then wed worry about shortfalls and not earning credits to feed the mouths we had much less the extra one nina wanted surpluses must be penalized or everyone would go fishing for surpluses and having spare babies and then where would we be too many mouths not enough food no resiliency to survive disaster and all the disease and starvation that followed id seen the pictures in the archives of what happened after the big fall just enough and no more moderation but so help me i wasnt going to dump fifty pounds just to keep my record clean were done here thank you captain marie anders said his back to me like he couldnt stand the sight of me when we left i found nina at the doorway staring i pushed her in front of me back to the boat so we could put amaryllis to bed for the night the amaryllis scales arent that far off garrett grumbled as we rowed to her slip ten pounds maybe not fifty anders had his foot on the pad throwing it off id bet on it sun said ever notice how were only ever off when anders is running the scales wed all noticed is that true but why would he do that said nina innocent nina everyone looked at me a weight seemed to settle on us what nina said what is it it was the kind of thing no one talked about and nina was too young to have grown up knowing the others had all known what they were getting into signing on with me but not nina i shook my head at them well never prove that anders has it in for us so theres no good arguing well take our licks and thats the end of it sun said too many black marks like that theyll break up the house that was the worry wasnt it how many black marks nina said he cant do that can he garrett smiled and tried to take the weight off he was the first to sign on with me when i inherited the boat wed been through a lot together well just have to find out anders schedule and make sure we come in when someone else is on duty but most of the time there were no schedules just whoever was on duty when a boat came in i wouldnt be surprised to learn that anders kept a watch for us just to be here to rig our weighin amaryllis glided into her slip and i let garrett and sun secure the lines i leaned back against the side stretching my arms staring up along the mast nina sat nearby clenching her hands her lips elsie and californians captain had gone i gave her a pained smile you might have a better chance of getting your extra mouth if you went to a different crew the californian maybe are you trying to get rid of me nina said sitting up i put my arms across her shoulders and pulled her close nina came to me a clumsy thirteenyear old from bernardino up the coast my household had a space for her and i was happy to get her shed grown up smart and eager she could take my place when i retired inherit amaryllis in her turn not that id told her that yet never never ever she only hesitated a moment before wrapping her arms around me and squeezing back our household was an oasis wed worked hard to make it so id inherited the boat attracted the crew one by one garrett and sun to run the boat round and bustling dakota to run the house and she brought the talented j j and we fostered nina wed been assigned fishing rights and then we earned the land allocation ten years of growing working sweating nurturing living and the place was gorgeous wed dug into the side of a hill above the docks and built with adobe in the afternoon sun the walls gleamed golden the part of the house projecting out from the hill served as a wall protecting the garden and well our path led around the house and into the courtyard wed found flat shale to use as flagstones around the cultivated plots and to line the well turning it into a spring a tiny spring but any open fresh water seemed like a luxury on the hill above were the windmill and solar panels everyone who wanted a private room had one but only sun did the detached room dug into the hill across the yard dakota j j and nina had pallets in the largest room garret and i shared a bed in the smaller room what wasnt house was garden we had producing fruit trees an orange and a lemon that also shaded the kitchen space corn tomatoes sunflowers green beans peas carrots radishes two kinds of peppers and anything else we could make grow on a few square feet a pot full of mint and one of basil for the most part we fed ourselves and so could use our credits on improving amaryllis and bringing in specialties like rice and honey or fabric and rope that we couldnt make in quantity dakota wanted to start chickens next season if we could trade for the chicks i kept wanting to throw that in the face of people like anders it wasnt like i didnt pay attention i wasnt a burden the crew arrived home j j had supper ready dakota and j j had started out splitting household work evenly but pretty quickly they were trading chores turning compost versus hanging laundry mending the windmill versus cleaning the kitchen until j j did most everything involving the kitchen and living spaces and dakota did everything with the garden and mechanics by j j s sympathetic expression when he gave me my serving smoked mackerel and vegetables tonight someone had already told him about the runin with the scalemaster probably to keep him or dakota from asking how my day went i stayed out later than usual making a round of the holding not that i expected to find anything wrong it was for my own peace of mind looking at what wed built with my own eyes putting my hand on the trunk of the windmill running the leaves of the lemon tree across my palms ensuring that none of it had vanished that it wasnt going to it had become a ritual in bed i held tight to garrett to give and get comfort skin against skin under the sheet under the warm air coming in through the open skylight above our bed bad day he said can never be a bad day when the ship and crew come home safe i said but my voice was flat garrett shifted running a hand down my back arranging his arms to pull me tight against him our legs twined together my nerves settled he said ninas right we can do more we can support an extra mouth if we appealed you really think thatll do any good i said i think youd all be better off with a different captain he tilted his face toward mine touched my lips with his pressed until i responded a minute of that and we were both smiling you know we all ended up here because we dont get along with anyone else but you make the rest of us look good i squirmed against him in mock outrage giggling plenty of crews plenty of households dont ever get babies he said it doesnt mean anything i dont care about a baby so much i said im just tired of fighting all the time it was normal for children to fight with their parents their households and even their committees as they grew but it wasnt fair for me to feel like i was still fighting with a mother id never known the next day when nina and i went down to do some cleaning on amaryllis i tried to convince myself it was my imagination that she was avoiding me not looking at me or pretending not to look when in fact she was stealing glances the way she avoided meeting my gaze made my skin crawl a little shed decided something she had a secret we caught sight of elsie again walking up from the docks a hundred yards away but her silhouette was unmistakable that distracted nina who stopped to stare is she really that interesting i said smiling trying to make it a joke nina looked at me sideways as if deciding whether she should talk to me then she sighed i wonder what its like dont you wonder what its like i thought about it a moment and mostly felt fear rather than interest all the things that could go wrong even with a banner of approval flying above you nina wouldnt understand that not really marie how can you be so so indifferent because im not going to spend the effort worrying about something i cant change besides id much rather be captain of a boat than stuck on shore watching i marched past her to the boat and she followed head bowed we washed the deck checked the lines cleaned out the cabin took inventory and made a stack of gear that needed to be repaired wed take it home and spend the next few days working on it before we went to sea again nina was quiet most of the morning and i kept glancing at her head bent to her work biting her lip wondering what she was thinking on so intently what she was hiding turned out she was working up the courage i handed the last bundle of net to her then went back to double check that the hatches were closed and the cabin was shut up when i went to climb off the boat myself she was sitting at the edge of the dock her legs hanging over the edge swinging a little she looked ten years younger like she was a kid again like she had when i first saw her i regarded her brows raised questioning until finally she said i asked sun why anders doesnt like you why none of the captains talk to you much so that was what had happened sun matteroffact and sensible would have told her without any circumspection and nina had been horrified smiling i sat on the gun wale in front of her id have thought youd been here long enough to figure it out on your own i knew something had happened but i couldnt imagine what certainly not i mean no one ever talks about it but what happened to your mother her household i shrugged because it wasnt like i remembered any of it id pieced the story together made some assumptions was told what happened by people who made their own assumptions who wanted me to understand exactly what my place in the world was they were scattered over the whole region i think ten of them it was a big household successful until i came along i dont know where all they ended up i was brought to new oceanside raised up by the first amaryllis crew then zeke and ann retired took up pottery went down the coast and gave me the ship to start my own household happy ending and your mother they sterilized her after you were born i mean i assume so like i said i dont really know do you suppose she thought it was worth it i imagine she didnt i said if she wanted a baby she didnt get one did she but maybe she just wanted to be pregnant for a little while nina looked so thoughtful swinging her feet staring at the rippling water where it lapped against the hull she made me nervous i had to say something youd better not be thinking of pulling something like that i said theyd split us up take the house take amaryllis oh no nina said shaking her head quickly her denial vehement i would never do that id never do anything like that good i said relieved i trusted her and didnt think she would then again my mothers household probably thought that about her too i hopped over to the dock we collected up the gear slinging bags and buckets over our shoulders and starting the hike up to the house halfway there nina said you dont think well ever get a banner because of your mother thats what you were trying to tell me yeah i kept my breathing steady concentrating on the work at hand but it doesnt change who you are what you do the old folk still take it out on me its not fair she said she was too old to be saying things like that but at least now shed know and she could better decide if she wanted to find another household if you want to leave ill understand i said any house would be happy to take you no she said no ill stay none of it it doesnt change who you are i could have dropped everything and hugged her for that we walked awhile longer until we came in sight of the house then i asked you have someone in mind to be the father hypothetically she blushed berry red and looked away i had to grin so that was how it stood when garrett greeted us in the courtyard nina was still blushing she avoided him and rushed along to dump her load in the workshop garrett blinked after her whats up with her nina being nina the next trip on amaryllis went well we made quota in less time than i expected which gave us half a days vacation we anchored off a deserted bit of shore and went swimming lay on deck and took in the sun ate the last of the oranges and dried mackerel that j j had sent along with us it was a good day but we had to head back some time and face the scales i weighed our haul three times with amaryllis scale got a different number each time but all within ten pounds of each other and more importantly twenty pounds under quota not that it would matter we rowed into the slip at the scale house and anders was the scalemaster on duty again i almost hauled up our sails and turned us around never to return i couldnt face him not after the perfect trip nina was right it wasnt fair that this one man could ruin us with false surpluses and black marks silently we secured amaryllis to the dock and began handing up our cargo i managed to keep from even looking at anders which probably made me look guilty in his eyes but wed already established i could be queen of perfection and he would consider me guilty anders frown was smug his gaze judgmental i could already hear him tell me i was fifty pounds over quota another haul like that hed say well have to see about yanking your fishing rights id have to punch him i almost told garrett to hold me back if i looked like i was going to punch him but he was already keeping himself between the two of us as if he thought i might really do it if the old scalemaster managed to break up amaryllis id murder him and wouldnt that be a worse crime than any i might represent anders drew out the moment looking us all up and down before finally announcing sixty over this time and you think youre good at this my hands tightened into fists i imagined myself lunging at him at this point what could i lose wed like an audit nina said slipping past sun garrett and me to stand before the stationmaster frowning hands on her hips excuse me anders said an audit i think your scale is wrong and wed like an audit right she looked at me it was probably better than punching him yes i said after a flabbergasted moment yes we would like an audit that set off two hours of chaos in the scale house anders protested hollered at us threatened us i sent sun to the committee house to summon official oversight he wouldnt try to play nice and they couldnt brush him off june and abe two senior committee members arrived austere in gray and annoyed whats the complaint june said everyone looked at me to answer i almost denied it that was my first impulse dont fight dont make waves because maybe i deserved the trash i got or my mother did but she wasnt here was she but nina was looking at me with her innocent brown eyes and this was for her i wore a perfectly neutral businesslike expression when i spoke to june and abe this wasnt about me it was about business quotas and being fair scalemaster anders adjusts the scales calibration when he sees us coming i was amazed when they turned accusing gazes at him and not at me anders mouth worked trying to stutter a defense but he had nothing to say the committee confirmed that anders was rigging his scale they offered us reparations out of anders own rations i considered it would mean extra credits extra food and supplies for the household wed been discussing getting another windmill petitioning for another well instead i recommended that any penalties they wanted to levy should go to community funds i just wanted amaryllis treated fairly and i wanted a meeting to make one more petition before the committee garrett walked with me to the committee office the next morning i should have been the one to think of requesting an audit i said nina isnt as scared of the committee as you are as you were he said im not but i stopped because he was right he squeezed my hand his smile was amused his gaze warm he seemed to find the whole thing entertaining me i was relieved exhausted giddy ashamed mostly relieved we amaryllis had done nothing wrong i had done nothing wrong garrett gave me a long kiss then waited outside while i went to sit before the committee june was in her chair along with five other committee members behind their long table with their slate boards tally sheets and lists of quotas i sat across from them alone hands clenched in my lap trying not to tap my feet trying to appear as proud and assured as they did a stray breeze slipped through the open windows and cooled the cinderblock room after polite greetings june said you wanted to make a petition we the amaryllis crew would like to request an increase in our quota just a small one june nodded weve already discussed it and were of a mind to allow an increase would that be suitable suitable as what as reparation as an apology my mouth was dry my tongue frozen my eyes stung wanting to weep but that would have damaged our chances as much as just being me did theres one more thing i managed with an increased quota we can feed another mouth it was an arrogant thing to say but i had no reason to be polite they could chastise me send me away without a word lecture me on wanting too much when there wasnt enough to go around tell me that it was more important to maintain what we had rather than try to expand expansion was arrogance we simply had to maintain but they didnt they didnt even look shocked at what i had said june so elegant i thought with her long gray hair braided and resting over her shoulder a knitted shawl draped around her as much for decoration as for warmth reached into the bag at her feet and retrieved a folded piece of cloth which she pushed across the table toward me i didnt want to touch it i was still afraid as if id reach for it and june would snatch it away at the last moment i didnt want to unfold it to see the red and green pattern in full in case it was some other color instead but i did even though my hand shook and there it was i clenched the banner in my fist no one would be able to pry it out is there anything else youd like to speak of june asked no i said my voice a whisper i stood nodded at each of them held the banner to my chest and left the room garrett and i discussed it on the way back to the house the rest of the crew was waiting in the courtyard for us dakota in her skirt and tunic hair in a tangled bun j j with his arms crossed looking worried sun shirtless hands on hips inquiring and nina right there in front bouncing almost i regarded them trying to be inscrutable gritting my teeth to keep from bursting into laughter i held our banner behind my back to hide it garrett held my other hand well nina finally said how did it go what did they say the surprise wasnt going to get any better than this i shook out the banner and held it up for them to see and oh id never seen all of them wideeyed and wondering mouths gaping like fish at once nina broke the spell laughing and running at me throwing herself into my arms we nearly fell over then we were all hugging and dakota started worrying right off talking about what we needed to build a crib all the fabric wed need for diapers and how we only had nine months to save up the credits for it i recovered enough to hold nina at arms length so i could look her in the eyes when i pressed the banner into her hands she nearly dropped it at first skittering from it as if it were fire so i closed her fingers around the fabric and held them there its yours i said i want you to have it i glanced at garrett to be sure and yes he was still smiling staring at me nina held it to her chest much like i had but you its yours she started crying then so did i gathering her close and holding her tight while she spoke through tears dont you want to be a mother in fact i rather thought i already was pop

if no one dies theres no reason to procreate and in a world still healing from environmental disaster children are the new americas most wanted and they get the death penalty when there really is a fountain of youth what price are we willing to pay for a drink the familiar stench of unwashed bodies cooked food and shit washes over me as i come through the door cruiser lights flicker through the blinds sparkling in rain and illuminating the crime scene with strobes of red and blue fire a kitchen a humid mess a chunky woman huddles in the corner clutching closed her nightgown fat thighs and swaying breasts under stained silk squad goons crowding her pushing her around making her sit making her cower another woman younglooking and pretty pregnant and blackhaired is slumped against the opposite wall her blouse spackled with spaghetti remains screams from the next room kids i squeeze my fingers over my nose and breathe through my mouth fighting off nausea as pentle wanders in holstering his grange he sees me and tosses me a nosecap i break it and snort lavender until the stink slides off children come scampering in with pentle a brood of three tangling around his knees the screamers from the other room they gallop around the kitchen and disappear again screaming still into the living room where data sparkles like fairy dust on the wallscreens and provides what is likely their only connection to the outside world thats everyone pentle says hes got a long skinny face and a sour small mouth that always points south weights seem to hang off his cheeks fat caterpillar brows droop over his eyes he surveys the kitchen mouth corners dragging lower its always depressing to come into these scenes they were all inside when we broke down the door i nod absently as i shake monsoon water from my hat great thanks liquid beads scatter on the floor joining puddles of wet from the pop squad along with the maggot debris of the spaghetti dinner i put my hat back on water still manages to drip off the brim and slip under my collar a slick rivulet of discomfort someone closes the door to the outside the shit smell thickens eggy and humid the nosecap barely holds it off old peas and bits of cereal crunch under my feet they squish with the spaghetti the geologic layers of past feedings the kitchen hasnt been selfcleaned in years the older woman coughs and pulls her nightgown tighter around her cellulite and i wonder as i always do when i come into situations like this what made her choose this furtive nasty life of rotting garbage and brief illicit forays into daylight the pregnant girl seems to have slipped even further into herself since i arrived she stares into space youd have to touch her pulse to know that shes alive it amazes me that women can end up like this seduced so far down into gutter life that they arrive here fugitives from everyone who would have kept them and held them and loved them and let them see the world outside the children run in from the living room again playing chase a blond no more than five another younger and with brown braids topless and in makeshift diapers less than three and a kneehigh toddler boy scrap diaper bunched around little muscle thighs wearing a tshirt stained with tomato sauce that says whos the cutest the tshirt would be an antique if it wasnt stained you need anything else pentle asks he wrinkles his nose as new reek wafts from the direction of the kids you get photos for the prosecutor got em pentle holds out a digicam and thumbs through the images of the ladies and the three children all of them staring out from the screen like little smeared dolls you want me to take them in now i look over the women the kids have run out again from the other room their howls echo as they chase around their shrieks are piercing even from a distance they hurt my head yeah ill deal with the kids pentle gets the women up off the floor and shuffles out the door leaving me standing alone in the middle of the kitchen its all so familiar a typical floor plan from builders united custom undercab lighting black mirror tile on the floors clever selfclean nozzles hidden behind deco trim lines so much like the stuff alice and i have that i can almost forget where i am its a negative image of our apartments kitchen light vs dark clean vs dirty quiet vs loud the same floor plan everything about it the same and yet nothing in it is its archeological i can look at the layers of gunk and grime and noise and see what must have underlain it before when these people worried about color coordinating and classy appliances i open the fridge smudgefree nickel how practical ours contains pineapples and avocados and endive and corn and coffee and brazil nuts from angel spires hanging gardens this one holds a shelf cluttered with ground mycoprotein bars and wadded piles of nutrition supplement sacs like the kind they hand out at the government rejoo clinics other than a bag of slimy lettuce there isnt anything unprocessed in the fridge at all no vegetables except in powder jars ditto for fruit a stack of selfwarming dinner bins for fried rice and laap and spaghetti just like the one still lying on the kitchen table in a puddle of its own sauce and thats it i close the fridge and straighten theres something here in the mess and the screaming in the next room and the reek of the one kids poopy pants but im stumped as to what it is they could have lived up in the light and air instead they hid in the dark under wet jungle canopy and turned pale and gave up their lives the kids race back in chasing each other all in a train laughing and shrieking they stop and look around surprised maybe that their moms have disappeared the littlest one has a stuffed dinosaur by the nose its got a long green neck and a fat body a brontosaurus i think with big cartoony eyes and black felt lashes its funny about the dinosaur because theyve been gone so long but here one is showing up as a stuffed toy and then its funny again because when you think about it a dinosaur toy is really extinct twice sorry kids mommys gone i pull out my grange their heads kick back in successive jerks bang bang bang down the line holes appearing on their foreheads like paint and their brains spattering out the back their bodies flip and skid on the black mirror floor they land in jumbled piles of misaligned limbs for a second gunpowder burn makes the stench bearable up out of the jungle like a bat out of hell climbing out of rhinehurst superclusters holdout suburban sprawl and then rising through jungle overstory blasting across the causeway toward angel spire and the sea monkeys diving off the rail line like grasshoppers pouring off the edge ahead of my cruiser and disappearing into the mangrove and kudzu and mahogany and teak disappearing into the wet bowels of greenery tangle dumping the cruiser at squad center no time for mopdown dont need it anyway my hat my raincoat my clothes into hazmat bags and then out again on the other side rushing to pull on a tux before catching a masslift up stories rising into the high clear air over the jungle fur of carbon sequestration project n mma telogo has a new concerto alice is his diva viola his prize and hua chiang and telogo have been circling her like ravens picking apart her performance corvid eyes on her watching and hungry for fault but now they call her ready ready to banish banini from his throne ready to challenge for a place in the immortal canon of classical performance and im late caught in a masslift on level packed in with the breath and heat of upperdeck diners and weekenders climbing the spire while the seconds tick by listening to the climate fans buzz and whir while we all sweat and wilt waiting for some problem on the line to clear finally were rising again our stomachs dropping into our shoes our ears popping as we soar into the heavens flying under magnetic acceleration and then slowing so fast we almost leave the floor our stomachs catch up i shove out through hundreds of people waving my cop badge when anyone complains and sprint through the glass arch of the ki performance center i dive between the closing slabs of the attention doors the autolocks thud home behind me sealing the performance space its comforting im inside enfolded in the symphony as though its hands have cupped themselves around me and pulled me into a chamber of absolute focus the lights dim conversational thrum falls away i find my way to my seat more by feel than sight dirty looks from men in topaz hats and women in spectacle eyes as i squeeze across them gauche i know absurdly late to an event that happens once in a decade plopping down just as hua chiang steps up to the podium his hands rise like crane wings bows and horns and flutes flash with movement and then the music comes first a hint like blowing mist and then building winding through a series of repeated stanzas that i have heard alice play perhaps ten thousand times notes i heard first so long ago stumbling and painful that now spill like water and burst like ice flowers the music settles pianissimo again the lovely delicate motifs that i know from alices practice an introduction only she has told me intended to file away the audiences last thoughts of the world outside repeated stanzas until hua chiang accepts that the audience is completely his and then alices viola rises and the other players move to support her fifteen years of practice coming to fruition i look down at my hands overwhelmed its different in the concert hall different than all those days when she cursed and practiced and swore at telogo and claimed his work couldnt be performed different even from when she finished her practices early smiling hands calloused in new ways face flushed eager to drink a cool white wine with me on our balcony in the light of the setting sun and watch the sky as monsoon clouds parted and starlight shone down on our companionship tonight her part joins the rest of the symphony and i cant speak or think for the beauty of the whole later ill hear whether telogo has surpassed banini for sheer audacity ill hear how critics compare living memories of ancient performances and see how critical opinion shifts to accommodate this new piece in a canon that stretches back more than a century and that hangs like a ghost over everything that alice and her director hua chiang hope for a performance that will knock banini off his throne and perhaps depress him enough to stop rejoo and stuff him in his grave for me competing against that much history would be a heavy weight im glad ive got a job where forgetting is the most important part working on the pop squad means your brain takes a vacation and your hands do the work and when you leave work youve left it for good except now as i look down at my hands im surprised to find pinpricks of blood all over them a fine spray the misty remains of the little kid with the dinosaur my fingers smell of rust the tempo accelerates alice is playing again notes writhe together so fluidly that it seems impossible they arent generated electronically and yet the warmth and phrasing is hers achingly hers ive heard it in the morning when she practiced on the balcony testing herself working again and again against the limitations of her self disciplining her fingers and hands forcing them to accept telogos demands the ones that years ago she had called impossible and which now run so cleanly through the audience the blood is all over my hands i pick at it scrape it away in flakes it had to be the kid with the dinosaur he was closest when he took the bullet some of his residue is stuck tight bonded to my own skin i shouldnt have skipped mopdown i pick the man next to me tan face and rouged lips frowns im ruining a moment of history for him something he has waited years to hear i pick more carefully silently the blood flakes off dumb kid with the dumb dinosaur that almost made me miss the performance the cleanup crew noticed the dinosaur toy too caught the irony joked and snorted nosecaps and started bagging the bodies for compost made me late stupid dinosaur the music cascades into silence hua chiangs hands fall applause alice stands at chiangs urging and the applause increases craning my neck i can see her nineteenyearold face flushed smile bright and triumphant enveloped in our adulation we end up at a party thrown by maria illoni one of the symphonys high donors she made her money on global warming mitigation for new york city before it went under her penthouse is in shoreline curve daringly arcing over the seawalls and the surf a sort of flip of the finger to the ocean that beat her storm surge calculations a spidery silver vine over dark water and the bob of the boat communities out in the deeps new york obviously never got its money back illonis outdoor patio runs across the entire top floor of the shoreline and platforms additional petals of spun hollowform carbon out into the air from the far side of the curve you can see beyond the incandescent cores of the superclusters to the old city sprawl dark except along where maglines radiate a strange mangle of wreckage and scavenge and disrepair in the day it looks like some kind of dry red fungal collapse a weave of jungle canopy and old suburban understory but at night all thats visible is the skeleton of glowing infrastructure radial blooms in the darkness and i breathe deeply enjoying all the freshness and openness thats missing from those steaming hideouts i raid with the pop squad alice sparkles in the heat perfectly slim well curved an armful of beautiful girl the fall air is under thirtythree degrees and pleasant and i feel infinitely tender toward her i pull her close we slip into a forest of centuryold bonsai sculptures created by marias husband alice murmurs that he spends all his time here on the roof staring at branches studying their curves and occasionally perhaps every few years wiring a branch and guiding it in a new direction we kiss in the shadows they provide and alice is beautiful and everything is perfect but im distracted when i hit the kids with my grange the littlest one the one with that stupid dinosaur flipped over a grange is built for nitheads not little kids so the bullet plowed through the kid and he flipped and his dinosaur went flying it sailed i mean really sailed through the air and now i cant get it out of my mind that dinosaur flying and then hitting the wall and bouncing onto the black mirror floor so fast and so slow bang bang bang down the line and then the dinosaur in the air alice pulls away seeming to sense my inattention i straighten up try to focus on her she says i thought you werent going to make it when we were tuning i looked out and your seat was empty i force a grin but i did i made it barely i stood around too long with the cleanup guys while the dinosaur lay in a puddle and sopped up the kids blood double extinct the kid and the dinosaur both dead one way and then dead again theres a weird symmetry there she cocks her head studying me was it bad what the brontosaurus the call i shrug just a couple crazy ladies not armed or anything it was easy i cant imagine it cutting rejoo like that she sighs and reaches out to touch a bonsai perfectly guided over the decades by the map that only michael illoni can see or understand why give all this up i dont have an answer i rewind the crime scene in my mind i have the same feeling that i did when i stood on spaghetti maggots and went through their fridge theres something there in the stink and noise and darkness something hot and obsessive and ripe but i dont know what it is the ladies looked old i say like weekold balloons all puffy and droopy alice makes a face of distaste can you imagine trying to perform telogo without rejoo we wouldnt have had the time half of us would have been past our prime and wed have needed understudies and then the understudies would have had to find understudies fifteen years and these women throw it all away how can they throw away something as beautiful as telogo you thinking about kara she would have played telogo twice as well as i did i dont believe that believe it she was the best before she went kidcrazy she sighs i miss her you could still visit her shes not dead yet she might as well be shes already twenty years older than when we knew her she shakes her head no id rather remember her in her prime not out at some singlesex work camp growing vegetables and losing the last of her talent i couldnt stand listening to her play now it would kill me to hear all of that gone she turns abruptly that reminds me my rejoo booster is tomorrow can you take me tomorrow i hesitate im supposed to be on another shift popping kids its kind of short notice i know i meant to ask sooner but with the concert coming up i forgot she shrugs its not that important i can go by myself she glances at me sidelong but it is nicer when you come what the hell i dont really want to work anyway okay sure ill get pentle to cover for me let him deal with the dinosaurs really i shrug what can i say im a sweet guy she smiles and stands on tiptoe to kiss me if we werent going to live forever id marry you i laugh if we werent going to live forever id get you pregnant we look at each other alice laughs unsteadily and takes it as a joke dont be gross before we can talk any more illoni pops out from behind a bonsai and grabs alice by the arm there you are ive been looking everywhere for you you cant hide yourself like this youre the woman of the hour she pulls alice away with all the confidence that must have made new york believe she could save it she barely even looks at me as they hustle off alice smiles tolerantly and motions for me to follow then marias calling to everyone and pulling them all together and she climbs up on a fountains rim and pulls alice up beside her she starts talking about art and sacrifice and discipline and beauty i tune it out theres only so much selfcongratulation you can take its obvious alice is one of the best in the world talking about it just makes it seem banal but the donors need to feel like theyre part of the moment so they all want to squeeze alice and make her theirs so they talk and talk and talk marias saying wouldnt be standing here congratulating ourselves if it werent for our lovely alice hua chiang and telogo did their work well but in the final moment it was alices execution in the face of telogos ambitious piece that has made it resonate so strongly already with the critics we have her to thank for the pieces flawlessness everyone starts applauding and alice blushes prettily not accustomed to adulation from her peers and competitors maria shouts over the cheering ive made several calls to banini and it is more than apparent that he has no answer to our challenge and so i expect the next eighty years are ours and alices the applause is almost deafening maria waves for attention again and the applause fades into scattered whistles and catcalls which finally taper off enough to allow mariato continue to commemorate the end of baninis age and the beginning of a new one i would like to present alice with a small token of affection and here she leans down and picks up a jutewoven gift bag shot with gold as she says of course a woman likes gold and jewels and strings for her viola but i thought this was a particularly apt gift for the evening im leaning against the woman next to me trying to see as maria holds the bag dramatically above her head and calls out to the crowd for alice our slayer of dinosaurs and pulls the green brontosaurus out of the bag its just like the one the kid had its big eyes look right at me for a second it seems to blink at me with its big black lashes and then the crowd laughs and applauds as they all get the joke banini dinosaur ha ha alice takes the dinosaur and holds it by the neck and swings it over her head and everybody laughs again but i cant see anything anymore because im lying on the ground caught in the jungle swelter of peoples legs and i cant breathe are you sure youre okay sure no problem i told you im fine its true i guess sitting next to alice in the waiting room i dont feel dizzy or anything even if i am tired last night she put the dinosaur on the bedside table right in with her collection of little jeweled music boxes and the damn thing looked at me all night long finally at four a m i couldnt stand it anymore and i shoved it under the bed but in the morning she found it and put it back and its been looking at me ever since alice squeezes my hand the rejoo clinics a small one private carefully appointed with holographic windows of sailboats on the atlantic so it feels open and airy even though its daylight is piped in through mirror collectors its not one of the big public monsters out in the clusters that got started after rejoos patents expired you pay a little more than you do for the medicaid generics but you dont rub shoulders with a bunch of starving gamblers and nitheads and drunks who all still want their rejoo even if theyre wasting every day of their endless lives the nurses are quick and efficient pretty soon alice is on her back hooked up to an iv bladder with me sitting beside her on the bed and were watching rejoo push into her its just a clear liquid i always thought it should be fizzy and green for growing things or maybe not green but definitely fizzy it always feels fizzy when it goes in alice takes a quick breath and reaches out for me her slender pale fingers brushing my thigh hold my hand the elixir of life pulses into her filling her flushing her she pants shallowly her eyes dilate she isnt watching me anymore shes somewhere deep inside reclaiming what was lost over the last eighteen months no matter how many times i do it im surprised when i watch it come over someone the way it seems to swallow them and then they come back to the surface more whole and alive than when they started alices eyes focus she smiles oh god i can never get used to that she tries to stand up but i hold her down and beep the nurse once weve got her unhooked i lead her back out to the car she leans heavily against me stumbling and touching me i can almost feel the fizzing and tingling through her skin she climbs into the car when im inside she looks over at me and laughs i cant believe how good i feel nothing like winding back the clock take me home i want to be with you i push the start button on the car and we slide out of our parking space we hook onto the magline out of center spire alice watches the city slide by outside the windows all the shoppers and the businessmen and the martyrs and the ghosts and then were out in the open on the high track over the jungle speeding north again for angel spire its so wonderful to be alive she says it doesnt make any sense what doesnt cutting rejoo if people made sense we wouldnt have psychologists and we wouldnt buy dinosaur toys for kids who were never going to make it anyway i grit my teeth none of them make any sense stupid moms alice sighs and runs her hands across her thighs kneading herself hiking up her skirt and digging her fingers into her flesh but it still doesnt make any sense it feels so good youd have to be crazy to stop rejoo of course theyre crazy they kill themselves they make babies they dont know how to take care of they live in shitty apartments in the dark they never go out they smell bad they look terrible they never have anything good again im starting to shout i shut my mouth alice looks over at me are you okay im fine but im not im mad mad at the ladies and their stupid toybuying pissed off that these dumb women tease their dumb terminal kids like that treat them like they arent going to end up as compost lets not talk about work right now lets just go home i force a grin ive already got the day off we should take advantage of it alice is still looking at me i can see the questions in her eyes if she werent on the leading edge of a rejoo high shed keep pressing but shes so wrapped up in the tingling of her rebuilt body that she lets it go she laughs and runs her fingers up my leg and starts to play with me i override the maglines safeties with my cop codes and we barrel across the causeway toward angel spire with the sun on the ocean and alice smiling and laughing and the bright air whirling around us three a m another call windows down howling through the humidity and swelter of newfoundland alice wants me to come home come back relax but i cant i dont want to im not sure what i want but its not brunch with belgian waffles or screwing on the living room floor or a trip to the movies or anything really i cant do it anyway we got home and i couldnt do it nothing felt right alice said it didnt matter that she wanted to practice now i havent seen her for more than a day ive been on duty catching up on calls ive been going for twentyfour hours straight powered on copperslittlehelpers and mainlined caffeine and my hat and trench coat and hands are pinpricksprayed with the residue of work along the coastline the sea runs high and hot splashing in over the breakwaters lights ahead the glow of coal foundries and gasification works the call takes me up the glittering face of palomino cluster nice real estate up the masslifts and smashing through a door with pentle backing me knowing what were going to find but never knowing how much these ones will fight bedlam a lady this one a pretty brown girl who might have had a great life if she didnt decide she needed a baby and a kid lying in the corner in a box screaming and screaming and the ladys screaming too screaming at the little kid in its box like shes gone out of her mind as we come in through the door she starts screaming at us the kid keeps screaming the lady keeps screaming its like a bunch of screwdrivers jamming in my ears it goes on and on pentle grabs the lady and tries to hold her but she and the kid just keep screaming away and suddenly i cant breathe i can barely stand the kid screams and screams and screams screwdrivers and glass and icepicks in my head so i shoot the thing i pull out my grange and put a bullet in the little sucker fragments of box and baby spray the air i dont do that normally its against procedure to waste the kid in front of the mother but there we all are staring at the body bloodmist and gunpowder all over and my ears ringing from the shot and for one pristine crystal second its quiet then the womans screaming at me again and pentles screaming too because i screwed up the evidence before he could get a picture and then the ladys all over me trying to claw my eyes out pentle drags her off and then shes calling me a bastard and a killer and bastard and monkey man and a fucking pig and that ive got dead eyes and that really gets me ive got dead eyes this ladys headed into a rejoo collapse and wont last another twenty years and shell spend all of it in a singlesex work camp shes young a lot like alice maybe the last of them to cross the line into rejoo right when she came of age not an old workhorse like me who was already forty when it went generic and now shell be dead in an eye blink but im the one with dead eyes i take my grange and shove it into her forehead you want to die too go ahead do it do it she doesnt stop for a second just keeps howling and spitting fucking bastard bastard fuckingfuckfucking do it do it shes crying even though i want to see her brains pop out the back of her head i dont have the heart shell die soon enough another twenty years and shes done for the paperwork isnt worth it pentle cuffs her while she babbles to the baby in the box just a lump of blood and limp doll parts now my baby my poor baby i didnt know im sorry my baby my poor baby im sorry pentle muscles her out to the car for a while i can hear her in the hall my baby my poor baby my poor baby and then shes gone down the lifts and its a relief just to be standing there with the wet smells of the apartment and the dead body she was using a dresser drawer as her bassinet i run my fingers along the splintered edge fondle the brass pulls if nothing else these ladies are resourceful making the things we cant buy anymore if i close my eyes i can almost remember a whole industry around these little guys little outfits little chairs little beds everything made little little dinosaurs she couldnt make it shut up i jerk my hands away from the baby box startled pentle has come up behind me huh she couldnt make it stop crying didnt know what to do with it didnt know how to make it calm down thats how the neighbors heard dumb yeah she didnt even have a tagteamer how the heck was she going to do grocery shopping he gets out his camera and tries a couple shots of the baby theres not a whole lot left a mm grange is built for junkies nitheads going crazy bot assassins its overkill for an unarmored thing like this when the new granges came out grange ran an ad campaign on the sides of our cruisers grange unstoppable or something like that there was this one that said point blank grange with a photo of a completely mangled nithead that one was in all our lockers pentle tries another angle on the drawer going for a profile trying to make the best of a bad situation i like how she used a drawer he says yeah resourceful i saw this one where the lady made a whole little table and chair set for her kid handmade it all i couldnt believe how much energy she put into it he makes shapes with his hand little scalloped edges shapes painted on the top squares and triangles and things if youre going to die doing something i guess you want to do a good job of it id rather be parasailing or go to a concert i heard alice was great the other night yeah she was i study the babys body as pentle takes some more shots if you had to do it how do you think youd make one of them be quiet pentle nods at my grange id tell it to shut up i grimace and holster the gun sorry about that its been a rough week ive been up too long havent been sleeping too many dinosaurs looking at me pentle shrugs whatever it would have been better to get an intact image he snaps another picture but even if she gets off this time you got to figure in another year or two well be busting down her door again these girls have a damn high recidivism he takes another photo i go to a window and open it salt air flows in like fresh life cleaning out the wet shit and body stinks probably the first fresh air the apartments had since the baby was born got to keep the windows closed or the neighbors might hear got to stay locked in i wonder if shes got a boyfriend some rejoo dropout whos going to show up with groceries and find her gone probably worth staking out the apartment just to see keep the feminists off us for only bagging the women i take a deep breath of sea air to get something fresh in my lungs then light a cigarette and turn back to the room with its clutter and stink recidivism fancy word for girls with a compulsion like a nithead or a coke freak but weirder more selfdestructive at least being a junkie is fun who the hell chooses to live in dark apartments with shitty diapers instant food and no sleep for years on end the whole breeding thing is an anachronism twentyfirstcentury ritual torture we dont need anymore but these girls keep trying to turn back the clock and pop out the pups little lizard brains compelled to pass on some dna and theres a new batch every year little burps of offspring cropping up here and there the convulsions of a species trying to restart itself and get evolution rolling again like we cant tell that weve already won im keying through the directory listings in my cruiser fiddling through ads and keywords and search preferences trying to zero in on something that doesnt come up no matter how i go after it dinosaur toys stuffed animals nothing nobody sells stuff like that dinosaur but ive run into two of them now monkeys scamper over the roof of my car one of them lands on my forward impact rails and looks at me yellow eyes wide before another jumps it and they fall off the carbon petal pullout where im parked somewhere down below suburban crumble keeps small herds of them i remember when this area was tundra it was a long time ago ive talked to techs in the carbon sink business who talk about flipping the climate and building an icecap but its a slow process an accretion of centuries most likely assuming i dont get shot by a crazy mom or a nithead ill see it happen but for now its monkeys and jungle fortyeight hours on call and two more cleanups and alice wants me to take the weekend off and play but i cant im living on perkies now she feels good about her work and wants me all day weve done it before lying together enjoying the silence and our own company the pleasure of just being together with nothing needing to be done theres something wonderful about peace and silence and sea breezes twisting the curtains on the balcony i should go home in a week maybe shell be back at worrying doubting herself thrashing herself to work harder to practice longer to listen and feel and move inside of music thats so complex it might as well be the mathematics of chaos for anyone but her but in reality she has time all the time in the world and it makes me happy that she has it that fifteen years isnt too long to prepare for something as heart stoppingly beautiful as what she did with telogo i want to spend this time with her to enjoy her bliss but i dont want to go back and sleep with that dinosaur i cant i call her from the cruiser alice she looks out at me from the dash are you coming home i could meet you for lunch do you know where maria got that dinosaur toy she shrugs maybe one of the shops on the span why just wondering i pause could you go get it for me why why cant we do something fun im on vacation i just had my rejoo i feel great if you want to see my dinosaur why dont you come home and get it alice please scowling she disappears from the screen in a few minutes shes back holding it up to the screen shoving it in my face i can feel my heart beating faster its cool in the cruiser but i break into a sweat when i see the dinosaur on the screen i clear my throat whats it say on the tag frowning she turns the thing over runs her fingers through its fur she holds up the tag to the camera it comes in blurry as the camera focuses then its there clear and sharp ipswitch collectibles of course not a toy at all the woman who runs ipswitch is old as old a rejoo as ive ever met the wrinkles on her face look so much like plastic that its hard to tell whats real and what may be a mask her eyes are sunken little blue coals and her hair is so white i think of weddings and silk she must have been ninety when rejoo hit whatever the name of it ipswitch collectibles is full of toys dolls staring down from their racks different faces and shapes and colors of hair some of them soft some of them made of hard bright plastics tiny trains that run around miniature tracks and spout steam from their pinkysized smokestacks figurines from oldtime movies and comics in action poses superman dolphina rex mutinous and under a shelf of handcarved wooden cars a bin full of stuffed dinosaurs in green and blue and red a tyrannosaurus rex a pterodactyl the brontosaurus ive got a few stegosauruses in the back i look up startled the old woman watches me from behind the counter a strange wrinkly buzzard studying me with those sharp blue eyes examining me like im carrion i pick out the brontosaurus and hold it up by the neck no thesere fine a bell rings the shops main doors to the concourse slide open a woman steps through hesitant her hair is pulled back in a ponytail and she hasnt applied any makeup and i can tell even before shes all the way through the door that shes one of them a mom she hasnt been off rejoo long she still looks fresh and young despite the plumpness that comes with kids she still looks good but even without rejoocollapse telltales i know what shes done to herself shes got the tired look of a person at war with the world none of us look like that no one has to look like that nitheads look less besieged shes trying to act like the person she was before like the actress or the financial advisor or the code engineer or the biologist or the waitress or whatever putting on clothes from her life before that used to fit perfectly and dont now making herself look like a person who walks without fear in the open air and who doesnt now as she wanders the aisles i spy a stain on her shoulder its small but obvious if you know what to look for a light streak of green on a creamy blouse the kind of thing that never happens to anyone except women with children no matter how hard she tries she doesnt fit anymore not with us ipswitch collectibles like others of its ilk is a trap door of sorts a rabbit hole down into the land of illicit motherhood the place of mashed pea stains soundproofed walls and furtive forays into daylight for resupply and survival if i stand here long enough holding my magic brontosaurus by the neck ill slip through entirely and see their world as it overlaps with my own see it with the queer double vision of these women who have learned to turn a drawer into a crib and know how to fold and pin an old shirt into a diaper and know that collectibles really means toys the woman slips in the direction of the train sets she chooses one and places it on the counter its a bright wooden thing each car a different color each connected by a magnet the old woman takes the train and says oh yes this is a fine piece i had grandchildren who played with trains like this when they were just a little more than one the mother doesnt say anything just holds out her wrist for the charge her eyes down on the train she fingers the blue and yellow engine nervously i come up to the counter ill bet you sell a lot of them the mother jerks for a second she looks like shell run but she steadies the old womans eyes turn on me dark sunken blue cores infinitely knowledgeable not many not now not many collectors around for this sort of thing not now the transaction clears the woman hustles out of the store not looking back i watch her go the old woman says that dinosaur is fortyseven if you want it her tone says that she already knows i wont be buying im not a collector nighttime more darkofnight encounters with illicit motherhood the babies are everywhere popping up like toadstools after rain i cant keep up with them i had to leave my last call before the cleanup crew came broke the chain of evidence but what can you do everywhere i go the baby world is ripping open around me melons and seedpods and fertile wombs splitting open and vomiting babies onto the ground were drowning in babies the jungle seems to seethe with them the hidden women down in the suburb swelter and as i shoot along the maglines on my way to bloody errands the jungles tendril vines curl up from below reaching out to me ive got the moms address in my cruiser shes hidden now back down the rabbit hole pulled the lid down tight over her head lying low with her brood reconnected with the underground of women who have all decided to kill themselves for the sake of squeezing out pups back in the swelter of locked doors and poopy diapers amongst the sorority who give train sets to little creatures who actually play with them instead of putting them on an end table and making you look at them every damn day the woman the collector ive been holding off on hitting her it doesnt seem fair it seems like i should wait for her to make her mistake before i pop her kids but knowing that shes out there tickles my mind i catch myself again and again reaching to key in the homing on her address but then another call comes another cleanup and i let myself pretend i dont know about her that i havent perforated her hideyhole and can now peer in on her whenever i like the woman we dont know about yet who hasnt made a mistake yet instead i barrel down the rails to another call slicing through jungle overstory where it impinges around the tracks blasting toward another womans destiny who was less lucky and less clever than the one who likes to collect and these other women hold me for a little while but in the end parked on the edge of the sea with monkeys screeching from the jungle and rain spackling my windshield i punch in the collectors address ill just drive by it could have been a rich house before carbon sequestration before we all climbed into the bright air of the spires and superclusters but now it exists at the very edge of what is left of suburbs im surprised it even has electric or any services running to it at all the jungle surrounds it envelopes it the road to it off the maglines and off the maintenance routes is heaved and split and perforated with encroaching trees shes smart shes as close to wilderness as it is possible to live beyond is only shadow tangle and green darkness monkeys scamper away from the spray of my headlights the houses around her have already been abandoned any day now theyll stop serving this area entirely in another couple years this portion will be completely overgrown well cut off services and the last of the spires will go online and the jungle will swallow this place completely i sit outside the house for a while looking at it shes a smart one to live this far out no neighbors to hear the screaming but if i think about it she would have been smarter to move into the jungle entirely and live with all the other monkeys that just cant keep themselves from breeding i guess at the end of the day even these crazy ladies are still human they cant leave civilization totally behind or dont know how anyway i get out of my car pull my grange and hit the door as i slam through she looks up from where she sits at her kitchen table she isnt even surprised a little bit of her seems to deflate and thats all like she knew it was going to happen all along like i said a smart one a kid runs in from the other room attracted by the noise of me coming through the door maybe one and a half or two years old it stops and stares little towheaded thing its hair already getting long like hers we stare at each other then it turns and scrambles into its mothers lap the woman closes her eyes go on then do it i point my grange my mm hand cannon zero in on the kid the lady wraps her arms around it its not a clear shot itll rip right through and take out the mom i angle differently looking for the shot nothing she opens her eyes what are you waiting for we stare at each other i saw you in the toy store a couple days ago she closes her eyes again regretful understanding her mistake she doesnt let go of the kid i could just take it out of her arms throw it on the floor and shoot it but i dont her eyes are still closed why do you do it i ask her eyes open again shes confused im breaking the script shes mapped this out in her own mind probably a thousand times had to had to know this day would be coming but here i am all alone and her kids not dead yet and i keep asking her questions why do you keep having these kids she just stares at me the kid squirms around on her and tries to start nursing she lifts her blouse a little and the kid dives under i can see the hanging bulges of the ladys breasts these heavy swinging mammaries so much larger than i remember them from the store when they were hidden under bra and blouse they sag while the kid sucks the woman just stares at me shes on some kind of autopilot feeding the kid last meal i take my hat off and put it on the table and sit i put my grange down too it just doesnt seem right to blow the sucker away while its nursing i take out a cigarette and light it take a drag the woman watches me the way anyone watches a predator i take another drag on my cigarette and offer it to her smoke i dont she jerks her head toward her kid i nod ah right bad for the new lungs i heard that once cant remember where i grin cant remember when she stares at me what are you waiting for i look down at my pistol lying on the table the heavy machine weight of slugs and steel a monster weapon grange mm recoilless hand cannon standard issue stop a nitfitter in his tracks take out the whole damn heart if you hit them right pulverize a baby you had to stop taking rejoo to have the kid right she shrugs its just an additive they dont have to make rejoo that way but otherwise wed have a big damn population problem wouldnt we she shrugs again the gun sits on the table between us her eyes flick toward the gun then to me then back to the gun i take a drag on the cigarette i can tell what shes thinking looking at that big old steel hand cannon on her table its way out of her reach but shes desperate so it looks a lot closer to her almost close enough almost her eyes go back up to me why dont you just do it get it over with its my turn to shrug i dont really have an answer i should be taking pictures and securing her in the car and popping the kid and calling in the cleanup squad but here we sit shes got tears in her eyes i watch her cry mammaries and fatty limbs and a frightening sort of wisdom maybe coming from knowing that she wont last forever a contrast to alice with her smooth smooth skin and high bright breasts this woman is fecund hips and breasts and belly fertile surrounded by her messy kitchen the jungle outside the soil of life she seems settled in all of this a damp gaia creature a dinosaur i should be cuffing her ive got her and her kid i should be shooting the kid but i dont instead ive got a hardon shes not beautiful exactly but ive got a hardon she sags shes round shes breasty and hippy and sloppy i can barely sit because my pants are so tight i try not to stare at the kid nursing at her exposed breasts i take another drag on my cigarette you know ive been doing this job for a long time she stares at me dully doesnt say anything ive always wanted to know why you women do this i nod at the kid its come off her breast and now the whole thing is exposed this huge sagging thing with its heavy nipple she doesnt cover up when i look up shes studying me seeing me looking at her breast the kid scrambles down and watches me too solemneyed i wonder if it can feel the tension in the room if it knows whats coming why the kid really why she purses her lips i think i can see anger in the tightening of her teary eyes anger that im playing with her that im sitting here talking to her with my grange on her grimy table but then her eyes go down to that gun and i can almost see the gears clicking the calculations the shewolf gathering herself she sighs and scoots her chair forward i just wanted one ever since i was a little girl play with dolls all that collectibles she shrugs i guess she pauses eyes back to the gun yeah i guess i did i had a little plastic doll and i used to dress it up and id play tea with it you know wed make tea and then id pour some on her face to make her drink it wasnt a great doll voice input but not much repertoire my parents werent rich lets go shopping okay for what for watches i love watches simple like that but i liked it and then one day i called her my baby i dont know why i did though and the doll said i love you mommy her eyes turn wet as she speaks and i just knew i wanted to have a baby i played with her all the time and shed pretend she was my baby and then my mother caught us doing it and said i was a stupid girl and i shouldnt talk that way girls didnt have babies anymore and she took the doll away the kid is down on the floor shoving blocks under the table stacking and unstacking it catches sight of me its got blue eyes and a shy smile i get a twitch of it again and then it scrambles up off the floor and buries its face in its mothers breasts hiding it peeks out at me and giggles and hides again i nod at the kid whos the dad stone cold face i dont know i got a sample shipped from a guy i found online we didnt want to meet i erased everything about him as soon as i got the sample too bad things would have been better if youd kept in touch better for you thats what i said i notice that the ash on my cigarette has gotten long a thin gray penis hanging limp off the end of my smoke i give it a twitch and it falls i still cant get over the rejoo part inexplicably she laughs brightens even why because im not so in love with myself that i just want to live forever and ever what were you going to do keep it in the house until her she interrupts suddenly keep her in the house she is a girl and her name is melanie at her name the kid looks over at me she sees my hat on the table and grabs it then climbs down off her mothers lap and carries it over to me she holds it out to me arms fully extended an offering i try to take it but she pulls the hat away she wants to put it on your head i look at the lady confused shes smiling slightly sadly its a game she plays she likes to put hats on my head i look at the girl again shes getting antsy holding the hat she makes little grunts of meaning at me and waves the hat invitingly i lean down the girl puts the hat on my head and beams i sit up and set it more firmly youre smiling she says i look up at her shes cute you like her dont you i look at the girl again thinking cant say ive never really looked at them before liar my cigarette is dead i stub it out on the kitchen table she watches me do it frowning pissed off that im messing up her messy table maybe but then she seems to remember the gun and i do too a chill runs up my spine for a moment when i leaned down to the girl id forgotten about it i could be dead right now funny how we forget and remember and forget these things both of us me and the lady one minute were having a conversation the next were waiting for the killing to start this lady seems like she would have been a nice date shes got spunk you can tell that it almost comes out before she remembers the gun you can watch it flicker back and forth shes one person then another person alive thinking remembering then bang shes sitting in a kitchen full of crusty dishes coffee rings on her countertop and a cop with a hand cannon sitting at the kitchen table i spark up another cigarette dont you miss the rejoo she looks down at her daughter holds out her arms no not a bit the girl climbs back onto her mothers lap i let the smoke curl out of my mouth but theres no way you were going to get away with this its insane you have to drop off of rejoo you have to find a sperm donor whos willing to drop off too so two people kill themselves for a kid youve got to birth the kid alone and then youve got to keep it hidden and then youd eventually need an id card so you could get it started on rejoo because nobodys going to dose an undocumented patient and youve got to know that none of this would ever work but here you are she scowls at me i could have done it you didnt bang shes back in the kitchen again she slumps in her chair holding the kid so why dont you just hurry up and do it i shrug i was just curious about what you breeders are thinking she looks at me hard angry you know what im thinking im thinking we need something new ive been alive for one hundred and eighteen years and im thinking that its not just about me im thinking i want a baby and i want to see what she sees today when she wakes up and what shell find and see that ive never seen before because thats new finally something new i love seeing things through her little eyes and not through dead eyes like yours i dont have dead eyes look in the mirror youve all got dead eyes im a hundred and fifty and i feel just as good as i did the day i went on ill bet you cant even remember no one remembers her eyes are on the gun again but they come up off it to look at me but i do now and its better this way a thousand times better than living forever i make a face live through your kid and all that you wouldnt understand none of you would i look away i dont know why im the one with the gun im running everything but shes looking at me and something gets tight inside me when she says that if i was imaginative id say it was some little bit of old primal monkey trying to drag itself out of the muck and make itself heard some bit of the critter we were before i look at the kid the girl and shes looking back at me i wonder if they all do the trick with the hat or if this ones special somehow if they all like to put hats on their killers heads she smiles at me and ducks her head back under her mothers arm the womans got her eyes on my gun you want to shoot me i ask her eyes come up no i smile slightly come on be honest her eyes narrow id blow your head off if i could suddenly im tired i dont care anymore im sick of the dirty kitchen and the dark rooms and the smell of dirty makeshift diapers i give the grange a push shove it closer to her go ahead you going to kill an old life so you can save one that isnt even going to last im going to live forever and that little girl wont last longer than seventy years even if shes lucky which she wont be and youre practically already dead but you want to waste my life i feel like im standing on the edge of a cliff possibility seethes around me give it a shot what do you mean im giving you your shot you want to try for it this is your chance i shove the grange a little closer baiting her im tingling all over my head feels light almost dizzy adrenaline rushes through me i push the grange even closer to her suddenly not even sure if ill fight her for the gun or if ill just let her have it this is your chance she doesnt give a warning she flings herself across the table her kid flies out of her arms her fingers touch the gun at the same time as i yank it out of reach she lunges again clawing across the table i jump back knocking over my chair i step out of range she stretches toward the gun fingers wide and grasping desperate still even though she knows shes already lost i point the gun at her she stares at me then puts her head down on the table and sobs the girl is crying too she sits bawling on the floor her little face screwed up and red crying along with her mother whos given everything in that one run at my gun all her hopes and years of hidden dedication all her need to protect her progeny everything and now she lies sprawled on a dirty table and cries while her daughter howls from the floor the girl keeps screaming and screaming i sight the grange on the girl shes exposed now shes squalling and holding her hands out to her mother but she doesnt get up she just holds out her hands waiting to be picked up and held by a lady who doesnt have anything left to give she doesnt notice me or the gun one quick shot and shes gone paint hole in the forehead and brains on the wall just like spaghetti and the cryings over and all thats left is gunpowder burn and cleanup calls but i dont fire instead i holster my grange and walk out the door leaving them to their crying and their grime and their lives its raining again outside thick ropes of water spout off the eaves and spatter the ground all around me the jungle seethes with the chatter of monkeys i pull up my collar and resettle my hat behind me i can barely hear the crying anymore maybe theyll make it anything is possible maybe the kid will make it to eighteen get some black market rejoo and live to be a hundred and fifty more likely in six months or a year or two years or ten a cop will bust down the door and pop the kid but it wont be me i run for my cruiser splashing through mud and vines and wet and for the first time in a long time the rain feels new auspicious eggs by james morrow james morrow is

apprentice his novella shambling toward hiroshima was a finalist for the hugo nebula and locus awards and won the theodore sturgeon memorial award his short fiction which has appeared the magazine of fantasy science fiction and in many anthologies has been collected in bible stories for adults and the cats pajamas other stories once a year a person gets to celebrate a birthday for children its the best day of the year for most adults its something to pretend to forget or to celebrate with a quiet dinner out after all a birthday only means another year tacked on to an already large number but no matter how old you are a birthday is special because it marks the most important instance in a persons life the moment of their birth in our next story a birthday is hardly anything to celebrate life is as rainy and drear as the climate the united states has been fragmented into a constellation of reefs and islands the rest swallowed up by the rising oceans and a new kind of church has mandated that the lives of those already born are less important than the lives of those who are as yet unconceived here is a place overflowing with babies packed with pregnant women smothered by the stench of dripping diapers its a world where a menopausal woman might be put to death and an infertile baby drowned because those who cant procreate are without value father cornelius dennis monaghan of charlestown parish connie to his friends sets down the styrofoam chalice turns from the corrugated cardboard altar and approaches the two young women standing by the resin baptismal font the font is sixsided and encrusted with saints like a gigantic hex nut forged for some obscure yet holy purpose but its most impressive feature is its portability hardly a month passes in which connie doesnt drive the vessel across town bear it into some wretched hovel and confer immortality on a newborn whose parents have grown too feeble to leave home merribell right asks connie pointing to the baby on his left wedged in the crook of her mothers arm the infant wriggles and howls no madeleine angela mumbles connie has known angela dunfey all her life and he still remembers the seraphic glow that beamed from her face when she first received the sacrament of holy communion today she boasts no such glow her cheeks and brow appear tarnished like iron corroded by the greenhouse deluge and her spine curls with a torsion more commonly seen in women three times her age merribells over here angela raises her free hand and gestures toward her cousin lorna who is balancing madeleines twin sister atop her gravid belly will lorna dunfey connie wonders also give birth to twins the phenomenon he has heard runs in families touching the sleeve of angelas frayed blue sweater the priest addresses her in a voice that travels clear across the nave have these children received the sacrament of reproductive potential assessment the parishioner shifts a nugget of chewing gum from her left cheek to her right yyes she says at last henry shaw the pale altar boy his face abloom with acne hands the priest a parchment sheet stamped with the seal of the boston isle archdiocese a pair of signatures adorns the margin verifying that two ecclesiastical representatives have legitimized the birth connie instantly recognizes the illegible hand of archbishop xallibos below lie the bold loops and assured serifs of a friar james wolfe m d doubtless the man who drew the blood madeleine dunfey connie reads left ovary primordial follicles right ovary primordial follicles a spasm of despair passes through the priest the eggcell count for each organ should be at least its a verdict of infertility no possible appeal no imaginable reprieve with an efficiency bordering on effrontery henry shaw offers connie a second parchment sheet merribell dunfey left ovary primordial follicles right ovary primordial follicles the priest is not surprised what sense would there be in gods withholding the power of procreation from one twin but not the other connie now needs only to receive these barren sisters apply the sacred rites and furtively pray that the eighth lateran council was indeed guided by the holy spirit when it undertook to bring the baptismal process into the age of testable destinies and ovarian surveillance he holds out his hands withered palms up a posture he maintains as angela surrenders madeleine reaches under the babys christening gown and unhooks both diaper pins the mossy odor of fresh urine wafts into the church of the immediate conception sighing profoundly angela hands the sopping diaper to her cousin bless these waters o lord says connie spotting his ancient face in the consecrated fluid that they might grant these sinners the gift of life everlasting turning from the vessel he presents madeleine to his ragged flock over three hundred naturalborn catholics sixthgeneration irish mostly plus a smattering of portuguese italians and croats interspersed with two dozen recent converts of korean and vietnamese extraction a congregation bound together hell admit not so much by religious conviction as by shared destitution dearly beloved forasmuch as all humans enter the world in a state of depravity and forasmuch as they cannot know the grace of our lord except they be born anew of water i beseech you to call upon god the father that through these baptisms madeleine and merribell dunfey may gain the divine kingdom connie faces his trembling parishioner angela dunfey do you believe by gods word that children who are baptized dying before they commit any actual evil will be saved her yes is begrudging and clipped like a scrivener replenishing his pen at an inkwell connie dips his thumb into the font angela dunfey name this child of yours mmmadeleine eileen dunfey we welcome this sinner madeleine eileen dunfey into the mystical body of christ with his wet thumb connie traces a plus sign on the infants foreheadand do mark her with the sign of the cross unraveling madeleine from her christening gown connie fixes on the waters they are preternaturally still as calm and quiet as the sea of galilee after the savior rebuked the winds for many years the priest wondered why christ hadnt returned on the eve of the greenhouse deluge dispersing the hydrocarbon vapors with a wave of his hand ending global warming with a heavenward wink but recently connie has come to feel that divine intervention entails protocols past human ken he contemplates his reflected countenance nothing about it not the tiny eyes thin lips hawks beak of a nose pleases him now he begins the immersion sinking madeleine dunfey to her skullcap her ears cheeks mouth eyes no screams angela as the babys nose goes under mute cries spurt from her lips bubbles inflated with bewilderment and pain madeleine dunfey connie intones holding the infant down i baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost the bubbles break the surface the fluid pours into the infants lungs her silent screams cease but she still puts up a fight no please no a full minute passes marked by the rhythmic shuffling of the congregation and the choked sobs of the mother a second minute a third and finally the body stops moving a mere husk no longer home to madeleine dunfeys indestructible soul no the sacrament of terminal baptism connie knows is rooted in both logic and history even today he can recite verbatim the preamble to the eighth lateran councils pastoral letter on the rights of the unconceived throughout her early years holy mother church tirelessly defended the rights of the born then as the iniquitous institution of abortion spread across western europe and north america she undertook to secure the rights of the unborn now as a new era dawns for the church and her servants she must make even greater efforts to propagate the gift of life everlasting championing the rights of the unconceived through a doctrine of affirmative fertility the subsequent sentence has always given connie pause it stopped him when he was a seminarian it stops him today this council therefore avers that during a period such as that in which we find ourselves when god has elected to discipline our species through a greenhouse deluge and its concomitant privations a society can commit no greater crime against the future than to squander provender on individuals congenitally incapable of procreation quite so indeed and yet connie has never performed a terminal baptism without misgivings he scans the faithful valerie gallogher his nephews zaftig kindergarten teacher seems on the verge of tears keye sung frowns teresa curtoni shudders michael hines moans softly stephen orourke and his wife both wince we give thanks most merciful father connie lifts the corpse from the waterthat it pleases you to regenerate this infant and take her unto your bosom placing the dripping flesh on the altar he leans toward lorna dunfey and lays his palm on merribells brow angela dunfey name this child of yours mmmerribell ssiobhan with a sharp reptilian hiss angela wrests merribell from her cousin and pulls the infant to her breast merribell siobhan dunfey the priest steps forward caressing the wisp of tawny hair sprouting from merribells cranium we welcome this sinner angela whirls around and still sheltering her baby leaps from the podium to the aisle the very aisle down which connie hopes one day to see her parade in prelude to receiving the sacrament of qualified monogamy stop cries connie angela shouts lorna no yells the altar boy for someone who has recently given birth to twins angela is amazingly spry rushing pellmell past the stupefied congregation and straight through the narthex please screams connie but already she is out the door bearing her unsaved daughter into the teeming streets of boston isle at p m eastern standard time stephen orourkes fertility reaches its weekly peak the dial on his wrist tells him so buzzing like a tortured hornet as he scrubs his teeth with baking soda skreee says the sperm counter reminding stephen of his ineluctable duty skreee skreee go find us an egg he pauses in the middle of a brush stroke and without bothering to rinse his mouth strides into the bedroom kate lies on the sagging mattress smoking an unfiltered cigarette as she balances her nightly dose of iced arbutus rum on her stomach baby malcolm cuddles against his mother gums fastened onto her left nipple she stares at the far wall where the cracked and scabrous plaster frames the video monitor its screen displaying the regular sunday night broadcast of keep those kiddies coming archbishop xallibos seated dominates a tv studio appointed like a daycare center stuffed animals changing table brightly colored alphabet letters preschoolers crawl across the prelates falstaffian body sliding down his thighs and swinging from his arms as if he is a piece of playground equipment did you know that a single act of onanism kills up to four hundred million babies in a matter of seconds asks xallibos from the monitor as jesus remarks in the gospel according to saint andrew masturbation is murder stephen coughs i dont suppose youre his wife thrusts her index finger against her pursed lips even when engaged in shutting him out she still looks beautiful to stephen her huge eyes and high cheekbones her elegant swanlike neck shhh please check says stephen swallowing baking soda kate raises her bony wrist and glances at her ovulation gauge not for three days maybe four damn he loves her so dearly he wants her so much no less now than when they received the sacrament of qualified monogamy its fine to have a connubial conversation but when you utterly adore your wife when you crave to comprehend her beyond all others you need to speak in flesh as well will anyone deny that hells hottest quadrant is reserved for those who violate the rights of the unconceived asks xallibos playing peekaboo with a cherubic toddler who will dispute that contraception casual sex and nocturnal emissions place their perpetrators on a oneway cruise to perdition honey i have to ask you something says stephen shhh that young woman at mass this morning the one who ran away she went crazy because it was twins kate slurps down her remaining rum the ice fragments clink against each other if itd been just the one she probably couldve coped well yes of course says stephen gesturing toward baby malcolm but suppose one of your newborns heaven is forever stephen says kate filling her mouth with ice and hell is just as long she chews her molars grinding the ice dribbles of rumtinted water spill from her lips youd better get to church farewell friends says xallibos as the theme music swells he dandles a korean threeyearold on his knee and keep those kiddies coming the path to the front door takes stephen through the cramped and fetid living room functionally the nursery all is quiet all is well the fourteen children one for every other year of kates postpubescence sleep soundly nineyearold roger is quite likely his product of the time stephen and kate got their cycles in synch the boy boasts stephens curly blond hair and riveting green eyes difficult as it is stephen refuses to accord roger any special treatment no private trips to the frog pond no second candy cane at christmas a good stepfather didnt indulge in favoritism stephen pulls on his mended galoshes fingerless gloves and torn pea jacket ambling out of the apartment he joins the knot of morose pedestrians as they shuffle along winthrop street a fog descends a steady rain falls reverberations from the deluge pushed by expectant mothers dozens of shabby blackhooded baby buggies squeak mournfully down the asphalt the sidewalks belong to adolescent girls gang after gang gossiping among themselves and stomping on puddles as they show off their pregnancies like olympic medals besmirched by two decades of wind and drizzle a limestone madonna stands outside the church of the immediate conception her expression lies somewhere between a smile and a smirk stephen climbs the steps enters the narthex removes his gloves and dipping his fingertips into the nearest font decorates the air with the sign of the cross every city stephen teaches his students at cardinal dougherty high school boasts its own personality extroverted rio pessimistic prague paranoid new york and boston isle what sort of psyche inhabits the hub and its surrounding reefs schizoid stephen tells them split the boston that battled slavery and stoked the fires beneath the american melting pot was the same boston that massacred the pequots and sent witchfinders to salem but here now which side of the city is emergent the bright one stephen decides picturing the hundreds of heavenbound souls who each day exit bostons innumerable wombs flowing forth like the bubbles that so recently streamed from madeleine dunfeys lips blessing the virgins name he descends the concrete stairs to the copulatorium a hundred votive candles pierce the darkness the briny scent of incipient immortality suffuses the air in the far corner a cd player screeches out the apostolic succession doing their famous rendition of ave maria the sacrament of extramarital intercourse has always reminded stephen of a junior high prom girls strung along one side of the room boys along the other gyrating couples in the center he takes his place in the line of males removes his jacket shirt trousers and underclothes and hangs them on the nearest pegs he stares through the gloom locking eyes with rogers old kindergarten teacher valerie gallogher a robust thirtyish woman whose incandescent red hair spills all the way to her hips grimly they saunter toward each other following the pathway formed by the mattresses until they meet amid the morass of writhing soulmakers youre roger mulcannys stepfather arent you asks the ovulating teacher father quite possibly stephen orourke and youre miss gallogher right call me valerie stephen he glances around noting to his infinite relief that he recognizes no one sooner or later he knows a familiar young face will appear at the copulatorium a notion that never fails to make him wince how could he possibly explicate the boston massacre to a boy whod recently beheld him in the procreative act how could he render the battle of lexington lucid to a girl whose egg hed attempted to quicken on the previous night for ten minutes he and valerie make small talk most of it issuing from stephen as was proper should the coming sacrament prove fruitful the resultant child will want to know about the handful of men with whom his mother connected during the relevant ovulation beatrice claude tommy laura yolanda willy and the others were forever grilling kate for facts about their possible progenitors stephen tells valerie about the time his students gave him a surprise birthday party he describes his rock collection he mentions his skill at trapping the singularly elusive species of rat that inhabits charlestown parish i have a talent too says valerie inserting a coppery braid into her mouth her areolas seem to be staring at him roger thought you were a terrific teacher no something else valerie tugs absently on her ovulation gauge a person twitches his lips a certain way and i know what hes feeling he darts his eyes in an odd manner i sense the drift of his thoughts she lowers her voice i watched you during the baptism this morning your reaction wouldve angered the archbishop am i right stephen looks at his bare toes odd that a copulatorium partner should be demanding such intimacy of him am i valerie persists sliding her index finger along her large concave bellybutton fear rushes through stephen does this woman work for the immortality corps if his answer smacks of heresy will she arrest him on the spot well stephen would the archbishop have been angry perhaps he confesses in his mind he sees madeleine dunfeys submerged mouth bubble following bubble like beads strung along a rosary theres no microphone in my navel valerie asserts alluding to a common immortality corps ploy im not a spy never said you were you were thinking it i could tell by the cant of your eyebrows she kisses him on the mouth deeply wetly did roger ever learn to hold his pencil correctly fraid not too bad at last the mattress to stephens left becomes free and they climb on top and begin reifying the doctrine of affirmative fertility the candle flames look like spear points stephen closes his eyes but the effect is merely to intensify the fact that hes here the liquid squeal of flesh against flesh grows louder the odor of hot paraffin and warm semen more pungent for a few seconds he manages to convince himself that the woman beneath him is kate but the illusion proves as tenuous as the surrounding wax when the sacrament is accomplished valerie says i have something for you a gift whats the occasion saint patricks day is less than a week away since when is that a time for gifts instead of answering she strolls to her side of the room rummages through her tangled garments and returns holding a pressed flower sealed in plastic think of it as a ticket she whispers lifting stephens shirt from its peg and slipping the blossom inside the pocket to where valerie holds an erect index finger to her lips well know when we get there stephen gulps audibly sweat collects beneath his sperm counter only fools considered fleeing boston isle only lunatics risked the retributions meted out by the corps displayed every sunday night on keep those kiddies coming the classic images men submitting to sperm siphons women locked in the rapacious embrace of artificial inseminators haunt every parishioners imagination instilling the same levels of dread as spinellis sculpture of the archangel chamuel strangling david hume there are rumors of course unconfirmable accounts of parishioners whod outmaneuvered the patrol boats and escaped to québec cay seattle reef or the texas archipelago but to credit such tales was itself a kind of sin jeopardizing your slot in paradise as surely as if youd denied the unconceived their rights tell me something stephen valerie straps herself into her bra youre a history teacher did saint patrick really drive the snakes out of ireland or is that just a legend im sure it never happened literally says stephen i suppose it could be true in some mythic sense its about penises isnt it says valerie dissolving into the darkness its about how our saints have always been hostile to cocks although harbor authority tower was designed to house the merchantshipping aristocracy on whose ambitions the decrepit boston economy still depended the buildings form connie now realizes perfectly fits its new supplemental function sheltering the offices courts and archives of the archdiocese as he lifts his gaze along the soaring facade connie thinks of sacred shapes of steeples and vaulted windows of sinai and zion of jacobs ladder and hands pressed together in prayer perhaps its all as god wants he muses flashing his ecclesiastical pass to the guard perhaps theres nothing wrong with commerce and grace being transacted within the same walls connie has seen archbishop xallibos in person only once before five years earlier when the stately prelate appeared as an honorary irishman in charlestown parishs annual saint patricks day parade standing on the sidewalk connie observed xallibos gliding down lynde street atop a huge motorized shamrock the archbishop looked impressive then and he looks impressive now six foot four at least connie calculates and not an ounce under three hundred pounds his eyes are as red as a lab rats father cornelius dennis monaghan the priest begins following the custom whereby a visitor to an archbishops chambers initiates the interview by naming himself come forward father cornelius dennis monaghan connie starts into the office boots clacking on the polished bronze floor xallibos steps out from behind his desk a glistery cube hewn from black marble charlestown parish holds a special place in my affections says the archbishop what brings you to this part of town connie fidgets shifting first left then right until his face lies mirrored in the hubcapsize saint cyril medallion adorning xalliboss chest my soul is in torment your grace torment weighty word i can find no other last tuesday i laid a twoweekold infant to rest terminal baptism connie ponders his reflection it is wrinkled and deflated like a helium balloon purchased at a carnival long gone my eighth i know how you feel after i dispatched my first infertile no left testicle right one shriveled beyond repair i got no sleep for a week eyes glowing like molten rubies xallibos gazes directly at connie where did you attend seminary isle of denver and on the isle of denver did they teach you that there are in fact two churches one invisible and eternal the other temporal and finite then they also taught you that the latter church is empowered to revise its rites according to the imperatives of the age the archbishops stare grows brighter hotter purer do you doubt that present privations compel us to arrange early immortality for those who cannot secure the rights of the unconceived the problem is that the infant i immortalized has a twin connie swallows nervously her mother stole her away before i could perform the second baptism stole her away she fled in the middle of the sacrament and the second child is likewise arid left ovary two hundred ninety primordials right ovary three hundred ten lord a high whistle issues from the archbishop like water vapor escaping a tea kettle does she intend to quit the island i certainly hope not your grace says the priest wincing at the thought she probably has no immediate plans beyond protecting her baby and trying to connie cuts himself off intimidated by the sudden arrival of a rolypoly man in a white hooded robe friar james wolfe m d says the monk come forward friar doctor james wolfe says xallibos it would be well if you validated this posthaste james wolfe draws a parchment sheet from his robe and lays it on the archbishops desk connie steals a glance at the report hoping to learn the babys fertility quotient but the relevant statistics are too faint the priest in question hes celebrating mass in sliding a loose sleeve upward james wolfe consults his wristwatchless than an hour hes all the way over in brookline striding back to his desk the archbishop yanks a silver fountain pen from its holder and decorates the parchment with his famous spidery signature dominus vobiscum friar doctor wolfe he says handing over the document as wolfe rushes out of the office xallibos steps so close to connie that his nostrils fill with the archbishops lemonscented aftershave lotion that man never has any fun says xallibos pointing toward the vanishing friar what fun do you have father monaghan fun your grace do you eat ice cream follow the fortunes of the celtics he pronounces celtics with the hard c mandated by the seventh lateran council connie inhales a hearty quantity of citrus fumes i bake bake bake what bread cookies your grace brownies cheesecake pies for the feast of the nativity i make gingerbread magi wonderful i like my priests to have fun listen no matter what the rite must be performed if angela dunfey wont come to you then you must go to her shell simply run away again perhaps so perhaps not i have great faith in you father cornelius dennis monaghan more than i have in myself says the priest biting his inner cheeks so hard that his eyes fill with tears no says kate for the third time that night yes insists stephen savoring the dual satisfactions of kates thigh beneath his palm and arbutus rum washing through his brain pinching her cigarette in one hand kate strokes baby malcolms forehead with the other lulling him to sleep its wicked she protests placing malcolm on the rug beside the bed a crime against the future stephen grabs the arbutus bottle pours himself another glass and adding a measure of dr pepper takes a greedy gulp he sets the bottle back on the nightstand next to valerie galloghers enigmatic flower screw the unconceived he says throwing himself atop his wife on friday hed shown the blossom to gail whittington dougherty high schools smartest science teacher but her verdict had proved unenlightening epigaea repens trailing arbutus a species with at least two claims to fame it is the state flower of the massachusetts archipelago and it has lent its name to the very brand of alcohol stephen now consumes no says kate once again she drops her cigarette on the floor crushes it with her shoe and wraps her arms around him im not ovulating she avers forcing her stiff and slippery tongue into the depths of his mouth your sperm arent last night the holy father received a vision xallibos announces from the video monitor pictures straight from satans flaming domain hell is a fact friends its as real as a stubbed toe stephen whips off kates chemise with all the dexterity of father monaghan removing a christening gown the rum of course has much to do with their mutual willingness four glasses each only mildly diluted with dr pepper but beyond the arbutus the two of them have truly earned this moment neither has ever skipped mass neither has ever missed a sacrament of extramarital intercourse and while any act of nonconceptual love technically lay beyond the churchs powers of absolution surely christ would forgive them a solitary lapse and so they go at it this sterile union this forbidden fruitlessness this coupling from which no soul can come hedonists dissolving in vats of molten sulfur says xallibos the bedroom door squeals open one of kates middle children beatrice a gaunt sixyearold with flaking skin enters holding a rude toy boat whittled from a hunk of bark look what i made in school yesterday were busy says kate pulling the tattered muslin sheet over her nakedness do you like my boat stephen asks beatrice he slams a pillow atop his groin lovely dear go back to bed kate commands her daughter onanists drowning in lakes of boiling semen says xallibos beatrice fixes stephen with her receding eyes can we sail it tomorrow on parsons pond certainly of course please go away just you and me right stephen not claude or tommy or yolanda or anybody flaying machines says xallibos peeling the damned like ripe bananas do you want a spanking seethes kate thats exactly what youre going to get young lady the worst spanking of your whole life the child issues an elaborate shrug and strides off in a huff i love you says stephen removing the pillow from his privates like a chef lifting the lid from a stew pot again they press together throwing all they have into it every limb and gland and orifice no holds barred no positions banned unpardonable kate groans unpardonable stephen agrees hes never been so excited his entire body is an appendage to his loins well be damned she says forever he echoes kiss me she commands farewell friends says xallibos and keep those kiddies coming wrestling the baptismal font from the trunk of his car connie ponders the vessels resemblance to a birdbath a place he muses for pious sparrows to accomplish their avian ablutions as he sets the vessel on his shoulder and starts away its edges digging into his flesh a different metaphor suggests itself but if the font is connies cross and constitution road his via dolorosa where does that leave his upcoming mission to angela dunfey is he about to perform some mysterious act of vicarious atonement morning father he slips the font from his shoulder standing it up upright beside a fire hydrant his parishioner valerie gallogher weaves amid the mob dressed in a threadbare woolen parka far to go she asks brightly end of the block want help i need the exercise valerie extends her arm and they shake hands mitten clinging to mitten made any special plans for saint patricks day im going to bake shamrock cookies green cant afford food coloring i think ive got some green youre welcome to it whos at the end of the block angela dunfey a shadow flits across valeries face and her daughter yes moans connie his throat constricts her daughter valerie lays a sympathetic hand on his arm if i dont have green we can probably fake it oh valerie valerie i wish id never taken holy orders well mix yellow with orange im sorry father i wish this cup would pass i mean yellow with blue connie loops his arms around the font embracing it as he might a frightened child stay with me together they walk through the serrated march air and reaching the warren avenue intersection enter the tumbledown pile of bricks labeled no the foyer is as dim as a crypt switching on his penlight connie holds it aloft until he discerns the label angela dunfey glued to a dented mailbox he begins the climb to apartment c his parishioner right behind on the third landing connie stops to catch his breath on the sixth he puts down the font valerie wipes his brow with her parka sleeve she takes up the font and the two of them resume their ascent angela dunfeys door is wormy cracked and hanging by one hinge the mere act of knocking swings it open they find themselves in the kitchen a small musty space that would have felt claustrophobic were it not so sparely furnished a saucepan hangs over the stove a frying pan sits atop the icebox the floor is a mottle of splinters tar paper and leprous shards of linoleum valerie sets the font next to the sink the basin in which angela dunfey washes her dishes connie notes is actually smaller than the one in which the church of the immediate conception immortalizes infertiles he tiptoes into the bedroom his parishioner sleeps soundly her terrycloth bathrobe parted down the middle to accommodate her groggy nursing infant milk trickles from her breasts streaking her belly with white rivulets he must move now quickly and deliberately so therell be no struggle no melodramatic replay of kings the desperate whore trying to tear her baby away from solomons swordsman inhaling slowly connie leans toward the mattress and with the dexterity of a weasel extracting the innards from an eggshell slides the barren baby free and carries her into the kitchen beside the icebox valerie sits glowering on a wobbly threelegged stool dearly beloved forasmuch as all humans enter the world in a state of depravity connie whispers casting a wary eye on valerie and forasmuch as they cannot know the grace of our lord except they be born anew of water he places the infant on the floor near valeries feeti beseech you to call upon god the father that through this baptism merribell dunfey may gain the divine kingdom dont beseech me snaps valerie connie fills the saucepan dumps the water into the font and returns to the sink for another load not exactly holy water he muses not remotely chrism but presumably not typhoidal either the best the underbudgeted boston water authority has to offer he deposits the load then fetches another a wide milky yawn twists merribells face but she does not cry out at last the vessel is ready bless these waters o lord that they might grant this sinner the gift of life everlasting dropping to his knees connie begins removing the infants diaper the first pin comes out easily as he pops the second the tip catches the ball of his thumb crown of thorns he decides feeling the sting seeing the blood he bears the naked infant to the font wetting his punctured thumb he touches merribells brow and draws the sacred plus sign with a mixture of blood and water we receive this sinner unto the mystical body of christ and do mark her with the sign of the cross he begins the immersion skullcap ears cheeks mouth eyes o lord what a monstrous trust this power to underwrite a persons soul merribell dunfey i baptize you in the name of the father now comes the nausea excavating stephens alimentary canal as he kneels before the porcelain toilet bowl his guilt pours forth in a searing flood acidic strands of cabbage caustic lumps of potato glutinous strings of bile yet these pains are nothing he knows compared with what hell experience on passing from this world to the next drained he stumbles toward the bedroom somehow kate has bundled the older children off to school before collapsing on the floor alongside the baby she shivers with remorse shrieks and giggles pour from the nursery the preschoolers engaged in a raucous game of blind mans bluff flaying machines she mutters her tone is beaten bloodless she lights a cigarette peeling the damned like will more rum help stephen wonders or merely make them sicker he extends his arm passing over the nightstand his fingers touch a box of aspirin brush the preserved epigaea repens and curl around the neck of the halffull arbutus bottle a ruddy cockroach scurries across the doily i kept willy home today says kate taking a drag he says his stomach hurts as he raises the bottle stephen realizes for the first time that the label contains a block of type headed the story of trailing arbutus his stomach always hurts he studies the breezy little paragraph i think hes telling the truth epigaea repens trailing arbutus mayflower and suddenly everything is clear whats todays date asks stephen sixteenth march sixteenth yeah then tomorrows saint patricks day so what tomorrows saint patricks day like an auctioneer accepting a final bid stephen slams the bottle onto the nightstandand valerie gallogher will be leaving boston isle rogers old teacher leaving leaving snatching up the preserved flower he dangles it before his wife leaving and of the son says connie raising the sputtering infant from the water and of the holy ghost merribell dunfey screeches and squirms shes slippery as a bar of soap connie manages to wrap her in a dish towel and shove her into valeries arms let me tell you who you are she says father cornelius dennis monaghan of charlestown parish youre a tired and bewildered pilgrim father youre a weary wayfarer like myself dribbling milk angela dunfey staggers into the kitchen seeing her priest she recoils her mouth flies open and a howl rushes out a cry such as connie imagines the damned spew forth while rotating on the spits of perdition not her too not merribell no your babys all right says valerie connie clasps his hands together fingers knotted in agony and supplication he stoops his knees hit the floor crashing against the fractured linoleum please he groans angela plucks merribell from valerie and affixes the squalling baby to her nipple oh merribell merribell please connies voice is hoarse and jagged as if hes been shot in the larynx please please he beseeches tears roll from his eyes tickling his cheeks as they fall its not her job to absolve you says valerie connie snuffles the mucus back into his nose i know the boat leaves tomorrow boat connie runs his sleeve across his face blotting his tears a rescue vessel his parishioner explains sliding her hands beneath his armpits she raises him inch by inch to his feet rather like noahs ark mommy i want to go home tell that to your stepfather its cold i know sweetheart and dark try to be patient mommy my stomach hurts im sorry my head too you want an aspirin i want to go home is this a mistake wonders stephen shouldnt they should all be in bed right now instead of tromping around in this nocturnal mist risking flu and possibly pneumonia and yet he has faith somewhere in the labyrinthine reaches of the hoosac docks amid the tang of salt air and the stink of rotting cod a ship awaits guiding his wife and stepchildren down pier he studies the possibilities the scows and barges the tugs and trawlers the reefers and bulk carriers gulls and gannets hover above the wharfs squawking their chronic disapproval of the world across the channel lit by a sodiumvapor searchlight the u s constitution bobs in her customary berth beside charlestown navy yard whatre we doing here anyway asks beatrice your stepfather gets these notions in his head kate presses the baby tight against her chest shielding him from the sea breeze whats the name of the boat asks roger mayflower answers stephen epigaea repens trailing arbutus mayflower how do you spell it roger demands may flower good job roger says stephen i read it the boy explains indignantly pointing straight ahead with the collective fingers of his right mitten fifty yards away moored between an oil tanker and a bait shack a battered freighter rides the incoming tide her stern displays a single word mayflower a name that to the inhabitants of boston isle means far more than the sum of its letters now can we go home asks roger no says stephen he has taught the story countless times the separatists departure from england for virginia their hazardous voyage their unplanned landing on plymouth rock the signing of the covenant whereby the nonseparatists on board agreed to obey whatever rules the separatists imposed now we can go on a nice long voyage on that thing asks willy youre not serious says laura not me says claude forget it says yolanda sayonara says tommy i think im going to throw up says beatrice its not your decision stephen tells his stepchildren he stares at the ships hull blotched with rust blistered with decay another victim of the deluge a passenger whom he recognizes as his neighbor michael hines leans out a porthole like a prairie dog peering from its burrow until further notice i make all the rules half by entreaty half by coercion he leads his disgruntled family up the gangplank and onto the quarterdeck where a squat man in an orange raincoat and a maroon watch cap demands to see their ticket happy saint patricks day says stephen flourishing the preserved blossom were putting you people on the focsle deck the man yells above the growl of the idling engines you can hide behind the pianos at ten oclock you get a bran muffin and a cup of coffee as stephen guides his stepchildren in a single file up the forward ladder the crew of the mayflower reels in the mooring lines and ravels up the anchor chains setting her adrift the engines kick in smoke pours from the freighters twin stacks sunlight seeps across the bay tinting the eastern sky hot pink and making the islands manywindowed towers glitter like christmas trees a sleek immortality corps cutter glides by headed for the wharfs evidently unaware that enemies of the unconceived lie close at hand slowly cautiously stephen negotiates the maze of wooden crates it seems as if every piano on boston isle is being exported today until he reaches the starboard bulwark as he curls his palm around the rail the mayflower cruises past the mystic shoals maneuvering amid the rocks like a skier following a slalom course hello stephen a large woman lurches into view abruptly kissing his cheek he gulps blinking like a man emerging into sunlight from the darkness of a copulatorium valerie galloghers presence on the mayflower doesnt surprise him but hes taken aback by her companions angela dunfey suckling little merribell her cousin lorna still spectacularly pregnant and most shocking of all father monaghan leaning his frail frame against his baptismal font stephen says did we are you my blood has spoken valerie gallogher replies her red hair flying like a pennant in nine months i give birth to our child whereupon the sky above stephens head begins swarming with tiny black birds no not birds he realizes devices ovulation gauges sail through the air a dozen at first then scores then hundreds immediately pursued by equal numbers of sperm counters as the little machines splash down and sink darkening the harbor like the contraband tea from an earlier moment in the history of boston insurgency a muffled but impassioned cheer arises among the stowaways hello father monaghan stephen unstraps his sperm counter didnt expect to find you here the priest smiles feebly drumming his fingers on the lip of the font valerie informs me youre about to become a father again congratulations my instincts tell me its a boy says stephen leaning over the rail hes going to get a second candy cane at christmasasserts the bewildered pilgrim as with a wan smile and a sudden flick of his wrist he breaks his bondage to the future if i dont act now thinks connie as he pivots toward valerie gallogher ill never find the courage again do we have a destination he asks like a bear preparing to ascend a tree he hugs the font pulling it against his chest only a purposevalerie replies sweeping her hand across the horizon we wont find any edens out there father the entire baltimore reef has become a wriggling mass of flesh newborns stretching shore to shore she removes her ovulation gauge and throws it over the side in the minneapolis keys the corps routinely casts homosexual men and menopausal women into the sea on the california archipelago male parishioners receive periodic potency tests and the atlanta insularity a nightmare miami isle forget it connie lays the font on the bulwark then clambers onto the rail straddling it like a child riding a seesaw a loop of heavyduty chain encircles the font the steel links flashing in the rising sun then whats our course east says valerie toward europe what are you doing east connie echoes tipping the font seaward europe a muffled liquid crash reverberates across the harbor the font disappears dragging the chain behind it father drawing in a deep breath connie studies the chain the spiral of links unwinds quickly and smoothly like a coiled rattlesnake striking its prey the slack vanishes connie feels the iron shackle seize his ankle he flips over he falls bless these waters o lord that they might grant this sinner the gift of life everlasting father he plunges into the harbor penetrating its cold hard surface an experience he decides not unlike throwing oneself through a plate glass window the waters envelop him filling his ears and stinging his eyes we welcome this sinner into the mystical body of christ and do mark him with the sign of the cross connie recites in his mind reaching up and drawing the sacred plus sign on his forehead he exhales bubble following bubble cornelius dennis monaghan i baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost he concludes and as the black wind sweeps through his brain sucking him toward immortality he knows that hes never been happier peter skilling by alex irvine alex irvine a k a alexander c

forty stories published since making his debut in his short work which frequently appears in the magazine of fantasy science fiction has been collected in unintended consequences pictures from an expedition and in a fourstory chapbook rossetti song since the late s conservative christians have united their voices to take an active and highly visible role in the american political sphere it is an interesting development in a nation founded on the separation of church and state and one that provides fodder for a great deal of speculation even science fiction writers sometimes wonder what would the united states be like if current trends in conservatism and religiosity continue our next story spins just such a future world a world that has taken a significantly dark tone this united states is a surveillance state bristling with rules and rigid strictures within such a complicated framework it would take years to learn all the right things to do or say years peter skilling never had hes awakened ninetyeight years after his own death a stranger in his own homeland medical science has given him a second chance at life but living it just might be beyond his grasp here is a new dystopian america thomas jefferson would be glad they cant bring him back to live in it peter skilling did not remember falling into a glacial crevasse on the north slope of mount mckinley so it came as a surprise to him when he awoke to find what appeared to be a robot sitting next to his bed youre a very lucky man peter skilling the robot said to him a genuinely unique set of circumstances you might have sustained fatal trauma from your fall but look you fell into a subglacial stream resulting in scrapes and bruises only and you might have been ground to gel by the glacier but for the earthquake that struck hours after your death and sheared away a portion of the mountain leaving your body exposed in a depression away from the redirected glacier then too consider the aboveaverage snowfall that encased your remains and protected you from the depredations of weather and wildlife my remains peter croaked noting the dryness of his throat the robot moved swiftly to unspool a thin hose from the wall and placed its nipple in peters mouth reflexively peter sucked and his mouth filled with cool water this is the truly amazing chapter in your saga mr skilling the robot gushed you died so quickly and in such cold water that if youll permit me an inorganic figure of speech your autonomic system shorted out your brain function is astonishingly well preserved and we have been able to surgically reconstruct damaged pathways you were our perfect candidate quite a find if i do say so myself the robot paused do you consider yourself sufficiently apprised of the fortuitous circumstances in which you find yourself peter hadnt caught much of the robots effusion but he gathered that hed been in an accident on the mountain and survived that seemed lucky i guess he said very good the robot said it extended a hand and peter shook the robots hand was warm i am called burkhardt the robot said i wish you all the very best it left and peter noticed a woman in a white coat who had apparently been waiting near the door while the robot burkhardt had told peter how lucky he was she stepped forward and smiled at him im dr mcbride she said i hope the steelie didnt overload you we have to observe protocols as part of our grant mechanism and its easier to have robots take care of them than entrust the process to people okay peter said why dont you sit up dr mcbride suggested i think youll find everythings in working order peter sat up surfed a brief wave of dizziness and discovered that he did feel pretty good yeah he said i feel okay so why am i in the hospital dr mcbride looked annoyed yes i thought maybe burkhardt had rushed a little these federal programs you know not that im criticizing it would be much more difficult to address everything on a casebycase basis when we dont have access to all the intelligence but its only natural although she still looked in his direction the doctor was no longer talking to peter he took another drink from the wall nipple dr mcbride looked up at him and smiled again apologetically this time im sorry mr skilling she said i havent answered your question peter raised an eyebrow and sucked at the nipple you see you died in weve spent the past several months working you through the rejuvenation process and i have to say its gone very well the nipple fell out of peters mouth and a little water dribbled down his chin dr mcbrides smile regained some of its strength theres no way to cushion itshe said although god knows burkhardt tries youve been dead for ninetyeight years and now you have another chance to live her gaze shifted to a monitor by peters head mm she said i was afraid of that crossing to the monitor dr mcbride opened a drawer and removed a shiny instrument peter couldnt breathe he tried to speak and a breathy whine came out of his mouth ive going to give you something that will alleviate your shock response dr mcbride said peter heard a hiss and then he was gone when he woke up the robot was there again peter felt worse than he had the first time hed opened his eyes in that room dont give me another shot he said oh i dont administer medication burkhardt said airily fascinating colloquialism shotbit anachronistic now we do transdermals now of course except when intravenous administration is indicated but im not here to go on about our medical procedures youre a healthy man you dont care about this i do need to apologize for yesterday it seems i moved a little too quickly for circumstances and dr mcbride burkhardt trailed off she was terribly inappropriate and unprofessional to say some of the things she said given the fragility of your condition trust me when i say that you wont have to deal with her anymore sometime during its apology peter remembered what shed said to him are you serious that i was dead he asked having slept on the idea even if the sleep was druginduced made it easier to grapple with burkhardt cocked its head to one side oh yes perfectly serious my function here is to ensure that your assimilation process is maximally efficient there is significant state interest in making certain that you come to terms with the reality of your surroundings yours is truly an exceptional situation i can certainly sympathize with your feelings of loss and displacement but do not neglect gratitude you have benefited from the most advanced and powerful science the world has ever known you can peter asked sympathize ha ha burkhardt said not in an emotional sense no but my simulations of emotional interaction are considered very sophisticated i belong to the only class of artificial intelligences whose testimony is admissible in court peter could have sworn that it sounded proud he considered what burkhardt had said about loss and displacement pretty soon he figured hed feel both but right then he was letting himself be caught up in the puzzle of how hed come to be talking to a robot that seemed to have been programmed by a selfhelp guru chicken soup for the future resurrected this is ridiculous he said he tossed back the blanket and swung his legs over the side of the bed the floor felt good under his feet delightful burkhardt said it actually clapped or clanked marvelous youre making tremendous progress peter needed a moment to get blood to his head then he stood he was wearing light blue hospital pajamas and when he ran his hands over his scalp he found that his hair had been cut that brought on the first tremor of dislocation someone had cut his hair okay burkhardt he said forcing himself to focus on what was in front of him where am i bremerton washington burkhardt said youre kidding peter had grown up in kirkland just across puget sound ninetyeight years he wondered what seattle looked like a powerful surge of optimism overcame him he was alive and burkhardt was right that he was lucky especially in that he hadnt had any family left when hed apparently died i died he said testing it out he had no memory of it and was unaffected by the idea so this isnt heaven my goodness no this is still the world of the flesh you dont seriously think you might be in heaven no peter said he chuckled my idea of heaven wouldnt be a hospital room what would it be burkhardts amazing cheer seemed to have gone on hiatus am i supposed to have a theological discussion with a robot peter asked part of my assessment must include the state of your beliefs burkhardt said given the blessing youve received it occurred to me that you might be thankful blessing what are you a robot priest the cutting edge of robotics if im not being too immodest in characterizing myself in such a manner is conducted in affiliation with the office of faithbased investigation we are all products of our upbringing arent we ha ha now please back to my question are you thankful sure but thank the doctors ive never been much of a religious guy i see burkhardt said well it so happens that this project is centered on the grounds of what was once the naval shipyard here the primary strength of the american military is now orbitally based so the facilities here were reconditioned some years ago there is another similar facility in our siberian protectorate but we thought it best to keep you close to home siberian protectorate peter let it pass a lot could happen in ninetyeight years okay he said can i get some clothes i want to get out and see this brave new world burkhardts face was a single textured piece of metal but peter could have sworn the robot grimaced thats an unfortunate choice of words peter we can certainly get you dressed in fact theres clothing tailored to you in the closet there but we think its better for you to stay on the grounds for a while what for am i sick im reaching my functional parameters here peter you seem to be adapting remarkably well to what must be an enormously wrenching turn of events please stay here feel free to get dressed im going to hand you off to one of the staff who will get you settled in here burkhardt extended a hand just as it had the last time and just as he had the last time peter shook the robot left and a bubble of fear rose up and broke in peters mind he closed his eyes and gathered himself okay things would be different he would have to cope but it would be like he was an immigrant to another country where people spoke the same language but lived in an entirely different way difficult but doable peter opened the closet door and found a suit of clothes that wouldnt have looked out of place in church the last time hed gone to church which was sometime in the s at his college roommates wedding it fit perfectly and so did the shoes a pair of spats came with the shoes peter looked them over and decided that his willingness to assimilate only went so far alone and awake he had a chance to really look around the room for the first time there was no window no tv did people still watch tv he couldnt imagine they didnt it would be weird if the hardest thing about blending into the year was the lack of television the number didnt mean anything to peter when it came right down to it he had to admit that he didnt quite believe it yet the alternative was that he was hallucinating but there he was in a room painted pale green with a bed and a monitor and a chair in the corner and a little tube that came out of the wall surely he had enough imagination to hallucinate something better than this the door opened and an orderly came in with a tray up and around the orderly said looking good he was tall and ropy with muscle hair in a crew cut peters first instinct was that the guy was military i feel okay he said the orderly set the tray on his bed and left peter removed the cover baked chicken muffin vegetables a plastic bottle of juice he sat down and ate getting progressively hungrier as he demolished the meal until by the time he was finished he wanted to start all over again there was nothing visible that looked like a call button peter looked at the monitor saw that it was tracking his vital signs even though he wasnt connected to it he hadnt seen any kind of contact patches when hed changed into the suit and it wasnt clear how the monitor could get a close reading on him was there some kind of camera system that could track all of his vitals he looked around the room and didnt see one then again dr mcbride had been talking to someone the day before peter went to the door and tried it it was locked he banged on it and it opened almost immediately the orderly stood in the doorway are you comfortable he asked am i under surveillance in here peter asked a disbelieving expression swept across the orderlys face surveillance is routine he said it presupposes nothing about guilt or innocence do you need anything id like to get out of this room for a while get some fresh air a tour is being arranged mr skilling you will be contacted when arrangements are complete the orderly shut the door peter got mad he banged on the door again the orderly opened it if youre going to bullshit me peter said you could at least remove my tray your language is objectionable the orderly said but he came in and took the tray without a clock in the room he had no way of knowing how much time passed before the door opened again and three people came in make that two people and a robot burkhardt stood behind the orderly and a woman peter hadnt seen before mr skilling she said are you my new doctor no im here to take you outside and answer any questions you might have my name is melinda if youll come this way peter followed her out into a hallway burkhardt and the orderly fell into step behind them your rejuvenation is our first full success melinda said as they waited for an elevator it really has been a gift both to you and to science she fell silent and peter figured out that he was supposed to respond it was beginning to dawn on him that people in nd century bremerton expected certain ritualistic exchanges and that so far he hadnt made a very good impression even burkhardt had been bothered by the offhand bravenewworld comment which peter had meant with shakespeare in mind instead of huxley but it might be too late to explain that the elevator door opened and the four of them crowded into the car peter noticed a crucifix on the wall is this a catholic hospital he asked melinda shook her head this is a military research installation youll find that one of the things thats changed since your accident is that we have different ideas about the appropriate role of religion in public life shed put strange emphasis on the word accident peter wasnt sure why but before he could frame a question the elevator door opened and they walked out into a spacious lobby all glass and steel military police stood at a screening checkpoint just inside the front doors and at least half of the people moving through the lobby wore uniforms most of the others wore white coats since when does the military fund research into how to bring people back to life peter asked national security concerns dictate that most scientific research be conducted in cooperation with the military melinda said weve taken the lead on this project she leaned her face down to a screen and one of the mps waved her through the orderly did the same and burkhardt held one hand in front of the screen peter followed suit the screen was blank glowing a dim green it didnt respond visibly to his presence but one of the mps nodded at him and he followed his escorts outside it was a nice day warm and clear peter looked out over the islands in puget sound then turned around to see the olympic mountains he blinked they werent quite the right shade of green and everywhere he looked he saw the savage brown scars of clearcuts what the hell happened there he asked weve all had to make sacrifices melinda answered national parks are a luxury in an age of terror with the exception of presidential historic sites theyve all been transferred to private ownership peter was furious but he bit down on the profane comment hed been about to make speaking of ownership melinda said i believe these are yours she reached out with his wallet and a small ziploc baggie with what was left of the last quarterounce peter had bought before he fell into a glacier an instinct to caution prickled the back of his neck thanks he said and took only the wallet please mr skilling melinda said blood tests clearly indicated the presence of marijuana in your body and this bag was found in your right front pocket its a little too late to deny things peter shrugged and took the weed he walked back toward the hospital door and threw it into a trash can i doubt its any good after ninetyeight years anyway i wouldnt know melinda said are you angry about something mr skilling my goodness of course hes angry burkhardt piped up a perfectly rational response to his situation in fact a clear indication that he is coping in a sane and intelligent manner i note that you grew angry when you saw the mountains peter is that because of our conservation practices is that what you call it looks like a clearcut to me thats not a current term maximal extractive intensity and utilization is the standard practice at this time i believe clearcut is jargon from the environmentalists of your time am i correct peter pointed up at the mountains no clearcut is an accurate description of whats happened up there he said so would you consider yourself an environmentalist burkhardt asked yeah i would especially compared to whoever authorized that whoa there the orderly said all conservation decisions come straight from the top show a little respect were you a member of the green party of the united states melinda asked what its a simple question mr skilling we need to know as much as possible about you to make correct decisions fine yes i was a green still am if theres still a party there isnt melinda said she turned to the orderly vince do you need anything else we need to get the drug offense squared away vince said mr skilling who did you purchase the marijuana from peter just gaped at him the guy i bought from has probably been dead for sixty years vince you may address me as col trecker answer the question peter hesitated he didnt want to rat on anyone but you couldnt do much harm to a dead guy except me he thought and if theyre going to make a big deal out of this i better cooperate especially if theyve had this colonel pretending he was an orderly his name was phil kokoszka happy col trecker whipped out a pda and tapped at it philip j kokoszka of redmond yeah he lived in redmond peter had just been there last week or ninetyeight years ago by the worlds reckoning was he a green too yeah i knew him through local meetings come on whats the point hes dead so was i jesus the curse brought a moment of icy silence are we all set here melinda asked trecker put away the pda looks that way take him back inside wait a minute peter said im kind of looking forward to seeing what the world looks like now the brave new world col trecker responded maybe some other time right now theres business to take care of burkhardt stepped closer to peter time to go in peter it said you really are doing marvelously well dont let your initial emotional responses cloud your judgment when they entered the hospital one of the mps at the door fell into step his rifle slung at his hip and pointed in peters direction they didnt go back to the elevator instead melinda and col trecker let the party down a curving hall to an open door they went in and peter got a cold chill as he recognized the setup a desk at the far wall set on a low dais two tables facing it a few chairs arranged in one corner a courtroom burkhardt sat peter at one of the tables and remained standing behind him col trecker went to the desk melinda sat at the other table youve got to be kidding peter said the army is prosecuting me for holding a quarterounce of weed a hundred years ago thats certainly a rosy way of putting it burkhardt said im deeply sorry that the situation is in fact a little more serious than that the door opened and shut behind peter he started to glance over his shoulder to see who was coming in but burkhardt stepped to block his view eyes front peter lets make the best of things here shall we run peter thought but he didnt he turned back around and looked at col trecker who had his pda out again a display set into the wall came to life and trecker took a gavel from a drawer and rapped it on the desk case of united states government against peter skilling he said military court convened per the uniting and strengthening america act of major fullerton your stipulations melinda rose working from her own pda she began defendant skilling is known to have fallen into a glacial crevasse while hiking in alaska during the late summer of the year of our lord the screen flashed a seattle postintelligencer article from aug kirkland man missing on mckinley the article disappeared and a video recording appeared peter and melinda major fullerton outside the hospital fine yes i was a green still am if theres still a party defendant was at that time and still claims to be a member of a terrorist organization the green party of the united states what peter said col trecker rapped his gavel you will speak only in answer to a direct question continue major defendant was at the time of his death under the influence of a class i controlled substance cannabis sativa peter disappeared from the screen replaced by a medical report that came and went too fast for him to read it the concentrations of intoxicating agents in defendants blood indicate that his motor functions would have been considerably impaired and that mountain hiking under this influence would have been criminally reckless according to prevailing legal standards a list of legal decisions scrolled across the screen counselor burkhardt do you accept these facts as stipulated trecker asked we do colonel since when is the green party a terrorist group peter said trecker got up from behind his desk walked up to peters table and leaned over peter if you speak again without being asked a direct question i swear on my mothers bible that i will bang your head on this table until you can count your teeth on one hand is that clear that was a direct question peters throat had dried shut he coughed and managed to say clear trecker nodded and went back to his desk major following from the entered stipulations and under the terrorism penalties enhancement act of and the victory act of we accuse the defendant of terrorist acts resulting in death in addition we accuse the defendant of making comments pejorative to the stature and actions of the commander in chief which act to undermine confidence in the united states of america and therefore weaken our efforts to fight global terror peter skilling do you understand the charges against you i sure as hell do not peter said what did i do that was terrorist since when is it illegal to make pejorative comments about idiot politicians counselor trecker said advise the defendant before i have to get up again burkhardts hand fell heavily on peters shoulder peter youve put yourself in a tricky situation here and youre only making it worse wouldnt you be better off cooperating and not being quite so antagonistic are you defending me burkhardt that is my role yes and i am very proud to perform it burkhardt straightened i believe we can count on a more civil atmosphere he said to trecker the colonel nodded how do you answer the charges oh not guilty in addition i move for the dismissal of the pejorativecomment and underminingconfidence charges which are possible only under laws passed during the s clearly peter cant be charged with a crime that didnt exist at the time of his death and at that time freespeech law was much less codified than it has since become trecker looked down at his pda after a moments consultation he said those charges are dismissed objection major fullerton said overruled major you will make your case only on the charge of terrorist acts resulting in death proceed hope fluttered weakly in peters stomach burkhardt had done the job so far he might be a crazy robot but dr mcbride had said he was built to ensure protocols were met what else would you want in a lawyer colonel the governments case is simple under the terrorism penalties enhancement act of it is a capital offense to commit an act of terrorism that results in a death the victory act of liberalized the definition of terrorism to include drug possession and distribution if it could be shown that drug money financed terrorist organizations the defendant has admitted that his supplier was a member of the green party of the united states which was on terrorist watchlists as early as and officially added to the governments list of terrorist organizations in april of following the first reelection of president george w bush on the wall screen peter watched himself say that phil kokoszka was a green medical and toxicological reports indicate that the defendant was seriously impaired by marijuana intoxication at the time of his death under the provisions of the terrorism penalties and victory acts his purchase of marijuana was a terrorist act in that it benefited a known terrorist organization his use of that same marijuana impaired his physical coordination to the extent that he suffered a fatal fall on mount mckinley it is clear that his terrorist act of purchasing marijuana from the green party of the united states led directly to his decease which makes the terrorism penalties act applicable here and leaves the government no choice but to subject the defendant to the ultimate sanction the only question is whether or not the defendant is compos mentis and to answer that issue the government calls burkhardt before peter could say anything burkhardt slapped a metal hand over his mouth please peter this is all standard you must realize that things arent the same as you remember were all much safer now letting go of peters jaw burkhardt stood and walked out in front of the table trecker swore it in do you find the defendant peter skilling to be fit for trial major fullerton asked it peter has done an exceptional job of adapting to severely trying circumstances burkhardt enthused i would not have thought it possible for him to be as welladjusted as he is but i can find no evidence of deficiency in analytic or emotional responses what a fine example of the human mind he is numbness was slowly settling over peters mind now i cant believe this is real he thought no way im still on the mountain and all of these lunatics are a dying paranoid fantasy thank you burkhardt major fullerton said you are excused that was a defense peter muttered when burkhardt returned to the table peter im under oath the robot said and im very proud of you anything else major fullerton shook her head we rest sir trecker looked at burkhardt defense the defense challenges the toxicology report burkhardt practically crowed and calls dr felicia mcbride objection major fullerton called dr mcbrides security clearance has been revoked for lack of confidence due to comments made in the defendants presence she cannot be counted on to deliver objective testimony sustained said col trecker anything else burkhardt this is terribly disappointing burkhardt said no colonel the defense rests col trecker stood so did major fullerton burkhardt tapped peter on the shoulder and peter rose feeling stoned again as if all of this was very distant right the colonel said we defend our homeland against those who would destroy our freedoms and our way of life in that defense it is sometimes necessary to take actions that in other circumstances would be

surveillance state was the stuff of absolute science fiction today in an era of security cameras wire taps and radiofrequency id tags surveillance is constant and privacy a privilege if no one is watching you its not because they cant its simply because so far no one has decided its worthwhile but in the future cory doctorow describes in our next story someone has decided to watch everyone all the time every day just think a moment about what your daily life is like have you ever run a red light have you stayed parked longer than the meter would allow have you ever rounded down on your taxes here is a world where the minor infractions get noticed here is a world where everyone is going to get caught sometime and everyone is some kind of criminal forget big brother in this dystopian surveillance state the watchers are more like the godfather and his dons cause its gonna be the future soon and i wont always be this way when the things that make me weak and strange get engineered away jonathan coulton the future soon lawrences cubicle was just the right place to chew on a thorny logfile problem decorated with the votive fetishes of his monastic order a thousand calming clarifying mandalas and saints devoted to helping him think clearly from the nearby cubicles lawrence heard the ritualized muttering of a thousand brothers and sisters in the order of reflective analytics a susurration of harmonized concentrated thought on his display he watched an instrument widget track the decibel level over time the graph overlaid on a d curve of normal activity over time and space he noted that the level was a little high the room a little more anxious than usual he clicked and tapped and thought some more massaging the logfile to see if he could make it snap into focus and make sense but it stubbornly refused to be sensible the data tracked the custody chain of the bitstream the order munged for the securitat and somewhere in there a file had grown by sixtyeight bytes blowing its checksum and becoming an anomaly order lore was filled with anomalies loose threads in the fabric of reality bugs to be squashed in the dataset that was the orders universe starting with the preorder sysadmin whod tracked a billing anomaly back to a foreign spyring that was using his systems to hack his military these morality tales were object lessons to the orders monks pick at the seams and the world will unravel in useful and interesting ways lawrence had reached the end of his personal picking capacity though it was time to talk it over with gerta he stood up and walked away from his cubicle touching his belt to let his sensor array know that he remembered it was there it counted his steps and his heartbeats and his eeg spikes as he made his way out into the compound its not like gerta was in charge the order worked in autonomous little units with rotating leadership all coordinated by some groupware that let them keep the hierarchy nice and flat the way that they all liked it authority sucked but once you instrument every keystroke every click every erg of productivity it soon becomes apparent who knows her shit and who just doesnt gerta knew the shit cold question he said walking up to her she liked it brusque no nonsense she batted her handball against the court wall three more times making long dives for it sweaty grey hair whipping back and forth body arcing in graceful flows then she caught the ball and tossed it into the basket by his feet lester huh all right surprise me its this he said and tossed the file at her pan she caught it with the same fluid gesture and her computer gave it to her on the handball court wall which was the closest display for which she controlled the lockfile she peered at the data spinning the graph this way and that peering intently she pulled up some of her own instruments and replayed the bitstream recalling the logfiles from many network taps from the moment at which the file grew by the anomalous sixtyeight bytes you think its an anomaly dont you she had a fine blond moustache that was beaded with sweat but her breathing had slowed to normal and her hands were steady and sure as she gestured at the wall i was kind of hoping yeah good opportunity for personal growth your anomalies easy to say why youd call it an anomaly but look at this she pulled the checksum of the injected bytes then showed him her network taps which were playing the traffic back and forth for several minutes before and after the insertion the checksummed block moved back through the routers one hop two hops three hops then to a terminal the authentication data for the terminal told them who owned its lockfile then zbigniew krotoski login zbigkrot gerta grabbed his room number now we dont have the actual payload of course because that gets flushed but we have the checksum we have the username and look at this we have him typing sixtyeight unspecified bytes in a pattern consistent with his biometrics five minutes and eight seconds prior to the injection so lets go ask him what his sixtyeight characters were and why they got added to the securitats datastream he led the way because he knew the corner of the campus where zbigkrot worked pretty well having lived there for five years when he first joined the order zbigkrot was probably a relatively recent inductee if he was still in that block his belt gave him a reassuring buzz to let him know he was being logged as he entered the building softer haptic feedback coming as he was logged to each floor as they went up the cleanswept wooden stairs once hed had the workdetail of restaining those stairs stripping the ancient wood sanding it babyskin smooth applying ten coats of varnish polishing it to a high gloss the work had been incredible painful and rewarding and seeing the stairs still shining gave him a tangible sense of satisfaction he knocked at zbigkrots door twice before entering technically any brother or sister was allowed to enter any room on the campus though there were norms of privacy and decorum that were far stronger than any law or rule the room was bare every last trace of its occupant removed a fine dust covered every surface swirling in clouds as they took a few steps in they both coughed explosively and stepped back slamming the door skin gerta croaked collected from the ventilation filters dna for every person on campus in a nice even gaussian distribution means we cant use biometrics to figure out who was in this room before it was cleaned out lawrence tasted the dust in his mouth and swallowed his gag reflex technically he knew that he was always inhaling and ingesting other peoples dead skincells but not by the mouthful all right gerta said now youve got an anomaly congrats lawrence personal growth awaits you the campus only had one entrance to the wall that surrounded it isnt that a firehazard lawrence asked the guard who sat in the pillbox at the gate naw the man said he was old with the serene air of someone whod been in the order for decades his beard was combed and shining plaited into a thick braid that hung to his belly which had only the merest hint of a little pot comes a fire we hit the panic button reverse the magnets lining the walls and the foundations destabilize at twenty sections the whole thingd come down in seconds but no ones going to sneak in or out that way i did not know that lawrence said public record of course but pretty obscure too tempting to a certain prankster mindset lawrence shook his head learn something new every day the guard made a gesture that caused something to depressurize in the gateway a primed hum vibrated through the floorboards we keep the inside of the vestibule at ten atmospheres and it opens inward from outside no one can force that door open without us knowing about it in a pretty dramatic way but it must take forever to repressurize not many people go in and out just data lawrence patted himself down you got everything do i seem nervous to you the old timer picked up his tea and sipped at it youd be an idiot if you werent how long since youve been out not since i came in sixteen years ago i was twentyone yeah the old timer said yeah youd be an idiot if you werent nervous you follow politics not my thing lawrence said i know its been getting worse out there the old timer barked a laugh not your thing its probably time you got out into the wide world son you might ignore politics but it wont ignore you is it dangerous you going armed i didnt know that was an option always an option but not a smart one any weapon you dont know how to use belongs to your enemy just be circumspect listen before you talk watch before you act theyre good people out there but theyre in a bad bad situation lawrence shuffled his feet and shifted the straps of his bindle youre not making me very comfortable with all this you know why are you going out anyway its an anomaly my first ive been waiting sixteen years for this someone poisoned the securitats data and left the campus im going to go ask him why he did it the old man blew the gate the heavy door lurched open revealing the vestibule sounds like an anomaly all right he turned away and lawrence forced himself to move toward the vestibule the man held his hand out before he reached it you havent been outside in fifteen years its going to be a surprise just remember were a noble species all appearances to the contrary notwithstanding then he gave lawrence a little shove that sent him into the vestibule the door slammed behind him the vestibule smelled like machine oil and rubber gaskety smells it was dimly lit by rows of white leds that marched up the walls like drunken ants lawrence barely had time to register this before he heard a loud thunk from the outer door and it swung away lawrence walked down the quiet street staring up at the same sky hed lived under breathing the same air hed always breathed but marveling at how different it all was his heartbeat and respiration were up the tips of the first two fingers on his right hand itched slightly under his feedback gloves and his thoughts were doing that racecondition thing where every time he tried to concentrate on something he thought about how he was trying to concentrate on something and should stop thinking about how he was concentrating and just concentrate this was how it had been sixteen years before when hed gone into the order hed been so angry all the time then sitting in front of his keyboard looking at the world through the lens of the network suffering all the fools with poor grace hed been a bright fourteenyearold a genius at sixteen a rising star at eighteen and a failure by twentyone he was depressed all the time his weight had ballooned to nearly pounds and he had been fired three times in two years one day he stood up from his desk at work hed just been hired at a company that was selling learning trainable visionsystems for analyzing images who liked him because hed retained his security clearance when hed been fired from his previous job and walked out of the building it had been a blowing wet grey day and the streets of new york were as empty as they ever got standing on sixth avenue looking north from midtown staring at the buildings the cars and the buses and the people and the tallwalkers thats when he had his realization he was not meant to be in this world it just didnt suit him he could see its workings see how its politics and policies were flawed see how the system needed debugging see what made its people work but he couldnt touch it every time he reached in to adjust its settings he got mangled by its gears he couldnt convince his bosses that he knew what they were doing wrong he couldnt convince his colleagues that he knew best nothing he did succeeded every attempt he made to right the wrongs of the world made him miserable and made everyone else angry lawrence knew about humans so he knew about this this was the exact profile of the people in the order normally he would have taken the subway home it was forty blocks to his place and he didnt get around so well anymore plus there was the rain and the wind but today he walked huffing and limping using his cane more and more as he got further and further uptown his knee complaining with each step he got to his apartment and found that the elevator was out of service second time that month and so he took the stairs he arrived at his apartment so out of breath he felt like he might vomit he stood in the doorway clutching the frame looking at his sofa and table the piles of books the dirty dishes from that mornings breakfast in the little sink hed watched a series of short videos about the order once and hed been struck by the little monastic cells each member occupied so neat so tidy everything in its perfect place serene and thoughtful so unlike his place he didnt bother to lock the door behind him when he left they said new york was the burglary capital of the developed world but he didnt know anyone whod been burgled if the burglars came they were welcome to everything they could carry away and the landlord could take the rest he was not meant to be in this world he walked back out into the rain and what the hell hailed a cab and hail mary one stopped when he put his hand out the cabbie grunted when he said he was going to staten island but what the hell he pulled three twenties out of his wallet and slid them through the glass partition the cabbie put the pedal down the rain sliced through the manhattan canyons and battered the windows and they went over the verrazano bridge and he said goodbye to his life and the outside world forever seeking a world he could be a part of or at least thats how he felt as his heart swelled with the drama of it all but the truth was much less glamorous the brothers who admitted him at the gate were cheerful and a little weird like his coworkers and he didnt get a nice clean cell to begin with but a bunk in a shared room and a detail helping to build more quarters and they didnt leave his stuff for the burglars someone from the order went and cleaned out his place and put his stuff in a storage locker on campus made good with his landlord and so on by the time it was all over it all felt a little ordinary but in a good way ordinary was good it had been a long time since hed felt ordinary order ordinary they went together he needed ordinary the securitat van played a cheerful enginetone as it zipped down the street towards him it looked like a childrens drawing a perfect little electrical box with two seats in front and a meshedin lockup in the rear it accelerated smoothly down the street towards him then braked perfectly at his toes rocking slightly on its suspension as its doors gullwinged up cool he said involuntarily stepping back to admire the smart little car he reached for the lifelogger around his neck and aimed it at the two securitat officers who were debarking moving with stiff grace in their armor as he raised the lifelogger the officer closest to him reached out with serpentine speed and snatched it out of his hands powerassisted fingers coming together on it with a loud plasticky crunk as the device shattered into a rain of fragments just as quickly the other officer had come around the vehicle and seized lawrences wrists bringing them together in a painful machineassisted grip the one who had crushed his lifelogger passed his palms over lawrences chest arms and legs holding them a few millimeters away from him lawrences pan went nuts intrusion detection sensors reporting multiple hostile reads of his identifiers millimeterwave radar scans herf attacks and assorted shenanigans all his feedback systems went to full alert going from itchy backoftheneck liminal sensations into high intensity pinches prods and buzzes it was a deeply alarming sensation like his internal organs were under attack he choked out an incoherent syllable and the securitat man who was handwanding him raised a warning finger holding it so close to his nose he went crosseyed he fell silent while the man continued to wand him twitching a little to let his pan know that it was all ok from the cult then are you the securitat man said after hed kicked lawrences ankles apart and spread his hands on the side of the truck thats right lawrence said from the order he jerked his head toward the gates just a few tantalizing meters away im out you people are really something you know that you could have been killed let me tell you a few things about how the world works when you are approached by the securitat you stand still with your hands stretched straight out to either side you do not raise unidentified devices and point them at the officers not unless youre trying to commit suicide by cop is that what youre trying to do no lawrence said no of course not i was just taking a picture for and you do not photograph or log our security procedures theres a war on you know the mans forehead bunched together oh for shits sake we should take you in now you know it tie up a dozen peoples day just to process you through the system you could end up in a cell for oh i dont know a month you want that of course not lawrence said i didnt realize you didnt but you should have if youre going to come walking around here where the real people are you have to learn how to behave like a real person in the real world the other man who had been impassively holding lawrences wrists in a crushing grip eased up let him go he said the first officer shook his head if i were you i would turn right around walk through those gates and never come out again do i make myself clear lawrence wasnt clear at all was the cop ordering him to go back or just giving him advice would he be arrested if he didnt go back in it had been a long time since lawrence had dealt with authority and the feeling wasnt a good one his chest heaved and sweat ran down the his back pooling around his ass then moving in rivulets down the backs of his legs i understand he said thinking i understand that asking questions now would not be a good idea the subway was more or less as he remembered it though the long line of people waiting to get through the turnstiles turned out to be a line to go through a security checkpoint complete with bagsearch and xray but the new yorkers were the same no one made eye contact with anyone else but if they did everyone shared a kind of bitter shrug as if to say aint it the fuckin truth but the smell was the same oil and damp and bleach and the indefinable human smell of a place where millions had passed for decades where millions would pass for decades to come he found himself standing before a subway map looking at it comparing it to the one in his memory to find the changes the new stations that must have sprung up during his hiatus from reality but there werent new stations in fact it seemed to him that there were a lot fewer stations hadnt there been one at bleecker street and another at cathedral parkway yes there had been but look now they were gone and and there were stickers white stickers over the places where the stations had been he reached up and touched the one over bleecker street i still cant get used to it either said a voice at his side i used to change for the f train there every day when i was a kid it was a woman about the same age as gerta but more beaten down by the years deeper creases in her face a stoop in her stance but her face was kind her eyes soft what happened to it she took a halfstep back from him bleecker street she said you know bleecker street like bleecker street like the name of the station was an incantation it rang a bell it wasnt like he didnt ever read the news but it had a way of sliding off of you when you were on campus as though it was some historical event in a book not something happening right there on the other side of the wall im sorry he said ive been away bleecker street yes of course she gave him a squinty stare you must have been very far away he tried out a sheepish grin im a monk he said from the order of reflective analytics ive been out of the world for sixteen years until today in fact my name is lawrence he stuck his hand out and she shook it like it was made of china a monk she said thats very interesting well you enjoy your little vacation she turned on her heel and walked quickly down the platform he watched her for a moment then turned back to the map counting the missing stations when the train ground to a halt in the tunnel between nd and th street the entire car let out a collective groan when the lights flickered and went out they groaned louder the emergency lights came on in sickly green and an incomprehensible announcement played over the loudspeakers evidently it was an order to evacuate because the press of people began to struggle through the door at the front of the car then further and further lawrence let the press of bodies move him too once they reached the front of the train they stepped down onto the tracks each passenger turning silently to help the next again with that aint it the fuckin truth look lawrence turned to help the person behind him and saw that it was the woman whod spoken to him on the platform she smiled a little smile at him and turned with practiced ease to help the person behind her they walked single file on a narrow walkway beside the railings securitat officers were strung out at regular intervals wearing night scopes and high rubberized boots they played flashlights over the walkers as they evacuated does this happen often lawrence said over his shoulder his words were absorbed by the dead subterranean air and he thought that she might not have heard him but then she sighed only every time theres an anomaly in the headcount when the system says theres too many or too few people in the trains maybe once a week he could feel her staring at the back of his head he looked back at her and saw her shaking her head he stumbled and went down on one knee clanging his head against the stone walls made soft by a fur of condensed train exhaust cobwebs and dust she helped him to his feet you dont seem like a snitch lawrence but youre a monk are you going to turn me in for being suspicious he took a second to parse this out i dont work for the securitat he said it seemed like the best way to answer she snorted thats not what we hear come on theyre going to start shouting at us if we dont move they walked the rest of the way to an emergency staircase together and emerged out of a sidewalk grating blinking in the remains of the autumn sunlight a bloody color on the glass of the highrises she looked at him and made a face youre filthy lawrence she thumped at his sleeves and great dirty clouds rose off them he looked down at the knees of his pants and saw that they were hung with boogers of dust the new yorkers who streamed past them ducked to avoid the dirty clouds where can i clean up he said where are you staying i was thinking id see about getting a room at the y or a backpackers hostel somewhere to stay until im done done im on a complicated errand trying to locate someone who used to be in the order her face grew hard again no one gets out alive huh he felt himself blushing its not like that wow youve got strange ideas about us i want to find this guy because he disappeared under mysterious circumstances and i want to how to explain anomalies to an outsider its a thing we do unravel mysteries it makes us better people better people she snorted again better than what dont answer come on i live near here you can wash up at my place and be on your way youre not going to get into any backpackers hostel looking like you just crawled out of a sewer youre more likely to get detained for being an indigent of suspicious character he let her steer him a few yards uptown you think that i work for the securitat but youre inviting me into your home she shook her head and led him around a corner along a long crosstown block and then turned back uptown no she said i think youre a confused stranger who is apt to get himself into some trouble if someone doesnt take you in hand and help you get smart fast it doesnt cost me anything to lend a hand and you dont seem like the kind of guy whod mug rape and kill an old lady the discipline he said is all about keeping track of the way that the world is and comparing it to your internal perceptions all the time when i entered the order i was really big fat i mean the discipline made me log every bit of food i ate and i discovered a few important things first i was eating about twenty times a day just grazing on whatever happened to be around second that i was consuming about calories a day mostly in industrial sugars like highfructose corn syrup just knowing how i ate made a gigantic difference i felt like i ate sensibly always ordering a salad with lunch and dinner but i missed the fact that i was glooping on half a cup of sweetened highfat dressing and having a cookie or two every hour between lunch and dinner and a halfpint of icecream before bed most nights but it wasnt just food in the order we keep track of everything our typing patterns our sleeping patterns our moods our reading habits i discovered that i read faster when ive been sleeping more so now when i need to really get through a lot of reading i make sure i sleep more used to be id try to stay up all night with pots of coffee to get the reading done of course the more sleepdeprived i was the slower i read and the slower i read the more i needed to stay up to catch up with the reading no wonder college was such a blur so thats why ive stayed its empiricism its as old as newton as the enlightenment he took another sip of his water which tasted like new york tap water had always tasted pretty good in fact and which he hadnt tasted for sixteen years the woman was called posy and her old leather sofa was worn but wellloved and smelled of saddle soap she was watching him from a kitchen chair shed brought around to the living room of the tiny apartment rubbing her stockinged feet over the good wool carpet that showed a few old stains hiding beneath strategically placed furnishings and knickknacks he had to tell her the rest of course you couldnt understand the order unless you understood the rest im a screwup posy or at least i was we all were smart and motivated and promising but just a wretched person to be around angry bitter all those smarts turned on biting the heads off of the people who were dumb enough to care about me or employ me and so smart that i could talk myself into believing that it was all everyone elses fault the idiots it took instrumentation empiricism to get me to understand the patterns of my own life to master my life to become the person i wanted to be well you seem like a perfectly nice young man now posy said that was clearly his cue to go and hed changed into a fresh set of trousers but he couldnt go not until hed picked apart something shed said earlier why did you think i was a snitch i think you know that very well lawrence she said i cant imagine someone whos so into measuring and understanding the world could possibly have missed it now he knew what she was talking about we just do contract work for the securitat its just one of the ways the order sustains itself the founders had gone into business refilling toner cartridges which was like the st century equivalent of keeping bees or brewing dark thick beer theyd branched out into remote it administration then into datamining and security which was a natural for people with order training but its all anonymized we dont snitch on people we report on anomalous events we do it for lots of different companies too not just the securitat posy walked over to the window behind her small dining room table rolling away a couple of handsome old chairs on castors to reach it she looked down over the billion lights of manhattan stretching all the way downtown to brooklyn she motioned to him to come over and he squeezed in beside her they were on the twentythird floor and it had been many years since hed stood this high and looked down the world is different from high up there she said pointing at an apartment building across the way there you see it with the broken windows he saw it the windows covered in cardboard they took them away last week i dont know why you never know why you become a person of interest and they take you away and then later they always find a reason to keep you away lawrences hackles were coming up he found stuff that didnt belong in the data he didnt arrest people so if they always find a reason to keep you away doesnt that mean she looked like she wanted to slap him and he took a step back were all guilty of something lawrence thats how the game is rigged look closely at anyones life and youll find what a little blackmarketeering a copyright infringement some cash economy business with unreported income something obscene in your internet use something in your bloodstream that shouldnt be there i bought that sofa from a cop lawrence bought it ten years ago when he was leaving the building he didnt give me a receipt and didnt collect tax and technically that makes us offenders she slapped the radiator i overrode the governor on this ten minutes after they installed it everyone does it they make it easy you just stick a penny between two contacts and hey presto the city cant turn your heat down anymore they wouldnt make it so easy if they didnt expect everyone to do it and once everyones done it were all guilty the people across the street they were pakistani or maybe sri lankan or bangladeshi id see the wife at the service laundry nice professional lady always lugging around a couple kids on their way to or from daycare she posy broke off and stared again i once saw her reach for her change and her sleeve rode up and there was a number tattooed there there on her wrist posy shuddered when they took her and her husband and their kids she stood at the window and pounded at it and screamed for help you could hear her from here thats terrible lawrence said but what does it have to do with the order she sat back down for someone who is supposed to know himself youre not very good at connecting the dots lawrence stood up he felt an obscure need to apologize instead he thanked her and put his glass in the sink she shook his hand solemnly take care out there she said good luck finding your escapee heres what lawrence knew about zbigniew krotoski he had been inducted into the order four years earlier he was a nativeborn new yorker he had spent his first two years in the order trying to coax some of the elders into a variety of pointless flamewars about the ethics of working for the securitat and then had settled into being a very productive member he spent his percent time the time when each monk had to pursue nonworkrelated projects building aerial photography rigs out of boxkites and tiny cameras that the monks installed on their systems to help them monitor their body mechanics and ergonomic posture zbigkrot performed in the eightyfifth percentile of the order which was respectable enough lawrence had started there and had crept up and down as low as and as high as depending on how he was doing in the rest of his life zbigkrot was active in the gardens both the big ones where they grew their produce and a little allotment garden where he indulged in baroque crossbreeding experiments which were in vogue among the monks then the securitat stream to which hed added sixtyeight bytes was long gone but it was the kind of thing that the order handled on a routine basis given the timing and other characteristics lawrence thought it was probably a stream of purchase data from hardware and grocery stores to be inspected for unusual patterns that might indicate someone buying bomb ingredients zbigkrot had worked on this kind of data thousands of times before six times just that day hed added the sixtyeight bytes and then left invoking his right to do so at the lone gate the gatekeeper on duty remembered him carrying a little rucksack and mentioning that he was going to see his sister in new york zbigkrot once had a sister in new york that much could be ascertained anja krotoski had lived on rd street in a coop near lexington but that had been four years previous when hed joined the order and she wasnt there anymore her numbers all rang dead the apartment building had once been a pleasant middleclass sort of place with a red awning and a niche for a doorman now it had become more run down the awnings edges frayed one pane of lobby glass broken out and replaced with a sheet of cardboard the doorman was long gone it seemed to lawrence that this fate had befallen many of the citys buildings they reminded him of the buildings hed seen in belgrade one time when hed been sent out to brief a gang of outsource programmers his boss had hired neglected for years indifferently patched by residents who had limited access to materials it was the dinner hour and a steady trickle of people were letting themselves into anjas old building lawrence watched a couple of them enter the building and noticed something wonderful and sad as they approached the building their faces were the hard masks of citydwellers not meeting anyones eye clipping along at a fast pace that said dont screw with me but once they passed the threshold of their building and the door closed behind them their whole affect changed they slumped they smiled at one another they leaned against the mailboxes and set down their bags and took off their hats and fluffed their hair and turned back into people he remembered that feeling from his life before the sense of having two faces the one he showed to the world and the one that he reserved for home in the order he only wore one face one that he knew in exquisite detail he approached the door now and his pan started to throb ominously letting him know that he was enduring hostile probes the building wanted to know who he was and what business he had there and it was attempting to fingerprint everything about him from his pan to his gait to his face he took up a position by the door and dialed back the pans response to a dull pulse he waited for a few minutes until one of the residents came down a middleaged man with a dog a little sicklylooking schnauzer with grey in its muzzle can i help you the man said from the other side of the security door not unlatching it im looking for anja krotoski he said im trying to track down her brother the man looked him up and down please step away from the door he took a few steps back does ms krotoski still live here the man considered im sorry sir i cant help you he waited for lawrence to react you dont know or you cant help me dont wait under this awning the police come if anyone waits under this awning for more than three minutes the man opened the door and walked away with his dog his phone rang before the next resident arrived he cocked his head to answer it then remembered that his lifelogger was dead and dug in his jacket for a mic there was one at his wrist pulsepoints used by the health array he unvelcroed it and held it to his mouth hello its gerta boyo wanted to know how your anomaly was going not good he said im at the sisters place and they dont want to talk to me youre walking up to strangers and asking them about one of their neighbors huh he winced put it that way yeah ok i understand why this doesnt work but gerta i feel like rip van winkle here i keep putting my foot in it its so different people are people lawrence every bad behavior and every good one lurks within us they were all there when you were in the world in different proportion with different triggers but all there you know yourself very well can you observe the people around you with the same keen attention he felt slightly put upon thats what im trying then youll get there eventually what youre in a hurry well no he didnt have any kind of timeline some people chased anomalies for years but truth be told he wanted to get out of the city and back onto campus im thinking of coming back to campus to sleep gerta clucked dont give in to the agoraphobia lawrence hang in there you havent even heard my news yet and youre already ready to give up what news and im not giving up just want to sleep in my own bed the entry checkpoints lawrence you cannot do this job if youre going to spend four hours a day in security queues anyway the news it wasnt the first time he did it ive been running the logs back three years and ive found at least a dozen streams that he tampered with each time he used a different technique this was the first time we caught him used some pretty subtle tripwires when he did it so hed know if anyone ever caught on must have spent his whole life living on edge waiting for that moment waiting to bug out must have been a hard life what was he doing spying most assuredly gerta said but for whom for the enemy the securitat theyd considered going to the securitat with the information but why bother the order did business with the securitat but tried never to interact with them on any other terms the securitat and the order had an implicit understanding so long as the order was performing excellent dataanalysis it didnt have to fret the kind of overt scrutiny that prevailed in the real world undoubtedly the securitat kept satellite eyes datasnoopers wiretaps millimeter radar and every other conceivable surveillance trained on each campus in the world but at the end of the day they were just badly socialized geeks whod left the world and useful geeks at that the securitat treated the order the way that lawrences old bosses treated the company sysadmins expendable geeks who no one cared about so long as nothing went wrong no there was no sense in telling the securitat about the sixtyeight bytes why would the securitat poison its own datastreams you know that when the soviets pulled out of finland they found forty kilometers of wiretapping wire in kgb headquarters the building was only twelve stories tall spying begets spying the worst most dangerous enemy the securitat has is the securitat there were securitat vans on the street around him going past every now and again eerily silent engines playing their cheerful music he stepped back into shadow then thought better of it and stood under a pool of light ok so it was a habit how do i find him no one in the sisters building will talk to me you need to put them at their ease tell them the truth that often works you know how people feel about the order out here he thought of posy i dont know if the truth is going to work here youve been in the order for sixteen years youre not just some fumbletongued outcast anymore go talk to them but go lawrence go youre a smart guy youll figure it out he went residents were coming home every few minutes now carrying grocery bags walking dogs or dragging their tired feet he almost approached a young woman then figured that she wouldnt want to talk to a strange man on the street at night he picked a guy in his thirties wearing jeans and a huge old vintage coat that looked like it had come off the eastern front scuse me he said im trying to find someone who used to live here the guy stopped and looked lawrence up and down he had a handsome sweater on underneath his coat designy and cosmopolitan the kind of thing that made lawrence think of milan or paris lawrence was keenly aware of his generic orderissued suit a brown rumpled illfitting thing topped with a polymer coat that while warm hardly flattered good luck with that he said then started to move past please lawrence said im im not used to how things are around here theres probably some way i could ask you this that would put you at your ease but i dont know what it is im not good with people but i really need to find this person she used to live here the man stopped looked at him again he seemed to recognize something in lawrence or maybe it was that he was disarmed by lawrences honesty why would you want to do that its a long story he said basically though im a monk from the order of reflective analytics and one of our guys has disappeared his sister used to live here maybe she still does and i wanted to ask her if she knew where i could find him let me guess none of my neighbors wanted to help you youre only the second guy ive asked but yeah pretty much out here in the real world we dont really talk about each other to strangers too much like being a snitch lucky for you my sisters in the order out in oregon so i know youre not all a bunch of snoops and stoolies whore you looking for lawrence felt a rush of gratitude for this man anja krotosky number j oh the man said well yeah i can see why youd have a hard time with the neighbors when it comes to old anja she was wellliked around here before she went whered she go when whats your name friend lawrence lawrence anja went middle of the night kind of thing no one heard a thing the cctvs stopped working that night nothing on the drive the next day no footage at all like she skipped out they stopped delivering flyers to her door theres only one power stronger than direct marketing the securitat took her thats what we figured nothing left in her place not a stick of furniture we dont talk about it much not the thing that it pays to take an interest in how long ago two years ago he said a few more residents pushed past them listen i approve of what you people do in there more or less its good that theres a place for the people who dont you know who dont have a place out here but the way you make your living i told my sister about this the last time she visited and she got very angry with me she didnt see the difference between watching yourself and being watched lawrence nodded well thats true enough we dont draw a really sharp distinction we all get to see one anothers stats it keeps us honest thats fine if you have the choice but he broke off looking selfconscious lawrence reminded himself that they were on a public street the cameras on them people passing by was one of them a snitch the securitat had talked about putting him away for a month just for logging them they could watch him all they wanted but he couldnt look at them i see the point he sighed he was cold and it was full autumn dark now he still didnt have a room for the night and he didnt have any idea how hed find anja much less zbigkrot he began to understand why anomalies were such a big deal hed walked steps that day about triple what he did on campus his heart rate had spiked several times but not from exertion stress he could feel it in his muscles now he should really do some biofeedback try to calm down then run back his lifelogger and make some notes on how hed reacted to people through the day but the lifelogger was gone and he barely managed twentytwo seconds his first time on the biofeedback his next ten scores were much worse it was the hotel room it had once been an office and before that it had been half a hotelroom there were still scuffmarks on the floor from where the wheeled office chair had dug into the scratched lino the false wall that divided the room in half was thin as paper and lawrence could hear every snuffle from the other side the door to lawrences room had been rudely hacked in and weak light shone through an irregular crack over the jamb the old new yorker hotel had seen better days but it was what he could afford and it was central and he could hear new york outside the window hed gotten the half of the hotel room with the window in it the lights twinkled just as he remembered them and he still got a swimmy vertiginous feeling when he looked down from the great height the clerk had taken his photo and biometrics and had handed him a trackerkey that his pan was monitoring with tangible suspicion it radiated his identity every few yards and in the elevator it even seemed to track which part of the minuscule room he was in what the hell did the hotel do with all this information oh right it shipped it off to the securitat who shipped it to the order where it was processed for suspicious anomalies no wonder there was so much work for them on campus multiply the new yorker times a hundred thousand hotels two hundred thousand schools a million cabs across the nation there was no danger of the order running out of work the hotels network tried to keep him from establishing a secure connection back to the orders network but the orders countermeasures were better than the halfassed ones at the hotel it took a lot of tunneling and wrapping but in short measure he had a strong private line back to the campus albeit a slow line what with all the jiggerypokery he had to go through gerta had left him with her file on zbigkrot and his activities on the network he had several known associates on campus people he ate with or playing on intramural teams with or did a little extreme programming with gerta had bulkmessaged them all with an oblique query about his personal life and had forwarded the responses to lawrence there was a mountain of them and he started to plow through them he started by compiling stats on them length vocabulary number of paragraphs and then started with the outliers the shortest ones were polite shrugs apologies dont have anything to say the long ones whew they sorted into two categories general whining mostly from noobs who were still getting accustomed to the way of the order and protracted complaints from old hands whod worked with zbigkrot long enough to decide that he was incorrigible lawrence sorted these quickly then took a glance at the median responses and confirmed that they appeared to be largely unhelpful generalizations of the sort that you might produce on a coworker evaluation form a proliferation of null adjectives like satisfactory pleasant fine somewhere in this haystack lawrence did a quick wordcount and came back with words about two good novels worth of reading was a needle a clue that would show him the way to unravel the anomaly it would take him a couple days at least to sort through it all in depth he ducked downstairs and bought some groceries at an allnight grocery store in penn station and went back to his room ready to settle in and get the work done he could use a few days holiday from new york anyway about time zee big noob did a runner he never had a moments happiness here and i never figured out why hed bother hanging around when he hated it all so much ever meet the kind of guy who wanted to tell you just how much you shouldnt be enjoying the things you enjoy the kind of guy who could explain in detail exactly why your passions were stupid that was him brother antony why are you wasting your time collecting tin toys theyre badly made unlovely and represent at best a history of slave labor starting with your cherished made in occupied japan tanks christ why not collect rapecamp macrame while youre at it he had choice words for all of us about our passions but i was singled out because i liked to extreme program in my room which id spent a lot of time decorating see pic below and yes i built and sanded and mounted every one of those shelves by hand see magnification shot for detail on the joinery couldnt even drive a nail when i got here not that there are any nails in there its all precisionfitted tongue and groove holy moley lasers totally rock but he reserved his worst criticism for the order itself you know the litany were a cult were brainwashed were dupes of the securitat he was convinced that every instrument in the place was feeding up to the securitat itself hed mutter about this constantly whenever we got a new stream to work onis this your lifelog brother antony mine the number of flushes per shitter in the west wing of campus and it was no good trying to reason with him he just didnt acknowledge the benefit of introspection its no different from them hed say jerking his thumb up at the ceiling as though there was a securitat mic and camera hidden there youre just flooding yourself with useless information trying to find the useful parts why not make some predictions about which part of your life you need to pay attention to rather than spying on every process youre a spy in your own body so why did i work with him ill tell you first he was a shithot programmer i know his stats say he was way down in the th percentile but he could make every line of code that i wrote smarter we just dont have a way of measuring that kind of effect yes someone should write one ive been noodling with a framework for it for months now second there was something dreadfully fun about listening him light into other people their ridiculous passions and interests he could be incredibly funny and he was incisive if not insightful its shameful but there you have it i am imperfect finally when he wasnt being a dick he was a good guy to have in your corner he was our rugby teams fullback the baseball teams shortstop the tank on our mmog raids you could rely on him so im going to miss him weirdly if hes gone for good i wouldnt put it past him to stroll back onto campus someday and saywhat what i just took a little french leave jesus overreact much plenty of the notes ran in this direction but this was the most articulate lawrence read it through three times before adding it to the file of useful stuff it was a small pile still gerta kept forwarding him responses the late responders had some useful things to say he mentioned a sister only once a whole bunch of us were talking about how our families were really supportive of our coming to the order and after it had gone round the whole circle he just kind of looked at the sky and said my sister thought i was an idiot to go inside i asked her what she thought i should do and she said if i was you kid id just disappear before someone disappeared me naturally we all wanted to know what he meant by that im not very good at bullshitting and thats a vital skill in todays world she was better at it than me when she worked at it but she was the kind of person whod let her guard slip every now and then lawrence noted that zbigkrot had used the pasttense to describe his sister hed have known about her being disappeared then he stared at the walls of his hotel room the room next door was occupied by at least four people and he couldnt even imagine how youd get that many people inside he didnt know how four people could all stand in the room let alone lie down and sleep but there were definitely four voices from next door talking in chinese new york was outside the window and far below and the sun had come up far enough that everything was bright and reflective the cars and the buildings and the glints from sunglasses far below he wasnt getting anywhere with the docs the sister the datastreams and there was new york just outside the window he dug under the bed and excavated his boots recoiling from soft dustfurred old socks and worse underneath the mattress the securitat man pointed to lawrence as he walked past penn station lawrence stopped and pointed at himself in a whome gesture the securitat man pointed again then pointed to his alcove next to the entrance lawrences pan didnt like the securitat mans incursions and tried to wipe itself sir he said my pan is going nuts may i put down my arms so i can tell it to let you in the securitat man acted as though he hadnt heard just continued to wave his hands slowly over lawrences body come with me the securitat man said pointing to the door on the other side of the alcove that led into a narrow corridor into the bowels of penn station the door let out onto the concourse thronged with people shoving past each other disgorged by train after train though none made eye contact with them or each other they parted magically before them leaving them with a clear path lawrences pan was not helping him every inch of his body itched as it nagged at him about the depredations it was facing from the station and the securitat man this put him seriously on edge and made his heart and breathing go crazy triggering another round of warnings from his pan which wanted him to calm down but wouldnt help this was a bad failure mode one hed never experienced before hed have to file a bug report some day the securitats outpost in penn station was as clean as a dentists office but with meshreinforced windows and locks that made three distinct clicks and a soft hiss when the door closed the securitat man impersonally shackled lawrence to a plastic chair that was bolted into the floor and then went off to a checkin kiosk that he whispered into and prodded at there was no one else in evidence but there were huge cctv cameras so big that they seemed to be throwbacks to an earlier era some paleolithic ancestor of the modern camera these cameras were so big because they were meant to be seen meant to let you know that you were being watched the securitat man took him away again stood him in an interview room where the cameras were once again in voluble evidence explain everything the securitat man said he rolled up his mask so that lawrence could see his face young and hard hed been in diapers when lawrence went into the order and so lawrence began to explain but he didnt want to explain everything telling this man about zbigkrot tampering with securitat datastreams would not be good telling him about the disappearance of anja krotoski would be even worse so he lied he was already so stressed out that there was no way the lies would register as extraordinary to the sensors that were doubtless trained on him he told the securitat man that he was in the world to find an order member whod taken his leave because the order wanted to talk to him about coming back he told the man that hed been trying to locate zbigkrot by following up on his old contacts he told the securitat man that he expected to find zbigkrot within a day or two and would be going back to the order he implied that he was crucial to the order and that he worked for the securitat all the time that he and the securitat man were on the same fundamental mission on the same team the securitat mans face remained an impassive mask throughout he touched an earbead from time to time cocking his head slightly to listen someone else was listening to lawrences testimony and feeding him more material the securitat man scooted his chair closer to lawrence leaned in close searching his face we dont have any record of this krotoski person he said i advise you to go home and forget about him the words were said without any inflection at all and that was scariest of all lawrence had no doubt about what this meant there were no records because zbigniew krotoski was erased lawrence wondered what he was supposed to say to this armed child now did he lay his finger alongside of his nose and wink apologize for wasting his time everyone told him to listen before he spoke here should he just wait thank you for telling me so he said i appreciate the advice he hoped it didnt sound sarcastic the securitat man nodded you need to adjust the settings on your pan it reads like its got something to hide here in the world it has to accede to lawful read attempts without hesitation will you configure it lawrence nodded vigorously while hed recounted his story hed imagined spending a month in a cell while the securitat looked into his deeds and history now it seemed like he might be on the streets in a matter of minutes thank you for your cooperation the man didnt say it it was a recording played by hidden speakers triggered by some unseen agency and on hearing it the securitat man stood and opened the door waiting for the three distinct clicks and the hiss before tugging at the handle they stood before the door to the guards niche in front of penn station and the man rolled up his mask again this time he was smiling an easy smile and the hardness had melted a little from around his eyes you want a tip buddy sure look this is new york we all just want to get along here theres a lot of bad guys out there they got some kind of beef they want to fuck with us we dont want to let them do that you want to be safe here you got to show new york that youre not a bad guy that youre not here to fuck with us were the citys protectors and we can spot someone who doesnt belong here the way your body can spot a coldgerm the way youre walking around here looking around acting i could tell you didnt belong from a hundred yards you want to avoid trouble you get less strange fast you get me i get you he said thank you sir before the securitat man could say any more lawrence was on his way the man from anjas building had a different sweater on but the new one bulky wool the color of good chocolate was every bit as handsome as the one hed had on before he was wearing some kind of citrusy cologne and his hair fell around his ears in little waves that looked so natural they had to be fake lawrence saw him across the starbucks and had a crazy urge to duck away and change into better clothes just so he wouldnt look like such a fucking hayseed next to this guy im a new yorker he thought or at least i was i belong here hey lawrence fancy meeting you here he shook lawrences hand and gave him a wry youandmeinittogether smile hows the vision quest coming huh the anomaly thats what youre chasing arent you its your little rite of passage my sister had one last year figured out that some guy who travelled from fort worth to portland oregon every week was actually a fictional construct invented by cargo smugglers who used his seat to plant a series of mules running heroin and cash she was so proud afterwards that i couldnt get her to shut up about it you had the holy fire the other night when i saw you lawrence felt himself blushing its not really holyall that religious stuff its just a metaphor were not really spiritual oh the distinction between the spiritual and the material is pretty arbitrary anyway dont worry i dont think youre a cultist or anything no more than any of us anyway so hows it going i think its over he said dead end maybe ill get an easier anomaly next time sounds awful i didnt think you were allowed to give up on anomalies lawrence looked around to see if anyone was listening to them this one leads to the securitat he said in a sense you could say that ive solved it i think the guy im looking for ended up with his sister the mans expression froze not moving one iota you must be disappointed he said in neutral tones oh well he leaned over the condiment bar to get a napkin and wrestled with the dispenser for a moment it didnt cooperate and he ended up holding fifty napkins he made a disgusted noise and said can you help me get these back into the dispenser lawrence pushed at the dispenser and let the man feed it his excess napkins arranging them neatly while he did this he contrived to hand lawrence a card which lawrence cupped in his palm and then ditched into his inside jacket pocket under the pretense of reaching in to adjust his pan thanks the man said well i guess youll be going back to your campus now in the morning lawrence said i figured id see some new york first play tourist catch a broadway show the man laughed all right then you enjoy it he did nothing significant as he shook lawrences hand and left holding his paper cup he did nothing to indicate that hed just brought lawrence into some kind of illegal conspiracy lawrence read the note later on a bench in bryant park holding a paper bag of roasted chestnuts and fastidiously piling the husks next to him as he peeled them away it was a neatly cut rectangle of card sliced from a healthfood cereal box lettered on the back of it in pencil were two short lines wednesdays pm half moon café nd ave the address was on the lower east side a neighborhood that had been scorchingly trendy the last time lawrence had been there more importantly it was wednesday the half moon café turned out to be one of those new york places that are so incredibly hip they dont have a sign or any outward indication of their existence number was a frosted glass door between a drycleaners and a pakistani grocery store propped open with a squashed mountain dew can lawrence opened the door heart pounding and slipped inside a long dark corridor stretched away before him with a single door at the end open a crack dim light spilling out of it he walked quickly down the corridor sure that there were cameras observing him the door at the end of the hallway had a sheet of paper on it with half moon café laserprinted in its center good food smells came from behind it and the clink of cutlery and soft conversation he nudged it open and found himself in a dim flickering room lit by candles and draped with gathered curtains that turned the walls into the proscenia of a grand and ancient stage there were four or five small tables and a long one at the back of the room crowded with people with wine in icebuckets at either end a very pretty girl stood at the podium before him dressed in a conservative suit but with her hair shaved into a halfinch brush of electric blue she lifted an eyebrow at him as though she was sharing a joke with him and said welcome to the half moon do you have a reservation lawrence had carefully shredded the bit of cardboard and dropped its tatters in six different trash cans feeling like a real spy as he did so and realizing at the same time that going to all these different cans was probably anomalous enough in itself to draw suspicion a friend told me hed meet me here he said what was your friends name lawrence stuck his chin in the top of his coat to tell his pan to stop warning him that he was breathing too shallowly i dont know he said he craned his neck to look behind her at the tables he couldnt see the man but it was so dark in the restaurant you made it huh the man had yet another fantastic sweater on this one with a tight herringbone weave and ribbing down the sleeves he caught lawrence sizing him up and grinned my weakness the worlds wool farmers would starve if it wasnt for me he patted the greeter on the hand hes at our table she gave lawrence a knowing smile and the tiniest hint of a wink nice of you to come he said as they threaded their way slowly through the crowded tables past couples having murmured conversations over candlelight intense business dinners an old couple eating in silence with evident relish especially as its your last night in the city what kind of restaurant is this oh its not any kind of restaurant at all private kitchen ormund he owns the place and cooks like a wizard he runs this little place off the books for his friends to eat in we come every wednesday thats his vegan night youd be amazed with what that guy can do with some greens and a sweet potato and the cacao nib and avocado chili chocolate is something else the large table was crowded with men and women in their thirties people who had the look of belonging they dressed well in fabrics that draped or clung like someone had thought about it with jewelry that combined old pieces of brass with modern plastics and heavy clay beads that clicked like poolballs the women were beautiful or at least handsome one woman with cheekbones like snowplows and a jawline as long as a skislope was possibly the most striking person hed ever seen up close the men were handsome or at least craggy with threeday beards or neat full moustaches they were talking in twos and threes passing around overflowing dishes of steaming greens and oranges and browns chatting and forking by turns everyone id like you to meet my guest for the evening the man gestured at lawrence lawrence hadnt told the man his name yet but he made it seem like he was being gracious and letting lawrence introduce himself lawrence he said giving a little wave just in new york for one more night he said still waving he stopped waving the closest people including the striking woman with the cheekbones waved back smiling the furthest people stopped talking and tipped their forks at him or at least cocked their heads sara the cheekbones woman said pronouncing the first a long sahrah and making it sound unpretentious the lowkey buzzing from lawrences pan warned him that he was still overwrought breathing badly heart thudding who were these people and im randy the man said sorry i should have said that sooner the food was passed down to his end it was delicious almost as good as the food at the campus which was saying something there was a dedicated cadre of cooks there who made gastronomy their percent projects using elaborate computational models to create dishes that were always different and always delicious the big difference was the company these people didnt have to retreat to belong they belonged right here sara told him about her job managing a specialist antiquarian bookstore and there were a hundred stories about her customers and their funny ways randy worked at an architectural design firm and he had done some work at saras bookstore down the table there were actors and waiters and an insurance person and someone who did something in city government and they all ate and talked and made him feel like he was a different kind of man the kind of man who could live on the outside the coals of the conversation banked over port and coffees as they drifted away in twos and threes sara was the last to leave and she gave him a little hug and a kiss on the cheek safe travels lawrence her perfume was like an orange on christmas morning something from his childhood he hadnt thought of his childhood in decades randy and he looked at each other over the litter on the table the server brought a check over on a small silver tray and randy took a quick look at it he drew a wad of twenties in a bulldog clip out of his inside coat pocket and counted off a large stack then handed the tray to the server all before lawrence could even dig in his pocket please let me contribute he managed just as the server disappeared not necessary randy said setting the clip down on the table there was still a rather thick wad of money there lawrence hadnt been much of a cash user before he went into the order and hed seen hardly any spent since he came back out into the world it seemed rather antiquarian with its elaborate engraving but the notes were crisp as though freshly minted the government still pressed the notes even if they were hardly used any longer i can afford it it was a very fine dinner you have interesting friends sara is lovely he said she and i well we had a thing once shes a remarkable person of course youre a remarkable person too lawrence lawrences pan reminded him again that he was getting edgy he shushed it youre smart we know that th percentile looks like you could go higher judging from the work weve evaluated for you i cant say your performance as a private eye is very good though if i hadnt intervened youd still be standing outside anjas apartment building harassing her neighbors his pan was ready to call for an ambulance lawrence looked down and saw his hands clenched into fists youre securitat he said let me put it this way the man said leaning back im not one of anjas neighbors youre securitat lawrence said again i havent done anything wrong you came here randy said you had every reason to believe that you were taking part in something illegal you lied to the securitat man at penn station today lawrence switched his pans feedback mechanisms off altogether posy at her window a penny stuck in the governor of her radiator rose in his mind everyone was treating me like a criminal from the minute i stepped out of the order you all treated me like a criminal that made me act like one everyone has to act like a criminal here thats the hypocrisy of the world that honest people end up acting like crooks because the world treats them like crooks maybe we treat them like crooks because they act so crooked youve got it all backwards lawrence said the causal arrow runs the other direction you treat us like criminals and the only way to get by is to act criminal if id told the securitat man in penn station the truth you build a wall around the order dont you to keep us out because were barbarians to keep you in because youre too fragile what does that treatment do lawrence lawrence slapped his hand on the table and the crystal rang but no one in the restaurant noticed they were all studiously ignoring them its to keep you out all of you who treated us randy stood up from the table bulky figures stepped out of the shadows behind them behind their armor the securitat people could have been white or black old or young lawrence could only treat them as securitat he rose slowly from his chair and put his arms out as though surrendering as soon as the securitat officers relaxed by a tiny hair treating him as someone who was surrendering he dropped backwards over the chair behind him knocking over a little twoseat table and whacking his head on the floor so hard it rang like a gong he scrambled to his feet and charged pellmell for the door sweeping the empty tables out of the way as he ran he caught a glimpse of the pretty waitress standing by her podium at the front of the restaurant as he banged out the door her eyes wide and her hands up as though to ward off a blow he caromed off the wall of the dark corridor and ran for the glass door that led out to second avenue where cars hissed by in the night he made it onto the sidewalk crashed into a burly man in a mets cap bounced off him and ran downtown the people on the sidewalk leaping clear of him he made it two whole storefronts all the running around on the campus handball courts had given him a pretty good pace and wind before someone tackled him from behind he scrambled and squirmed and turned around it was the guy in the mets hat his breath smelled of onions and he was panting his lips pulled back watch where youre going he said and then he was lifted free jerked to his feet the blood sang in lawrences ears and he had just enough time to register that the big guy had been lifted by two blank armored securitat officers before he flipped over onto his knees and used the posture like a runners crouch to take off again he got maybe ten feet before he was clobbered by a bolt of lightning that made every muscle in his body lock into rigid agony he pitched forward facefirst not feeling anything except the terrible electric fire from the taserbolt in his back his pan died with a sizzle up and down every haptic point in his suit and between that and the electricity he flung his arms and legs out in an agonized x while his neck thrashed grating his face over the sidewalk something went horribly crunch in his nose the room had the same kind of locks as the securitat room in penn station hed awakened in the corner of the room his face taped up and aching there was no toilet but there was a chair bolted to the floor and three prominent video cameras they left him there for some time alone with his thoughts and the deepening throb from his face his knees the palms of his hands his hands and knees had been sanded raw and there was grit and glass and bits of pebble embedded under the skin which oozed blood his thoughts wanted to return to the predicament they wanted to fill him with despair for his situation they wanted to make him panic and weep with the anticipation of the cells the confession the life hed had and the life he would get he didnt let them he had spent sixteen years mastering his thoughts and he would master them now he breathed deeply noticing the places where his body was tight and trembling thinking each muscle into tranquility even his aching face letting his jaw drop open every time his thoughts went back to the predicament he scrawled their anxious message on a streamer of mental ribbon which he allowed to slip through his mental fingers and sail away sixteen years of doing this had made him an expert and even so it was not easy the worries rose and streamed away as fast as his minds hand could write them but as always he was finally able to master his mind to find relaxation and calm at the bottom of the thrashing churning vat of despair when randy came in lawrence heard each bolt click and the hiss of air as from a great distance and he surfaced from his calm watching randy cross the floor bearing his own chair innocent people dont run lawrence thats a rather selfserving hypothesis lawrence said the cool ribbons of worry slithered through his mind like satin floating off into the ether around them you appear to have made up your mind though i wonder at you you dont seem like an idiot howve you managed to convince yourself that this he gestured around at the room is a good idea i mean this is just randy waved him silent the interrogation in this room flows in one direction lawrence this is not a dialogue have you ever noticed that when youre uncomfortable with something you talk louder and lean forward a little a lot of people have that tell do you work with securitat data streams lawrence i work with large amounts of data including a lot of material from the securitat its rarely in cleartext though mostly im doing sigint signals intelligence i analyze the timing frequency and length of different kinds of data to see if i can spot anomalies thats with a lowercase a by the way he was warming up to the subject now his face hurt when he talked but when he thought about what to say the hurt went away as did the vision of the cell where he would go next its the kind of thing that works best when you dont know whats in the payload of the data youre looking at that would just distract me its like a magicians trick with a rabbit or a glass of water you focus on the rabbit or on the water and what you expect of them and are flummoxed when the magician does something unexpected if he used pebbles though it might seem absolutely ordinary do you know what zbigniew krotoski was working on no theres no way for me to know that the streams are enciphered at the router with his public key and rescrambled after hes done with them its all zeroknowledge but you dont have zero knowledge do you lawrence found himself grinning which hurt a lot and which caused a little more blood to leak out of his nose and over his lips in a hot trickle well signals intelligence being what it is i was able to discover that it was a securitat stream and that it wasnt the first one hed worked on nor the first one hed altered he altered a stream lawrence lost his smile i hadnt told you that part yet had i no randy leaned forward but you will now the blue silk ribbons slid through lawrences mental fingers as he sat in his cell which was barely lit and tiny and padded and utterly devoid of furniture high above him a ring of glittering red leds cast no visible light they would be infrared lights the better for the hidden cameras to see him it was dark so he saw nothing but for the infrared cameras it might as well have been broad daylight the asymmetry was one of the things he inscribed on a blue ribbon and floated away the cell wasnt perfectly soundproof there was a gaseous hiss that reverberated through it every forty six to fifty three breaths which he assumed was the regular opening and shutting of the heavy door that led to the cellblock deep within the securitat building that would be a patrol or a regular report or someone with a weak bladder there was a softer regular grinding that he felt more than heard a subway train running very regular that was the new york rumble and it felt a little like his pans reassuring purring there was his breathing deep and oceanic and there was the sound in his minds ear the sound of the streamers hissing away into the ether hed gone out in the world and now hed gone back into a cell he supposed that it was meant to sweat him to make him mad to make him make mistakes but he had been trained by sixteen years in the order and this was not sweating him at all come along then the door opened with a cottonsoft sound from its balanced hinges letting light into the room and giving him the squints i wondered about your friends lawrence said all those people at the restaurant oh randy said he was a black silhouette in the doorway well you know honor among thieves rank hath its privileges they were caught he said everyone gets caught randy said i suppose its easy when everybody is guilty he thought of posy you just pick a skillset find someone with those skills and then figure out what that person is guilty of recruiting made simple not so simple as all that randy said youd be amazed at the difficulties we face zbigniew krotoski was one of yours randys silhouette now resolving into features clothes another sweater this one with a high collar and squaredoff shoulders made a little movement that lawrence knew meant yes randy was all tells no matter how suave and collected he seemed he must have been really up to something when they caught him come along randy said again and extended a hand to him he allowed himself to be lifted the scabs at his knees made crackling noises and there was the hot wet feeling of fresh blood on his calves do you withhold medical attention until i give you what you want is that it randy put an affectionate hand on his shoulder you seem to have it all figured out dont you not all of it i dont know why you havent told me what it is you want yet that would have been simpler i think i guess you could say that were just looking for the right way to ask you the way to ask me a question that i cant say no to was it the sister is that what you had on him he was useful because he was so eager to prove that he was smarter than everyone else you needed him to edit your own datastreams randy just looked at him calmly why would the securitat need to change its own streams why couldnt they just arrest whomever they wanted on whatever pretext they wanted whod be immune to then he realized whod be immune to the securitat the securitat would be you used him to nail other securitat officers randys blank look didnt change lawrence realized that he would never leave this building even if his body left now he would be tied to it forever he breathed he tried for that oceanic quality of breath the susurration of the blue silk ribbons inscribed with his worries it wouldnt come come along now randy said and pulled him down the corridor to the main door it hissed as it opened and behind it was an old securitat man legs crossed painfully weak bladder lawrence knew heres the thing randy said the system isnt going to go away no matter what we do the securitats here forever weve treated everyone like a criminal for too long now everyones really a criminal now if we dismantled tomorrow thered be chaos bombings murder sprees were not going anywhere randys office was comfortable he had some beautiful vintage circus posters the bearded lady the sword swallower the hoochiecoochie girl framed on the wall and a cracked leather sofa that made amiable exhalations of good tobacco smell mixed with years of saddle soap when he settled into it randy reached onto a tall mahogany bookcase and handed him down a firstaid kit there was a bottle of alcohol in it and a lot of gauze pads gingerly lawrence began to clean out the wounds on his legs and hands then started in on his face the blood ran down and dripped onto the slate tiled floor almost invisible randy handed him a wastepaper bin and it slowly filled with the bloody gauze looks painful randy said just skinned i have a vicious headache though thats the taser hangover it goes away theres some codeine tablets in the pillcase take it easy on them theyll put you to sleep while lawrence taped large pieces of gauze over the cleanedout corrugations in his skin randy tapped idly at a screen on his desk it felt almost as though hed dropped in on someones hotdesk back at the order lawrence felt a sharp knife of homesickness and wondered if gerta was ok do you really have a sister i do in oregon in the order does she work for you randy snorted of course not i wouldnt do that to her but the people who run me they know that they can get to me through her so in a sense we both work for them and i work for you thats the general idea zbigkrot spooked when you got onto him so hes long gone long gone as in this is one of those things where we dont say maybe he disappeared and got away clean took his sister with him maybe he disappeared into our operations not knowing is the kind of thing that keeps our other workers on their game and im one of your workers like i said the system isnt going anywhere you met the gang tonight weve all been caught at one time or another our little cozy club manages to make the best of things you saw us its not a bad life at all and we think that all things considered we make the world a better place someone would be doing our job might as well be us at least we manage to weed out the real retarded sadists he sipped a little coffee from a thermos cup on his desk thats where zbigkrot came in he helped you with retarded sadists for the most part power corrupts of course but it attracts the corrupt too theres a certain kind of person who grows up wanting to be a securitat officer and me you i would do this too you catch on fast the outside wall of campus was imposing tall sheathed in seamless metal painted uniform grey nothing grew for several yards around it as though the world was shrinking back from it how did zbigkrot get off campus thats a question that should have occurred to him when he left the campus he was embarrassed that it took him this long to come up with it but it was a damned good question trying to force the gate what was it the old brother on the gate had said pressurized blowouts the walls rigged to come down in an instant if zbigkrot had left hed walked out the normal way while someone at the gate watched him go and hed left no record of it someone working on campus had altered the stream of data fountaining off the front gate to remove the record of it there was more than one forger there it hadnt just been zbigkrot working for the securitat hed belonged in the order hed learned how to know himself how to see himself with the scalding objective logic that hed normally reserved for everyone else the anomaly had seemed like such a bit of fun like he was leveling up to the next stage of his progress he called greta theyd given him a new pan one that had a shunt that delivered a copy of all his data to the securitat since hed first booted it it had felt strange and invasive every buzz and warning coming with the haunted feeling the watched feeling you huh its very good to hear your voice he said he meant it he wondered if she knew about the securitats campus snitches he wondered if she was one but it was good to hear her voice his pan let him know that whatever he was doing was making him feel great he didnt need his pan to tell him that though i worried when you didnt check in for a couple days well about that yes if he told her shed be in it too if she wasnt already if he told her theyd figure out what they could get on her he should just tell her nothing just go on inside and twist the occasional datastream he could be better at it than zbigkrot no one would ever make an anomaly out of him besides so what if they did it would be a few hours days months or years that he could live on campus and if it wasnt him it would be someone else it would be someone else i just wanted to say good bye and thanks i suspect im not going to see you again off in the distance now the sound of the securitat vans happy little song his pan let him know that he was breathing quickly and shallowly and he slowed his breathing down until it let up on him lawrence he hung up the securitat van was visible now streaking toward the campus wall he closed his eyes and watched the blue satin ribbons tumble like silky water licking over a waterfall he could get to the place that campus took him to from anywhere that was all that mattered the pearl diver by caitlín r kiernan caitlín r kiernan is the author of seven novels including silk

the open for all the world to see here big brother isnt just watching you hes reporting you to your boss farasha kim opens her eyes at precisely six thirtyfour exactly one minute before the wakeup prompt woven into her pillow begins to bleat like an injured sheep shes been lying awake since at least three lying in bed listening to the constant gentle hum of the thermaspan and watching the darkness trapped behind her eyelids its better than watching the lesser more meaningful darkness of her tiny bedroom the lights from the unsleeping city outside the solid corner shadows that mercuryvapor streetlights and the headlights of passing trucks and cars never even touch her insomnia the wideawakeness that always follows the dreams renders the pillow app superfluous but shes afraid that muting it might tempt sleep that in the absence of its threat she might actually fall back to sleep and end up being late for work shes already been blackcited twice in the last five years once for failing to report another employees illegal use of noncorp software and once more for missing the start of an intradepartmental meeting on waste and oversight so its better safe than sorry farasha tells the bed that shes awake thank you and a moment later it ceases to bleat its tuesday so she has a single slice of toast with a smear of marmalade a hardboiled egg a red twentyfive milligram stimugel and an eightounce glass of soy milk for breakfast just like every other tuesday she leaves the dishes in the sink for later because the trains have been running a little early the past week or so she dresses quickly deciding that she can get by one more day without a shower deciding to wear black stockings instead of navy and shes out the door and waiting for the elevator by seven twentytwo her head already sizzling from the stimugel on the train she stares out at the wintergray landscape manhattan in midjanuary and listens to the cnn firstlight report over the trains tinny speakers the war in turkey the war in north africa the war in india an ecoterrorist attack in uruguay senate hearings on californias statefunded suicide camps the weather the stockmarket report the untimely death of an actor shes never seen the train races the clock across the hudson and into jersey and because its tuesday morning the firstlight anchorwoman reminds everyone that there will be no private operation of gasolinepowered motor vehicles until thursday morning at ten oclock eastern ten oclock pacific the day unfolds around her in no way that is noticeably different from any other tuesday farasha eats her lunch a chocolateflavored protein bar and an apple from the vending machines and is back at her desk three minutes before anyone else at one nineteen the network burps and everyone in datatrak and receiving is advised to crossfile and reboot at one minute past three the fat guy five desks over from her laughs aloud to himself and is duly docked twelve points plus five percent for inattentive behavior he glances nervously at the nearest observer risking another citation risking unemployment and then goes back to work at four thirtyeight the lights on the fourth floor dim themselves for seven minutes because it is tuesday and even the corporations are willing to make these inconvenient necessary sacrifices in the interest of energy conservation good examples are set at the top after all at six pm as a light snow begins to fall she walks alone with all the others to the palisades station and takes the lev back across the river back to the city on the train she watches the snow and the lights dotting the gathering night and listens indifferently to the cnn winddown broadcast the stimugel capsule is wearing off early and she reminds herself to mention it to her physician next month it wouldnt be the first time shes needed her dosage adjusted farasha is home by seven thirty and she changes clothes trading the black stockings for bare legs then eats her dinner a spongy slice of vegetarian meatloaf with a few spoonfuls of green peas and carrots on the side a stale wheat roll and a cup of hot sweetened mint tea the tea is good at least and she sips the last of it in front of the television two blackandwhite popeye the sailor cartoons and one with tom and jerry her company therapist recommended cartoons in the evening and she enjoys them though they dont seem to do anything for her insomnia or the nightmares her insurance would cover sleep mods and rem reconditioning but she knows its best not to make too much of the bad dreams its not something she wants on her record not something she wants her supervisors getting curious about she shuts off the television at nine oclock does the dishes takes the short cold shower shes been putting off for three days and then checks her mail before bed theres something wordy and unimportant from her half sister in montreal an ad for breast enhancement that slipped through the spamblock a reminder that city elections are only a month away and shes required by company policy to vote gop and something else thats probably only more spam farasha reads the vague header on the fourth item invitation transcend then tells the computer to empty the inbox she touches the upper lefthand corner of the screen an index finger pressed against and then into the phosphor triangle and it vanishes the wall above the kitchen counter is only a wall again she brushes her teeth flosses takes a piss then washes her hands and is in bed by nine fortysix she falls asleep ten or twenty minutes later trying not to think about the dreams or the next day concentrating on the steady roar of a water sweeper moving slowly methodically along mercer street farasha kim was born in trenton the year before the beginning of the panamericaneuropean birth lottery to a saudi mother and a korean father she was one of the last freeborn children in the u s though she doesnt see this as a point of pride farasha has never bothered with the lottery not with the birthdefect rate what it is these days and not when there are already more than ten billion people in the world most of them living in conditions she prefers not contemplate her father a molecular biochemist at columbia university has told her more than once that her own birth was an accident and illtimed and she has no wish to repeat any of the mistakes of her parents she grew up in lower manhattan suffering the impeccably programmed attentions of the nanny mechs that did the work her mother and father couldnt be bothered with sometimes in the uncomfortable dreams that wake her every night farasha is a child again shes five or eight or even eleven and theres usually a nagging sense of loss of disappointment and sadness when she wakes to discover herself aged to thirtyseven years in one recurring dream repeated at least twice a month shes eight and on a school field trip to the museum of modern art she stands with the edumechs and other children all nameless in the fickle memory of her unconsciousness gazing up at an enormous canvas hung on a wide white wall there are no other paintings on the wall a towering rectangle of pigment and coldpressed linseed oil sweeping arcs of color a riot of blues and greens and pinks and violets sea foam and rising bubbles the sandy sundappled floor of a tropical lagoon coral and giant clams and the teardrop bodies of fish positioned near the center is the figure of a woman a naked woman her skin almost the same shade of brown as farashas own swimming towards the shimmering mirror surface her arms outstretched air streaming from her wide nostrils and open mouth her strong legs driving her up and up and up and near the bottom of the painting lurking in lower lefthand shadows theres a shark with snowtipped caudal and dorsal fins it isnt clear whether or not the shark poses an immediate danger to the swimmer but the threat is plain to see theres a label fixed to the wall beneath the painting black lettering stark against all that white so she knows its titled the pearl diver no such painting has ever hung at moma shes inquired more than once shes also searched online databases and library hardcopies but has found no evidence that the painting is anything but a fabrication of her dreaming mind shes never mentioned it to her therapist or to anyone else for that matter in her dream one of the children never precisely the same child twice asks one of the edumechs what the woman in the painting is doing and the droid answers patiently first explaining what pearls are in case some of its students might not know a natural pearl the mech says forms by secretions from the epithelial cells in the mantle of some mollusks such as oysters deposited in successive layers about an irritating foreign object often a parasitic organism layers of aragonite or calcite the crystalline forms of calcium carbonate accumulate but the eightyearold farasha is always more interested in the painting itself the brushstroke movement and color of the painting than in the mere facts behind its subject matter and she concentrates on the canvas while the mech talks she tunes it out and the other children too and the walls of the museum and the marble floor beneath her feet she tastes the impossibly clean saltwater getting into her mouth and her oxygenstarved lungs ache for air beneath her the shark moves silently forward a silverbluegray ghost propelled by the powerful sidetoside sweeps of its tall heterocercal tail it knows things that she can only guess things that she will never see even in dreams eventually the droid finishes with all the twists and turns of its encyclopedia reply and ushers the other children towards the next painting in the gallery but farasha is left behind unnoticed forgotten abandoned because she can no longer separate herself from the pearl diver her face and hands are stained with paint and shes still rising struggling for the glistening surface that seems to be getting father away instead of nearer she wonders if people can drown in paintings and kicks her legs again going nowhere at all the sharks dull eyes roll back like the eyes of something dead or dying and its jaws gape open wide to reveal the abyss waiting for her past the rows and rows of ragged teeth eternity in there all the eternity she might ever have imagined or feared and the canvas pulls her in and sometimes she wakes up and sometimes she drifts down through frost and darkness filled with anxious whispering voices and sometimes the dream architecture collapses and becomes another dream entirely theres a small plastic box on farashas bedroom dressing table polyethylene terephthalate molded and colored to look like carved ivory and inside are three perfect antique pearls from a broken strand that once belonged to one of her arab greatgrandmothers her mother gave her the pearls as a birthday present many years ago and shes been told that theyre worth a lot of money the oyster species that produced them has been extinct for almost a hundred years sometimes she goes to the dressing table after the dream and opens the plastic box takes out one or two or all three of the pearls and carries them back to bed with her in her sweating sleepless palms they feel very heavy as good as stone or lead and she cant imagine how anyone could have ever worn an entire necklace of them strung about her neck on those mornings after the pearl diver when its finally six thirtyfive and the pillow has begun to bleat at her farasha gets up and returns the heirloom pearls to their box which they share with the few inexpensive unremarkable pieces of jewelry that she owns she never takes the pearls out any other time and she tries not to think about them she would gladly forget them would sell them off for whatever she could get if the dream would stop and after tuesday there is wednesday and then thursday and friday each inevitable in its turn and each distinguishable from the other only by its own specific monotony farasha works saturday because her department fell behind last month by twelve and three quarters over the previous month and because she has nothing else to do she dreads her days off and avoids them when she can however her employer does not encourage voluntary overtime as clinical studies have shown repeatedly that it decreases the value of overtime as an effective deterrent to the myriad transgressions that must be guarded against at every turn she takes her extra days and hours on campus whenever she can get them and wishes for more on sunday there is no work and she isnt religious so she doesnt go to church either instead she sits alone in her tworoom apartment on canal street the intermittent snow showers of the last four days have been replaced by a torrential rain which drums loudly against her window for lunch she has a can of cheese ravioli and a few slices of dried pear then tries again to get interested in a romance fic she downloaded the weekend before she sits in the comfortable chair beside her bed the lines of text scrolling tediously by on her portable hidden sensors reading the motion of her eyes from word to word sentence to sentence when the computer detects her growing disinterest it asks if she would prefer the fic be read aloud to her and farasha declines shes never liked being read to by machines though she cant recall ever having been read to by a human my mail please she says and the fic dissolves becoming instead the inbox of her corporate account theres a reminder for a planning meeting on monday morning a catalog from a pharmaceutical spa in nevada and another mail with the subject line invitation transcend she starts to tell the computer to delete all three even though it would probably mean a warning from interdept comms for failing to read an official memorandum instead she taps the screen with the nail of her left index finger tapping invitation transcend before she can think better of it the portable advises her that all unsolicited mail if read is immediately noted and filed with the homeland bureau of casual correspondence and the federal bureau of investigation and asks her if she still wishes to open the file she tells it yes and the blue and white hbccfbi notice is promptly replaced with the body of the message she notes at once that the senders address is not displayed even though the portable is running the corporations own custom version of microsoft panoptic farasha shifts in the chair and its legs squeak loudly against the tile floor squeaking like the sleek quick rats that infest the buildings basement the message reads simply invitation transcend final nd outreach imminent your presence is requested delivery complete and confidential guaranteed there is meaning in you and outside still you shall see that wholeness regained through communion with the immaculate appetite one way sonepur baudh mahanadi this overture will not be repeated open doors do not remain open forever ms kim please expect contact merciful closure shantih amen off bullshit farasha mutters scanning the message once more and finding it even more opaque and ridiculous the second time through someone had obviously managed to hack the drop tank again and this was his or her or its idea of a joke delete all she says hearing the annoyance in her voice wondering how long its been since shes sounded that way too late she remembers the unread memorandum on monday mornings meeting and a second later the portable informs her that the inbox is now empty and that a federal complaint has been filed on her behalf she stares at the screen for a long moment at the omnipresent corporate logo and the blinking cursor floating just slightly left of center then farasha requests a search and when the computer asks her for parameters she types in two unfamiliar words from the vanished invitation transcend message sonepur and mahanadi she thought the latter looked hindi and isnt surprised when it turns out to be a river in central and eastern india and sonepur is a city located at the confluence of the mahanadi and tel rivers in the eastern part of the subarnapur district most of the recent articles on sonepur concern repeated bioweapon attacks on the city by pakistanibacked guerrilla forces six months earlier there are rumors that the retroviral agent involved may have originated somewhere in china and the loss of life is estimated to have been staggering a general quarantine of sonepur remains in effect but few other details are available the computer reminds farasha that searches involving military interests will be noted and filed with the greater office of homeland security the fbi cia and interpol she frowns and shuts off the portable setting it down on the small bamboo table beside the bed tomorrow shell file an appeal on the search citing the strange piece of mail as just cause her record is good and theres nothing to worry about outside the rain is coming down harder than ever falling like it means to wash manhattan clean or drown it trying and she sits listening to the storm wishing that she could have gone into work monday again after the mornings meeting and farasha is sitting at her desk someone whispers woolgathering and she turns her head to see whos spoken but its only nadine palmer who occupies the first desk to her right nadine palmer who seems intent on ignoring company policy regarding unnecessary speech and whos likely to find herself unemployed if she keeps it up farasha knows better than to tempt the monitors by replying to the question instead she glances down at the pad in front of her the sloppy black lines her stylus has traced on the silverblue screen the two hindi wordssonepur and mahanadi the city and the river two words that have nothing whatsoever to do with the nakamuraito account shes scribbled them over and over one after the other farasha wonders how long shes been sitting there daydreaming and if anyone besides nadine has noticed she looks at the clock and sees that theres only ten minutes left before lunch then clears the pad she stays at her desk through the lunch hour to make up the twelve minutes she squandered woolgathering she isnt hungry anyway at precisely two p m all the others come back from their midday meals and farasha notices that nadine palmer has a small stain that looks like ketchup on the front of her pink blouse at three twentyfour farasha completes her second postanalysis report of the day at four thirteen she begins to wish that she hadnt found it necessary to skip lunch and at four fiftysix she receives a voicecall informing her that shes to appear in mr binders office on the tenth floor no later than a quarter past five failure to comply will of course result in immediate dismissal and forfeiture of all unemployment benefits and references farasha thanks the very polite yet very adamant young man who made the call then straightens her desk and shuts off her terminal before walking to the elevator her mouth has gone dry and her heart is beating too fast by the time the elevator doors slide open opening for her like the jaws of an oilpaint shark theres a knot deep in her belly and she can feel the sweat beginning to bead on her forehead and upper lip mr binders office has a rhododendron in a terracotta pot and a view of the river and the city beyond you are ms kim he asks not looking up from his desk hes wearing a navyblue suit with a teal necktie and whats left of his hair is the color of milk yes sir youve been with the company for a long time now havent you it says here that youve been with us since college yes sir i have but you deleted an unread interdepartmental memorandum yesterday didnt you that was an accident id intended to read it but you didnt no sir she replies and glances at the rhododendron may i ask what is your interest in india ms kim and at first she has no idea what hes talking about then she remembers the letter invitation transcend and her web search on the two words shed caught herself doodling earlier in the day none sir i can explain i understand that there was an incident report filed yesterday evening with the gohs a report filed against you ms kim are you aware of that yes sir id meant to file an appeal this morning it slipped my mind and what are your interests in india he asks her again and looks up finally and smiles an impatient smile at her i have no interest in india sir i was just curious thats all because of a letter a letter well not really a letter not exactly just a piece of spam that got through why would you read unsolicited mail he asks i dont know i cant say it was the second time id received it and kim is that chinese no sir its korean yes of course it is i trust you understand our position in this very delicate matter ms kim we appreciate the work youve done here im sure and regret the necessity of this action but we cant afford a federal investigation because one of our employees cant keep her curiosity in check yes sir farasha says quietly the knot in her stomach winding itself tighter as something icy thats not quite panic or despair washes over and through her i understand thank you ms kim an agent will be in contact regarding your severance do not return to your desk an officer will escort you off the campus and then its over five nineteen by the clock on mr binders office wall and shes led from the building by a silent woman with shiny videocapture eyes from the building and all the way back to the palisades lev station where the officer waits with her until the next train back to manhattan arrives and shes aboard its raining again by the time farasha reaches canal street a light misting rain thatll probably turn to sleet before morning she thinks about her umbrella tucked beneath her desk as she waits for the security code to clear and the lobby door to open no she thinks by now theyll have gotten rid of it by now theyll have cleared away any evidence i was ever there she takes the stairs enough of elevators for one day and by the time she reaches her floor shes breathless and a little lightheaded theres a faintly metallic taste in her mouth and she looks back down the stairwell picturing her body lying limp and broken at the very bottom im not a coward she says aloud her voice echoing between the concrete walls and then farasha closes the red door marked exit and walks quickly down the long fluorescentlit hallway to her apartment at least its hers until the tenant committee gets wind of her dismissal of the reasons behind her dismissal and files a petition for her relocation with the housing authority someone has left a large manila envelope lying on the floor in front of her door she starts to bend over to pick it up then stops and glances back towards the door to the stairs looks both ways up and down the hall to be sure that shes alone she briefly considers pressing on the keypad and letting someone in the lobby deal with this she knows it doesnt matter if theres no one else in the hallway to see her pick up the envelope because the cameras will record it fuck it all she says reaching for the envelope they cant very well fire me twice theres a lot left they can do she thinks some mean splinter of her thats still concerned with the possibility of things getting worse you dont even want to know all the things left they can do to you farasha picks up the envelope anyway her name has been handwritten on the front printed in black ink neat blocky letters at least an inch high and beneath her name in somewhat smaller lettering are two words invitation transcend the envelope is heavier than she expected something more substantial inside than paper she taps her code into the keypad and the front door buzzes loudly and pops open farasha takes a moment to reset the locks eightdigit code violating the terms of her lease as well as one municipal and two federal ordinances then takes the envelope to the kitchen counter inside the manila envelope there are a number of things which she spreads out across the countertop then examines one by one theres a single yellowed page torn from an old book the paper is brittle and theres no indication what the book might have been the top of the page bears the header childhood of the human hero so perhaps that was the title at the bottom is a page number and the following paragraph has been marked with a blue highlighter the feats of the beloved hindu savior krishna during his infant exile among the cowherds of gokula and brindaban constitute a lively cycle a certain goblin named putana came in the shape of a beautiful woman but with poison in her breasts she entered the house of yasoda the foster mother of the child and made herself very friendly presently taking the baby in her lap to give it suck but krishna drew so hard that he sucked away her life and she fell dead reassuming her huge and hideous form when the foul corpse was cremated however it emitted a sweet fragrance for the divine infant had given the demoness salvation when he had drunk her milk at the bottom of the page written with a pencil in very neat precise cursive are three lines farasha recognizes from t s eliot and i will show you something different from eitheryour shadow morning striding behind youor your shadow evening rising up to meet you there are three newspaper clippings held together with a somewhat rusty gem clip all regarding the use of biological agents by propakistani forces in sonepur and baudh which turns out to be another city on the mahanadi river more than three million are believed dead one article states though the quarantine has made an accurate death toll impossible and the final number may prove to be many times that both the cdc and who have been refused entry into the contaminated areas and the nature of the contagion remains unclear there are rumors of vast fires burning out of control along the river and of mass disappearances in neighboring towns and she reads the names of sikh and assamese rebel leaders who have been detained or executed there is a stoppered glass vial containing what looks to farasha like soot perhaps half a gram of the black powder and the vial is sealed with a bit of orange tape there is a photocopy of an eightyearold nasa press release on the chemical composition of waterice samples recovered from the lunar north pole and another on the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons oxidized sulfide compounds and carbonate globules in a meteorite discovered embedded in the middle devonianaged rocks of antarcticas mt gudmundson in july finally theres the item which gave the envelope its unexpected weight a silvery metallic disk about ten centimeters in diameter and at least two centimeters thick its edges are beveled and marked by a deep groove and there is a pronounced dimple in the center of one side matching a swelling at the center of the other the metal is oddly warm to the touch and though it seems soft almost pliant in her hands when farasha tries to scratch it with a steak knife shes unable to leave even the faintest mark she glances at the clock on the wall above the refrigerator and realizes that more than two hours have passed since she sat down with the envelope that she has no sense of so much time having passed unnoticed and the realization makes her uneasy i have slipped and fallen off the earth she thinks remembering mr binders potted rhododendron not even time can find me now and then she looks back at the contents of the manila envelope is it a riddle she asks aloud asking no one or herself or whoever left the package at her doorstep am i supposed to understand any of this for an answer her stomach growls loudly and farasha glances at the clock again adding up all the long hours since breakfast she leaves the papers the glass vial the peculiar metal disk the empty envelope all of it lying on the countertop and makes herself a cheddarcheese sandwich with brown mustard she pours a glass of soy milk and sits down on the kitchen floor even unemployed ghosts have to eat she thinks and laughs softly to herself even dead women drifting alone in space get hungry now and then when shes finished she sets the dirty dishes in the sink and goes back to her stool at the counter back to pondering the things from the envelope outside the rain has turned to sleet just as she suspected it would and it crackles coldly against the windows the child reaches out her hand straining to touch the painting and her fingertips dip into salty cool water her lips part and air escapes through the space between her teeth and floats in swirling glassy bubbles towards the surface of the sea she kicks her feet and the sharks sandpaper skin slices through the gloom making a sound like metal scraping stone if she looked down towards the sandy place where giant clams lie in secret coral and anemoneencrusted gardens shed see sparks fly as the great fish cuts its way towards her the sea is not her protector and isnt taking sides she came to steal after all and the shark is only doing what sharks have done for the last four hundred and fifty million years its nothing personal nothing she hasnt been expecting the child cries out and pulls her hand back her fingers are stained with paint and smell faintly of low tide and turpentine the rivers burning and the night sky is the color of an apocalypse white temples of weathered stone rise from the whispering jungles ancient monuments to alien gods shiva parvati kartikeya brushava ganesha crumbling prayers to pale blue skins and borrowed tusks farasha looks at the sky and the stars have begun to fall drawing momentary lines of clean white fire through the billowing smoke heaven will intercede and this ruined world will pass away and rise anew from its own gray ashes a helicopter drifts above the bloody river like a great insect of steel and spinning rotors and she closes her eyes before it sees her i was never any good with riddles she says when mr binder asks her about the package again why she touched it why she opened it why she read all the things inside it isnt a riddle he scolds and his voice is thunder and waves breaking against rocky shores and wind through the trees its a gift i was never any good with gifts either she replies watching as the glass vial from the manila envelope slips from his fingers and begins the long descent towards her kitchen floor it might fall for a hundred years for a hundred thousand years but shell never be quick enough to catch it the child reaches deep into the painting again deeper than before and now the water has gone as cold as ice and burns her hand she grits her teeth against the pain and feels the shark brush past her frozen skin if its not already within you no one can put it there the droid says to her as it begins to unbutton the pink ketchupstained blouse she doesnt remember putting on we have no wombs but those which open for us i told you im not any good with riddles farasha is standing naked in her kitchen bathed in the light of falling stars and burning rivers and the fluorescent tubes set into the low ceiling theres a girl in a rumpled school uniform standing nearby her back turned to farasha watching the vial from the envelope as it tumbles end over end towards the floor the childs hands and forearms are smeared with greasy shades of cobalt and jade and hyacinth you have neither love nor the hope of love the girl says you have neither purpose nor a dream of purpose you have neither pain nor freedom from pain then she turns her head looking over her right shoulder at farasha you dont even have a job did you do that you did didnt you you opened the envelope the child says and smiles knowingly then turns back to the falling vial youre the one who read the message the shark is coming for her an engine of blood and cartilage dentine and bone an engine forged and perfected without love or the hope of love without purpose or freedom from pain the air in her lungs expands as she rises and her exhausted unperfect primate muscles have begun to ache and cramp this is not your world the shark growls and shes not surprised that it has her mothers voice you gave all this shit up aeons ago you crawled out into the slime and the sun looking for god remember it was an invitation thats all the girl says and shrugs the vial is only a few inches from the floor now youre free to turn us away there will always be others i dont understand what youre saying farasha tells the girl and then takes a step back anticipating the moment when the vial finally strikes the hard tile floor then stop trying sonepur that wasnt our doing the girl says and shakes her head a man did that men would make a weapon of the entire cosmos given enough time i dont know what youre offering me the girl turns to face farasha holding out one paintstained hand there are three pearls resting in her palm the jungle echoes with rifle and machine gun fire and the dull violence of faraway explosions the muddy crooked path that farasha has taken from the river bank ends at the steps of a great temple and the air here is choked with the sugary scent of nightblooming flowers bright and corpulent blooms which almost manage to hide the riper stink of dead things but from out your own flesh the girl says her eyes throwing sparks now like the shark rushing towards her the fruit of your suffering farasha kim not these inconsequential baubles im afraid farasha whispers not wanting to cry and she begins to climb the temple steps taking them cautiously one at a time the vial from the envelope shatters scattering the sooty black powder across her kitchen floor thats why im here the child says and smiles again she makes a fist closing her hand tightly around the three pearls as a vertical slit appears in the space between farashas bare breasts its edges red and puckered like a slowly healing wound the slit opens wide to accept the childs seeds the pain farasha feels is not so very different from the pain shes felt her entire life farasha opens her eyes in the notquiteempty moments left after the dream and she squints at the silver disk from the manila envelope its hovering a couple of inches above the countertop spinning clockwise and emitting a low mechanical whine a pencilthin beam of light leaks from the dimple on the side facing upwards light the lonely color of a winter sky before heavy snow the beam is slightly wider where it meets the ceiling than where it exits the disk and the air smells like ozone she rubs her eyes and sits up her back pops and her neck is stiff from falling asleep at the kitchen counter her mouth is dry and tastes vaguely of the things she ate for her supper she glances from the spinning disk to the glass vial still stoppered and sealed with a strip of orange tape and her left hand goes slowly to the space between her breasts farasha presses three fingers against the thin barrier of cloth and muscle and skin covering her sternum halfexpecting something on the other side to press back but theres nothing nothing at all except the faint rhythm of her heart and she reaches for the vial her hand is shaking and it rolls away from her and disappears over the far edge of the counter a second or two later theres the sound of breaking glass the disk is spinning faster now and the light shining from the dimple turns a bruised violet she looks down at the scatter of paper and her eyes settle on the three handwritten lines from the waste land she reads them aloud and they feel wild and irrevocable on her tongue poetry become the components of an alchemical rite or the constituent symbols in some algebraic equation and i will show you something different from eitheryour shadow at morning striding behind youor your shadow at evening rising up to meet you nine seven ten dividing into thirtyeight syllables one hundred and nineteen characters but what if i wont listen she thinks what if i wont see and shes answered at once by the voice of a child the voice of a brown woman who dives for gems in a painted ocean the wordless voice of the sooty particles from the broken vial as they fill the air farashas breathing and find their way deep inside her thats why im here remember the voices reply almost speaking in unison now a secret choir struggling for harmony and the disk on the counter stops suddenly and then begins to spin in the opposite direction the beam of light has turned a garish scarlet and it pulsates in time to her racing heart the contagion is faster than she ever could have imagined and this is not the pain from her dream this is pain doubled and redoubled pain become something infinitely greater than mere electrical impulses passed between neurons and the folds of her simple mammalian brain but farasha understands finally and she doesnt struggle as the soot begins its work of taking her apart and putting her back together another way dividing polypeptide chains and inserting its own particular amino acids before it zips them shut again and her stolen body like the fractured ephemeral landscape of her nightmares becomes something infinitely mutable altered from second to second to second living tissue as malleable as paint on a bare canvas there is not death here and there is no longer loneliness or fear boredom or the dread of whatevers coming next with eyes that have never truly seen before this moment farasha watches at her soul fills up with pearls dead space for the unexpected by geoff ryman geoff ryman is

like office spacecreations that sank their teeth into american corporate culture to reveal the hollow interior of a life spent in a cubicle there may have been stock options up for grabs and iras growing in the bank but nothing could make up for soulless grind of bad bosses and constant scrutiny our next story could have been written for dom portwood office spaces detestably droning middle management icon if dom had access to the kind of technology our next protagonist uses to dig into his underlings the film would have gone from darkly funny to deeply depressing this is a working world not much different from our own a dystopian society just a few notches up the corporate ladder jonathan was going to have to fire simon it was a big moment in jonathans day a solid achievement from the point of view of the company jonathan knew that his handling of the whole procedure had been model so far he had warned simon a month ago that termination was a possibility and that plans should be made jonathan knew that he had felt all the appropriate feelings sympathy regret and an echoing in himself of the sick sad panic of redundancy well if you have sincere emotion hang onto it use it hell there had even been a sting of tears around the bottom of his eyes as he told simon jonathans score for that session had been out of a personal best for a counseling episode now he had to be even better the entire teams average had nosedived so had jonathans own scores he the team needed a good score next months printouts were at stake so jonathan waited in the meeting room with a sign up on the door that said in use on his eyes were contact lenses that were marked for accurate measurement and which flickered and swerved as his eyes moved there was a bright pattern of stripes and squares and circles on his shirt to highlight breathing patterns galvanic skin resistance was monitored by his watch strap it was of course a voluntary program designed to give managers and staff alike feedback on their performance there was a knock on the door and simon came in handsome neat running a bit to fat fiftytwo years old it would be the benches for simon the park benches in summer with the civic chess board with the missing pieces then the leaves and seasonal chill in autumn winter would be the packed and steamy public library with the unwashed bodies and the waiting for a chance to read the job ads check the terminals scan the benefits information it would be byebye to clean shirts ties without food stains a desk the odd bottle of wine pride for just a moment jonathan saw it all clearly in his mind either you were a performer or you werent hi simon have a good weekend yes thank you said simon as he sat down his face impassive his movements contained and neat jonathan sighed i wanted to give you this now before i sent it to anyone else i wanted you to be the first to know im very sorry jonathan held out a sealed white blank envelope simon primed for a month simply nodded i hope you know theres nothing personal in this ive tried to explain why its necessary but just to be clear there has been a severe drop in our performance and we simply must up our averages and be seen to be taking some positive action in terms of more staff training that sort of thing already this was not going well the opening line about the weekend could not be less appropriate and nobody was going to think that being fired was a positive step or care two hoots about the training other people were going to get inwardly jonathan winced anyway he shrugged with regret still holding out the envelope that simon had not taken jonathan tossed it across the table and it spun on a cushion of air across the woodpatterned surface simon made no move to pick it up we all get old he said you will too and when my scores slip said jonathan trying to generate some fellow feeling i expect the same thing will happen to me i hope so said simon right counseling mode jonathan remembered his training unfortunately so did simon they had been on the same courses are you angry would you like to talk said jonathan remembering keep steady eye contact or rather contact with the forehead or bridge of the nose which is less threatening lean backwards so less aggression but echo body language simon smiled slightly and started to pick his nose very messily and look at the result he held the result up towards jonathan as if to say echo this jonathan nodded as if in agreement its only natural that you should feel some resentment but it might be more constructive if you expressed it verbally you know say what you feel blow off some steam if not to me then to someone the welfare officer perhaps i dont need to blow off steam said simon and stood up and walked to the door procedures were not being followed discipline was important simon you havent taken your letter simon stood at the door for a moment its not my letter its not written for me its addressed to personnel so they can stop paying me boy thought jonathan if you were still being marked youd be in trouble buddy you forget said simon his blue eyes gray and flinty i used to work in accounts he picked up the letter paused and wiped his finger on it then he left the room jonathan sat at the table trembling with rage fuck counseling he wanted to haul off and slug the guy he took a deep breath just like in the handling stress course then stood up and left the meeting room remembering to change the sign on the door vacant it said back in his own office he checked his score it was bad form to check your scores too often it showed insecurity but jonathan couldnt help himself he verballed to the computer performance feedback dayplan item one his mark was higher than he had thought it would be well over a five and edging towards a for a pretty tough situation but it was not the high score the team needed it was three minutes ahead of schedule dayplan complete he verballed and his day was laid out before him on the screen simon hasley actioned dayplan confirmed and in tray sally meeting prep sally meeting sales meeting william dead space for the unexpected it was important that work was seen to be prioritized that nothing stayed on the desk or queued up on the machine it all had to be handled in the right order the computer worked that out for you from the priority rating you gave each item gave you optimum work times and the corporate cost and if you did not object those were your targets for the first half of the day right intray there was a management report on purchasing jonathan did not purchase but he needed to know the new procedures his finance officer was supposed to follow so make that a priority eight book in a reading for it next week and ask for the machine to prepare a performance next was a memo with spreadsheet from admin admin acted as a kind of prophylactic against accounts giving early warning of what would strike accounts as below par performance jonathans heart sank late invoices holy shit not again an average of twelve days thanks a lot george thanks a fucking lot shit piss fuck ill cut off that goddamned assholes head and stick it up his own greased asshole hoboy jonathan thats anger channel it use it right we got ourselves a priority one here schedule it in dead space jonathan slammed his way into georges network terminal which at in the morning was not switched on priority george we have a serious issue to discuss can you come to my office at am today thursday th please come with figures on speed of invoicing j rosson iii nc jr there goes our cash flow down the fucking tube and interest payments to the centre great there was a fretful knocking at his door jonathan could guess who it was two minutes was all the time he had in came harriet gray hair flying what you might call an individual jonathan swiveled knowing his body language showed no surprise or alarm his greeting was warm friendly in control so far so good hello harriet good to see you but im afraid im up against it this morning i expect youve heard about simon yes i have actually said harriet eyes bright smile wide she was preparing to sit down no my door is not always open dont mess with my time management lady id love to talk to you about it when i can give you some time how about this morning this will only take a minute harriet was still smiling a tough old bird i doubt that very much its an important issue and id like to talk to you about it properly with a flourish he keyed her into his dayplan there we go see you then harriet accepted defeat with good grace lovely she said ill look forward to that she even gave him a sweet little wave as she left poor old cow is scared thought jonathan well there are no plans to get rid of her so that should be a fairly easy session next up came a report on a new initiative in timekeeping a hobby horse of jonathans was a priority one justified just because he was interested in it he decided to downgrade it show he was keeping a sense of proportion that he was a team player he gave it a two and booked it in for friday he was behind schedule thanks harriet next was a note of praise for a job well done from that crawler jason the guy even writes memos to apologize for not writing memos jonathan wastebinned it with a grin next was a welfare report on the teams resident schizophrenic jonathan was sure the poor guy had been hired just to give them a bit of an obstacle to show jump the welfare officer was asking him to counsel the man to reduce his smoking in the office but he was to remember that the stress of giving up smoking could trigger another schizophrenic episode oh come on this really must be a monitoring exercise jonathan thought a moment he should therefore show that he knew it was an exercise and not take it too seriously so he delegated he dumped the whole report off his own screen and into the dayplan of his supporting officer and so five minutes to prep for sally jeez thought jonathan i hope im not showing not showing fear which meant of course that he was simply sally was one of the big boys she was the same grade as jonathan a on a level d but she was younger whiplash quick utterly charming and she always won jonathan knew her scores were infinitely better than his own sally had been naughty her division and his team had to cooperate on projects that were both above and below the line without telling him she had called a meeting on his own grade s flattered them no end and then got the poor lambs to agree just as a point of procedure that all joint projects would be registered with her division this would cost his team about three hundred thousand a year in turnover jonathan had countered with a report on procedures reminding all concerned that such decisions needed to be made at divisional level and suggesting a more thorough procedural review sally had countered with enthusiastic agreement deadly but said a joint presentation on procedures might eliminate misunderstanding the difference between discussion and presentation was the difference between procedures up for grabs and procedures already set and agreed when jonathan pointed this out at a divisional liaison sally had said awwww as if he were a hurt suspicious child she had even started to counsel him in front of management jonathan had never felt so angry so outmaneuvered now his team had noticed pieces of artwork they should have controlled going elsewhere and wanted him to do something about it too late guys bloody harry his boss was too dim to see what had happened or too feeble to fight harry had agreed to the presentation so he told himself the posture has to be teamwork cooperation between different parts of the same organization steer like hell to get back what he could and keep smiling he put his phone and mail through to support and went downstairs sallys office was neater than his own and had tiny white furniture it was like sitting on porcelain teacups he was sure she chose the furniture deliberately to make large men feel clumsy sally offered him coffee christ what was his caffeine count already too many stimulants you lost points was she trying to jangle him get him shaky oh great thanks he said white with one sugar help yourself she said her smile was warm and friendly what she meant was help yourself im not your mother real cream acknowledged jonathan as he poured nothing but the best is good enough for us said sally she was luxuriantly made up frosted with sheen she sat down opposite him her hair was in different streaks of honey beige and blonde and she was slim under her sharp and padded suit her entire mien was sociable and open inviting trust thanks for the report she said it was very useful and i really want to thank you for organizing the presentation for us jonathan had fought it every step of the way my pleasure he said we really need to get the two teams together to talk i just want to be clear that what were aiming to do is work towards a set of procedures for shared work which keeps everything going to the right people sally nodded but she didnt speak jonathan doublechecked am i right her smile broadened just a stretch uhhuh we do have a set of procedures that your own staff agreed not all my staff and not the quality action units who should have been involved the idea is to empower everyone in the organization well im sure we can iron out any points of difference refer them to the quasi ok jonathan played back the same trick an uncommitted shrug but it was one up to him a peace offering sally kept on i also thought that we should present to you first most of my staff are familiar with what you do but our cd rom work is new and we need to go over it with your team can i let her get away with that the clock was ticking his heart was racing caffeine and three hundred thousand smackers basically her staff would not be there say just three of them they would have the floor and the agenda but his people would outnumber them and it would be very easy to take pot shots from the audience on balance yes he could go along with that so he agreed they set dates and agreed how to split the cost of wine and food sally gave him a warm and enveloping smile as he left climbing back up the stairs he reckoned he had scored a five she still had the initiative shed gone no distance towards giving up registration of his jobs but then it could be argued that harry had given them away i got some points across but anyone could see i was tense jeez why do i do it to myself right now it was billy then dead space then the brief on the commission tender then lunch lunch with harry his boss harry was shy and hated schmoozing which was endearing in a boss if only he didnt wring his hands for hours at a time and utterly fail to make decisions jonathan braced himself for an hour of whining jonathan used to work out at lunchtime till he realized that he scored a full higher if he socialgrazed instead he was climbing the stairs now to keep fit though he was not too sure if anyone was noticing for some reason he was feeling mean when william arrived for the sales meeting template jonathan snapped at him williams eyes glittered look at those lenses dive for cover william was in his early twenties uncomely gay nervous he was supposed to have the agreed agenda and a place for agreed action notes ah its just here when william found his sheet the agenda section was left blank jonathan tapped the white space and chuckled and shook his head like an indulgent father billy billy what am i going to do with you couldnt you remember to print it out here use mine and photocopy it to me after the meeting did we get the form letters out billy had well what do you know all sixty great thanks very much now the new fax number we sent all our customers the new fax number right fine then why did the commission fax us a copy of a tender brief on the old number billys face fell they sent us a tender billy and it went to our old number which is with interactive media now who are not necessarily our greatest chums where it sat for a full afternoon so now we have four days instead of a working week to develop a full tender with designs do you see the problem here billy face went white and distressed the real problem jonathan cursed to himself is that management expects me to make sales without any funding so i have to use poor billy from support who is as sweet as a lamb but jeez jonathan watched as william scrambled through his shaggy files ok jonathan decided to try a new management technique he tried to make himself fancy billy sexually lla low level attraction could generate good team bonding in fact people with low to middle bisexuality scores had a favoured startinggun profile so jonathan looked at billy and tried but billy had chalk white skin and lank black hair and spots the thick clotted dumb kind of spot that never comes to a head i hate this guy this puny nervy little idiot i just cant resist trying to break him um said billy miserable balancing his spreadeagled file on his lap yeah well i uh didnt fax the commission because it was among my problems to be resolved you mean you didnt know the commission was one of your clients jonathan managed to say it more in sorrow that in anger i think it was that i didnt know who were our contact names there neither now that he thought about it did jonathan ok he sighed look talk to clara shell know them and then just send the notification youve got dont apologize or let them know that we didnt tell them in time if they ask the number has just changed i dont want them to know we had this little hiccup ok ok billy murmured and billy please dont try to keep all your correspondence in one file youll find it easier if you keep things separate billy thanked him for the advice then he suggested that jonathan might like to come around to his place for drinks i dont believe this this kid was making a pass at him he was so desperate ok were both playing the same lla game how can we both win dont be judgmental turn the attraction if that was what you could call it into friendliness team bonding thats a great idea billy but ive been feeling bad about not inviting you to my place i think youve met my wife but youve never even seen my daughter are you free next week billy looked relieved jonathan was relieved too and thanked him for the job he was doing and in the general thanking and summing up the invitations were forgotten billy left and jonathan sat back and sighed he was feeling tired a lot these days he saw sallys face pink glossy lips parted as she gave a tiny cry he sat still for a moment his eyes closed it was jonathan couldnt help himself he checked his scores again he really must stop doing this it was like when he got hooked on the i ching and had to have chaos therapy to kick it but all he wanted was a breakdown a fuller breakdown of this mornings score with simon verbal content ok i knew i was bad but that bad body language what oh come on what was i supposed to do pick my nose jonathan actioned a more indepth analysis artificiality his machine told him a lack of visible sincerity christ you cant move around this place if id been sincere i would have said you fucked up that ownaccount job eighteen months ago and youve been a liability ever since and youve done nothing any better so were ditching you like we should have done even earlier i was just trying to be fucking kind what should i have done told him to fuck off so what got me my good score this breakdown is terrible dead space and the computer flipped itself out into a proactive intervention suddenly it started to play him the tape of the mornings session with simon there he was fat stonefaced saying its not written for me its written for personnel a full analysis scrolled up on the screen flesh tones oxygen use body language uncharacteristic verbals atypical eye use behavior typical of industrial sabotage rage mixed with satisfaction in other words simon had become dangerous not a little bit dangerous very dangerous determined apparently to get revenge inhouse sabotage is one of the greatest problems now facing both manufacturing and service industries yeah yeah yeah ive been on the course jonathan glanced up at the door to make sure it was closed he could verbal and noone would hear george was supposed to be seeing him but george thank heaven was late as usual first jonathan asked the computer why didnt you warn me before programmed to hold all proactive interventions until dead space alright reprogram if you get a priority like this again you are to intervene immediately please confirm confirmed what are the possible actions taken by simon hasley action taken fine what is it there was no response at all it was almost as though the machine had crashed right in the middle of proactive intervention it simply went back to what it had been doing before the machine had been analyzing jonathans performance this time he noticed the total score in the upper right hand corner his total score was it had been if jonathan knew anything he knew his own scores simon was changing them cv please full cv on simon hasley not available file cancelled due to termination of employment simon hasley is here until st august his files are not cancelled not available file cancelled due to termination of employment then open the exemployee file action restore scores for dayplan item one to action not authorized jonathan slammed the top of his desk george walked in to talk about late invoicing and the bloody machine flipped back to its proactive intervention its not my letter simon was saying jeez how embarrassing right in front of other staff stop intervention jonathan ordered sit down george then jonathan remembered what had simon said something about accounts that hed worked in accounts accounts with their big system who did all the monitoring the really big boys simon would have swept up after them wiped their asses what does he know about the system george was talking to him and jonathan realized he had not heard a word he was losing this he was not handling it its the same story we have to wait for extracontractuals before we know what the job costs and so we cant bill george was smiling his noncommissioned sleevesup manontheshopfloor smile thats not what the people upstairs think well with the best will in the world theyre not down here doing the work are they they dont have to george im sorry to pull the rug from under you but i want to change the agenda for this meeting george sucked his teeth scoring points tut bad meeting management you know i would never do this normally but ive just had an intervention on simon as you came in how is he taking it the shopfloor smile was still there like a prince hes calm in fact you could say he looks quite happy about it like he has a card up his sleeve you give him a good severance deal or something we cant afford severance deals this is in confidence simon is changing peoples performance scores hes got access to accounts somehow the machine cant change them back youre joking said george his pink face going slack then he began to chuckle no wonder he looks so pleased hes changing peoples scores well well i didnt know he had it in him managers must never lose their sense of humor jonathan managed to find an answering smile its one way of getting your own back there was sweat on his forehead changing yours is he georges red moustache seemed to glow redder screwed both of us youre in charge of monitoring jonathans own smile was a bit harder so how could he have done it how can we stop him beats me unless he got hold of the password when he was in accounts you mean the access code no this is different it really lays open the whole network i think only the chairman has it maybe head of accounts you get hold of that you can change any information you like and then ice it so it can never be changed change it invisibly i mean great for when the auditors call i expect so can you change it on verbal by mail by camel i imagine its only a rumor but ive heard a few funny things from simon george grinned back at him and then in waltzed harriet it was after all and here he was still in his previous meeting so his time management score would be fucked and harriet would know that and wouldnt she just love that harriet loved something she had gone doolally with pleasure she started to do a dance around jonathans desk ring around the rosy a pocketful of posy husha husha they all fall down harriet roared her hearty hooray henry laugh that jonathan had not heard in so long did you know that that is a song about the plague someones caught a cold said george and his and harriets eyes seemed to harpoon each other and both of them grinned bad behavior from staff depressed their own scores but insubordination knocked the stuffing out of their managers profile they knew it they were enjoying this i am fed up with this crap i am fed up trying to keep people happy i am not responsible for keeping people happy harriet the stress has gotten to you jonathan said come back when youre more in control when you are more in control you mean harriet was beaming and about to chuckle again come on george lets leave him to it george please were not finished we still have to talk about invoicing oh jesus and both he and harriet cracked up i want a breakdown of every invoice on this printout and why its late friday will do and please remember that you are responsible for ensuring we hold to financial targets if you dont you arent meeting the minimum requirements of your job ill give you a box four marking and if it doesnt improve ill write one of those hilarious little warning letters oh and harriet your antiblood pressure medicine i know about it it does have strange side effects doesnt it i can recommend medical leave i will be recommending a checkup in other words baby you may just have lost your job harriets smile slipped he verballed it action store session copy h pednorowskas behavior to the medical department all this counseling shit to one side the thing he knew he was really good at was being a bit of a bastard harriet george thanks for coming to see me harriet im sorry youre unwell george im sure youll be able to cope with your invoicing problem please ask simon to come in and see me their smiles had not quite faded meeting over team gloves off simon had slow reaction times he needed time to think about things well he had had a whole month to work through this thanks to jonathan being so nice it had probably taken him all month but he had done it and hes got me by the balls he can change my scores and leave no trace unless the chairman is prepared to admit the existence of the password the computers got me and george on record and knows our suspicions but thats not proof i have to wrong foot him i could say that hed been monitored telling harriet what hed done but what if he hadnt or asked how could they read the note it was in code jonathan would just have to wing it simon came back in he looked as calm and unperturbed as this morning an impressive display simon simon was saying nothing it wasnt age you idiot said jonathan it wasnt sloweddown reaction times dont you know when youre being let off they knew simon thats why you were fired you didnt think you could use the chairmans password without all the right protocols did you they were letting you go without any noise then you had to go and tamper with my scores this morning you stupid dumb poor idiot little lamb and i dont know if i can stop it this time simon i think theyre going to send you to jail simon sat unmoving in silence but silence was not a denial or shocked surprise would that be enough i mean as if i didnt signal it as if i didnt near as dammit tell you in those private little sessions youve got a month keep your nose clean i dont want to see you go to jail jonathan raised his hands and let them fall i really thought you were smarter than that simon had not moved not an involuntary flicker of the eyeballs not a heave of the prisonpatterned shirt except he was weeping he sat very still and a thick heavy tear that seemed to be made of glucose crept down his cheek they always have one up on you dont they he said in the corner of jonathans screen a tiny white square was flashing on and off in complete silence a security alert you work your butt off they keep you dancing for twenty years and they make a fortune out of you this was going to be very sweet indeed thought jonathan talk about two birds with one stone fancy accounts letting something like the password out theyd all be for the high jump bloody accounts who were always breathing down jonathans neck about invoices or performance scores or project costs or unit cost reduction they would all have their necks wrung like chickens what a wonderful world this could be it was a dumb thing to do simon admitted laying each word with a kind of finality like bricks well i reckon youll have revenge at least on accounts said jonathan the door burst open and custody came in like it was a drug bust and they were supercops in their dumb blue little uniforms what the fuck kept you jonathan demanded by the way simon he added we didnt know for sure until a second ago thanks simon didnt move a muscle when jonathan checked later he found hed scored a ten hot damn it felt good to be so creative he got home after fitting in his evening workout got up to one hundred on the bench press shows what a little adrenalin could do he got home to the ethnic wallpaper and the books and the cds and he knew he was not a bad man life was tough but that was business home was different his wife was a painter and she wore a smock covered in fresh pistachio magenta cobalt he had to lean forward to kiss her lest the smock print paint on his suit we should hang that coat of yours in a gallery he said it would be nice to live like this too in a quiet home but then someone had to bring home the bacon daddy daddy called christine from the bedroom she wouldnt go to sleep until she had seen him no matter how long she had to wait and she was not even his child he went to her room and sat on the bed and kissed her she smelled of orange juice and childrens shampoo play a game with me she said and out came the little screen mickey had to shoot the basketball through the hoop to escape the aliens the score was on the screen daddy i got an eight she cried he chuckled but a part of his mind said in a slow dark voice get them young that night he dreamed he had old hands and they mumbled through job ads he couldnt feel anything with them his fingers were dead repent harlequin said the ticktockman by harlan ellison harlan ellison is another

visions and again dangerous visions early sea voyages were dangerous things the oceans were rough it was hard to store enough provisions and the maps were rough sketches where they existed at all in fact its a wonder anyone could attempt to draw a map it was almost impossible to calculate longitude on a moving boat in the british government even established a special advisory board on the topic with a twentythousand pound prize for the man who could find the solution the solution came in the form of a better clock one unaffected by weather conditions and movement that clock was john harrisons marine chronometer in our next story people might just curse john harrisons name if it werent for his chronometers ability to keep accurate time all the time their entire society would be different if there were only inaccurate pendulum clocks and springwound watches these people might not be slaves to the timetable instead punctuality is the law of the land heres a world where time is not only money its life and death there are always those who ask what is it all about for those who need to ask for those who need points sharply made who need to know where its at this the mass of men serve the state thus not as men mainly but as machines with their bodies they are the standing army and the militia jailors constables posse comitatus etc in most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well such command no more respect than men of straw or a lump of dirt they have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens others as most legislators politicians lawyers ministers and officeholders serve the state chiefly with their heads and as they rarely make any moral distinctions they are as likely to serve the devil without intending it as god a very few as heroes patriots martyrs reformers in the great sense and men serve the state with their consciences also and so necessarily resist it for the most part and they are commonly treated as enemies by it henry david thoreau civil disobedience that is the heart of it now begin in the middle and later learn the beginning the end will take care of itself but because it was the very world it was the very world they had allowed it to become for months his activities did not come to the alarmed attention of the ones who kept the machine functioning smoothly the ones who poured the very best butter over the cams and mainsprings of the culture not until it had become obvious that somehow someway he had become a notoriety a celebrity perhaps even a hero for what officialdom inescapably tagged an emotionally disturbed segment of the populace did they turn it over to the ticktockman and his legal machinery but by then because it was the very world it was and they had no way to predict he would happen possibly a strain of disease longdefunct now suddenly reborn in a system where immunity had been forgotten had lapsed he had been allowed to become too real now he had form and substance he had become a personality something they had filtered out of the system many decades before but there it was and there he was a very definitely imposing personality in certain circles middleclass circles it was thought disgusting vulgar ostentation anarchistic shameful in others there was only sniggering those strata where thought is subjugated to form and ritual niceties proprieties but down below ah down below where the people always needed their saints and sinners their bread and circuses their heroes and villains he was considered a bolivar a napoleon a robin hood a dick bong ace of aces a jesus a jomo kenyatta and at the top where like sociallyattuned shipwreck kellys every tremor and vibration threatening to dislodge the wealthy powerful and titled from their flagpoles he was considered a menace a heretic a rebel a disgrace a peril he was known down the line to the very heartmeat core but the important reactions were high above and far below at the very top at the very bottom so his file was turned over along with his timecard and his cardioplate to the office of the ticktockman the ticktockman very much over six feet tall often silent a soft purring man when things went timewise the ticktockman even in the cubicles of the hierarchy where fear was generated seldom suffered he was called the ticktockman but no one called him that to his mask you dont call a man a hated name not when that man behind his mask is capable of revoking the minutes the hours the days and nights the years of your life he was called the master timekeeper to his mask it was safer that way this is what he is said the ticktockman with genuine softness but not who he is this timecard im holding in my left hand has a name on it but it is the name of what he is not who he is the cardioplate here in my right hand is also named but not whom named merely what named before i can exercise proper revocation i have to know who this what is to his staff all the ferrets all the loggers all the finks all the commex even the mineez he said who is this harlequin he was not purring smoothly timewise it was jangle however it was the longest speech they had ever heard him utter at one time the staff the ferrets the loggers the finks the commex but not the mineez who usually werent around to know in any case but even they scurried to find out who is the harlequin high above the third level of the city he crouched on the humming aluminumframe platform of the airboat foof airboat indeed swizzleskid is what it was with a towrack jerryrigged and he stared down at the neat mondrian arrangement of the buildings somewhere nearby he could hear the metronomic leftrightleft of the pm shift entering the timkin rollerbearing plant in their sneakers a minute later precisely he heard the softer rightleftright of the am formation going home an elfin grin spread across his tanned features and his dimples appeared for a moment then scratching at his thatch of auburn hair he shrugged within his motley as though girding himself for what came next and threw the joystick forward and bent into the wind as the airboat dropped he skimmed over a slidewalk purposely dropping a few feet to crease the tassels of the ladies of fashion and inserting thumbs in large ears he stuck out his tongue rolled his eyes and went wuggawuggawugga it was a minor diversion one pedestrian skittered and tumbled sending parcels everywhichway another wet herself a third keeled slantwise and the walk was stopped automatically by the servitors till she could be resuscitated it was a minor diversion then he swirled away on a vagrant breeze and was gone hiho as he rounded the cornice of the timemotion study building he saw the shift just boarding the slidewalk with practiced motion and an absolute conservation of movement they sidestepped up onto the slowstrip and in a chorus line reminiscent of a busby berkeley film of the antediluvian s advanced across the strips ostrichwalking till they were lined up on the expresstrip once more in anticipation the elfin grin spread and there was a tooth missing back there on the left side he dipped skimmed and swooped over them and then scrunching about on the airboat he released the holding pins that fastened shut the ends of the homemade pouring troughs that kept his cargo from dumping prematurely and as he pulled the troughpins the airboat slid over the factory workers and one hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of jelly beans cascaded down on the expresstrip jelly beans millions and billions of purples and yellows and greens and licorice and grape and raspberry and mint and round and smooth and crunchy outside and softmealy inside and sugary and bouncing jouncing tumbling clittering clattering skittering fell on the heads and shoulders and hardhats and carapaces of the timkin workers tinkling on the slidewalk and bouncing away and rolling about underfoot and filling the sky on their way down with all the colors of joy and childhood and holidays coming down in a steady rain a solid wash a torrent of color and sweetness out of the sky from above and entering a universe of sanity and metronomic order with quitemad coocoo newness jelly beans the shift workers howled and laughed and were pelted and broke ranks and the jelly beans managed to work their way into the mechanism of the slidewalks after which there was a hideous scraping as the sound of a million fingernails rasped down a quarter of a million blackboards followed by a coughing and a sputtering and then the slidewalks all stopped and everyone was dumped thisawayandthataway in a jackstraw tumble still laughing and popping little jelly bean eggs of childish color into their mouths it was a holiday and a jollity an absolute insanity a giggle but the shift was delayed seven minutes they did not get home for seven minutes the master schedule was thrown off by seven minutes quotas were delayed by inoperative slidewalks for seven minutes he had tapped the first domino in the line and one after another like chik chik chik the others had fallen the system had been seven minutes worth of disrupted it was a tiny matter one hardly worthy of note but in a society where the single driving force was order and unity and equality and promptness and clocklike precision and attention to the clock reverence of the gods of the passage of time it was a disaster of major importance so he was ordered to appear before the ticktockman it was broadcast across every channel of the communications web he was ordered to be there at dammit on time and they waited and they waited but he didnt show up till almost tenthirty at which time he merely sang a little song about moonlight in a place no one had ever heard of called vermont and vanished again but they had all been waiting since seven and it wrecked hell with their schedules so the question remained who is the harlequin but the unasked question more important of the two was how did we get into this position where a laughing irresponsible japer of jabberwocky and jive could disrupt our entire economic and cultural life with a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of jelly beans jelly for gods sake beans this is madness where did he get the money to buy a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of jelly beans they knew it would have cost that much because they had a team of situation analysts pulled off another assignment and rushed to the slidewalk scene to sweep up and count the candies and produce findings which disrupted their schedules and threw their entire branch at least a day behind jelly beans jelly beans now wait a second a second accounted for no one has manufactured jelly beans for over a hundred years where did he get jelly beans thats another good question more than likely it will never be answered to your complete satisfaction but then how many questions ever are the middle you know here is the beginning how it starts a desk pad day for day and turn each day open the mail appointment with planning commission board discuss installation progress charts with j l pray for rain lunch and so it goes im sorry miss grant but the time for interviews was set at and its almost five now im sorry youre late but those are the rules youll have to wait till next year to submit application for this college again and so it goes the local stops at cresthaven galesville tonawanda junction selby and farnhurst but not at indiana city lucasville and colton except on sunday the express stops at galesville selby and indiana city except on sundays holidays at which time it stops at and so it goes i couldnt wait fred i had to be at pierre cartains by and you said youd meet me under the clock in the terminal at and you werent there so i had to go on youre always late fred if youd been there we could have served it up together but as it was well i took the order alone and so it goes dear mr and mrs atterley in reference to your son gerolds constant tardiness i am afraid we will have to suspend him from school unless some more reliable method can be instituted guaranteeing he will arrive at his classes on time granted he is an exemplary student and his marks are high his constant flouting of the schedules of this school makes it impractical to maintain him in a system where the other children seem capable of getting where they are supposed to be on time and so it goes you cannot vote unless you appear at am i dont care if the script is good i need it thursday checkout time is pm you got here late the jobs taken sorry your salary has been docked for twenty minutes time lost god what time is it ive gotta run and so it goes and so it goes and so it goes and so it goes goes goes goes goes tick tock tick tock tick tock and one day we no longer let time serve us we serve time and we are slaves of the schedule worshippers of the suns passing bound into a life predicated on restrictions because the system will not function if we dont keep the schedule tight until it becomes more than a minor inconvenience to be late it becomes a sin then a crime then a crime punishable by this effective july midnight the office of the master timekeeper will require all citizens to submit their timecards and cardioplates for processing in accordance with statute sgh governing the revocation of time per capita all cardioplates will be keyed to the individual holder and what they had done was devise a method of curtailing the amount of life a person could have if he was ten minutes late he lost ten minutes of his life an hour was proportionately worth more revocation if someone was consistently tardy he might find himself on a sunday night receiving a communiqué from the master timekeeper that his time had run out and he would be turned off at high noon on monday please straighten your affairs sir madame or bisex and so by this simple scientific expedient utilizing a scientific process held dearly secret by the ticktockmans office the system was maintained it was the only expedient thing to do it was after all patriotic the schedules had to be met after all there was a war on but wasnt there always now that is really disgusting the harlequin said when pretty alice showed him the wanted poster disgusting and highly improbable after all this isnt the day of the desperado a wanted poster you know pretty alice noted you speak with a great deal of inflection im sorry said the harlequin humbly no need to be sorry youre always saying im sorry you have such massive guilt everett its really very sad im sorry he said again then pursed his lips so the dimples appeared momentarily he hadnt wanted to say that at all i have to go out again i have to do something pretty alice slammed her coffeebulb down on the counter oh for gods sake everett cant you stay home just one night must you always be out in that ghastly clown suit running around annoying people im he stopped and clapped the jesters hat onto his auburn thatch with a tiny tinkling of bells he rose rinsed out his coffeebulb at the spray and put it into the dryer for a moment i have to go she didnt answer the faxbox was purring and she pulled a sheet out read it threw it toward him on the counter its about you of course youre ridiculous he read it quickly it said the ticktockman was trying to locate him he didnt care he was going out to be late again at the door dredging for an exit line he hurled back petulantly well you speak with inflection too pretty alice rolled her pretty eyes heavenward youre ridiculous the harlequin stalked out slamming the door which sighed shut softly and locked itself there was a gentle knock and pretty alice got up with an exhalation of exasperated breath and opened the door he stood there ill be back about tenthirty okay she pulled a rueful face why do you tell me that why you know youll be late you know it youre always late so why do you tell me these dumb things she closed the door on the other side the harlequin nodded to himself shes right shes always right ill be late im always late why do i tell her these dumb things he shrugged again and went off to be late once more he had fired off the firecracker rockets that said i will attend the th annual international medical association invocation at pm precisely i do hope you will all be able to join me the words had burned in the sky and of course the authorities were there lying in wait for him they assumed naturally that he would be late he arrived twenty minutes early while they were setting up the spiderwebs to trap and hold him blowing a large bullhorn he frightened and unnerved them so their own moisturized encirclement webs sucked closed and they were hauled up kicking and shrieking high above the amphitheaters floor the harlequin laughed and laughed and apologized profusely the physicians gathered in solemn conclave roared with laughter and accepted the harlequins apologies with exaggerated bowing and posturing and a merry time was had by all who thought the harlequin was a regular foofaraw in fancy pants all that is but the authorities who had been sent out by the office of the ticktockman they hung there like so much dockside cargo hauled up above the floor of the amphitheater in a most unseemly fashion in another part of the same city where the harlequin carried on his activities totally unrelated in every way to what concerns us here save that it illustrates the ticktockmans power and import a man named marshall delahanty received his turnoff notice from the ticktockmans office his wife received the notification from the graysuited minee who delivered it with the traditional look of sorrow plastered hideously across his face she knew what it was even without unsealing it it was a billetdoux of immediate recognition to everyone these days she gasped and held it as though it were a glass slide tinged with botulism and prayed it was not for her let it be for marsh she thought brutally realistically or one of the kids but not for me please dear god not for me and then she opened it and it was for marsh and she was at one and the same time horrified and relieved the next trooper in the line had caught the bullet marshall she screamed marshall termination marshall ohmigod marshall whattl we do whattl we do marshall omigodmarshall and in their home that night was the sound of tearing paper and fear and the stink of madness went up the flue and there was nothing absolutely nothing they could do about it but marshall delahanty tried to run and early the next day when turnoff time came he was deep in the canadian forest two hundred miles away and the office of the ticktockman blanked his cardioplate and marshall delahanty keeled over running and his heart stopped and the blood dried up on its way to his brain and he was dead thats all one light went out on the sector map in the office of the master timekeeper while notification was entered for fax reproduction and georgette delahantys name was entered on the dole roles till she could remarry which is the end of the footnote and all the point that need be made except dont laugh because that is what would happen to the harlequin if ever the ticktockman found out his real name it isnt funny the shopping level of the city was thronged with the thursdaycolors of the buyers women in canary yellow chitons and men in pseudotyrolean outfits that were jade and leather and fit very tightly save for the balloon pants when the harlequin appeared on the stillbeingconstructed shell of the new efficiency shopping center his bullhorn to his elfishlylaughing lips everyone pointed and stared and he berated them why let them order you about why let them tell you to hurry and scurry like ants or maggots take your time saunter a while enjoy the sunshine enjoy the breeze let life carry you at your own pace dont be slaves of time its a helluva way to die slowly by degrees down with the ticktockman whos the nut most of the shoppers wanted to know whos the nut oh wow im gonna be late i gotta run and the construction gang on the shopping center received an urgent order from the office of the master timekeeper that the dangerous criminal known as the harlequin was atop their spire and their aid was urgently needed in apprehending him the work crew said no they would lose time on their construction schedule but the ticktockman managed to pull the proper threads of governmental webbing and they were told to cease work and catch that nitwit up there on the spire up there with the bullhorn so a dozen and more burly workers began climbing into their construction platforms releasing the agrav plates and rising toward the harlequin after the debacle in which through the harlequins attention to personal safety no one was seriously injured the workers tried to reassemble and assault him again but it was too late he had vanished it had attracted quite a crowd however and the shopping cycle was thrown off by hours simply hours the purchasing needs of the system were therefore falling behind and so measures were taken to accelerate the cycle for the rest of the day but it got bogged down and speeded up and they sold too many floatvalves and not nearly enough wegglers which meant that the popli ratio was off which made it necessary to rush cases and cases of spoiling smasho to stores that usually needed a case only every three or four hours the shipments were bollixed the transshipments were misrouted and in the end even the swizzleskid industries felt it dont come back till you have him the ticktockman said very quietly very sincerely extremely dangerously they used dogs they used probes they used cardioplate crossoffs they used teepers they used bribery they used stiktytes they used intimidation they used torment they used torture they used finks they used cops they used search seizure they used fallaron they used betterment incentive they used fingerprints they used the bertillon system they used cunning they used guile they used treachery they used raoul mitgong but he didnt help much they used applied physics they used techniques of criminology and what the hell they caught him after all his name was everett c marm and he wasnt much to begin with except a man who had no sense of time repent harlequin said the ticktockman get stuffed the harlequin replied sneering youve been late a total of sixtythree years five months three weeks two days twelve hours fortyone minutes fiftynine seconds point oh three six one one one microseconds youve used up everything you can and more im going to turn you off scare someone else id rather be dead that live in a dumb world with a bogeyman like you its my job youre full of it youre a tyrant you have no right to order people around and kill them if they show up late you cant adjust you cant fit in unstrap me and ill fit my fist into your mouth youre a nonconformist that didnt used to be a felony it is now live in the world around you i hate it its a terrible world not everyone thinks so most people enjoy order i dont and most of the people i know dont thats not true how do you think we caught you im not interested a girl named pretty alice told us who you were thats a lie its true you unnerve her she wants to belong she wants to conform im going to turn you off then do it already and stop arguing with me im not going to turn you off youre an idiot repent harlequin said the ticktockman get stuffed so they sent him to coventry and in coventry they worked him over it was just like what they did to winston smith in nineteen eightyfour which was a book none of them knew about but the techniques are really quite ancient and so they did it to everett c marm and one day quite a long time later the harlequin appeared on the communications web appearing elfin and dimpled and brighteyed and not at all brainwashed and he said he had been wrong that it was a good a very good thing indeed to belong to be right on time hipho and away we go and everyone stared up at him on the public screens that covered an entire city block and they said to themselves well you see he was just a nut after all and if thats the way the system is run then lets do it that way because it doesnt pay to fight city hall or in this case the ticktockman so everett c marm was destroyed which was a loss because of what thoreau said earlier but you cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs and in every revolution a few die who shouldnt but they have to because thats the way it happens and if you make only a little change then it seems to be worthwhile or to make the point lucidly uh excuse me sir i uh dont know how to uh to uh tell you this but you were three minutes late the schedule is a little uh bit off he grinned sheepishly thats ridiculous murmured the ticktockman behind his mask check your watch and then he went into his office going mrmee mrmee mrmee mrmee is this your day to join the revolution by genevieve valentine genevieve valentines first novel mechanique a tale of the circus tresaulti is forthcoming

unit known as the voice from the sky it was no ordinary airplane the ant was the jewel of stalins propaganda machine propaganda doesnt have to be evil but it exists to convince people and those who use it are often willing to skew the truth or obscure it entirely in order to create an influential product in the past propaganda was an important part of the war efforts of many countries from nazi germany to the united states but in the future who knows how propaganda might be used our next tale is the story of a new kind of propaganda filled with a message so large it has changed the living fabric of a nation but is the message true in this grim new world theres no way to know and even if its not whos brave enough to ask when liz left her building disease control workers were standing on the corners handing out pills and little paper cups of coke do you need one the old lady asked holding up a handful of paper masks stamped with ads for lavender fields sterilemilled soap liz pulled out the one she kept in her bag and the lady smiled the tv in her subway car showed what you can do on a date the young man and woman went to the fair twice once where he screwed everything up and again where he helped her into the ferris wheel and handed her a paper mask before he put on his own the movie closed with swelling music and a reminder in cursive are you due for a date check with your doctor liz worked the reception desk on the sixth floor of the department of information affairs that gregs a lucky man said mr randall the district manager when he came in every morning too bad i didnt get matched with you first liz chuckled because a district managers jokes were always funny above her on a loop the introduction video played for anyone coming into the department it showed a woman on the street overhearing pieces of information she didnt know how to report it reviewed the details of filing a claim as a man in a mechanics jumpsuit signed in at the desk took the elevator to the eighteenth floor shook hands with a smiling agent what do you know that we should know the narrator asked at the end right before the two actors turned to the camera and the man in the jumpsuit said more than i thought thats for sure liz couldnt see it from where she was sitting but she didnt need to shed seen the film during orientation the last time anyone at the department suggested she had anything anyone needed to know greg waited outside her building for their scheduled date and when he saw her coming he smiled greg had been studying for a job at disease control before the bang his viable sperm knocked him out of line for any sectorc jobs he answered phones at a law office they had been matched three years ago and had been evaluated above average sweethearts three years running by the society council their chances of marriage had been rated by the doctors as close to greg was gay as a maypole but they made do when she was just far enough away she called hello darling you never knew when the society council was monitoring he smiled hello honey how was your day some concern over disease i think someone from film production signed in this morning they might be making a new film about how the disease is going greg whistled thats no good she shook her head i just dont understand the delay weve been wearing the masks for weeks already they should have delivered a new movie by now they should have greg said frowning liz patted her boyfriends arm and dropped the subject every once in a while the government wasnt above a little mistake they hit up the shindig at the threescreen the tag line had caused a little scandal vane and murray spark more fireworks than the bang but it was just a romantic musical liz liked the dancing greg liked joe murray the cashier stamped their tickets please dont forget to get them stamped on the way out or the purchase is ineligible for reimbursement from the department of society he droned once they were in their seats greg put his arm around her like all the other guys had done to their dates you never knew who was a society council inspector is there a plan for after this well if you really enjoy joe murray we can go to a society hotel if you want after he looked over understanding due for the doctor she smiled thinly we have a year left before they rematch me she thought about mr randall finding out and filing a request and shuddered id rather stick it out with you greg nodded and when the movie titles came up he held her hand murray and vane were in the middle of their meetcute dance routine when the film stuttered pixelated and blinked out refund someone shouted before the screen was even black the screen flared back to life with the title you are being lied to so no refund asked greg the people near them laughed the screen cards kept flashing there are no pathogens there is no disease control there is no disease now no one was laughing someone got up and ran out of the theatre liz craned her neck trying to see what was happening in the projection booth the screen cut to a grainy shot of a computer screen a shadowy figure sat beside it typing and talking to the camera we are john doe it said its voice had been distorted like film played at halfspeedand we have tuned the network we have proof the disease is a lie now people were beginning to murmur some got up and scurried for the exit like it was a security department trap it probably was liz hoped this kid was lying she thought annoyed about the stupid paper mask she wore three days a week when the pathogen alert was high the computer screen showed a mail exchange with the header damage control to intercept information leak every citizen must act the voice was saying dont take the pills from disease control by now the figure was agitated gesturing at the camera ask yourselves whos ever really gotten sick how can the bangs pathogens strike such small areas why are they always near the borders how does disease control respond so quickly the pills have kept us docile but the time has come to act weve made contact with the doors behind them crashed open the doorway filled with plainclothes sd and uniformed cops guns out hold it someone shouted and the police charged the projector booth a young man jumped out of the booth and crashlanded in the aisle grabbing gregs seat to pull himself up the boy was young blond his face tight with pain or fear and for a moment he was just staring at them his hands flexed on gregs armrest then he sprinted for the exit and disappeared the cops and sds tripped over themselves back down the projectionroom stairs and they scattered some for the exits some for the audience greg and liz were yanked out of their seats and dragged outside into a holding pen of cop cars along with the rest of the audience liz saw a few of the ones who had tried to run and hadnt made it i dont want to go into the station greg told her it could end up on my record he still hoped that someday he could get closer any closer to disease control liz faked a storm of tears when the cops were close enough to see it and they handed greg a printout and stamped his ticket stubs and told him to be a gentleman and take her home already im looking for a refund for this prank greg told them halfseriously i want you to know that on the walk home greg read from the printout a standardissue distribution without a date on it theyd had it ready to go just in case greg flashed the picture of a frowning boy dragging a skullemblazoned bag behind him pranks are foolish and waste the time of valuable citizens they distract from safety work and interfere with your government if you see a prankster contact your local precinct the bottom read in large block letters todays delinquent is tomorrows criminal hold it said the blond kid from behind her and liz felt the point of a knife in her back or todays criminal liz said greg leveled a look at the kid keep it cool johnny doe what do you want your car dont have one johnny pulled a face shit well give me your money he said and nudged liz with his shoulder not she noted with the knife what youre going to buy a bus pass and ride out of town on the local liz asked but she handed over her purse seventeen dollars enjoy johnny thumbed through the wallet with his free hand theyve got my car he told them like they were all friends i need to get out of here theyll kill me liz didnt doubt that greg glanced around at the quiet street ahead of them was the main drag swarming with people going out to the city fair on subsidized dates you should go said johnny youll be in trouble if they see you with me greg looked like he was in the middle of a magnificent adventure and was sneaking looks at johnnys sharp profile when he thought johnny wasnt looking and liz knew what was coming before greg even opened his mouth greg asked what do you need liz and greg signed into a society hotel just off the main drag the concierge registered them stamped their paper and smiled politely no speeches about exit stamps this time it was gauche for concierges to keep track of that sort of thing they closed the door and looked at one another like it was their first date again liz felt an itch just under her skin like she was sick like she needed to run until she dropped she felt like greg looked greg laid his tie over the chair and looked at her what if they trace him to my apartment what if they find him there liz figured if they found a goodlooking young man in gregs apartment hed be in trouble for a lot more than harboring a fugitive come on said liz tugging gently at the tongue of his belt we have work to do just close your eyes and think of johnny at the door of the hotel greg kissed her cheek goodnight he seemed surprised when she fell into step beside him instead of turning for her street but he took her arm without hesitation just curious to see what he does in civilization she said when she felt him looking at her besides im your alibi if anyones found him god thats the truth he said and pressed her hand more tightly into the crook of his arm john doe was gone having availed himself of gregs good raincoat and a bottle of milk from the refrigerator and gregs sadness at the end of their adventure was mitigated by the fact that hed have to replace a very pricey coat liz figured that wasnt the last of johnny doe though when greg wistfully asked her do you think he might ever she said nope just to keep him from getting tied up in knots about it secretly she guessed that a rebel wouldnt abandon a safe harbor but that was really only from the films is your neighbor a traitor and she couldnt be sure now sometimes when they were at the movies and the screen skipped a frame greg tensed and liz dreaded the day johnny ever came back and swept greg off his feet and into some mission living in a ghost town smack in the middle of the pathogen fields liz would have to go on the group dates in the society center where they observed you behind the mirror and marked your body language and assigned you someone and liz would have to learn to live with someone entirely new above her head the woman in the video was shopping for groceries a man behind her said to someone well have to hurry the pickup happens tonight and the woman frowned at an apple the narrator said mary knows somethings not quite right but what can she do she can do what we all should do report suspicions todays alert citizen is tomorrows hero on the screen behind her the man in the jumpsuit opened the lobby door and approached the desk to make his complaint he never actually made it liz knew he just went up in the elevator and shook hands with the other actor every ten minutes all day its easy to be a good citizen the narrator said we need what you know john doe was standing at the corner of her street dressed like a disease control agent when she saw him next when he saw her he went white as a sheet then he fumbled for the tray handed her a cup whats in here she asked under her breath you poisoning us now he rolled his eyes its the same as the rest he said im just waiting here to be taken back to disease control so he was going to sneak in that way is it true you work for the doi she blinked as his question settled in then she shook her head oh no johnny dont how can you say no he handed off a paper cup to a passerby turned back to her this close she could see the vein of green in his blue eyes youre not stupid he said you know im telling the truth wont you help me what are you

said someone will how can you be such a coward he was louder now too loud the other disease control agent looked concerned and liz took a step back as johnny stepped forward his eyes were sharp and bright dont you see what theyve done to you leave me alone she said she wished greg or someone was here just in case he dropped the tray with a clang paper cups and pills skittered across the pavement bounced off lizs shoes its over he said theyll kill me if you dont help me youve killed me liz couldnt breathe she felt dizzy she didnt understand what he meant the next moment she was on the ground being handcuffed and johnny was being picked up five cops maybe more and carried kicking into the back of a van that had appeared out of nowhere as the two policemen walked liz to the car they passed the van blaring the last swells of a familiar tune through its speakers are you due for a date called the announcer check with your doctor mr randall was waiting for her on the eighteenth floor of the department she waited she tried to think how many people who came up to report something to the department had ever come down again wed like to congratulate you said mr randall liz blinked pardon your

had happened how she had been too afraid to help johnny and what must have happened to him by now see you soon she said hung up as he was saying goodbye darling above her the film was ending the department actor grinning through the last frames of twinkling music what do you know that we should know independence day by sarah langan sarah langan is a threetime winner of the bram stoker award she is the author the novels the keeper and the missing and audreys door her short fiction has appeared in the magazines lightspeed cemetery dance phantom and chiaroscuro and in the anthologies the living dead darkness on the edge and unspeakable horror she is currently working on a postapocalyptic young adult series called kids and two adult novels empty houses which was inspired by the twilight zone and my fathers ghost which was inspired by hamlet if you listen closely to bruce springsteens born in the usa youll hear real pain beneath the slick guitar solos the song is a lament for an america where ordinary people mattered and their vote made a difference in the direction of the nation it was a song written in response to the vietnam war and the squawking nationalism that swept the u s after the bicentennial but its the tricentennial that our next story examines polluted and terrorized somehow america is just as frantically patriotic as it was when the boss wrote his classic song and the feeling is twice as empty langan says of her piece i was working on an homage to springsteen i couldnt decide on a particular song and decided instead on what i thought was the essence of springsteen standing up and fighting for what you believe in a screwedup world the waiting room is shiny and bright but the people inside it are dirty trina tries not to stare but she cant help herself she can tell just by looking that a few are addicts trying to score a fix one ladys wearing a black garbage bag instead of clothes trina waits her turn with her dad ramesh he wont be seeing the doctor today hes never seen the doctor he says hes not sick but hes lying he coughs all the time and in the mornings shes seen him spit blood and phlegm into the bathroom sink last month the committee for ethical media installed a television camera in their kitchen because he submitted an unapproved audio to the news opera environmental health instead of running it under a pseudonym like hed wanted the editors called the cops now the whole family is under house surveillance anybody who wants can flip to channel can see her lardcongealed breakfast table and the weird foam curlers her mother keeps forgetting to take out of her hair in the morning her whole eighth grade class knows that rameshs pet name for her is giggles and that they cant afford fresh milk only oneday soured from the bodega on th street its humiliating and so is he while they wait he puts his hand on the back of her neck and squeezes the skin surrounding her port like hes trying to pull it out he doesnt understand even though eighteen patriot day channels repeat it dayin and dayout you cant stop progress trina rubs her bruised cheek and glares at ramesh he sighs and lets go of her port its a victory but it doesnt make her happy it only stirs the piss and vinegar stew in her stomach shes carrying the list in the pocket of her spandex jeans each visit her dad makes her write down her complaints before they leave the house and then goes over them with her he tells her that he wants to be sure she says the right things so she doesnt get in trouble but the truth is he doesnt give crap about her hes just protecting his own sorry ass he got drunk last night at dinner her mom drea accidentally took too many vitamins and nodded off at the table trina pretended she was a duck and let it roll off her back quack fricking quack at least dinner was ready peanut butter and fluff the ambrosia of champions but after a few drinks ramesh got the look he started talking through his teeth like a growling dog theyre pushing me out looking over my shoulders all the time even the janitors cameras everywhere a man cant work like that he rubbed his temples while he talked like his thoughts were hurting him and trina tried to be sympathetic but shed heard this song before every time he got drunk it was the same meanwhile cameras were recording his every word and where would they live if he got fired worse what if that blood in the sink turned out to be cancer and in a week or a month from now he was dead in the corner the television was set to entertainment this second drea pretended to be interested in what ramesh was saying but she was looking past him at the show those fuckers are killing my work ramesh shouted while banging his fist against the table like a gavel everything jumped even his stinking vodka bottle the salt shaker rolled into her lap she was scared to call attention to herself by putting it back so in her lap it stayed her little friend salty she and salty against the world she hated salty all of a sudden because his sides were all greasy with thumbprint scum she hated her dad for ruining dinner she hated their crappy apartment and the kids at school who called her pink lung mostly she hated the way ramesh shouted because drea was so out of it drea had checked out months ago it was trina he was yelling at i cant fix your problems im thirteen years old remember she wanted to say but she didnt it would be too hard to explain the salt spilled like bad luck and she let the shaker drop from her lap it rolled under the table fuck you you fucking no good drunk she grumbled under her breath only the words got away from her they rushed from her chest and then burst into a holler that practically echoed inside the kitchen she spun at her mother to make sure it wasnt drea whod spoken but dreas earpods were inserted on the television beauty queens in bathing suits wrestled in a pool of mud for the title of hottest bitch had she really just said fuck you to her own father she was already blushing from shame when she felt the blow it came while her head was turned her dad a dirty fighter another reason to hate him at least it was his open palm and not his fist that tore across her face and knocked her out of her chair she lay stunned on the floor from the table drea shook her head dont fight babies its beneath you she said but she might have been talking to the mudslingers trinas face broke like glass her lips pulled wide ready to explode into the worst crying jag of her life so she squeezed her fists so tight her fingernails pierced her skin and tried to stay calm ramesh was kneeling next to her his long limbs wobbled drunkenly until he gave up kneeling and sat down she flinched as he ran the plastic smirnov bottle along her swelling cheek it was so cold it got stuck and pulled her skin let me see hold still he told her youre a terrorist she sobbed thats why they want to get you fired a dirty indian terrorist she said even though she was half indian too shh he said im sorry that was unforgivable ill never do it again he was still holding the bottle against her skin he smelled like mice and formaldehyde and though he wasnt supposed to hed worn his white lab coat home from the office it made him feel important because he could tell people he was a doctor too trina tried to stop crying but she couldnt she pushed the bottle away and hid her face between her knees it was dark in there and she wanted to come out and let him hold her but she hated him so much im so sorry ramesh crooned his long limbs didnt quite fit under the table so he was hunched like a man in a dollhouse the air was warmer because they were both breathing fast in a small space i mean it im reporting you she blubbered he didnt answer that probably too shocked it was the meanest thing she could think to say then she got up and locked herself in her room she didnt come out until morning when it was time to go to the doctor now a nurse holding a styrofoam clipboard calls her name trina shes wearing neon orange shortshorts and a belly ring all the smart nurses dress in tight clothes that way they get better tips trina narayan she asks again her dad nods at her very slowly like hes trying to impart one last tacit bit of advice he thinks hes a genius or something but if hed taken a real job with the defense department when the last war started instead of staying in the toxicology lab at new york university theyd be rich instead his funding got cut so they had to move from their pretty house in westchester to a twobedroom stinkhole with walltowall shag carpet in jackson heights queens now she goes to a school where kids ignite cherry bombs in homeroom and her only friend is semiretarded which is better than the rest of the kids who are completely retarded she touches her bruised cheek for courage it still stings dont tell ramesh mouths so that only she can see hes so scared that his eyes are bulging a bugeyed coward hes not a real man her father she smiles in a way that is not meant to reassure her lips are closed tight and angry and she silently tells him her answer the blood drains from his face as she walks away the examining room is empty a bright light shines from the corner and she squints most people her age only require one visit then tuneups every ten years youre not allowed treatment more than once a month or you become a vegetable still some people invent false identities and sneak they wind up wandering the streets and begging for food because they cant remember their names or where they live problem is the treatment never works on her every time the doctor cuts out the bad stuff it grows back like a tumor her dad tells her itll right itself on its own but he doesnt know shit first sign the bad stuff is back trina doesnt gather moss she calls the doctor the best part is no matter how much paperwork ramesh fills out to cancel her appointments he never gets it done in time its fun to watch him run around like a windup toy when she knows that no matter how hard he works hell never get anywhere the examining room is pink and round like a womb shes wearing a shortsleeved jumper so she wont have to undress the needles are plastic which makes them cheaper but not as sharp she has to shove the small one really hard to get it into a vein blood squirts she puts the second needle inside the port in the back of her neck and twists its metal ring until it locks into place some people do it standing but she likes to lie on the cool metal table makes the whole thing floaty like a dream the doctor is a fivefoot wide metal box in the curved corner of the room its attached to the needles and her by worn plastic tubes that over time have turned pink from other peoples blood the doctor has a cyclopslike eye in the center of his face it lights up white and then red the needle jabs through her neck and into her skull her skull is especially big so she had to get her port adjusted at a shop in the mall the sales lady broke off a piece of her skull and replaced it with hinged plastic that she has to swipe with rubbing alcohol every night so it doesnt get infected the light flicks from red to green the machine starts to purr she holds her breath this is her fourth time with the doctor and it is always this moment that feels most wrong the needles have warmed to the temperature of her blood but they are still foreign objects they dont belong inside her skin neither does this port that has left her gray matter vulnerable there are people mostly the old and young who experience drip their spinal fluid leaks and they become paralyzed she wants to rip out the port she wants to pull out the needles and break them she wants her boozehound daddy mostly she wants to run but then the doctor doles his medicine it travels colder than her blood but tingly first her elbow then her shoulder her back and finally all the places that are just beginning to get tender it feels like the boys she wishes would touch her like laughing so hard her stomach hurt back in westchester when life was easy and she was giggles like her mothers embrace like love it feels just like love begin a recorded female voice announces over the loudspeaker its mechanical quality reassures her this is too intimate for human witnesses too special oh how she loves the doctor she pulls the wad of paper from her spandex jeans and starts im afraid for lulu she always begins with this one but so far every time they excise it the worry grows back in school they say that early cultures believed in this thing called a soul it scares me i dont know why like weve all got these ghosts that live inside us like im haunted by my own ghost continue the voice tells her its soft voice travels through the tubes so that her port vibrates the actors in the movies it doesnt make any sense that they look so different from the people i know theyre so pale and thin they never have mechanical lungs i hate the way i look i wish i could cut myself into little pieces i wish i was pretty the tube in her arm is getting backflow red blood mixes with morphine pink and pretty like all girls should be except shes brown and pudgy i got so mad last week i bit my hand you can still see the teethmarks theyre smaller than youd think looks like baby teeth so i told everyone at school it was a neighbors little kid well actually nobody asked but if they did thats what id tell them she looks at her list the rest are the items that her father invented you dont like sour milk you want to devote your life to your country youre so excited about patriot day that you cant sleep then he added like it was an afterthought but she knew it wasnt you want to be popular but you dont fit in you dont understand that youre special your worries are a gift shed felt her face flush when he said that because suddenly the gig was up and they both knew that nobody at ps thought she was cool she decides shell say the honest one maybe itll stop being true once she says it maybe the doctor is magic im not pop she starts and then stops because if she says the words her father will be right because that smack had been so unexpected and undeserved because every day for as long as she can remember things have been worse than the day before which is how she knows that last night wasnt a fluke he might be sorry for it but next time he gets drunk hell hit her again the morphine has wound all over her like amniotic fluid it feels so good and safe the doctor will know what to do she crinkles the paper into a ball and for the first time tells the doctor whats on her mind im so sad my mom doesnt take pills because she wants to be happy she just wants to be numb id take pills if they made me numb but they dont she sniffles and bites her lip hard until shes sure she wont cry shed like the doctor to take everything this time shed like to be so empty that she doesnt remember how to breathe the machine starts clicking and humming she gets nervous was she wrong to say that pills dont work continue the voice tells her the thing she really wants to say sits on her tongue like a sliver of reconstituted nectarine she bites down and lets its juice run down her chin this is not her problem she is not accountable he has done this to her her father the doctor too i hate my father he drinks he hit me last night she notices dully that her voice now echoes im being recorded she thinks and then good now hell really get in trouble he makes us wear air filters in our chests even though the epa says we dont need them he fills the apartment with them too he says hes working on safe cigarettes at the lab but really hes testing metal dust on mice again he says its the debris from the bombs thats killing us all those falling buildings hes going to move us to canada because theyre granting amnesty i heard him talking he wants to get out before the mandatory ports go into effect as she talks the drug warms her shes almost sleeping sweet thick dreams she will be sick from this for days but for now it is so good continue the voice says but she doesnt have anything else to say thats all continue she tries to make something up but her thoughts scatter she licks them like gossamer spiders webs but cant collect them into coherent strands they bundle and knot in all the wrong ways i have no soul to haunt me she says because it reassures her to think this then the pull this is her least and most favorite part she closes her eyes and starts floating warmth radiates from the port in her neck she doesnt feel it there are no nerves up there just pulp and grey matter heat in tiny lasers breaks the synapses until all those bad thoughts disappear memories fade and are gone first lulu then school then the pills then her father then her soul she cant remember them anymore when the stream ends she nods off in her dream a little person lives inside of her and that person is so angry shes eating her own fingers until all that is left is a pair of opposable thumbs she holds them up bloody and ragged as the coast of a beach the table jiggles as it rescinds she falls to the floor the needle in her arm tears her skin on its way out blood squirts the needle in her port still attached yanks her head back cripes on a cross she mumbles then with an eye halfopen looks at her watch shes been sleeping for two hours a personal best she twists the tube from her port and starts out just as the sprinklers and ammonia pour from the ceiling to clean the room for another patient except for the headache that longs for more morphine shes as light as air when she opens the door to the waiting room the world is like a flat desert and she sees nothing for miles wings sparkly and slender as silk threads are attached to her back theyll fly her away in the waiting room her father is sitting next to the woman wearing the garbage bag the woman is really fat so maybe its a contractor bag you could roll her trina thinks and then she giggles the doctor has made her so happy her dad stands to greet her hes tall dark and skinny long long ago her mother used to call him beanpole my funny beanpole i could grow cumquats off your arms my funny beanpole bend down a few stories and give me a kiss two years ago the apartment got so hot that he filled the tub with ice water and they all took turns snorkeling for rubber duckies in their bathing suits hes frowning like hes worried and suddenly her stomach turns something is wrong what could it be she knows even though she cant remember she did something bad her temples throb she cradles her head like shes wounded because she wants him to know that shes hurting theres a bruise on her cheek but she doesnt know how she got it daddy she says and she doesnt know why but shes crying it smells like metal out another explosion in midtown they walk with their shirtsleeves over their noses to the car his legs scrunch in the seat and he has to bend into the steering wheel she thinks maybe hes going to hit her which is stupid because hes never once hit her in her life but he only raises his hand to make sure her sleeve stays over her nose he holds it there so she doesnt have to talk for a long while he takes care of her which come to think of it hes always done after a long while he takes his hand away so she raises her own hand to keep her shirt in place out the window ashes fall like rain if you think of them as black dandelion wishes theyre almost pretty she was mad at him she realizes so she told the doctor something very bad now hes is in trouble to keep from sobbing she puts the heel of her hand in her mouth and bites down im sorry i told she whispers through a mouthful of bone he closes his eyes for just a second remember me he says in her mind a bomb explodes where she sits its fire swallows her and her father and the car and the doctor and her apartment in queens and her city and her country and the whole world all ashes falling down hes not yet gone but already she remembers something as if she is reminiscing at his funeral before the war her dad never drank where do they go trina asks her best friend lulu the next day at lunch theyre on line in the school cafeteria she cant remember what she said to the doctor except it feels queasy like spoilt milk it feels gnawing like missing fingers where does what go lulu asks shes got a voice like darth vader because her mechanical lung needs a tuneup when trinas feeling left out she takes tiny breaths like hiccoughs until she feels loopy because lulu says that having a mechanical lung is like being high on nitrous all the time where do our thoughts go after we visit the doctor trina asks in her mind doctors across the country collect the worries into a giant vat theyre extracted one at a time by the people in charge who best know what to do with them why should the whole world worry when you can give the job to a select few thats stupid lulu giggles there are no problems thats why we go to the doctor to get adjusted its a throwback from early evolution our species worries even when nothing is wrong its a line from a commercial for the doctor that lulus quoting but trina knows better than to argue so instead she shrugs lulu scoops up a ladleful of lardfried iceberg lettuce onto her styrofoam tray she used to be one of the pretty girls but over the last few years shes gotten fat and dimwitted trina caught her on the way down trina bypasses the lettuce for a vitaminfortified fluff sandwich and they sit in the back of the cafeteria by themselves because except for each other they dont have any friends there are about twenty television screens all set to the same program brick jensens health challenge they hang from hooks in the ceiling and descend to eye level at the middle of every table lulu is fascinated brick jensen also known as mr fit is explaining that five minutes of exercise each day is enough to keep in shape so long as you do it correctly you can squeeze your butt while standing for example and do three sets of mechanical lung lunges for perfect arms you hold your backpack over your head the show is interrupted by mr mulrooney the school principal hes got a tiny black moustache so everybody calls him hitler the moustache is pencil thin though so maybe its gay hitler eccentric hitler hitler lite two days until patriot day he announces a small man trapped inside twenty small screens itll be july the th anniversary of the great emancipation remember to wear your school colors hitler lite adds if they werent maroon and orange maybe lulu mumbles her wilted lettuce looks like green poop but she keeps eating it like shes punishing herself for getting ugly if everybody wears maroon and orange ill go blind trina adds seriously its a health concern ill get dizzy and puke and go blind not necessarily in that order lulu is wheezing so trina punches her backpack until the battery starts humming shes done this enough times that it no longer requires acknowledgment theyre best friends and thats what friends are for for those of you without ports remember to bring your insurance cards hitler says and if youve got private insurance well he smiles tightly nobody here has private insurance patriot day is the same day that the law goes into effect and everybody who cant afford a private doctor has to get a port she used to be really happy about that what progress adjustments for the masses better yet poppies for the masses but that means her dad will have to get a port and she knows he doesnt want one her stomach feels hollowed out again like somebody scooped away her insides with a metal frozen yogurt spoon she thinks about the cyclops eye the list she crinkled into a ball instead of reading and the morphine she thinks about that too because she misses it already hitler makes a final announcement hes the third principal in two years they keep getting fired for embezzlement the last guy partnered with milk of magnesia so everybody got free laxatives after lunch the bathrooms stank but at least the school colors were blue she liked that a lot better than hitlers pick who wants free tang everybody knows that trip to the moon was a hoax ozone levels are too high no after school sports today hitler says before signing off bees knees shit up a tree trina moans unless its video games sports are for lesbians and stupid people everybody knows that its the running joke on the show everybodys watching lately will brick jensen get laid people keep remaking it with their own video cameras and posting it on their personal television channels its the joke that wont die its pulling its decaying corpse down the hall with its thumbs still she loves track and the weathers only been nice enough once this season because of her natural lungs trina is really good at running she even laps the boys its showing off but she cant help it she loves to run when you go fast and long enough its like being high only better its like living only good most people in this neighborhood get the operation by the time they hit grade school stores all over the mall take out your bronchi and replace them with plastic tubes that way you never cough when the bombed buildings fall but so far trina doesnt need the surgery thanks to her dad and the time she spent in westchester her lungs are clean even if it makes you popular fake lungs look like a bad idea sure you wont get cancer but what happens when they rot still shes an outcast at this school when she volunteers in class she doesnt pant like the rest of them if she says more than a sentence she doesnt need to shoot insulin in the girls room either sometimes she brings a needle anyway and fills it with saltwater sports are for lesbians and stupid people lulu wheezes trina frowns its coming back to her the stuff that got excised she wishes it would go away she wishes she was like everybody else and nothing ever bothered her but instead shes crazy like her dad ignoring lulus comment she asks do you think the doctor helps people that its good to forget lulu shrugs i wouldnt know i dont have any problems then she adds im feeling much better than yesterday trina sighs lulu always says shes feeling better but she coughs more and more its not just the battery thats low the tubes are clogged with pus the gnawing inside her hurts like a morphine headache in her mind a girl is chewing her hands into rags maybe its all a lie trina says and we cant figure it out because the doctor makes us stupid lulus jaw drops she looks around because they both know that trina said a very bad thing something so bad that if lulu reported it the committee for ethical media would take her away to a reeducation center where the kids get stuck cleaning rubble and bodies they look at each other for a while and finally lulu smiles like a phony you pink lung she teases only shes not kidding and for the first time in the three years that theyve been best friends trina is on the outside looking in the door is open to the apartment when she gets home which is new wheres dad she asks drea is watching three different programs on the television while instant chatting with her friend next door trina wishes shed inherited dreas white skin and blue eyes but no dice shes brown like a terrorist instead in big letters in the corner of the screen trina sees sports are for thesbians and flaccid people brick jenson gets me wet sour milkdelitefull on a side bar are all the quips she wrote but doesnt plan to send because unless she dumbs it down nobody ever knows what shes talking about these ashes are our loons call mad and maudlin remember my love it ends not with a bang but with a whimper the womb grows like a widening gyre and even our best suckle its poison drea was a poetinresidence at nyu when she met ramesh at a faculty dinner as his pickup line he told her that the written word was dead even then he compulsively pissed people off trinas the same way she never intends to offend anybody stuff just bursts out of her mouth half the time she doesnt even realize shes thinking it but instead of getting mad drea agreed yeah books are dead she said so what does that make me for writing poems better yet what does that make you but drea hasnt written a poem in a decade now that everybody self broadcasts audio poems she says its like genius and madness there are so many voices that you cant tell which is which anymore why was the door open was someone here trina asks outside the window she sees a fire on th street the jackson diner is burning she smells scorched indian food which is a better smell than usual on the television split screen ten people are competing to be the best art critics they look at photos of paintings scavenged from the louvre and say whether theyre any good then the judges tell them if theyre right or if the paintings are crap the second channel is that show with rhett butler and scarlet ohara where instead of breaking up they get back together the last channel is their still kitchen drea is watching their apartment on channel suddenly all three programs are interrupted and trina moans it better not be another evacuation she only just got rid of the lice in her hair from the last time she had to stay at the th street shelter the president comes on screen hes smiling hes had a lot of cosmetic surgery so he looks just like bricks brother brett jensen or maybe he is brett jensen she cant remember remember me she hears in her mind like the president is saying it her head hurts bad she misses the morphine i worry about lulu she thinks and she knows the thought is not new the doctors cure never works for long good evening the president says like hes fancy everybody else says hey america then he reminds everyone about patriot day ive got a special surprise he says and drea claps her hands together like its exmass morning at dusk on patriot day every city in this great country will launch a fire works spectacular he announces then he itemizes the cities seattle santa fe portland boston new york he doesnt mention los angeles or new orleans which makes her think theyre still at war for earthquake and flood supplies she can never remember who the war is with because it changes so often ummm her mother says like shes hungry i love all those pretty explosions we have explosions every feckin day drea trina reminds her but it doesnt do much good brett jensen the president has a dimpled smile which for some reason makes her remember the word soul a little girl with no hands is haunting her she looks at her own hands now and notices that shes been biting them teeth indentations are embedded like welts along her fingers whys the door open wheres dad she asks drea sits up from the couch and looks at trina like she doesnt recognize her think trina says where was the last place you saw him drea furrows her brow her fingers are swollen from all the typing shes supposed to use voice prompt but she prefers typing because it reminds her of writing old people i saw him on the television drea asks trinas lower lip quivers she wants to hit her mom all of a sudden which makes her even more like her dad maybe did he go to work this morning the door is open oh drea says and slides back into the couch somebody took him then so where is he she doesnt answer the president signs off and new shows start their theme songs all sound the same they plan it that way so when youre watching a bunch of shows at once its never discordant im lonely baby why dont you come sit with me drea asks and trina would like that theyll share a blanket and kiss toes like they used to trina will tell her mother what she did and her mother will forgive her together theyll figure out what to do but trina doesnt sit because things have changed and nothings the way it used to be on one of the programs a darkskinned girl with brown hair and deep circles under her eyes is standing in a dark dingy room flickering lights cast shadows against her face on the couch beneath the girl a sickly thin woman lays stretched out and halfsleeping its weird because television stars are supposed to be skinny and tan not a bunch of uggos then she figures it out its her its right now this is her life the committee for ethical media has added another camera in her room she switches to channels and then presses rewind she sighs with relief the reverse record is working she plays the tapes backward and sees herself wiping tears from her eyes while talking to her mother on the couch was she crying she doesnt remember that though she notices now that her eyes are still wet she sees stillness her mother in the dark with the shades drawn moving only to swallow vitamins and breathe then her dad with each arm held by an officer of the cem walking backward into the kitchen they wrestle a little her dad is on the floor one of the men hits him on the back of the head but then they all get up again they let him go and walk backward out the apartment the door closes and it is dad chewing toast into existence she wishes it had happened like that she uses a long metal prong to pull out the old filter its black with soot then she replaces it with a clean one and tries not to gag its small until it fills with air then it expands her dad says its the ultrafine particles you have to worry about they get into the deep lungs where there isnt any hair or phlegm to carry them back out nobody at school uses filters theyre expensive ramesh steals them from the lab theres about fifty hidden behind the false wall panel in her bedroom as she walks she remembers shes not supposed to but she cant help it first came the cold table and then the blinking eye and then the slap against her cheek and the echo of her voice as it was recorded she puts her hand in her mouth and bites down until she draws blood but it doesnt make her feel any better her father she told and now hes gone the main branch of the committee for ethical media is at the old library near bryant park in manhattan a guard at the subway station orders her to spread her legs because it looks like shes hiding a bomb up there he loses interest when she tells him shes got antibiotic resistant syphilis after an hour the f train never shows because the th street bridge is closed due to a bomb threat she hikes it north over the triborough then grabs the train downtown by the time she gets to the cem its night but the city is lit up so bright it feels like day she takes a number and waits the woman sitting next to her is wearing a trash bag this time its white and lemon scented so slightly less offensive she falls asleep for a while when she wakes its morning and her number is three spots away they call her name shes up in a flash ramesh narayan she asks a woman punches something into a computer rammy naran nope next no wait you spelled it wrong here the woman enters the name again then she frowns cremated or buried trina tries not to hear this she tries very hard there is something bad on her tongue bile maybe no he was taken in for voluntary questioning so it says then she leans over the counter she is wheezing badly and her backpack is hissing like a bum who got stabbed heart attack during interrogation she answers cremation or burial trinas tries to think but the words dont make sense shes not sure theyre english her hand is in her mouth and shes biting hard it tastes like salt i love my dad she mumbles and he loves me which your insurance covers both the woman says her backpack is gasping trina thinks about the cold bottle against her cheek the bruise is still tender and she touches it now and pushes hard until it hurts shed like it to reverse heal shed like to wear the scar for the rest of her life its a mistake she says he was going to get us out i made a mistake the woman shakes her head youre right there was a mistake trinas crying all of a sudden from relief yes i knew they only took him for questioning shes holding onto the counter because otherwise shell fall daddy she shouts daddy where are you because maybe hell hear her voice in one of the interrogation rooms and know that she came all the way from queens to rescue him hell know shes sorry the woman grabs hold of trinas wrist like a lobster catching prey her grip clamps tighter when trina tries to shake her off we couldnt find next of kin so the cem already incinerated him thats the mistake hes still dead kid now shut your mouth before the guards arrest you for making a racket then she lets go and places a barcoded ticket on the counter you can pick him up at that address no trina says thats wrong ramesh narayan before the war he gave lectures all over the country he was an important man the ticket the woman says only trina sees that shes not mad just tired her lips are almost blue from lack of oxygen sure maybe its a mistake but thats where youll find out trina looks down at her shoes in her mind there is a bomb at her feet when it explodes a hole opens in the earth and swallows her the girl left standing in the cem lobby is just a shell made of tubes and plastic surgery a confection of the doctor sweet and stupid as cotton candy shes panting and wet with sweat by the time she jogs the forty blocks downtown to the east village shed keep running forever if she could but the buildings name comes into view city morgue she stands in front of it for a long while catching her breath unlike jackson heights a lot of people in manhattan dont have mechanical lungs instead theyre zipped inside big plastic bubbles equipped with molecular air generators theyre skinny and they dress in high heels even the men they look like a different species as they pass the front of the building she thinks about poking holes in their generators the air will leak slowly and then theyll start coughing just like everybody else once inside the building she exchanges her ticket for a number and waits after a while a guy with no teeth hands her a styrofoam urn shes not sure its her dad but theres a picture burned into the side in it ramesh is wearing his tan work suit his dead eyes are closed shed like to eat the urn that way shell never forget there were the animals that died in his lab little spotted mice with pink tongues they couldnt survive the debris there are buildings that fall the third world war in the last twenty years there is her mother who used to laugh there is her best friend lulu they blend together they coalesce like mercury like morphine they bathe her she is bathed in death perhaps shell run out of here and never stop there is canada like her dad planned but would they really have gotten there or would patriot day have come with blood and fireworks and then gone gently into another day she knows the answer and for once it makes her think no less of him he would have anesthetized his new port with vodka and after a visit or two to the doctor hed have become just like everyone else there was no plan for escape there was only rage and talk but these were better that nothing i wont forget she whispers and she knows she should say it to the ashes but she cant bring herself to open the urn she walks the whole way and doesnt get home until the next morning her feet are bleeding squishsquish when she walks inside drea is on the couch shes been sneaking extra visits to the doctor and trina can tell from her dilated blue eyes that she saw him recently she puts the ashes on the table the television is tuned to four channels this time there is a view of the neighbors apartment the weird guy is having sex with his daughter drea is sad about that so shes hiding her face trina cant figure out if its really happening or a programmed show she turns off the television this is dad she says drea is quiet she knows shes supposed to explain but she doesnt know how she cant help it she laughs this is dad light as a feather this is my hand covered in open sores drea examines the photo and then opens the styrofoam top if this is your father what does that make me she asks when she wakes the next morning she cant help it she forgets she was supposed to remember she spies drea running her fingers through the ashes and goes on automatic pilot she calls the doctor he cant squeeze her in until tonight she uses lulus name she figures lulu wont care its all for a good cause just the thought of the needle makes her skin tingle she cant wait for the needle remember me drea is playing the television so loud that it gives her a headache so even though shed rather stay home she walks to school its patriot day so everyone is wearing maroon and orange in her black jeans and tshirt trina sticks out like a bloody thumb there arent any classes just lines of people waiting to sit on gurneys in the auditorium and get their free ports along the aisles theyre handing out tang juice and fluff sandwiches in her mind she tears the ports from kids skulls and watches them bleed she tears out her own port too up on the podium the seniors are giving speeches to the underclassmen before my port i wasnt sure but now i know im happy the doctor makes everything better this will be the best day of your life but then hitler interrupts the testimonials for a special announcement something about a pep rally and bonfire tonight after the fireworks he wants people to bring things to burn she stops listening until she hears lulus name shes been hiding from lulu all day because if she sees her itll make what happened to her father real instead of a dream shell have to talk about it shell have to say his name hitler lite continues complications of the complication on the complication he says blah blah blah lets bow our heads for a moment in memory of lulu walker her face goes red its so hot shes sweating she doesnt stay to hear any more shes out the door she knows she shouldnt be here she promised she wouldnt come she hates him then again shes got no place else to go emergency she tells the nurse in pleather and vinyl i have to see the doctor lulu walker she takes a ticket the woman sitting next to her is wearing a sheet shes shaking like she needs a fix real bad trina doesnt look too closely because the woman is drea she closes her eyes and thinks about the trickle through her veins she thinks about emptiness she thinks about the filter in her lungs full of ashes the dead are all around her she is breathing them and still the buildings topple while the televisions sing remember me why it hurts too much lulu walker the nurse calls and shes up in a flash needles inserted blood squirted she lays down white eye to red to green she begins i worry about the speed of things i worry you murdered my dad i murdered my dad i worry he was right all along only i hated him so much i didnt see it i worry this war will never end its just a lie to keep us stupid her voice echoes its being recorded theyll think its lulu probably continue it tells her and she finally recognizes the voice its the same lady on will brick jensen get laid who says that sports are for lesbians and stupid people the morphine tingles in her arm she starts forgetting even though the doctor hasnt entered her port yet the treatment is finally working she realizes its not brain damage theyre after everybody remembers eventually no matter how often theyre adjusted the doctor isnt the cure its selfregulation its forgetting with the snap of a finger the promise of a tingle in the arm forgetting in the anticipation of pleasure forgetting because its easier and youre tired of fighting when every day things get worse instead of better its learning to be your own doctor thats what patriot day is all about continue the woman repeats shes been paid for her voice of course an actress they do it all the time trina thinks shes going to laugh but instead she is crying as the morphine drips it doesnt feel good this time it just feels sick lulu is dead her father is dead even the living are dead the laser begins to shoot and her father is disappearing the machine is killing her father bean pole with dark circles they used to swing their feet on the bench in westchester sidebyside the memory disappears burned away she searches for it but its gone next goes the bathtub where he taught her to swim gone she is killing her father she is a murderer the doctor is a murderer she pulls the needle like a plug precious morphine drips she unlocks the port click then shes kicking the machine shes beating it senseless with her bitten and scarred hands because two days ago ramesh was here two days ago even though he knew she would betray him he was waiting for her he loved her she punches and kicks until the cyclops eye shatters then she pops the needle inside its gaping wound the morphine wets the wires and the doctors lights go out it goes to sleep and forgets but she does not she leaves fast before they can figure out what she did it wont be long before they come for her there is video lulu is dead theyll figure it out theyll lock her up or worse she thinks about canada it would make her father proud but she doesnt have the paperwork to leave the state she could take a train to westchester but shes broke besides theyll run her name through the cem database an idea occurs to her and she likes it she could walk shes good at that shell insert a double filter and cross the triborough at night when they wont see her walking the old pedestrian path shell sleep during the day and walk as long as it takes shell visit those places shes heard about where there is grass and dirt where there are animals and birdsongs and she doesnt need a filter but do places like that exist anymore she goes home first the apartment door is wide open and her fathers ashes are scattered on the coffee table the television is loud she packs a bag full of filters and vitaminenriched fluff wears it on her shoulders like a mechanical lung mom she calls drea is lying on the bed the bottle of vitamins is empty trinas first thought is a bad one but then drea opens her eyes sweetie she moans i got lost and had to find a nice policeman to take me home they put this on my arm so it doesnt happen again drea lifts her wrist where a barcode has been branded into her skin youd think theyd just write the address but nobody likes words anymore do they trina sits down on the bed her mom doesnt move her head is upsidedown which makes her look alien im in trouble she says drea blinks her fingernails are dirty or maybe ashy the cameras light is green just like the doctors and she thinks about smashing it shed like to say im leaving come with me mom but this is being recorded so instead she stands ill remember both of you she says drea smiles how nice shes walking backward out the door like this is a movie in rewind they havent really lived in this hole for three years her mother isnt really a junkie she didnt really rat her father out to the cem and get him killed she isnt really leaving all that shes ever known bye mom she croaks as she crosses the threshold then shes running down the steps the streets are red and the sky is ashes inside her a girl is chewing the scenery shes ripping down all the old pictures and making everything blank a girl is yelling and shouting and crying and breathing and running and thinking and remembering this girl is her feet pounding she doesnt stop until shes out of breath when she looks up a crowd of people has amassed under the triborough bridge in astoria park have they come to arrest her so soon no she remembers its patriot day all along the street and sidewalk are floodlights gurneys and the sound of drills the streets look wet and at first she thinks its water but no its blood people stand in lines onehundred bodies deep waiting for the messy operation scalp wounds bleed her sneakers are red when the sky explodes she thinks at first that its another bomb but then there are colors red white and blue heads bobble in unison thousands and peer into the light she notices now the men with guns theyre here to make sure that everybody even the people who try to back out get their ports she pushes through the crowd and gets onto the bridge the road is so thick with people that she can hardly move still she pushes there are others she notices who do not look at the bright lights in the sky they navigate the crowd and try to make their faces blank but they cant theyre terrified just like her one in a hundred maybe one in a thousand but still she spots them still they exist have there always been others only shes never noticed them before or is it that shes never been one of them before she knows the secret now and it has nothing to do with the doctor the way to remember is to stop forcing yourself to forget the people like her make their way across the bridge while the other stand still and block the way some are alone others in small groups of three or four heads bent chests pounding they steer through the immobile throng she thinks theyre all headed for the same place canada or free vermont a few are wearing neck kerchiefs and she realizes its because they have no ports remember her father told her and she will do more than that she doesnt know its happening until her breath comes ragged shes running along the bridge in blood stained shoes shes not sure but it seems like shes the first others follow soon half the bridge is shaking pounding there arent many of them but theyre determined they are running it feels so good the air slapping her face she was born for this to run she will keep running until she is far away until she can watch the fireworks of patriot day from some place free the lunatics by kim stanley robinson kim stanley robinson is the bestselling author of fifteen novels including three series the mars trilogy the three

robinson he is the winner of two hugos two nebulas six locus awards the world fantasy award the british science fiction award and the john w campbell memorial award his latest novel galileos dream came out in at the end of the nineteenth century coal mining had become one of the biggest meanest industries in the united states unhealthy working conditions and a reliance on child labor caused accidents and blackened mens lungs crooked business practices like debt bondage and wagecheating were just part of the misery but it was dangerous to stand up against the mining companies miners didnt just face losing their jobs their lives were often at stake as mining companies fought against unionizing with violence the coal miners struggles for better conditions were captured in photos and songs that have become a warning for the workers of the world but in the future miners might not be so lucky what could be worse than working deep beneath the ground never seeing the light of day what could be worse than knowing the money in your paycheck was a token worthless outside the companys store our next story gives us a vision of a mine worse than anything in pennsylvania powered by slavery and jumpstarted by torment this mine might as well be hell they were very near the center of the moon jakob told them he was the newest member of the bullpen but already their leader how do you know solly challenged him it was stifling the hot air thick with the reek of their sweat and a pungent stink from the waste bucket in the corner in the pure black under the blanket of the rocks basalt silence their shifting and snuffling loomed large defined the size of the pen i suppose you see it with your third eye jakob had a laugh as big as his hands he was a big man never a doubt of that of course not solly the third eye is for seeing in the black its a natural sense just like the others it takes all the data from the rest of the senses and processes them into a visual image transmitted by the third optic nerve which runs from the forehead to the sight centers at the back of the brain but you can only focus it by an act of the will same as with all the other senses its not magic we just never needed it till now so how do you know its a problem in spherical geometry and i solved it oliver and i solved it this big vein of blue runs right down into the core i believe down into the moons molten heart where we can never go but well follow it as far as we can note how light were getting theres less gravity near the center of things i feel heavier than ever you are heavy solly heavy with disbelief wheres freeman hester said in her crows rasp no one replied oliver stirred uneasily over the rough basalt of the pens floor first naomi then mute elijah now freeman somewhere out in the shafts and caverns tunnels and corridors somewhere in the dark maze of mines people were disappearing their pen was emptying it seemed and the other pens free at last jakob murmured theres something out there hester said fear edging her harsh voice so that it scraped olivers nerves like the screech of an ore cars wheels over a toosharp bend in the tracks something out there the rumor had spread through the bullpens already whispered mouth to ear or in huddled groups of bodies there were thousands of shafts bored through the rock hundreds of chambers and caverns lots of these were closed off but many more were left open and there was room to hide miles and miles of it first some of their cows had disappeared now it was people too and oliver had heard a miner jabbering at the low edge of hysteria about a giant foreman gone mad after an accident took both his arms at the shoulder the arms had been replaced by prostheses and the foreman had escaped into the black where he preyed on miners off by themselves ripping them up feeding on them they all heard the steely squeak of a cars wheel up the mother shaft past cross tunnel forty had to be foremen at this time of shift would the car turn at the fork to their concourse their hypersensitive ears focused on the distant sound no one breathed the wheels squeaked turned their way oliver who was already shivering began to shake hard the car stopped before their pen the door opened all in darkness not a sound from the quaking miners fierce white light blasted them and they cried out leaped back against the cage bars vainly blinded oliver cringed at the clawing of a foremans hands searching under his shirt and pants through pupils like pinholes he glimpsed brief blackandwhite snapshots of gaunt bodies undergoing similar searches then blows shouts cries of pain smack of flesh on flesh an electric buzzing shaving their heads could it be that time again already he was struck in the stomach choked around the neck hesters long wiry brown arms wrapped around her head scalp burned buzzz all chopped up thrown to the rock wheres the twelfth in the foremens staccato language no one answered the foremen left light receding with them until it was black again the pure dense black that was their own except now it was swimming with bright red bars washing around in painful tears olivers third eye opened a little which calmed him because it was still a new experience he could make out his companions dim redblack shapes in the black huddled over themselves gasping jakob moved among them checking for hurts comforting he cupped olivers forehead and oliver said its seeing already good work on his knees jakob clumped to their shit bucket took off the lid reached in he pulled something out oliver marveled at how clearly he was able to see all this before floating blobs of color had drifted in the black but he had always assumed they were afterimages or hallucinations only with jakobs instruction had he been able to perceive the patterns they made the vision that they constituted it was an act of will that was the key now as jakob cleaned the object with his urine and spit oliver found that the eye in his forehead saw even more in sharp blood etchings jakob held the lump overhead and it seemed it was a little lamp pouring light over them in a wavelength they had always been able to see but had never needed before by its faint ghostly radiance the whole pen was made clear a structure etched in blood redblack on black promethium jakob breathed the miners crowded around him faces lifted to it solly had a little pug nose and squinched his face terribly in the effort to focus hester had a face to go with her voice stark bones under skin scored with lines the most precious element on earth our masters rule by it all their civilization is based on it on the movement inside it electrons escaping their shells and crashing into neutrons giving off heat and more blue as well so they condemn us to a life of pulling it out of the moon for them he chipped at the chunk with a thumbnail they all knew precisely its clayey texture its heaviness the dull silvery gray of it which pulsed green under some lasers blue under others jakob gave each of them a sliver ofit take it between two molars and crush hard then swallow its poison isnt it said solly after years and years the big laugh filling the black we dont have years and years you know that and in the short run it helps your vision in the black it strengthens the will oliver put the soft heavy sliver between his teeth chomped down felt the metallic jolt swallowed it throbbed in him he could see the others faces the mesh of the pen walls the pens farther down the concourse the robot tracks all in the lightless black promethium is the moons living substance jakob said quietly we walk in the nerves of the moon tearing them out under the lash of the foremen the shafts are a map of where the neurons used to be as they drag the moons mind out by its roots to take it back to earth and use it for their own enrichment the lunar consciousness fills us and we become its mind ourselves to save it from extinction they joined hands solly hester jakob and oliver the surge of energy passed through them leaving a sweet afterglow then they lay down on their rock bed and jakob told them tales of his home of the pacific dockyards of the cliffs and wind and waves and the way the suns light lay on it all of the jazz in the bars and how trumpet and clarinet could cross each other how do you remember solly asked plaintively they turned me blank jakob laughed hard i fell on my mothers knitting needles when i was a boy and one went right up my nose chopped the hippocampus in two so all my life my brain has been storing what memories it can somewhere else they burned a dead part of me and left the living memory intact did it hurt hester croaked the needles you bet a flash like the foremens prods right there in the center of me i suppose the moon feels the same pain when we mine her but im grateful now because it opened my third eye right at that moment ever since then ive seen with it and down here without our third eye its nothing but the black oliver nodded remembering and something out there croaked hester next shift start oliver was keyed by a foreman then made his way through the dark to the end of the long slender vein of blue he was working oliver was a tall youth and some of the shaft was low no time had been wasted smoothing out the veins irregular shape he had to crawl between the narrow tracks bolted to the rocky uneven floor scraping through some gaps as if working through a great twisted intestine at the shaft head he turned on the robot a long lowslung metal box on wheels he activated the laser drill which faintly lit the exposed surface of the blue blinding him for some time when he regained a certain visual equilibrium mostly by ignoring the weird illumination of the drill beam he typed instructions into the robot and went to work drilling into the face then guiding the robots scoop and hoist to the broken pieces of blue when the big chunks were in the ore cars behind the robot he jackhammered loose any fragments of the ore that adhered to the basalt walls and added them to the cars before sending them off this vein was tapering down becoming a mere tendril in the lunar body and there was less and less room to work in soon the robot would be too big for the shaft and they would have to bore through basalt they would follow the tendril to its very end hoping for a bole or a fan at first oliver didnt much mind the shifts work but irdirected cameras on the robot surveyed him as well as the shaft face and occasional shocks from its prod reminded him to keep hustling and in the heat and bad air as he grew ever more famished it soon enough became the usual desperate painful struggle to keep to the required pace time disappeared into that zone of endless agony that was the latter part of a shift then he heard the distant klaxon of shifts end echoing down the shaft like a cry in a dream he turned the key in the robot and was plunged into noiseless black the pure absolute of nonbeing too tired to try opening his third eye oliver started back up the shaft by feel following the last ore car of the shift it rolled quickly ahead of him and was gone in the new silence distant mechanical noises were like creaks in the rock he measured out the shifts work having marked its beginning on the shaft floor eightynine lengths of his body average it took a long time to get back to the junction with the shaft above his here there was a confluence of veins and the room opened out into an odd chamber some seven feet high but wider than oliver could determine in every direction when he snapped his fingers there was no rebound at all the usual light at the far end of the low chamber was absent feeling sandwiched between two endless rough planes of rock oliver experienced a sudden claustrophobia there was a whole world overhead he was buried alive he crouched and every few steps tapped one rail with his ankle navigating blindly a hand held forward to discover any dips in the ceiling he was somewhere in the middle of this space when he heard a noise behind him he froze air pushed at his face it was completely dark completely silent the noise squeaked behind him again a sound like a fingernail brushed along the banded metal of piano wire it ran right up his spine and he felt the hair on his forearms pull away from the dried sweat and stick straight out he was holding his breath very slow footsteps were placed softly behind him perhaps forty feet away an airy snuffle like a big nostril sniffing for the footsteps to be so spaced out it would have to be oliver loosened his joints held one arm out and the other forward tiptoed away from the rail at right angles to it for twelve feathery steps in the lunar gravity he felt he might even float then he sank to his knees breathed through his nose as slowly as he could stand to his heart knocked at the back of his throat he was sure it was louder than his breath by far over that noise and the roar of blood in his ears he concentrated his hearing to the utmost pitch now he could hear the faint sounds of ore cars and perhaps miners and foremen far down the tunnel that led from the far side of this chamber back to the pens even as faint as they were they obscured further his chances of hearing whatever it was in the cavern with him the footsteps had stopped then came another metallic scrick over the rail heard against a light sniff oliver cowered held his arms hard against his sides knowing he smelled of sweat and fear far down the distant shaft a foreman spoke sharply if he could reach that voice he resisted the urge to run for it feeling sure somehow that whatever was in there with him was fast another scrick oliver cringed trying to reduce his echo profile there was a chip of rock under his hand he fingered it hand shaking his forehead throbbed and he understood it was his third eye straining to pierce the black silence and see a shape with pillarthick legs all in blocks of redblack it was some sort of scrick sniff it was turning his way a flick of the wrist the chip of rock skittered hitting ceiling and then floor back in the direction he had come from very slow soft footsteps as if the legs were somehow they were coming in his direction he straightened and reached above him hands scrabbling over the rough basalt he felt a deep groove in the rock and next to it a vertical hole he jammed a hand in the hole made a fist put the fingers of the other hand along the side of the groove and pulled himself up the toes of his boot fit the groove and he flattened up against the ceiling in the lunar gravity he could stay there forever holding his breath step step snuffle fairly near the floor which had given him the idea for this move he couldnt turn to look he felt something scrape the hip pocket of his pants and thought he was dead but fear kept him frozen and the sounds moved off into the distance of the vast chamber without a pause he dropped to the ground and bolted doubled over for the far tunnel which loomed before him redblack in the black exuding air and faint noise he plunged right in it feeling one wall nick a knuckle he took the sharp right he knew was there and threw himself down to the intersection of floor and wall footsteps padded by him apparently running on the rails when he couldnt hold his breath any longer he breathed three or four minutes passed and he couldnt bear to stay still he hurried to the intersection turned left and slunk to the bullpen at the checkpoint the monitors horn squawked and a foreman blasted him with a searchlight pawed him roughly hey the foreman held a big chunk of blue taken from olivers hip pocket what was this sorry boss oliver said jerkily trying to see it properly remembering the thing brushing him as it passed under mustve fallen in he ignored the foremans curse and blow and fell into the pen tearful with the pain of the light with relief at being back among the others every muscle in him was shaking but hester never came back from that shift sometime later the foremen came back into their bullpen wielding the lights and the prods to line them up against one mesh wall through pinprick pupils oliver saw just the grossest slabs of shapes all grainy blackandgray jakob was a big stout man with a short black beard under the shaved head and eyes that popped out glittering even in olivers silhouette world miners are disappearing from your pen the foreman said in the miners language his voice was like the quartz they tunneled through occasionally hard and sparkly with cracks and stresses as if it might break at any moment into a laugh or a scream no one answered finally jakob said we know the foreman stood before him they started disappearing when you arrived jakob shrugged not what i hear the foremans searchlight was right on jakobs face which stood out brilliantly as if two of the searchlights were pointed at each other olivers third eye suddenly opened and gave the face substance brown skin heavy brows scarred scalp not at all the white cut out blazing from the black shadows youd better be careful miner loudly enough to be heard from neighboring pens jakob said not my fault if something out there is eating us boss the foreman struck him lights bounced and they all dropped to the floor for protection presenting their backs to the boots rain of blows pain of blows still several pens had to have heard him foremen gone white blindness returned to black blindness to the death velvet of their pure darkness for a long time they lay in their own private worlds hugging the warm rock of the floor feeling the bruises blush then jakob crawled around and squatted by each of them placing his hands on their foreheads oh yeah he would say youre okay wake up now look around you and in the afterblack they stretched and stretched quivering like dogs on a scent the bulks in the black the shapes they made as they moved and groaned yes it came to oliver again and he rubbed his face and looked around eyes shut to help him see i ran into it on the way back in he said they all went still he told them what had happened the blue in your pocket they considered his story in silence no one understood it no one spoke of hester oliver found he couldnt she had been his friend to live without that gaunt crows voice sometime later the side door slid up and they hurried into the barn to eat the chickens squawked as they took the eggs the cows mooed as they milked them the stove plates turned the slightest bit luminous redblack again and by their light his three eyes saw all solly cracked and fried eggs oliver went to work on his vats of cheese pulled out a round of it that was ready jakob sat at the rear of one cow and laughed as it turned to butt his knee splish splish splish splish when he was done he picked up the cow and put it down in front of its hay where it chomped happily animal stink of them all the many fine smells of food cutting through it jakob laughed at his cow which butted his knee again as if objecting to the ridicule little pig of a cow little piglet mexican cows they bred for this size you know on earth the ordinary cow is as tall as oliver and about as big as this whole pen they laughed at the idea not believing him the buzzer cut them off and the meal was over back into their pen to lay their bodies down still no talk of hester and oliver found his skin crawling again as he recalled his encounter with whatever it was that sniffed through the mines jakob came over and asked him about it sounding puzzled then he handed oliver a rock imagine this is a perfect sphere like a baseball baseball like a ball bearing perfectly round and smooth you know ah yes spherical geometry again trigonometry too oliver groaned resisting the work then jakob got him interested despite himself in the intricacy of it all the way it all fell together in a complex but comprehensible pattern sine and cosine so clear and the clearer it got the more he could see the mesh of the bullpen the network of shafts and tunnels and caverns piercing the jumbled fabric of the moons body all clear lines of redblack on black like the metal of the stove plate as it just came visible and all from jakobs clear patiently fingered perfectly balanced equations he could see through rock good work jakob said when oliver got tired they lay there among the others shifting around to find hollows for their hips silence of the offshift muffled clanks downshaft floor trembling at a detonation miles of rock away ears popped as air smashed into the dead end of their tunnel compressed to something nearly liquid for just an instant must have been a boesman ringing silence again so what is it jakob solly asked when they could hear each other again its an element jakob said sleepily a strange kind of element nothing else like it promethium number on the periodic table a rare earth a lanthanide an inner transition metal were finding it in veins of an ore called monazite and in pure grains and nuggets scattered in the ore impatient almost pleading but what makes it so special for a long time jakob didnt answer they could hear him thinking then he said atoms have a nucleus made of protons and neutrons bound together around this nucleus shells of electrons spin and each shell is either full or trying to get full to balance with the number of protons to balance the positive and negative charges an atom is like a human heart you see now promethium is radioactive which means its out of balance and parts of it are breaking free but promethium never reaches its balance because it radiates in a manner that increases its instability rather than the reverse promethium atoms release energy in the form of positrons flying free when neutrons are hit by electrons but during that impact more neutrons appear in the nucleus seems theyre coming from nowhere so each atom of the blue is a power loop in itself giving off energy perpetually some people say that theyre little white holes every single atom of them burning forever at nine hundred and forty curies per gram bringing energy into our universe from somewhere else little gateways sollys sigh filled the black expressing incomprehension for all of them so its poisonous its dangerous sure because the positrons breaking away from it fly right through flesh like ours mostly they never touch a thing in us because thats how close to phantoms we are mostly blood which is almost light thats why we can see each other so well but sometimes a beta particle will hit something small on its way through could mean nothing or it could kill you on the spot eventually itll get us all oliver fell asleep dreaming of threads of light like concentrations of the foremens fierce flashes passing right through him shifts passed in their timeless round they ached when they woke on the warm basalt floor they ached when they finished the long work shifts they were hungry and often injured none of them could say how long they had been there none of them could say how old they were sometimes they lived without light other than the robots lasers and the stove plates sometimes the foremen visited with their scorching lighthouse beams every offshift shouting questions and beating them apparently cows were disappearing cylinders of air and oxygen supplies of all sorts none of it mattered to oliver but the spherical geometry he knew where he was he could see it the threedimensional map in his head grew more extensive every shift but everything else was fading away so its the most powerful substance in the world solly said but why us why are we here you dont know jakob said they blanked us remember all thats gone but because of jakob they knew what was up there the domed palaces on the lunar surface the fantastic luxuries of earth when he spoke of it in fact a lot of earth came back to them and they babbled and chattered at the unexpected upwellings memories that deep couldnt be blanked without killing jakob said and so they prevailed after all in a way but there was much that had been burnt forever and so jakob sighed yeah yeah i remember i just thought well were here for different reasons some were criminals some complained like hester they laughed yeah i suppose thats what got her here but a lot of us were just in the wrong place at the wrong time wrong politics or skin or whatever wrong look on your face that was me i bet solly said and the others laughed at him well i got a funny face i know i do i can feel it jakob was silent for a long time what about you oliver asked more silence the rumble of a distant detonation like muted thunder i wish i knew but im like you in that i dont remember the actual arrest they must have hit me on the head given me a concussion i must have said something against the mines i guess and the wrong people heard me bad luck yeah bad luck more shifts passed oliver rigged a timepiece with two rocks a length of detonation cord and a set of pulleys and confirmed over time what he had come to suspect the work shifts were getting longer it was more and more difficult to get all the way through one harder to stay awake for the meals and the geometry lessons during the offshifts the foremen came every offshift now blasting in with their searchlights and shouts and kicks leaving in a swirl of afterimages and pain solly went out one shift cursing them under his breath and never came back disappeared the foremen beat them for it and oliver shouted with rage its not our fault theres something out there i saw it its killing us then next shift his little tendril of a vein bloomed he couldnt find any rock around the blue a big bole he would have to tell the foremen start working in a crew he dismantled his clock on the way back he heard the footsteps again shuffling along slowly behind him this time he was at the entrance to the last tunnel the pens close behind him he turned to stare into the darkness with his third eye willing himself to see the thing whoosh of air a sniff a footfall on the rail far across the thin wedge of air a beam of light flashed making a long narrow cone of white talc steel tracks gleamed where the wheels of the car burnished them pupils shrinking like a snails antennae he stared back at the footsteps saw nothing then just barely two points of red retinas reflecting the distant lance of light they blinked he bolted and ran again reached the foremen at the checkpoint in seconds they blinded him as he panted passed him through and into the bullpen after the meal on that shift oliver lay trembling on the floor of the bullpen and told jakob about it im scared jakob solly hester freeman mute lije naomi theyre all gone everyone i know here is gone but us free at last jakob said shortly here lets do your problems for tonight i dont care about them you have to care about them nothing matters unless you do that blue is the mind of the moon being torn away and the moon knows it if we learn what the network says in its shapes then the moon knows that too and were suffered to live not if that thing finds us you dont know anyway nothing to be done about it come on lets do the lesson we need it so they worked on equations in the dark both were distracted and the work went slowly they fell asleep in the middle of it right there on their faces shifts passed oliver pulled a muscle in his back and excavating the bole he had found was an agony of discomfort when the bole was cleared it left a space like the interior of an egg ivory and black and quite smooth punctuated only by the bluish spots of other tendrils of monazite extending away through the basalt they left a catwalk across the central space with decks cut into the rock on each side and ramps leading to each of the veins of blue and began drilling on their own again one man and robot team to each vein at each shifts end oliver rushed to get to the eggchamber at the same time as all the others so that he could return the rest of the way to the bullpen in a crowd this worked well until one shift came to an end with the hoist chockfull of the ore it took him some time to dump it into the ore car and shut down so he had to cross the catwalk alone and he would be alone all the way back to the pens surely it was past time to move the pens closer to the shaft heads he didnt want to do this halfway across the catwalk he heard a faint noise ahead of him scrick scriiiiiiik he jerked to a stop held the rail hard couldnt reach the ceiling here back stabbing its protest he started to climb over the railing he could hang from the underside he was right on the top of the railing when he was seized up by a number of strong cold hands he opened his mouth to scream and his mouth was filled with wet clay the blue his head was held steady and his ears filled with the same stuff so that the sounds of his own terrified sharp nasal exhalations were suddenly cut off promethium it would kill him it hurt his back to struggle on he was being carried horizontally ankles whipped arms tied against his body then plugs of the clay were shoved up his nose and in the middle of a final paroxysm of resistance his mind fell away into the black the lowest whisper in the world said oliver pen twelve he heard the voice with his stomach he was astonished to be alive you will never be given anything again do you accept the charge he struggled to nod i never wanted anything he tried to say i only wanted a life like anyone else you will have to fight for every scrap of food every swallow of water every breath of air do you accept the charge i accept the charge i welcome it in the eternal night you will steal from the foremen kill the foremen oppose their work in every way do you accept the charge i welcome it you will live free in the mind of the moon will you take up this charge he sat up his mouth was clear filled only with the sharp electric aftertaste of the blue he saw the shapes around him there were five of them five people there and suddenly he understood joy ballooned in him and he said i will oh i will a light appeared accustomed as he was either to no light or to intense blasts of it oliver at first didnt comprehend he thought his third eye was rapidly gaining power as perhaps it was but there was also a laser drill from one of the a robots shot at low power through a cylindrical ceramic electronic element in a way that made the cylinder glow yellow blind like a fish openmouthed weak eyes gaping and watering floods he saw around him solly hester freeman mute elijah naomi yes he said and tried to embrace them all at once oh yes they were in one of the longabandoned caverns a flatbottomed bole with only three tendrils extending away from it the chamber was filled with objects oliver was more used to identifying by feel or sound or smell pens of cows and hens a stack of air cylinders and suits three ore cars two b robots an a robot a pile of tracks and miscellaneous gear he walked through it all slowly hester at his side she was gaunt as ever her skin as dark as the shadows it sucked up the weak light from the ceramic tube and gave it back only in little points and lines why didnt you tell me it was the same for all of us this is the way and naomi the same for her too but when she agreed to it she found herself alone then it was jakob he thought suddenly wheres jakob rasped hes coming we think oliver nodded thought about it was it you then following me those times why didnt you speak that wasnt us hester said when he explained what had happened she cawed a laugh that was something else still out there then jakob stood before them making them both jump they shouted and the others all came running pressed into a mass together jakob laughed all here now he said turn that light off we dont need it and they didnt laser shut down ceramic cooled they could still see they could see right into each other red shapes in the black radiating joy everything in the little chamber was quite distinct quite visible we are the mind of the moon without shifts to mark the passage of time oliver found he could not judge it at all they worked hard and they were constantly on the move always up through level after level of the mine like shells of the atom and were that particle busted loose and on its way out they ate when they were famished slept when they had to most of the time they worked either bringing down shafts behind them or dismantling depots and stealing everything jakob designated theirs a few times they ambushed gangs of foremen killing them with laser cutters and stripping them of valuables but on jakobs orders they avoided contact with foremen when they could he wanted only material after a long time twenty sleeps at least they had six ore cars of it all trailing an a robot up longabandoned and empty shafts where they had to lay the track ahead of them and pull it out behind as fast as they could move among other items jakob had an insatiable hunger for explosives he couldnt get enough of them it got harder to avoid the foremen who were now heavily armed and on their guard perhaps even searching for them it was hard to tell but they searched with their lighthouse beams on full power to stay out of ambush it was easy to see them at a distance draw them off lose them in dead ends detonate mines under them all the while the little band moved up rising by infinitely long detours toward the front side of the moon the rock around them cooled the air circulated more strongly until it was a constant wind through the seismometers they could hear from far below the rumbling of cars heavy machinery detonations oh theyre after us all right jakob said theyre running scared he was happy with the booty they had accumulated which included a great number of cylinders of compressed air and pure oxygen also vacuum suits for all of them and a lot more explosives including ten boesmans which were much too big for any ordinary mining were getting close jakob said as they ate and drank then tended the cows and hens as they lay down to sleep by the cars he would talk to them about their work each of them had various jobs mute elijah was in charge of their supplies solly of the robot hester of the seismography naomi and freeman were learning demolition and were in some undefined sense jakobs lieutenants oliver kept working at his navigation they had found charts of the tunnel systems in their area and oliver was memorizing them so that he would know at each moment exactly where they were he found he could do it remarkably well each time they ventured on he knew where the forks would come where they would lead always upward but the pursuit was getting hotter it seemed there were foremen everywhere patrolling the shafts in search of them soon theyll mine some passages and try to drive us into them jakob said its about time we left left oliver repeated left the system struck out on our own dig our own tunnel naomi said happily yes to where hester croaked then they were rocked by an explosion that almost broke their eardrums and the air rushed away the rock around them trembled creaked groaned cracked and down the tunnel the ceiling collapsed shoving dust toward them in a roaring whoosh a boesman solly cried jakob laughed out loud they were all scrambling into their vacuum suits as fast as they could time to leave he cried maneuvering their a robot against the side of the chamber he put one of their boesmans against the wall and set the timer okay he said over the suits intercom now we got to mine like we never mined before to the surface the first task was to get far enough away from the boesman that they wouldnt be killed when it went off they were now drilling a narrow tunnel and moving the loosened rock behind them to fill up the hole as they passed through it this loose fill would fly like bullets down a rifle barrel when the boesman went off so they made three abrupt turns at acute angles to stop the fills movement and then drilled away from the area as fast as they could naomi and jakob were confident that the explosion of the boesman would shatter the surrounding rock to such an extent that it would never be possible for anyone to locate the starting point for their tunnel hopefully theyll think we did ourselves in naomi said either on purpose or by accident oliver enjoyed hearing her light laugh her clear voice that was so pure and musical compared to hesters croaking he had never known naomi well before but now he admired her grace and power her pulsing energy she worked harder than jakob even harder than any of them a few shifts into their new life naomi checked the detonator timer she kept on a cord around her neck it should be going off soon someone go try and keep the cows and chickens calmed down but solly had just reached the cows pen when the boesman went off they were all sledgehammered by the blast which was louder than a mere explosion something more basic and fundamental the violent smash of a whole world shutting the door on them deafened bruised they staggered up and checked each other for serious injuries then pacified the cows whose terrified moos they felt in their hands rather than actually heard the structural integrity of their tunnel seemed okay they were in an old flow of the mantles convection current now cooled to stasis and it was plastic enough to take such a blast without shattering perfect miners rock protecting them like a mother they lifted up the cows and set them upright on the bottom of the ore car that had been made into the barn freeman hurried back down the tunnel to see how the rear of it looked when he came back their hearing was returning and through the ringing that would persist for several shifts he shouted its walled off good fused so they were in a little tunnel of their own they fell together in a clump hugging each other and shouting free at last jakob roared booming out a laugh louder than anything oliver had ever heard from him then they settled down to the task of turning on an air cylinder and recycler and regulating their gas exchange they soon settled into a routine that moved their tunnel forward as quickly and quietly as possible one of them operated the robot digging as narrow a shaft as they could possibly work in this person used only laser drills unless confronted with extremely hard rock when it was judged worth the risk to set off small explosions timed by seismometer to follow closely other detonations back in the mines jakob and naomi hoped that the complex interior of the moon would prevent any listeners from noticing that their explosion was anything more than an echo of the mining blast three of them dealt with the rock freed by the robots drilling moving it from the front of the tunnel to its rear and at intervals pulling up the cars tracks and bringing them forward the placement of the loose rock was a serious matter because if it displaced much more volume than it had at the front of the tunnel they would eventually fill in all the open space they had this was the classic problem of the creeping worm tunnel it was necessary to pack the blocks into the space at the rear with an absolute minimum of gaps in exactly the way they had been cut like pieces of a puzzle they all got very good at the craft of this losing only a few inches of open space in every mile they dug this work was the hardest both physically and mentally and each shift of it left oliver more tired than he had ever been while mining because the truth was all of them were working at full speed and for the middle team it meant almost running back and forth back and forth back and forth their little bit of open tunnel was only some sixty yards long but after a while on the midshift it seemed like five hundred the three people not working on the rock tended the air and the livestock ate helped out with large blocks and the like and snatched some sleep they rotated one at a time through the three stations and worked one shift timed by detonator timer at each post it made for a routine so mesmerizing in its exhaustiveness that oliver found it very hard to do his calculations of their position in his shift off youve got to keep at it jakob told him as he ran back from the robot to help the calculating its not just anywhere we want to come up but right under the domed city of selene next to the rocket rails to do that well need some good navigation we get that and well come up right in the middle of the masters who have gotten rich from selling the blue to earth and that will be a very gratifying thing i assure you so oliver would work on it until he slept actually it was relatively easy he knew where they had been in the moon when they struck out on their own and jakob had given him the surface coordinates for selene so it was just a matter of dead reckoning it was even possible to calculate their average speed and therefore when they could expect to reach the surface that could be checked against the rate of depletion of their fixed resources air water lost in the recycler and food for the livestock it took a few shifts of consultation with mute elijah to determine all the factors reliably and after that it was a simple matter of arithmetic when oliver and elijah completed these calculations they called jakob over and explained what they had done good work jakob said i should have thought of that but look oliver said weve got enough air and water and the robots power pack is ten times what well need same with explosives its only food is a problem i dont know if weve got enough hay for the cows jakob nodded as he looked over olivers shoulder and examined their figures well have to kill and eat the cows one by one thatll feed us and cut down on the amount of hay we need at the same time eat the cows oliver was stunned sure theyre meat people on earth eat them all the time well oliver was doubtful but under the lash of hesters bitter laughter he didnt say any more still jakob and freeman and naomi decided it would be best if they stepped up the pace a little bit to provide them with more of a margin for error they shifted two people to the shaft face and supplemented the robots continuous drilling with hand drill work around the sides of the tunnel and ate on the run while moving blocks to the back and slept as little as they could they were making miles on every shift the rock they wormed through began to change in character the hard dark unbroken basalt gave way to lighter rock that was sometimes dangerously fractured anorthosite jakob said were reaching the crust after that every shift brought them through a new zone of rock once they tunneled through great layers of calcium feldspar striped with basalt intrusions so that it looked like badly made brick another time they blasted their way through a wall of jasper as hard as steel only once did they pass through a vein of the blue when they did it occurred to oliver that his whole conception of the moons composition had been warped by their mining he had thought the moon was bursting with promethium but as they dug across the narrow vein he realized it was uncommon a loose net of threads in the great lunar body as they left the vein behind solly picked up a piece of the ore and stared at it curiously lower eyes shut face contorted as he struggled to focus his third eye suddenly he dashed the chunk to the ground turned and marched to the head of their tunnel attacked it with a drill ive given my whole life to the blue he said voice thick and what is it but a goddamned rock jakob laughed shortly they tunneled on away from the precious metal that now represented to them only a softer material to dig through pick up the pace jakob cried slapping solly on the back and leaping over the blocks beside the robot this rock has melted and melted again changing over eons to the stones we see metamorphosis he chanted stretching the word out lingering on the syllable mor until the word became a kind of song metamorphosis metamorphosis naomi and hester took up the chant and mute elijah tapped his drill against the robot in double time jakob chanted over it soon we will come to the city of the masters the domes of xanadu with their glass and fruit and steaming pools and their vases and sports and their fine aged wines and then there will be a metamorphosis and they tunneled ever faster sitting in the sleeping car chewing on a cheese oliver regarded the bulk of jakob lying beside him jakob breathed deeply very tired almost asleep how do you know about the domes oliver asked him softly how do you know all the things that you know dont know jakob muttered everyone knows less they burn your brain put you in a hole to live out your life i dont know much boy make most of it up love of a moon whatever we need and he slept they came up through a layer of marble white marble all laced with quartz so that it gleamed and sparkled in their lightless sight and made them feel as though they dug through stone made of their cows good milk mixed with water like diamonds this went on for a long time until it filled them up and they became intoxicated with its smooth muscly texture with the sparks of light lazing out of it i remember once we went to see a jazz band jakob said to all of them puffing as he ran the white rock along the cars to the rear stacked it ever so carefully it was in richmond among all the docks and refineries and giant oil tanks and we were so drunk we kept getting lost but finally we found it huh and it was just this brokendown trumpeter and a back line he played sitting in a chair and you could just see in his face that his life had been a tough scuffle his hat covered his whole household and trumpet is a young mans instrument too it tears your lip to tatters so we sat down to drink not expecting a thing and they started up the last song of a set buckets got a hole in it four bar blues as simple as a song can get metamorphosis rasped hester yeah like that and this trumpeter started to play it and they went through it over and over and over huh they must have done it a hundred times two hundred times and sure enough this trumpeter was playing low and half the time in his hat using all the tricks a brokendown trumpeter uses to save his lip to hide the fact that it went west thirty years before but after a while that didnt matter because he was playing he was playing everything he had learned in all his life all the music and all the sorry rest of it all that was jammed into the poor old bucket and by god it was mind over matter time because that old song began to roll and still on the run he broke into it oh the buckets got a hole in it yeah the buckets got a hole in it say the buckets got a hole in it cant buy no beer and over again oliver solly freeman hester naomi they couldnt help laughing what jakob came up with out of his unburnt past mute elijah banged a car wall happily then squeezed the udder of a cow between one verse and the next cant buy no beer moo they all joined in breathing or singing it it fit the pace of their work perfectly fast but not too fast regular repetitive simple endless all the syllables got the same length a bit syncopated except hole which was stretched out and cant buy no beer which was high and all stretched out stretched into a great shout of triumph which was crazy since what it was saying was bad news or should have been but the song made it a cry of joy and every time it rolled around they sang it louder more stretched out jakob scatted up and down and around the tune and hester found all kinds of higher harmonics in a voice like a saw cutting steel and the old tune rocked over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over in a great passacaglia in the crucible where all poverty is wrenched to delight the blues metamorphosis they sang it continuously for two shifts running until they were all completely hypnotized by it and then frequently for long spells for the rest of their time together it was sheer bad luck that they broke into a shaft from below and that the shaft was filled with armed foremen and worse luck that jakob was working the robot so that he was the first to leap out firing his hand drill like a weapon and the only one to get struck by return fire before naomi threw a knotchopper past him and blew the foremen to shreds they got him on a car and rolled the robot back and pulled up the track and cut off in a new direction leaving another boesman behind to destroy evidence of their passing so they were all racing around with the blood and stuff still covering them and the cows mooing in distress and jakob breathing through clenched teeth in double time and only hester and oliver could sit in the car with him and try to tend him ripping away the pants from a leg that was all cut up hester took a hand drill to cauterize the wounds that were bleeding hard but jakob shook his head at her neck muscles bulging out got the big artery inside of the thigh he said through his teeth hester hissed come here she croaked at solly and the rest stop that and come here they were in a mass of broken quartz the fractured clear crystals all pink with oxidation the robot continued drilling away the air cylinder hissed the cows mooed jakobs breathing was harsh and somehow all of them were also breathing in the same way irregularly too fast so that as his breathing slowed and calmed theirs did too he was lying back in the sleeping car on a bed of hay staring up at the fractured sparkling quartz ceiling of their tunnel as if he could see far into it all these different kinds of rock he said his voice filled with wonder and pain you see the moon itself was the world once upon a time and the earth its moon but there was an impact and everything changed they cut a small side passage in the quartz and left jakob there so that when they filled in their tunnel as they moved on he was left behind in his own deep crypt and from then on the moon for them was only his big tomb rolling through space till the sun itself died as he had said it someday would oliver got them back on a course feeling radically uncertain of his navigational calculations now that jakob was not there to nod over his shoulder to approve them dully he gave naomi and freeman the coordinates for selene but what will we do when we get there jakob had never actually made that clear find the leaders of the city demand justice for the miners kill them get to the rockets of the great magnetic rail accelerators and hijack one to earth try to slip unnoticed into the populace you leave that to us naomi said just get us there and he saw a light in naomis and freemans eyes that hadnt been there before it reminded him of the thing that had chased him in the dark the thing that even jakob hadnt been able to explain it frightened him so he set the course and they tunneled on as fast as they ever had they never sang and they rarely talked they threw themselves at the rock hurt themselves in the effort returned to attack it more fiercely than before when he could not stave off sleep oliver lay down on jakobs dried blood and bitterness filled him like a block of the anorthosite they wrestled with they were running out of hay they killed a cow ate its roasted flesh the water recyclers filters were clogging and their water smelled of urine hester listened to the seismometer as often as she could now and she thought they were being pursued but she also thought they were approaching selenes underside naomi laughed but it wasnt like her old laugh you got us there oliver good work oliver bit back a cry is it big solly asked hester shook her head doesnt sound like it maybe twice the diameter of the great bole not more good freeman said looking at naomi but what will we do oliver said hester and naomi and freeman and solly all turned to look at him eyes blazing like twelve chunks of pure promethium weve got eight boesmans left freeman said in a low voice all the rest of the explosives add up to a couple more im going to set them just right itll be my best work ever my masterpiece and well blow selene right off into space it took them ten shifts to get all the boesmans placed to freemans and naomis satisfaction and then another three to get far enough down and to one side to be protected from the shock of the blast which luckily for them was directly upward against something that would give and therefore would have less recoil finally they were set and they sat in the sleeping car in a circle of six around the pile of components that sat under the master detonator for a long time they just sat there crosslegged breathing slowly and staring at it staring at each other in the dark in perfect redblack clarity then naomi put both arms out placed her hands carefully on the detonators button mute elijah put his hands on hers then freeman hester solly finally oliver just in the order that jakob had taken them oliver hesitated feeling the flesh and bone under his hands the warmth of his companions he felt they should say something but he didnt know what it was seven hester croaked suddenly six freeman said elijah blew air through his teeth hard four said naomi three solly cried two oliver said and they all waited a beat swallowing hard waiting for the moon and the man in the moon to speak to them then they pressed down on the button they smashed at it with their fists hit it so violently they scarcely felt the shock of the explosion they had put on vacuum suits and were breathing pure oxygen as they came up the last tunnel clearing it of rubble a great number of other shafts were revealed as they moved into the huge conical cavity left by the boesmans tunnels snaked away from the cavity in all directions so that they had sudden long vistas of blasted tubes extending off into the depths of the moon they had come out of and at the top of the cavity struggling over its broken edge over the rounded wall of a new crater it was black it was not like rock spread across it was a spill of white points some bright some so faint that they disappeared into the black if you looked straight at them there were thousands of these white points scattered over a black dome that was not a dome and there in the middle almost directly overhead a blue and white ball big bright blue distant rounded half of it bright as a foremans flash the other half just a shadow it was clearly round a big ball in the sky in the sky wordlessly they stood on the great pile of rubble ringing the edge of their hole half buried in the broken anorthosite were shards of clear plastic steel struts patches of green grass fragments of metal an arm broken branches a bit of orange ceramic heads back to stare at the ball in the sky at the astonishing fact of the void they scarcely noticed these things a long time passed and none of them moved except to look around past the jumble of dark trash that had mostly been thrown off in a single direction the surface of the moon was an immense expanse of white hills as strange and glorious as the stars above the size of it all oliver had never dreamed that everything could be so big the blue must be promethium solly said pointing up at the earth theyve covered the whole earth with the blue we mined their mouths hung open as they stared at it how far away is it freeman asked no one answered there they all are solly said he laughed harshly i wish i could blow up the earth too he walked in circles on the rubble of the craters rim the rocket rails oliver thought suddenly must have been in the direction freeman had sent the debris bad luck the final upward sweep of them poked up out of the dark dirt and glass solly pointed at them his voice was loud in olivers ears it strained the intercom too bad we cant fly to the earth and blow it up too i wish we could and mute elijah took a few steps leaped off the mound into the sky took a swipe with one hand at the blue ball they laughed at him almost got it didnt you freeman and solly tried themselves and then they all did taking quick runs leaping flying slowly up through space for five or six or seven seconds making a grab at the sky overhead floating back down as if in a dream to land in a tumble and try it again it felt wonderful to hang up there at the top of the leap free in the vacuum free of gravity and everything else for just that instant after a while they sat down on the new craters rim covered with white dust and black dirt oliver sat on the very edge of the crater legs over the edge so that he could see back down into their sublunar world at the same time that he looked up into the sky three eyes were not enough to judge such immensities his heart pounded he felt too intoxicated to move anymore tired drunk the intercom rasped with the sounds of their breathing which slowly calmed fell into a rhythm together hester buzzed one phrase of bucket and they laughed softly they lay back on the rubble all but oliver and stared up into the dizzy reaches of the universe the velvet black of infinity oliver sat with elbows on knees watched the white hills glowing under the black sky they were lit by earthlight earthlight and starlight the white mountains on the horizon were as sharpedged as the shards of dome glass sticking out of the rock and all the time the earth looked down at him it was all too fantastic to believe he drank it in like oxygen felt it filling him up expanding in his chest what do you think theyll do with us when they get here solly asked kill us hester croaked or put us back to work naomi added oliver laughed whatever happened it was impossible in that moment to care for above them a milky spill of stars lay thrown across the infinite black sky lighting a million better worlds while just over their heads the earth glowed like a fine blue lamp and under their feet rolled the white hills of the happy moon holed like a great cheese sacrament by matt williamson matt williamsons fiction has appeared in barrelhouse magazine gulf coast the portland review ruminator and the cimarron review he is a graduate of the university of texas and the iowa writers workshop he lives in austin texas where hes currently working on his first novel ever watch tv and think the ads are funnier than the sitcom they interrupted or see a beautiful photo in a magazine only to wonderingly discover its an advertisement moments like these blur the boundaries between art and advertising a borderline that grows increasingly unclear in this era of corporate sponsorship of the arts matt williamson spins a world where art and advertising have collided on such a large scale that a nike art project can fill times square and an apple light show can be seen from outer space the world is loaded with artadvertising objects so massive and inescapable that an international war has erupted over its imperialist presence or perhaps thats just the view of our protagonist a character who maintains his own uncertain boundary between art and his lifes work as an intelligence extractor its not an easy craft pulling information out of the unwilling it takes special tools a unique skillset and a sense of intuition that cant be taught its a gift a talent its easy to see why some people might call torture an artform but its only in a truly broken world that anyone would bones are not organs under the protocols ive got that stuck up on the wall in the locker room the briefing room big signs all caps bones are not organs that leaves a lot of running room the kneecap what you can do with the kneecap that alone will get you farther than you need to go in almost every case the kneecap the chin the lowest knuckle on the forefinger those are my favorite bones i always say you can tell my guys in a crowd from their hands the trick is can you keep him lucid can you keep ali sharply focused on the program all the way through part of it is physical control part of it is drugs and part of it i say a little facetiously but not totally facetiously is artistry the artistry of the lead interrogator before the pinpoints before suspensions we couldnt keep a guy from passing out wake him up with ammonia its not the same as having him alert now weve got pinpoint synthetics that allow sustained equilibrium no fainting no grogginess no euphoria it isnt quite the same as true awake dr ghose calls it a simulacrum its better than true in some ways alis awake sans certain defenses with catheters and drips we can preserve that balance not for hours but weeks months last week i left a session went home played kickball with my son dinner with my wife long nights sleep woke up breakfast walk the dog read the paper when i come back in alis still going from the night before with the pinpoints we dont have to take the rests and theres not the same concern about organic damage thats the drug side part two is the control technologies and some of the advances over there the tech stuffs done a lot to change the playing field the new chairs dont just offer refined muscular control we actually have retinal when i peel the skin back when i kiss the edges of the f joint with my drill alis going to be paying close attention and because of the synthetics hes not in lala land hes tracking hes alert and hes ready to talk were careful to stay on the right side of the line ive referred three men for crossing that line dishonorables in every case its something we take seriously even without the protocols id tell my teams nothing that results in death or organ failure because its lazy because its counterproductive because it misses the point the promise of survival thats everything the promise of emerging intact if you dont understand that aspect you wont understand deep interrogation i dont call it heavy i call it deep and that lack of understandings going to show up in your usable intel numbers the other reasons trust when you do the cowboy shit you might break through some walls but other walls are shutting up tighter than before the new model we do much more than break the subject break alis will reduce him to a state of dependence we do that but its just step one the first pivot point in any interrogation there are multiple pivot points the first is when ali discovers he no longer has the power to end his life everything before that moment is preinterrogation as far as im concerned thats why in the chair we keep him ventilated and catheterized we decide whether and when you eat shit piss breathe and we can keep you here as long as we like and we can we can keep these guys alive forever not literally not yet thats one of my dreams the replenishers the suspensions push them to the point where we can squeeze these guys indefinitely were on our way it wont happen in my lifetime probably but someday yes keep ali in the chair thirty forty a hundred years im not kidding ghose is doing stuff thats going to change the medical sciences forever forget about interrogations and the longer you keep these guys the more you can do with them their reality is changing every minute every hour at days you arent looking at the same ali you had at at hes still fighting you in some small part of himself whether he knows it or not by you have the power of a god thats why we welcome hunger strikes thats why we welcome suicide attempts you can tell ali youll be here till your hairs as gray as mine but its just talk until he makes a move thats why it works for us when ali tries to kill himself its a teaching moment suicide we dont allow starvation we dont allow ali wrapping his head in a bedsheet noose is ali testing the boundaries feeling out the limits of his field of control ali chewing off his tongue is ali testing the limits and what he finds in every case is exactly what we said hed find theres one way out of this and its through us but that as i say is only the first part of our work when you break a subject you get the stuff he wants to keep from you a deep interrogators after more we want to get inside the memory and experience of a subject get inside and have a long look around look listen smell and we get everything childhood adolescence grief anger fantasies and phobias we get the transient moments and impressions that may not seem in themselves to hold any strategic value but which in combination with a thousand other such impressions taken from a hundred other guys form a kind of tapestry or as ghose puts it a vivid fourdimensional map of daily life in extremist enclaves you can think of the new model then as a way of getting access to the peripheral perceptions alis no longer the author of his story he no longer gets to judge whats worth our knowing im not afraid to talk about it its a tricky area interrogation of confirmed innocents its complicated and there are good arguments on both sides defense knows what its policy is certainly to some extent well follow that certainly we obey the protocols well track the white papers to a point and then to some extent well go our own way theres a degree of autonomy but the short answer is yes if theres usable intel we will interrogate we dont look to culpability as an entrance criterion that doesnt mean we dont wrestle with it we make evaluations on a casebycase basis last year after the ramadan attacks the decision was made to go ahead with a deep program on a suite of cis before we initiated that program we did ask ourselves what are our obligations here in the end the determination was made to go ahead and i stand by the decision why because we found the bomb thats not to say its simple and there will be some people for whom thats not enough find the bomb save a couple thousand lives thats not enough and i respect that where you are on that issue is i think largely an ethical matter and something that will differ for you depending on who you are personally for me the objective is decisive without the cis the bomb explodes the target was a metro station in central dc which is maybe something to consider different guidelines will apply of course if its a ci in the chair thats literally as in theres a separate set of guidelines printed off everybody has a copy and also in the maybe just the attitude you take into the interrogation room one difference to start with one example is when were working a ci we wont do the chin thats not protocol thats our own rule my rule actually and i enforce it just like any other policy and i dont make exceptions when culpability isnt indicated on the profile the chin becomes an organ if were doing a ci well conduct the interrogation fairly well make the parameters clear when the objective is reached well stabilize and exit ideally in a ci session its a team process where were working with the subject to achieve a common goal well never go into a ci session blindever thats the rule and we wont do fishing expeditions and thats obviously very different from the program we apply to ccs and suspecteds when a suspecteds in the chair well wring him out when ali thinks hes told us everything he knows thats when the session begins where the problem area starts is when a ci tells us something that alters his designation this is tricky because a lot of cis will confess to things they havent done in that case theres no way to avoid changing the subjects designation and reverting to the cc protocols but its something that we wrestle with the suite last autumn a lot of my ci alis didnt lose a drop of blood im not exaggerating i say you can tell my guys from their hands these guys you cant because it never got to that point others it did and thats tough when youre dealing with a wife a husband and youre saying wheres ali wheres the husband the wife the son the uncle that can be tough because relatives are intransigent the wives sometimes are more intransigent than the target ccs and theres where a sense of delicacy and a sense of balance can be very helpful say youve got alis wife in the chair okay now she knows what alis in for or thinks she knows actually she has no idea but she knows alis going in the chair how bad then do you make it you have to find a place where mrs ali wants to end the session where shes ready to give her husband up but not so far that she knows she wont be able to live with herself if she cooperates you have to let her leave the chair with dignity let her feel shes made a choice that she can live with morally its delicate when a confirmed combatants in the chair theres no good copbad cop theres no carrot and stick its bad copworse cop and its stick razor drill cis its different with alis wife there might be a carrot in there too ill give you an example these cis most of them they wont ever be going home i say most really its all if its home its a prison in pakistan but thats not most cases most cases the cis done with the chair he or she is headed to the low restraint unit presumably for the remainder one reason we keep them is well be needing them again when their intelligence proves out when my target ali is in the chair and theres a host of other reasons alis kid though sometimes he can be an exception if we have alis wife in the chair if there are no culpability markers weve been willing in certain cases to see about orphanages see if we can keep the child in the us versus pakistan syria so thats an example of the carrot if alis wife is ready to give her husband up heres a chance for ali jr to enjoy some of the benefits of an american upbringing and thats worked well for us in a number of cases why i like the chin a bunch of reasons i like its complexity its not a major painpoint relative to the kneecaps and knuckles but there are intersecting nerve systems there which give the chin a different character a different flavor and theres something particular about the way the destruction and remaking of the face impacts a subject well mirror ali almost continuously during chinwork and ive found time and again that a kiss on the chin when ali is watching does more to concentrate his mind than complete powdering of the kneecaps what else i want to be careful here because id never want to make it seem as though some private form of catharsis is ever among my objectives in a session but there is a satisfaction for me in the physical transformations that some of our cc subjects undergo they come in theyve got the intel hidden they leave the intels gone in a sense and the fact of the extraction is written on their faces its physically manifest the chins heal over some of them you cant even see the scars but the faces the subdural structures are changed its like weve literally chipped the intel out of their heads i like it also because for me the chin represents a threshold a point of commitment once weve changed his face ali cant see the light of day whatever happens that means he wont be available as a witness we cant trot him out if there are hearings inquiries as far as the rest of the world is concerned hes gone and thats not my rule its in the protocols nothing that shall bring embarrassment or discredit to the state in english that means something like you broke it you bought it for me then the chin is an important moment before you go into the chin youre hamstrung a little bit youre always thinking in the back of your mind can we make this guy presentable after the chins when you can really squeeze him from that point forward alis value is purely dark maybe we can bring him in for leverage in another session if weve got a relative or friend in the chair but for the most part hes a source of information for us and thats it so we can push him harder we can go longer and a lot of times we can get more than we thought was there and that of course goes to another question which is when is an interrogation over its hard to say its always hard in some ways its similar to a question that i faced in legal practice at what point have i reached the end of my research on a particular question and the answer is you cant always know theres no everytime rule because its so hard to tell in some cases what alis brain is sitting on i had someone on a steady program once for two straight years we had an executive warrant on him which meant the protocols were off hour sessions sixhour rests hes colostomized castrated pinpointstabilized liquid meals catheter two full years we ride the guy months he gives us nothing suddenly month hes talking about montreal and through that piece of intel the stuff that came out after monthswere able to track down five more guys and through those five we get six more and from those six we get a lead that helps us stop a gelattack in rochester all because i had a feeling this guys got more to tell it doesnt always work that way one suspected we took him months never got a scrap of usable out of him not a drop and so again its that question of when do you throw in the towel for me and this is just for me this is how it works for months my ali insisted he was innocent he didnt know anyone we named never heard of yassir omar wasnt a devout muslim we got him by mistake all that time im sure hes bullshitting im sure of it at months for what reason i cant say i flip and im starting to believe him for me thats the end i admit then that its partly intuitive so we initiated exit protocols we stabilized ali injected him with nurturer we eased him down then my pfcs got him suited up and took him to his new home down in medium restraint far from the sun but far away also from the chair after months with me most alis will take that trade its better now for sure the old way it was messy and just messy i didnt like the messiness part of it is just my nature im a tidy person when i first started at the unit before the chairs were standard ops we were doing water parties music parties stackups fingerscrewing group sessions electricity wiping alis face with menstrual blood wiping the koran i thought it was fake menstrual blood i found out after six months no its real they get it from the womens unit a lot of that kind of stuff now i will say this any time you permit a measure of chaos there are going to be good and bad things that come of it sometimes under the old model we got surprising results stuff we couldnt have predicted stuff we couldnt have extracted in the chair on balance though i prefer the chair at the end of the day i want to feel that im a professional its important to me that the boundaries be clear im not a doctor but it is professional what were doing here and you lose moral credibility with ali when youre urinating in his presence when youre laughing over some funny costume you put him in it always felt disrespectful to me disrespectful to ali disrespectful to the process so certainly the new models much better there are some i know whod assume just based on my family background that i must be motivated by a desire for revenge people will believe what they want but nothing could be farther from the truth as soon as i sense that a member of my interrogator corps is motivated by revenge revenge or a perverse enjoyment of cruelty i strike him from my team hes gone its true it may be true that a soldier has to hate his enemy but we arent soldiers here contra the official narrative here strange as it may sound we have to love our enemy in a way we have to understand his pain empathize with him his fears and desires and we have to be curious about him in a way that a trained killer must never be we have to thirst and i use that word quite consciously to understand the workings of his mind and we have to credit his humanity its a cliché but true nevertheless theres no fortress better defended than the human mind our technology gets us into that fortress partways but human intuition goes a long way too and without human intuition and compassion its impossible to get to where we need to be dr ghose calls them the sacred spaces sacred spaces of the mind to reach the sacred spaces you have to love the mind you have to want to keep it intact as much as you can even as you methodically break down its defenses and the subjects mind has got to love you back peculiar as that sounds youve got to accustom alis brain to your presence inside of it until your presence there seems as natural as anything else its like date rape you start with force and then you seduce all that being said i would never deny that my fathers death was instrumental his death set the course for my entire life that much is obvious its stalin i think who said the death of one guy is a tragedy while the death of millions is a statistic in that sense if only in that sense dads death wasnt a tragedy i was seven years old on like thousands of kids tens of thousands maybe hundreds i watched my father die in real time on live tv watched the buildings melt run together those unearthly swirls of color the greens and vibrant blues all that life and death bleeding together pooling and spreading hardening into a marbled brick that to my eyes looked just like candy it was a kind of murder and who knew such things existed that totally erased its victims individuality bodies and birds and plants and rock and metal all disintegrating and reforming into this elastic anonymous whole when i was younger you know i shared in my mothers outrage at this additional taking the blotting out of identity which made it impossible for the survivors to bury their dead as ive grown older though ive come to find a poignancy in the way the gel attack melted down and mixed the human remains with the remains of the city on august rd it was impossible for once if only briefly to ignore the ways in which all of us are one and the ways in which were one also with the physical world and then too as i grew up i started to appreciate the parallels between this epic act of destruction and the equally epic acts of creation that were and are my fathers legacy dad was an artist he would never have called himself an artist he always insisted a little impishly i think that he wasnt one he called himself an adman but of course he was an artist and a great one at that by the end of his career the ending that should have been the apex he was chief communications sculptor at cfg hed been at cfg his whole career and anyone who knows will tell you dad was personally responsible for most of the firms growth and everything he did he did with no graduate education no formal artistic training joined cfg straight out of mit his work if you believe the job title was to create public points of attraction uncanny images shapes and spaces in reality his job was to bring the impossible into physical life usually with startling beauty examples i could give you a bunch one youve heard of they only took it down last year was the metamorphic installation on times square my father created that the only credited designer today there are duplicates in every shopping mall from juneau to dubai at the time of the times square unveiling though this is eight years before i was born there was nothing like it anywhere a miniaturized redrock formation hovering fifty feet above the ground this massive solid seemingly organic minimountain range just hovering as if by magic perfect facsimile of plant and animal life fully animated fully responsive deer and mountain lions trees and bushes that swayed and rustled with the actual wind on the square pigeons when they landed on those tiny pines theyd bend even snap from the weight and all those breathtaking details heres maybe the most amazing thing were generated with the imitation of life engine that dad had patented at the age of nineteen when he was still a college student in the first years after that installation went up back when my parents still lived in new york dad used to sneak down to times square at lunchtime to watch the faces of the tourists as his mountains changed many years later i stood on times square for the same reason to watch the ways in which strangers were moved by my fathers creation to see dads mountains on a monitor is not to see them at all thats the beauty of his work of all of it the immediacy and physicality the times square piece morphed twice a day first at and again at sunset in the first stage trickles of red like a red paint would run almost imperceptibly at first along the slopes of those little mountains like some gentle volcanic eruption then the trickle became a steady flow and as people stood and gaped theyd start to understand that it was the mountains themselves that were pouring down their own rock faces melting from the peaks down instead of dripping to the ground the rockmelt collected on the flat base of the mountain range collected and hardened and oozed into a new shape which only at the final moment of the transformation became identifiable as the nike swoosh the piece retained that down form for only a few seconds before defying gravity and the laws of physics to melt and flow upwards back into the shape of the mountains from the wet claylike mountains little animals and treelike protrusions would poke out and writhe free until in the space of a few seconds the range was fully animated fully alive swarming with tiny birds and elk and covered in those trees that rocked and danced with the wind on the square events dad called his installations visual events auditory events they were events and they were also as his job description had it public points of attraction but they were also the fruits of a brave artistic imagination fathers imagination his dreams brought into this improbable and tangible life i was six when dad put the finishing touches on his gobi apple he would have finished it years before if not for all the problems apple had negotiating for the thousandyear lease of the desert the apple was meant from the beginning to be his lasting mark a replica in colorshifting superlight of the apple logo four hundred square miles in dimension more money was spent if you can believe it on that apple than was spent on the entire egypt war you can look that up father made it with the thickest most expensive light hyperradiant nondispersable a light that in spite of its soft appearance pierced though the clouds and was visible from space in initial testing his main concern was would the apple be able to survive a total continental submergence and he wouldnt build until he got it how he wanted it even if the icecaps melt completely even in the event fantastic event that humans abandon the earth completely for some other home fathers apple will persist burning bright as ever from the bottom of the ocean my fondest memory of childhood was the trip i took with mom and dad to see the apple in person the whole way there dad was like a little boy a side of him i never saw before we first flew over in a glassbottomed helicopter at night and it was like we were gliding over the clouds of heaven the next night all night we wandered a stretch of the desert on camelback guided by mongolian goatherds who looked on my father my small softspoken gentle father as my alis would later look on me as a kind of god my own opinion of my dad wasnt too far off from that i wouldnt have said god what i would have said was superhero i would have told you if youd asked that there was nothing dad couldnt do and all of this was a little more than a year before the day when two illiterate fourteenyearold syrian boys armed with jansport backpacks full of i selfperpetuating gel component destroyed my father along with much of the city of boston some have said cruelly i think that dad by virtue of working for a global marketing firm was more responsible than others for the events of that cfgs sky banners in particular invigorated the extremists invigorated the word they use as if the invasion and occupation of egypt were of secondary importance according to the post facto logic of the extremists the posting of sky banners visible from mecca was an quoteunquote act of imperialist sacrilege equal to a ground invasion of the holy city a sacrilege that justified any savagery any cruelty that could be dreamt up by the same tortured logic americas use of gels and evaporators in egypt justified the terrorists use of gel weaponry to decimate bostons civilian population for the record my father never worked on sky banners he did design the firstever colorstorm drenched the whole earth in this gorgeous kaleidoscopic light but that was long after banners had become ubiquitous in the middle east and central asia theres always seemed to me to be something morbid about the fetishization by extremists even by some western pacifists of the natural world in its mythic virgin state not to get philosophical but mans always been a creature apart from and above the other life of the earth a creature destined to remake the world in his own image just as god made man in his own image and thus a creature destined to remake the world in gods image whatever we imagine gods imagined first if you dont believe that you dont believe in god that man would repaint the sky that hed fill it with his own colors his own designs was inevitable from the moment he discovered superlight but apart from questions of mans destiny the fact is everythings got to change or die or become new before the banners and dads colorstorms the skies at least in the cities were just ceilings of smog to prefer that featureless shitbrown smothering pollution to my fathers electric palette is simply to prefer deadness and decay to the possibility of life in a similar way i think to reduce dads art to marketing as he himself was willing to do but impishly as i said is to be willfully obtuse what were michelangelo and raphael if not marketers marketers in the employ of the pope people forget that after dad had finalized his patent on the imitation of life engine there was no need for him to work again his wealth was fixed for life what he did for cfg the swooshes and colorstorms and robotic eyes he did only because of his obsessive need to create to commune and converse with the world celebrate and enrich the life around him if he tethered his work to prudential investments and fuck body spray it was only because without those sponsorships his achievements would never have been technically possible and the first and ultimate imperative of any artist is to create he has to make his art whatever the terms dads stuff on rapa nui and at the taj mahal the forbidden city was controversial really only among the kinds of people who believe naively that ideas like france and japan are intrinsically more noble more authentically human than apple computers and toyota that the rules that govern and define our achievements are immutable and unchangeable that its not for us to dictate the terms of our own evolution but ill tell you a story something from a session not too far back that connects a few of the ideas ive been talking about and gets at some of the ways in which my dads career ostensibly so different from my own converses with my work as an interrogator this is the early winter of last year were on week three with one of the islamabad captures alis knuckles are gone were moving to dental the objectives not important to this story something involving alis mom shes hiding somewhere in brunei ali swears he doesnt know where shes hiding but its clear he does and in the end a few weeks after the stuff that im describing here he did give us what we needed and we were able to bring the mother in right now im in his mouth with the finest drill going straight down the middle of every tooth one after another thats how we do it one pass through each tooth with the finest drill bit and then we stop and interrogate then another full pass with a bigger bit and more questioning we call them rinseandrepeats alis on a cocktail now of sharpener and nurturer which makes the drill work like a light switch when its going in alis pain is at the human maximum the second we stop hes on cloud nine were on the first pass im entering an incisor and all of a sudden alis teeth all of them at once begin to spray eight or nine of them these fine crisscrossing sprays arching straight up in the air from the holes in his teeth like wed struck oil you ever seen this i say sort of to the room no nobodys ever seen it were all just fascinated observing this phenomenon the blood loss is minimal but the spray is getting pretty far inking alis bib turning it a very pale pink something about this image seems familiar to me déjàvutype familiar and then i figure it out ali looks disconcertingly like the heads from pier piersons geysers bodywork from thirty years back pierson was the guerilla artist and serial killer who plastinated his victims heads and installed them rigged with lights and fountains in public spaces a twisted descendant in some ways of my father but lets not start down that road right now whats alis drug situation i finally think to ask my technician euphoric the technician says hes drifting i wavered let him drift i finally said ali was a ci i should add and also just a kid fourteen if even that it wasnt going to hurt to let him float around for a few minutes and as he floats ali starts smiling his eyes narrowing like this is the happiest hes ever been as im sure it is thats one of the uncanny things about this job in moments like these and at the end of long sessions when we inject the nurturer our guys have never felt so good in their entire lives for a long time then a mysteriously long time we all just stood around ali and watched one of my pfcs took off her goggles and i didnt reprimand her a little later its obvious in retrospect we figured out the mist from alis mouth was leaching nurturer into the air thats why we were feeling giddy and why for a short time i was almost hypnotized was actually seeing rainbows reaching into the room from alis mist at the time though it seemed to me that it was just something about the strange sight of that fountain of pink its queer resemblance to the pierson heads that was making me feel this way ali meanwhile is smiling so hard so happy that hes started to cry in moments like these when art intrudes unexpected like a ghost its easy for me to think that my father is speaking to me that hes reminding me of why im here i dont deny the truth of men like muhyi aldin of the men whove spent and will spend their last long years in my interrogation chairs there can be heroism in destruction heroism as well as art there was art in my fathers murder in the transformation of a major american city into a primordial swirl of liquid color just as there was art in my cis smiling face the gentle sprays of blood but it was a destructive art my father who could never have aligned himself with the destroyers was blessed by his opportunity to stand with the creators thats the american opportunity isnt it and thats the opportunity i fight for here all of us were fighting for the triumph of a civilization that lets its heroes be creative heroes my own destiny determined from the day my father melted into color like one of his own brilliant creations is to stand against the destroyers by becoming a destroyer myself the sacrifice is worthwhile only if we win twenty thousand years from now when people marvel as they will at fathers apple nobody will see an advertisement for a laptop or a phone when they see the apple theyll assume perhaps that the shape had some religious significance or maybe theyll conclude that it was chosen for its inherent aesthetic properties and what will they be able to think if not that the people who lived here at this time however primitive were a questing people reaching through their blindness and the limitations of the real in an attempt to touch the divine and it was these kinds of thoughts sentimental and a little grandiose that cycled through my head as drunk on nurturer and surrounded by rainbows i laughed and cried with my innocent

abuse of chemistry from thalidomide babies to endangered eagles its difficult to see a good side of the chemical industry and our next tale turns a scathing eye upon it lindsley says its about desire and how easy that is to manipulate but ill go a bit further and say i was also thinking about the ongoing conflict between doing the right thing and doing the comfortable pleasurable thing its about having a compelling excuse to take the easier ethically questionable path to just do it and blame somebody elses chemical sometimes the only warning is a flash of sun on the lens of a snipers scope today im lucky enough to catch the mistake funny i think as i duck down behind the nearest parked car i dont feel lucky the car is a tiny thing an ultra envirofriendly honda righteous painted an unambiguous green good for the planet bad for cover ahead theres an h so massive and red i first take it for a fire truck the selfish bastard parked illegally blocking an alley and for that im grateful i take a quick look at the roof of the building across the street before starting my dash to the hummer halfway there a woman in plastic devil horns steps into my attempt to dodge her and her clipboard wouldyoucaretosignourpetitoninfavoroftheeffortagainstendingthefloridablockade damn shes good she sounds like she trained with a prebay auctioneer i feint left and dart right putting her between me and the shooter and countering ialreadysigneditthanks so she wont follow its not the first lie ive told today and its not likely to be the last temporarily safe behind the hummer i lean against the heavily tinted windows of the far back seat door glad to be standing upright but panting and sweating and wishing i wasnt wearing the black jumpsuit i reserve for funerals and job interviews nanofiber my ass it cant even keep up with a little physical activity on a hot april day i start the long walk toward the front bumper figuring ill duck into the alley and continue on my way one block over it seems like a good plan until another shooter steps out of the alley this one has a pistol id go crosseyed if i tried to look down the barrel oh come on i say backing away slowly not the face he dips the barrel down a bit i sigh and start pulling the zipper at the high neck of my jumpsuit in the same direction i stop just shy of revealing cleavage ill get shot in the face before i give this punk an eyeful he shrugs and fires you little bastard i yell at his retreating back as i pull out the dart out of my forehead i want your license number of course he doesnt bother to stop they never do the itching starts almost immediately and i reflexively reach up and touch the bump above my eyes i know better than to scratch it but i do anyway the scratching releases a flood of chemicals that create a powerful and specific food craving i brace myself french fries french fries from the den of the evil clown where they dont even pretend to use potatoes anymore i hate those french fries so golden and crispy on the outside so moist and fluffy on the inside no no no no no i do not want them i manage to get past the first shadow the clown casts on my route with relative calm but by the second the itching is more intense and all i can imagine are french fries disgusting nasty tasty delicious french fries this is not the way to walk into a job interview the site of my two oclock appointment looms in the office tower ahead right behind a third opportunity to relieve the craving i keep moving trying not to think about how well the diabetesinducing corn syrupy sweet ketchup complements the blood pressureraising salty savor of the fries i make a full circuit through the revolving doors of the office building before going back toward the object of my involuntary chemicallyenhanced desire the food odors pounce immediately and i can almost feel the molecules sticking to my clothes even if i turn around now ill smell like fast food lets get this over with i say unnecessarily to the credit scanner staring it down until it greenlights my ability to pay for food i dont really want none of the automat compartments contain fries which is unusual so i punch hard at a picture of french fries on the order panel the dents in the panel tell me im not the only customer who feels antagonistic about buying food here it shouldnt take more than a minute or two for the fries to appear in a compartment so when they dont i start pounding on the automat hey hurry it up i yell scratching furiously at the bump on my forehead the back door of the empty fry compartment slides open an eye stares out at me what fries i need fries were out of fries the voice behind the automat says how can you be out of fries youve got shooters out there making people crave the damned things thats why were out doesnt the head office coordinate this stuff the eye blinks twice and the door slides shut its enough time to go back to the second place if i hurry but i dont hurry i pace in the street muttering to myself like a lunatic its almost five minutes before i quit trying to control the craving and dash back the way i came i give the next credit scanner an especially dirty look then yank open the one compartment with fries i stop only to pump blobs of ketchup from the dispenser on my way out i pass an old man scratching his arm as he raves through an open compartment how can you be out of fish sandwiches try the one on third and pine i say around a mouthful of fries cravetechs offices are both plush and haphazard the combined result of a recordbreaking ipo and the latest design fad early dotcom retro i arrive sweaty greasy nauseated and thoroughly pissed off i smile at the receptionist anyway a fashionably sulky blonde boy seated in a vintage aeron chair behind a desk made out of two sawhorses topped with an old door and a crystal vase alex monroe i have a two oclock with mr avery two oclock he says pointedly its have a seat something to drink while youre waiting water please ill probably retain every ounce damn salty french fries there are pills that reduce bloating of course they sell them out of the same automat but i wouldnt hand over any more of my money ive just taken my first sip when a young man pops out of the office he looks like a typical startup manager handsome welldressed and almost certainly in over his head ms monroe welcome he bounds up to me hand extended during the handshake he nods toward my forehead ah i see you use our products he laughs heartily at his own joke i laugh back i want this job its a wonderful time to be in chemical advertising ms monroe he says shepherding me into his office i notice he has a proper desk we have some exciting deals in the works exciting exciting deals really i say distracted by the frylump in my stomach oh yes now that the supreme court has reversed most of those class action suits shooters dont have to be stealthy weve had to discontinue the tobacco lines for the time being but otherwise its open season on consumers i make another effort to join in his laughter and reaching toward the bump on my head add it certainly is effective indeed he smiles like he loaded the dart himself so he says picking up my resumei see your background is in print yes but ive done some work in fragrance influence and im very interested in chemical advertisings potential well it is a growing field plenty of room for trailblazers especially with campaigns as impressive as these he sets my resume aside and of course we still have quite a lot of synergy with print he pulls an inchlong crave dart out of a drawer and drops it on the desk between us i resist the urge to cringe at the sight of the wretched thing what do you see he asks i want to say a menace but instead i tap the delivery barrel and give the contextappropriate answer unused ad space suddenly hes a schoolmaster who has finally found a bright pupil in a classroom full of dunces exactly ms monroe exactly no square millimeter wasted thats what i say he leans across the table and whispers conspiratorially were looking at cobranding an aoltimewarnerstarbucks lattepalooza crave with a forever fitness session discount wow yes coupons on the darts how does that grab you coupons tiny coupons like the ones on swizzle sticks cant you just see it you get stuck so you want the product but youre also concerned about your weight the coupon helps the coupon tells you the provider cares about your concerns it tells you they understand he leans back in his chair my cue to speak interesting but id go login rebate rather than immediate discount same message same coverage easier on the bottom line he leans forward again i like the way you think ms monroe i hate meeting at sandras house her cats are constantly trying to climb up on my lap i suspect because they know im allergic to them but sandra is my best friend from college and also my cell leader so i usually end up here at least once a week whoa right in the forehead she says when she opens the door yeah and thats an ugly one on your neck thats a hickey oh uh sorry or congratulations i guess eh she shrugs heading to the kitchen i follow um arent you a little old to be getting those maybe but liams not too old to be giving them sandra has a taste for idealistic young revolutionaries she starts to make herbal tea and i know enough not to ask for coffee instead we take the tea to the lumpy cathair covered futon in the living room howd the interview go shaky start getting stuck really threw me off but i did manage to laugh at his jokes and sad to say im more or less qualified you do speak their language sandra likes to remind me that ive only recently stopped being part of the problem so where do things stand she asks he said he only had one more interview and hed call to let me know by the end of the week did you pick up anything while you were there not much about the next formulas aoltimewarnerstarbucks is definitely in now but thats old news but you think you can get access the jobs in the right division close enough marketings always looking over rds shoulder it wont seem strange for me to be poking around what should i tell our counterformula development contact well assuming i get the job and assuming i can start right away three weeks maybe four itll depend on their security she seems satisfied with this answer what about plan b hows the mata hari routine working on our favorite evil genius hes not evil hes just oblivious she raises an eyebrow at this dangerously oblivious yes i know i concentrate on picking cat hair off my clothes its going fine fourth date tonight expensive place i should get going actually i rise and head for the door she stops me and stares pointedly at my forehead alex dont forget hes the enemy i consciously abort an eyeroll and substitute a smile dangerously oblivious genius equals enemy check i give her a little wave as i step outside which restaurant are you going to sandra asks from the doorway prima her brow furrows dont they serve real meat oh yes and ill be ordering a steak i say taking a moment to enjoy her disapproving look ill have the porterhouse rare please make that two tom says mine medium very good the server says ill be back with the first course shortly he gives us each a prim little fourstar nod as he leaves i put my elbows on the white linen tablecloth and rest my chin on my interlaced fingers im not sure i can ever love a man who would ruin a perfectly good steak tom leans into the candlelight too and im not sure i can trust a woman who likes her meat nearly raw i guess well just have to stay together for the sex and the children he raises his glass to his lips im not having sex with children you pervert he chokes on his wine and grabs his napkin i have to give him points for not looking around to make sure we havent been overheard if id known youd be shooting wine out of your nose id have suggested a merlot i say as innocently as i can manage how he coughs did i ever end up in such hazardous company we met accidentally at a better living through chemistry expo sponsored by dowdupontbristolmyerssquibbpepsi co six weeks ago actually we met at a hotel bar during the expo i was running my report through my head thinking about the companies that had the most bad news for humanity in the works he sat down a couple of barstools away we traded a little eye contact and a few shy smiles in the dim light so which of these evil bastards are you representing he laughed cravetech ooh a startup exciting yeah what about you me im with an underground group whose goal is to liberate people from the tyranny of corporate chemical dependence huh underground you said yeah were not very good at that part i was already starting to like his laugh especially since it came so easily actually i freelance in marketing anything i might have seen maybe the junior chemical engineer campaign big molecules for little hands thats the one i said suddenly aware i was twisting a lock of my hair around my finger i reached for my drink wasnt there a massive judgment against them in one of the last big class action suits no that was unionpfizers my first exothermic reaction ours were just repackaged make your own cologne kits left over from the last queer eye reunion tour clever he got up and closed the barstool gap between us despicable so what do you do at cravetech i run the place thats funny i said laughing until he slid the nearest candle closer i squinted at a face i almost recognized from the cover of timenewsweek where are your glasses contacts tonight you lose the glasses when you dont want to be recognized yeah sort of a reverse clark kent thing he smiled yeah and i could feel his geeky little heart reaching out for mine tonight hes wearing his glasses he looks cute in them of course the really exciting work is in bemod he says slicing into his steak bemod this seems like a good time to play dumb behavior modification the current dart formulas can make you want to ingest something food smoke whatever thats easy easy for you i say raising my eyebrows toward the bump thats only just beginning to subside at least he has the grace to look embarrassed yeah uh sorry about that but once we ship the darts to the providers its pretty much out of cravetechs hands i get stuck sometimes too you know i spell the word oblivious in my head over and over until i lose the urge to punch him it takes four this time so i miss hearing yet another version of the if it wasnt cravetech it would be someone else speech anyway its all just using the chemistry of cravings hes saying when im calm enough to tune back in the fact that you have to buy whatever it is youre craving is an indirect consequence an awfully profitable indirect consequence i stab at a carrot yes but see thats the thing the next big leap in the field is to skip straight to the buying part weve been doing some promising work with what happens to brain chemistry when avid consumers watch successful commercials so youre trying to synthesize a drug that will make people go out and buy maxwhite toothpaste or a pair of neonikes or an h oh my god he unleashes his boy genius grin yeah pretty cool huh i report for my first day at cravetech two weeks later no one mentions that im dating the ceo so i assume it hasnt gotten out still i make a point of flirting back and being overheard when the cute young thing from amazonfedex kinkos makes her rounds id told tom up front that i was applying for the job he was encouraging but made it clear he would keep his nose out of it and leave things to avery i never see tom around the marketing department he seems more interested in making things than selling them which i find endearing if only he werent making such awful things i flop down on sandras futon narrowly missing a cat she puts mugs of tea on the table while i fish an envelope out of my shoulder bag when she sits down next to me i place the envelope in her hands information i say and lots of it she takes the data card out of the envelope and peers at it as if she can actually make sense of what it contains this is all of them all the formulas set to come out over the next six months ive included a release schedule so youll know which ones will be hitting the street first the counterformula team is gonna love this theyd better that little card represents a month of my life spent smiling at banalities and pretending to care about other peoples kids so youre ready to quit she sounds relieved id love to but i dont think i can just yet i still havent found anything about this bemod stuff tom keeps going on about it but as far as i can tell it hasnt surfaced in rd isnt it weird that he seems so serious about bemod but you cant find it at cravetech i laugh so you think he has some other lab where hes developing chemicals he can use to rule the world maybe not rule the world just make a shitload of money which is close enough youre serious arent you she shifts uncomfortably on the futon it just seems like hes been awfully specific about this bemod stuff and it hasnt turned up where youd expect it so what are you suggesting i think its time you broke up with him and maybe quit cravetech too but if this bemod stuff is in development somewhere well need to get our hands on it and start on a counterformula as soon as we can thats true and how do we do that if i dont keep seeing him the cell leader finally overcomes the college buddy just be careful dont get too attached to him i pick up the data card two gig worth of corporate espionage does this seem like im too attached i arrive at toms place in a foul mood he doesnt notice dangerously oblivious were still in the foyer when he starts in about bemod i read a fascinating study on endorphins today apparently you can stimulate can we please talk about something other than biochemistry i drop my bag on the floor he looks surprised and a little hurt im sorry i didnt realize i was boring you youre not boring me i reach for his hand as we head into the living room i just think we have more in common than an interest in bemods and dc comics i havent gotten around to telling him i prefer marvel he stops and pulls me back toward him i love you see there you go i love me too something else we have in common oh for gods sake he sighs collapsing on his downfilled couch im trying to be serious i know i sit down next to him im sorry i just need a little more time okay a little more time he says kissing my forehead and then my neck its so easy to kiss him back the next time i go to sandras she has a data card for me whats this a press release it says cravetech is voluntarily recalling all darts because internal studies have shown them to trigger heart attacks and strokes in a small but substantial segment of the population we need you to send it out from the cravetech network i hand the card back to her the media will figure out its bogus not before the stock plummets were set up to trigger a small drop and the release will do the rest you know i wont be able to go back there after i send it theyll trace it to me i know i stare hard at her she doesnt flinch and ill have to break up with tom you need to do that anyway alex its been almost six months thats too long its longer than youve dated anyone for real sandra sending this press release is just throwing a brick through a window its meaningless in the long run theyll replace the window the stock price will readjust but it will slow them down sandra if it isnt cravetech itll be what nothing i take the card youll send the release ill send it i put the few personal items that decorated my cubicle in a gym bag i never had a picture of tom on my desk that would have been indiscreet the press release glows on my work station one twitch away from every major news outlet and the most incendiary of the minor ones if i had a picture of tom i might have stared at it for a while maybe even whispered sorry to it but i dont so i just flick send ive come to break up with him youre early he says when he greets me at the door ive planned something special i follow him out to the deck for what our sixmonth anniversary theres a clothcovered table and dining chairs a silver champagne bucket on a stand in another twenty minutes therell be a sunset too he says this like he paid for it but you know he looks oddly apologetic youre early tom im sorry were not going to have a sixmonth anniversary i expect anything from him but the crooked boy genius smile i love so much this isnt about the press release is it i sit a little inelegantly in my surprise what press release he laughs this conversation will probably be less awkward if i just tell you i had all your cravetech emails routed to me before they went out ah i was a little surprised that you actually sent it but i do understand i appreciate your beliefs i love you for them i want you to know that he pours us each a glass of champagne and besides you really helped me out with those counterformulas i pick up my glass then set it down again helped you out absolutely my people made a couple of tweaks though your groups design wasnt very cost effective at the ten thousand unit level wait wait wait youre going to manufacture our counterformulas oh yes the marketing campaign has been in development at a subsidiary company for weeks now and the profit projections alex you wouldnt believe it apparently people really really hate the craving darts oh my oblivious darling theyll pay twice the cost of the actual food just to make the cravings go away but they wont have to well be giving away the counterformula for free funny thing about that the research shows people would rather pay a couple of bucks to get the antidote from a familiar trusted source than from a pack of anarchists with a habit of blowing up buses blowing up buses whatre you oh its a little something were planning for the fourth quarter disinformation campaign its ready for implementation now but we think everyone will be more inclined to actively hate you during the holidays hate me i stand up and start backing toward the door well not you your group theyll love you alex youll be managing my charitable organizations giving away money to worthy causes right and left people love that and theyll love me people love ceos whose wives do that kind of stuff wives he brings out a pistol and fires a dart into my neck i pull out the dart and drop it on the ground what was in that thing he answers my question with a question as he pops open a little black velvet box alex will you marry me tom you sneaky little i say lost between admiration and horror will i marry you of course i will tom jr has a hard time waking up in the morning he gets it from me not his father who is always up before the crack of dawn especially since the bemod wide dispersal aerosol went into production tommy wake up i call out toward his room theres only a muffled grumbling in response i walk up to his doorway really tommy its time to get going youll be late for school he rolls over groaning but doesnt make a move to get up i unholster my parenting gun and shift the round in the chamber from go to bed to wake up get up tommy i say as i draw a bead on his sleeptousled head im not going to tell you again caught in the organ draft by robert silverberg robert silverberg fourtime hugo awardwinner fivetime winner of the nebula award sfwa grand master sf hall of fame honoree is the author of nearly five hundred short stories nearly one hundredandfifty novels and is the editor of in the neighborhood of one hundred anthologies including my own the living dead federations and the way of the wizard among his most famous works are lord valentines castle dying inside nightwings and the world inside learn more at wwwmajipoor com the united states no longer has a draft military conscription was ended under the richard nixon administration in but before that millions of american men experienced compulsory military service when confronted with the possibility of wartime horror and the very real threat of death these men could not run they faced long sentences in military jails that were famous for their harsh conditions once their time was over their legal records would be ruined these men could give their bodies and lives to the war machines or they could throw away their futures that was their choice in our next story robert silverberg paints a reality where young people must once again choose between their bodies and their futures their organs are needed by the rich and important people whove got the power of the law on their side a conscripted organ donor can live without a lung or a kidney but a convicted draft dodger might wish hed never been born here is a tale that pushes the boundaries of ownership and duty and leaves us ready to burn our draft cards and emigrate to another world look there kate down by the promenade two splendid seniors walking side by side near the waters edge they radiate power authority wealth assurance hes a judge a senator a corporation president no doubt and shes what a professor emeritus of international law lets say there they go toward the plaza moving serenely smiling nodding graciously to passersby how the sunlight gleams in their white hair i can barely stand the brilliance of that reflected aura it blinds me it stings my eyes what are they eighty ninety a hundred years old at this distance they seem much younger they hold themselves upright their backs are straight they might pass for being only fifty or sixty but i can tell their confidence their poise mark them for what they are and when they were nearer i could see their withered cheeks their sunken eyes no cosmetics can hide that these two are old enough to be our greatgrandparents they were well past sixty before we were even born kate how superbly their bodies function but why not we can guess at their medical histories shes had at least three hearts hes working on his fourth set of lungs they apply for new kidneys every five years their brittle bones are reinforced with hundreds of skeletal snips from the arms and legs of hapless younger folk their dimming sensory apparatus is aided by countless nervegrafts obtained the same way their ancient arteries are freshly sheathed with sleek teflon ambulatory assemblages of secondhand human parts spliced here and there with synthetic or mechanical organ substitutes thats all they are and what am i then or you nineteen years old and vulnerable in their eyes im nothing but a ready stockpile of healthy organs waiting to serve their needs come here son what a fine strapping young man you are can you spare a kidney for me a lung a choice little segment of intestine ten centimeters of your ulnar nerve i need a few pieces of you lad you wont deny a distinguished elder like me what i ask will you will you today my draft notice a small crisp document very officiallooking came shooting out of the data slot when i punched for my morning mail ive been expecting it all spring no surprise no shock actually rather an anticlimax now that its finally here in six weeks i am to report to transplant house for my final physical exam only a formality they wouldnt have drafted me if i didnt already rate top marks as organreservoir potential and then i go on call the average call time is about two months by autumn theyll be carving me up eat drink and be merry for soon comes the surgeon to my door a straggly band of senior citizens is picketing the central headquarters of the league for bodily sanctity its a counterdemonstration an antiantitransplant protest the worst kind of political statement feeding on the ugliest of negative emotions the demonstrators carry glowing signs that say bodily sanctity or bodily selfishness and you owe your leaders your very lives and listen to the voice of experience the picketers are lowechelon seniors barely across the qualifying line the ones who cant really be sure of getting transplants no wonder theyre edgy about the league some of them are in wheelchairs and some are encased right up to the eyebrows in portable lifesupport systems they croak and shout bitter invective and shake their fists watching the show from an upper window of the league building i shiver with fear and dismay these people dont just want my kidneys or my lungs theyd take my eyes my liver my pancreas my heart anything they might happen to need i talked it over with my father hes fortyfive years old too old to have been personally affected by the organ draft too young to have needed any transplants yet that puts him in a neutral position so to speak except for one minor factor his transplant status is g thats quite high on the eligibility list not the toppriority class but close enough if he fell ill tomorrow and the transplant board ruled that his life would be endangered if he didnt get a new heart or lung or kidney hed be given one practically immediately status like that simply has to influence his objectivity on the whole organ issue anyway i told him i was planning to appeal and maybe even to resist be reasonable he said be rational dont let your emotions run away with you is it worth jeopardizing your whole future over a thing like this after all not everybody whos drafted loses vital organs show me the statistics i said show me he didnt know the statistics it was his impression that only about a quarter or a fifth of the draftees actually got an organ call that tells you how closely the older generation keeps in touch with the situation and my fathers an educated man articulate wellinformed nobody over the age of thirtyfive that i talked to could show me any statistics so i showed them out of a league brochure its true but based on certified national institute of health reports nobody escapes they always clip you once you qualify the need for young organs inexorably expands to match the pool of available organpower in the long run theyll get us all and chop us to bits thats probably what they want anyway to rid themselves of the younger members of the species always so troublesome by cannibalizing us for spare parts and recycling us lung by lung pancreas by pancreas through their own deteriorating bodies fig on march this dogs own liver was removed and replaced with the liver of a nonrelated mongrel donor the animal was treated with azathioprine for months and all therapy then stopped he remains in perfect health years after transplantation the war goes on this is i think its fourteenth year of course theyre beyond the business of killing now they havent had any field engagements since or so certainly none since the organdraft legislation went into effect the old ones cant afford to waste precious young bodies on the battlefield so robots wage our territorial struggles for us butting heads with a great metallic clank laying land mines and twitching their sensors at the enemys mines digging tunnels beneath his screens et cetera et cetera plus of course the quasimilitary activity economic sanctions thirdpower blockades propaganda telecasts beamed as overrides from merciless orbital satellites and stuff like that its a subtler war than the kind they used to wage nobody dies still it drains national resources taxes are going up again this year the fifth or sixth year in a row and theyve just slapped a special peace surcharge on all metalcontaining goods on account of the copper shortage there once was a time when we could hope that our crazy old leaders would die off or at least retire for reasons of health stumbling away to their country villas with ulcers or shingles or scabies or scruples and allowing new young peacemakers to take office but now they just go on and on immortal and insane our senators our cabinet members our generals our planners and their war goes on and on too their absurd incomprehensible diabolical selfgratifying war i know people my age or a little older who have taken asylum in belgium or sweden or paraguay or one of the other countries where bodily sanctity laws have been passed there are about twenty such countries half of them the most progressive nations in the world and half of them the most reactionary but whats the sense of running away i dont want to live in exile ill stay here and fight naturally they dont ask a draftee to give up his heart or his liver or some other organ essential to life say his medulla oblongata we havent yet reached that stage of political enlightenment at which the government feels capable of legislating fatal conscription kidneys and lungs the paired organs the dispensable organs are the chief targets so far but if you study the history of conscription over the ages you see that it can always be projected on a curve rising from rational necessity to absolute lunacy give them a fingertip theyll take an arm give them an inch of bowel theyll take your guts in another fifty years theyll be drafting hearts and stomachs and maybe even brains mark my words let them get the technology of brain transplants together and nobodys skull will be safe itll be human sacrifice all over again the only difference between us and the aztecs is one of method we have anesthesia we have antisepsis and asepsis we use scalpels instead of obsidian blades to cut out the hearts of our victims means of overcoming the homograft reaction the pathway that has led from the demonstration of the immunological nature of the homograft reaction and its universality to the development of relatively effective but by no means completely satisfactory means of overcoming it for therapeutic purposes is an interesting one that can only be touched upon very briefly the year ushered in a new era in transplantation immunobiology in which the discovery of various means of weakening or abrogating a hosts response to a homograft such as sublethal whole body xirradiation or treatment with certain adrenal corticosteroid hormones notably cortisone began to influence the direction of the mainstream of research and engender confidence that a workable clinical solution might not be too far off by the end of the decade powerful immunosuppressive drugs such as mercaptopurine had been shown to be capable of holding in abeyance the reactivity of dogs to renal homografts and soon afterward this principle was successfully extended to man is my resistance to the draft based on an ingrained abstract distaste for tyranny in all forms or rather on the mere desire to keep my body intact could it be both maybe do i need an idealistic rationalization at all dont i have an inalienable right to go through my life wearing my own nativeborn kidneys the law was put through by an administration of old men you can be sure that all laws affecting the welfare of the young are the work of doddering moribund ancients afflicted with angina pectoris atherosclerosis prolapses of the infundibulum fulminating ventricles and dilated viaducts the problem was this not enough healthy young people were dying of highway accidents successful suicide attempts divingboard miscalculations electrocutions and football injuries therefore there was a shortage of transplantable organs an effort to restore the death penalty for the sake of creating a steady supply of statecontrolled cadavers lost out in the courts volunteer programs of organ donation werent working out too well since most of the volunteers were criminals who signed up in order to gain early release from prison a lung reduced your sentence by five years a kidney got you three years off and so on the exodus of convicts from the jails under this clause wasnt so popular among suburban voters meanwhile there was an urgent and mounting need for organs a lot of important seniors might in fact die if something didnt get done fast so a coalition of senators from all four parties rammed the organdraft measure through the upper chambers in the face of a filibuster threat from a few youthoriented members it had a much easier time in the house of representatives since nobody in the house ever pays much attention to the text of a bill up for a vote and word had been circulated on this one that if it passed everybody over sixtyfive who had any political pull at all could count on living twenty or thirty extra years which to a representative means a crack at ten to fifteen extra terms of office naturally there have been court challenges but whats the use the average age of the eleven justices of the supreme court is seventyeight theyre human and mortal they need our flesh if they throw out the organ draft now theyre signing their own death warrants for a year and a half i was the chairman of the antidraft campaign on our campus we were the sixth or seventh local chapter of the league for bodily sanctity to be organized in this country and we were real activists mainly we would march up and down in front of the draft board offices carrying signs proclaiming things like kidney power and a mans body is his castle and the power to conscript organs is the power to destroy lives we never went in for the rough stuff though like bombing organtransplant centers or hijacking refrigeration trucks peaceful agitation that was our motto when a couple of our members tried to swing us to a more violent policy i delivered an extemporaneous twohour speech arguing for moderation naturally i was drafted the moment i became eligible i can understand your hostility to the draft my college advisor said its certainly normal to feel queasy about surrendering important organs of your body but you ought to consider the countervailing advantages once youve given an organ you get a a classification preferred recipient and you remain forever on the a roster surely you realize that this means that if you ever need a transplant yourself youll automatically be eligible for one even if your other personal and professional qualifications dont lift you to the optimum level suppose your career plans dont work out and you become a manual laborer for instance ordinarily you wouldnt rate even a first look if you developed heart disease but your preferred recipient status would save you youd get a new lease on life my boy i pointed out the fallacy inherent in this which is that as the number of draftees increases it will come to encompass a majority or even a totality of the population and eventually everybody will have a preferred recipient status by virtue of having donated and the term preferred recipient will cease to have any meaning a shortage of transplantable organs would eventually develop as each past donor stakes his claim to a transplant when his health fails and in time theyd have to arrange the preferred recipients by order of personal and professional achievement anyway for the sake of arriving at some kind of priorities within the a class and wed be right back where we are now fig the course of a patient who received antilymphocyte globulin alg before and for the first months after renal homotransplantation the donor was an older brother there was no early rejection prednisone therapy was started days postoperatively note the insidious onset of late rejection after cessation of globulin therapy this was treated by a moderate increase in the maintenance doses of steroids this delayed complication occurred in only of the first recipients of intrafamilial homografts who were treated with alg it has been seen with about the same low frequency in subsequent cases by permission of surg gynec obstet p so i went down to transplant house today right on schedule to take my physical a couple of my friends thought i was making a tactical mistake by reporting at all if youre going to resist they said resist at every point along the line make them drag you in for the physical in purely idealistic and ideological terms i suppose theyre right but theres no need yet for me to start kicking up a fuss wait till they actually say we need your kidney young man then i can resist if resistance is the course i ultimately choose why am i wavering am i afraid of the damage to my career plans that resisting might do am i not entirely convinced of the injustice of the entire organdraft system i dont know im not even sure that i am wavering reporting for your physical isnt really a sellout to the system i went anyway they tapped this and xrayed that and peeredintotheother thing yawn please bend over please cough please hold out your left arm please they marched me in front of a battery of diagnostat machines and i stood there hoping for the red light to flashtilt get out of here but i was as expected in perfect physical shape and i qualified for call afterward i met kate and we walked in the park and held hands and watched the glories of the sunset and discussed what ill do when and if the call comes if wishful thinking boy if your number is called you become exempt from military service and they credit you with a special tax deduction every year big deal another thing theyre very proud of is the program of voluntary donation of unpaired organs this has nothing to do with the draft which thus far at least requisitions only paired organs organs that can be spared without loss of life for the last twelve years its been possible to walk into any hospital in the united states and sign a simple release form allowing the surgeons to slice you up eyes lungs heart intestines pancreas liver anything you give it all to them this process used to be known as suicide in a simpler era and it was socially disapproved of especially in times of labor shortages now we have a labor surplus because even though our population growth has been fairly slow since the middle of the century the growth of laboreliminating mechanical devices and processes has been quite rapid even exponential therefore to volunteer for this kind of total donation is considered a deed of the highest social utility removing as it does a healthy young body from the overcrowded labor force and at the same time providing some elder statesman with the assurance that the supply of vital organs will not unduly diminish of course you have to be crazy to volunteer but theres never been any shortage of lunatics in our society if youre not drafted by the age of twentyone through some lucky fluke youre safe and a few of us do slip through the net im told so far there are more of us in the total draft pool than there are patients in need of transplants but the ratios are changing rapidly the draft legislation is still relatively new before long theyll have drained the pool of eligible draftees and then what birth rates nowadays are low the supply of potential draftees is finite but death rates are even lower the demand for organs is essentially infinite i can give you only one of my kidneys if i am to survive but you as you live on and on may require more than one kidney transplant some recipients may need five or six sets of kidneys or lungs before they finally get beyond hope of repair at age oneseventy or so as those whove given organs come to requisition organs later on in life the pressure on the undertwentyone group will get even greater those in need of transplants will come to outnumber those who can donate organs and everybody in the pool will get clipped and then well they could lower the draft age to seventeen or sixteen or even fourteen but even thats only a shortterm solution sooner or later there wont be enough spare organs to go around will i stay will i flee will i go to court times running out my call is sure to come up in another few weeks i feel a tickling sensation in my back now and then as though somebodys quietly sawing at my kidneys cannibalism at choukoutien dragon bone hill twentyfive miles southwest of peking paleontologists excavating a cave early in the twentieth century discovered the fossil skulls of peking man pithecanthropus pekinensis the skulls had been broken away at the base which led franz weidenreich the director of the dragon bone hill digs to speculate that peking man was a cannibal who had killed his own kind extracted the brains of his victims through openings in the base of their skulls cooked and feasted on the cerebral meat there were hearths and fragments of charcoal at the site and left the skulls behind in the cave as trophies to eat your enemys flesh to absorb his skills his strengths his knowledge his achievements his virtues it took mankind five hundred thousand years to struggle upward from cannibalism but we never lost the old craving did we theres still easy comfort to gain by devouring those who are younger stronger more agile than you weve improved the techniques is all and so now they eat us raw the old ones they gobble us up organ by throbbing organ is that really an improvement at least peking man cooked his meat our brave new society where all share equally in the triumphs of medicine and the deserving senior citizens need not feel that their merits and prestige will be rewarded only by a cold grave we sing its praises all the time how pleased everyone is about the organ draft except of course a few disgruntled draftees the ticklish question of priorities who gets the stockpiled organs they have an elaborate system by which hierarchies are defined supposedly a big computer drew it up thus assuring absolute godlike impartiality you earn salvation through good works accomplishments in career and benevolence in daily life win you points that nudge you up the ladder until you reach one of the highpriority classifications g or better no doubt the classification system is impartial and is administered justly but is it rational whose needs does it serve in during world war ii there was a shortage of the newly discovered drug penicillin among the american military forces in north africa two groups of soldiers were most in need of its benefits those who were suffering from infected battle wounds and those who had contracted venereal disease a junior medical officer working from selfevident moral principles ruled that the wounded heroes were more deserving of treatment than the selfindulgent syphilitics he was overruled by the medical officer in charge who observed that the vd cases could be restored to active duty more quickly if treated besides if they remained untreated they served as vectors of further infection therefore he gave them the penicillin and left the wounded groaning on their beds of pain the logic of the battlefield incontrovertible unassailable the great chain of life little creatures in the plankton are eaten by larger ones and the greater plankton falls prey to little fishes and little fishes to bigger fishes and so on up to the tuna and the dolphin and the shark i eat the flesh of the tuna and i thrive and flourish and grow fat and store up energy in my vital organs and am eaten in turn by the shriveled wizened seniors all life is linked i see my destiny in the early days rejection of the transplanted organ was the big problem such a waste the body failed to distinguish between a beneficial though alien organ and an intrusive hostile microorganism the mechanism known as the immune response was mobilized to drive out the invader at the point of invasion enzymes came into play a brushfire war designed to rip down and dissolve the foreign substances white corpuscles poured in via the circulatory system vigilant phagocytes on the march through the lymphatic network came antibodies highpowered protein missiles before any technology of organ grafts could be developed methods had to be devised to suppress the immune response drugs radiation treatment metabolic shock one way or another the organrejection problem was long ago conquered i cant conquer my draftrejection problem aged and rapacious legislators i reject you and your legislation my call notice came today theyll need one of my kidneys the usual request youre lucky somebody said at lunchtime they might have wanted a lung kate and i walk into the green glistening hills and stand among the blossoming oleanders and corianders and frangipani and whatever how good it is to be alive to breathe this fragrance to show our bodies to the bright sun her skin is tawny and glowing her beauty makes me weep she will not be spared none of us will be spared i go first then she or is it she ahead of me where will they make the incision here on her smooth rounded back here on the flat taut belly i can see the high priest standing over the altar at the first blaze of dawn his shadow falls across her the obsidian knife that is clutched in his upraised hand has a terrible fiery sparkle the choir offers up a discordant hymn to the god of blood the knife descends my last chance to escape across the border ive been up all night weighing the options theres no hope of appeal running away leaves a bad taste in my mouth father friends even kate all say stay stay stay face the music the hour of decision do i really have a choice i have no choice when the time comes ill surrender peacefully i report to transplant house for conscriptive donative surgery in three hours after all he said coolly whats a kidney ill still have another one you know and if that one malfunctions i can always get a replacement ill have preferred recipient status a for what thats worth but i wont settle for my automatic a i know whats going to happen to the priority system id better protect myself ill go into politics ill climb ill attain upward mobility out of enlightened selfinterest right right ill become so important that society will owe me a thousand transplants and one of these years ill get that kidney back three or four kidneys fifty kidneys as many as i need a heart or two a few lungs a pancreas a spleen a liver they wont be able to refuse me anything ill show them ill show them ill outsenior the seniors theres your bodily sanctity activist for you eh i suppose ill have to resign from the league goodbye idealism goodbye moral superiority goodbye kidney goodbye goodbye goodbye its done ive paid my debt to society ive given up unto the powers that be my humble pound of flesh when i leave the hospital in a couple of days ill carry a card testifying to my new a status top priority for the rest of my life why i might live for a thousand years

magazine will uncover at least one article that fights wrinkles or cellulite or some other symptom of times march across the body humans are afraid of death in whatever form it takes but growing older is perhaps its most reviled shape unlike a homicidal maniac or a car accident old age makes its victims survive decades of indignity no wonder we fight it so much but our next story gives us a future where the battle against old age has become even more of a losing proposition lifespans have plummeted senility can hit a person in only his midtwenties and despite efforts to start adulthood at a younger age theres only so much living anyone can cram into a quarter of a decade its hard to lead a full life in so little time here is a world of quiet desperation full of people fighting for one more day with a loved one one more day of sunshine one more day as a geriatric sandy started babbling on tuesday morning and todd knew it was the end they took poogy and gog away from me sandy said sadly her hand trembling spilling coffee on the toast what todd mumbled and never brought them back just took them i looked all over looked for what poogy sandy said thrusting out her lower lip the skin of her cheeks was sagging down to form jowls her hair was thin and fine now though she kept it dyed dark brown and gog what the hell are poogy and gog todd asked you took them sandy said she started to cry she kicked the table leg todd got up from the table and went to work the university was empty sunday damn sunday never anyone there to help with the work on sunday waste too much damn time looking up things that students should be sent to find out he went to the lab ryan was there they looked over the computer readouts blood said ryan just plain aint worth the paper its printed on not one thing todd said plenty of tests left to run no tests left to run except the viral microscopy and thats next week ryan smiled well then the problem must be viral you know damn well the problem isnt viral ryan looked at him sharply his long grey hair tossing in the opposite direction what is it then sunspots aliens from outer space gods punishment the jews yellow peril todd didnt answer just settled down to double checking the figures outside he heard the sunday parade pentecostal jesus will save you brother when you go without your sins how could he concentrate whats wrong ryan asked nothings wrong todd answered nothing sweet jesus you old man if i could live to thirtythree id let them hang my corpse from any cross they wanted if i could live to thirty twentyfour birthday june they used to celebrate birthdays now everyone tried to keep it secret not todd though not welladjusted todd even had a few friends over they drank to his health his hands shook at night now like palsy like fear and his teeth were rotting in his mouth he looked down at the paper where his hands were following the lines the numbers blurred have to have new glasses again second time this year the veins on his hands stuck out blue and evillooking and sandy was over the edge today she was only twentytwo it hit the women first he had met her just before college they had married had nine children in nine years duty to the race it must be childbearing that made the women get it sooner but the race had to go on somehow and now their older children were grown up having children of their own miracles of modern medicine we dont know why you get old so young and we cant cure it but in the meantime we can give you a little more adulthood accelerated development sixmonth gestation puberty at nine not a disease left you could catch except the one but the one was enough not as large as a church door but tis enough twill serve his chin quivered and tears dropped down wrinkled cheeks onto the page what is it ryan asked concerned todd shook his head he didnt need comfort not from a novice of eighteen only two years out of college what is it ryan persisted its tears todd answered a salty fluid produced by a gland near the eye used for lubrication also serves doubleduty as a signal to other people that stress cannot be privately coped with so dont cope privately what is it todd got up and left the room he went to his office and called the medical center psychiatric he said to the moronic voice that answered psychiatric was busy he called again and got through dr lassiter was in todd lassiter said val todd answered got a problem can it wait busy day cant wait its sandy she started babbling today ah said val im sorry is it bad she remembers her separation therapy like it was yesterday thats it then todd val said im really sorry sandys a wonderful woman good researcher but theres nothing we can do arent we supposed to be able to see signs before she reaches this stage usually val answered but not always think back though im sure youll remember signs todd swallowed have you got a space val you knew sandy back in the old days back when we were kids in the is this pressure todd val asked abruptly appeal to friendship dont you know the law i know the law dammit im asking you one medical researcher to another is there room theres room todd val answered for the treatables but if shes reverted to separation therapy then what can i do its a matter of weeks for your own safety you have to turn her over never know whats going to happen during the final senility you know hallucinations sometimes violence theres still strength in the old bones shes committed no crime its also the law val reminded him goodbye todd hung up the phone turn her over hed never thought it would come to sandy so suddenly he couldnt just turn her over shed hate him she had enough of herself left in herself to know what was going on theyd been married thirteen years he went back to ryan in the lab and told him to put the computers on the viral microscopy tomorrow thats unscientific to rush it said ryan damned unscientific todd agreed do it ok ryan answered its sandy isnt it its handwriting todd said its all over the walls todd went home and found sandy in the living room cuddling a pillow and watching the tube someone was yelling at someone else sandy didnt care she was stroking the pillow making love noises todd sat on the chair and watched for her almost an hour she never noticed him she did however change pillows gog she said she listened for an answer nodded smiled held the pillow to her breasts todd chewed his fingernails his heart was fluttering he went into the kitchen and fixed dinner she ate though she spilled a great deal and threw her spoon on the floor he put her to bed then he showered came back out and crawled into bed beside her what the hell do you think youre doing she challenged her voice husky and mature going to bed todd answered not in my bed you bastard she said shoving at him my bed you mean he said even though he knew better she growled like a tiger todd thought then she clawed as his face her nails were long he lurched back his face on fire with pain the motion carried him off the bed he landed heavily on the floor his brittle old bones ached at the impact he felt for his eyes to see if they were still there they were if you ever come back she said ill have my husband eat you alive todd didnt bother arguing he went into the living room and curled up on the couch for the first time he wished that children still lived at home nowadays that even the twoyearold were there to talk to he touched the pillow pulled it toward him then stopped himself pillows one of the signs not me he thought he fell asleep surrounded by nightmares of childhood attacked on all sides by sagging flesh and fragile bones and eyes and ears that had forgotten all they ever knew how to do he woke with the blood clotted stiffly on his face his back was sore where he had struck the floor last night he walked stiffly to the bathroom when he washed the blood off his face the cuts opened again and he spent a half hour stanching the bleeding when he left home sandy was sitting at the kitchen table holding a tea party for herself and the pillows goodbye sandy todd said more tea gog she answered he did not go to the lab instead he went to the library and used his top security clearance to gain access to the gerontology section it was illegal to use security clearance for personal purposes but who would know who would care for that matter he found a volume entitled psychology of accelerated aging by v n lassiter he finished it at ryan looked irritated when todd finally came in weve been running the series without you he said but holy hell todd everybodys been on my back for doing it early if youre going to give me a screwedup order at least be here to take the lumps sorry todd started looking over the early readouts you wont find anything yet ryan said i know todd answered but the meeting is on friday ryan slammed down a sheaf of papers on his desk well make the report then todd went on if we make a report then it will be worth exactly nothing ryan said angrily if we make a report then and we will make a report then it will be as accurate as human understanding can make it do you think well miss anything now theres nothing our blood is no different from the blood of our great great grandfathers who lived to be ninetyfive there are no microbes and viruses are just corkscrews if you do this ryan said ill recommend that you be removed from your post and the viral microscopy series be run again todd laughed calm down he said im twentyfour ryan looked at the floor im sorry hey todd said dont worry about it in a few months you can run the whole thing over again if you want and the guy after you and the one after him run it over and over and over again through eternity i wont care youll have your time in the sun ryan youll have six years as head of the department and youll write papers conduct research and then youll roll over like the rest of us and wiggle your feet in the air for a while and then youll die ryan turned away ive got the point todd dr halking boy todd said dr halking to you until im dead todd walked to the window and opened it outside on the lawn was an afternoon rally of the fatalists hasten the day they sang at the top of their decrepit lungs white hair flashing in the breeze and the sunlight take me away death is the answer dont make me stay shut the window ryan said todd opened it wider two students graduate students about sixteen years old took a few quick steps toward him relax todd said im not jumping todd was still standing at the window when val lassiter came ryan called me val said i know todd answered i heard him call lets talk val answered the students left the room val looked at ryan and he also left theyre gone val said lets talk todd sat in a chair i know what youre thinking todd said im showing the signs what signs todd sighed dont give me any of that psychiatrist crap i read your book ive got it all tears worries inability to bear delay impatience with friends unwillingness to admit any possibility of hope suicidal behavior im so far gone that if jesus whispered in my ear youre saved id believe and be baptized and not be surprised at all you shouldnt have read that book todd i read the book but im not over the edge val i will be i know but not yet its just sandy i was a fool i let myself get too attached you know i cant handle it cant let go keep feeling theres got to be a way val smiled and touched todds shoulder youve devoted your life to finding a way so have i so have all of us from the project geniuses all even sandy what a damned shame shes the first to go but the cure wont come overnight wont come by trying to reverse whats irreversible who says its irreversible todd demanded experience val said what do you think you can go out of your discipline and outdo the experts in a sudden flash of inspiration all youll think of are ideas weve thought of and discarded long ago how do you know it cant be reversed we dont even know what causes the aging val we dont even know if it has a cause why is the cutoff point separation therapy why cant you help people once they revert to that val shrugged its arbitrary we cant do that much for others either todd shook his head saying val you dont understand maybe whats going on in separation therapy is part of what causes the senility val stood impatiently i told you todd youll only think of things we already thought of it cant be the cause because separation therapy began after the aging epidemic it was tried as a cure it was used so we would mature faster so we would have more adult productive years todd you know that you know it cant be the cause what is this todd picked up a stack of readouts forget it val tell everyone im over my breakdown its sandy being over the edge i just couldnt handle the grief a while ok val smiled ok have you turned her over yet todd stiffened no val stopped smiling its the law todd do it soon do it before i have to report it todd looked up at val with a sickening smile on his face and when will you have to report it val val looked at todd for a moment then turned and left the others came back to the lab they worked all afternoon and far into the night pretending nothing had happened at least todd hadnt suicided so many did these days especially the brilliant ones no one would have been surprised but todd they needed at least for a while more at least until the young ones had a chance to learn otherwise theyd be a few years deeper into the hole thered be a few more years worth of learning lost a little bit less that one man could hope to do in his short lifetime todd called in sick the next morning he was not sick he took sandy by the hand led her to the car and drove her to the childhouse he flashed his security pass and rushed sandy through the halls as quickly as possible so no one would notice she was over the edge the rushing about left todds heart fluttering his old hopeless heart he thought only a few more months only a few more weeks of pumping away they were met at the observation window by several young researchers couldnt be out of college yet maybe fifteen hair still young eyes still bright skin still smooth todd felt angry looking at them they were impressed to be meeting the todd halking gee dr halking the heavyset young women enthused we never thought our work would have any application on the biological end of things it probably doesnt todd said but we need to check every angle this is my wife she has a cold so id advise you to keep your distance sandy showed no sign of paying attention to the conversation around her she only watched the large window in front of her on the other side a child was playing with two stuffed animals one was a bear the other a lion poogy sandy whispered gog a research supervisor walked into the observation room and began the testing for a moment todd tuned in to the heavyset womans droning explanation check to make sure the childs reliance is not pathological in which case special treatment is necessary in most cases separation therapy is judged to be safe and so we proceed immediately the tests were simple the supervisor knelt by the child and showed affection to each love object in turn first by patting then by kissing then by taking the love object briefly and hugging it though the little girl showed some signs of anxiety when the researcher took the love object away for a moment to hug it she was considered ready for therapy after all the student explained to todd for a fiveyearold to show no anxiety would be as startling as extreme anxiety and so the separation therapy began the attendant took both stuffed animals and left the room the little girls anxiety was immediately more acute she watched the door for a few moments then stood up went to the door and tried to make it open of course the buttons didnt respond to her touch she paced for a little while then sat back down and waited watching the door you see said the student you see how patient she is that can be a sign of exceptional maturity then the little girl ran out of patience she began to call out her words were inaudible but todd could hear sandy beside him mumbling poogy gog poogy gog in time with the little girls silent cries she was reacting todd felt a shiver of fear run through him upward from his feet she would react but would it do any good the little girl was screaming now her face red her eyes bugging out she may because she is an exceptionally affectionate and reliant child continue this until she is unconscious said the student we are monitoring her however in case she needs a sedative if we can avoid the sedative we do because it does them good like a purgative to work it out of their system the little girl lay on the floor and kicked she beat her head brutally against the floor padded of course said the student persistent little devil isnt she todd noticed that tears were rolling down sandys cheeks profusively making a latticework of tear tracks the little girl jumped up and ran as fast as she could against the wall striking it with her head the force of the impact was so great that she rebounded a full five feet and landed on her back she jumped up again and screamed and screamed then she began running around the room in circles oh well said the student this could go on for hours dr halking would you like to see something else id like to continue watching a while longer todd said softly the little girl abruptly stopped moving and slowly removed all her clothing then she started tearing at her naked skin with her teeth and fingernails streaks of bloody wounds followed after her fingers uhoh said the student selfdestructive have to stop her she might go for the eyes and cause permanent damage the last word was lost as the door slammed behind her in a moment the observers saw the student researcher enter the therapy room the little girl flew at her screaming and clawing the student despite her weight was welltrained she subdued the child quickly without sustaining or causing any wounds todd watched as the woman deftly forced a straitjacket on the child dr halking one of the other students said interrupting his observation i beg your pardon but what is your wife doing sandy was removing her last stitch of clothing todd managed to catch her hands before she could rake her nails across her sagging bosom the ancient hands were like claws where he held them and madness poured strength into her arms she broke free give me a hand here todd said meaning to shout but only able to whisper because of the way his heart was beating when they finally forced her to the ground shaking and exhausted her own skin was streaked with blood and some of the students had marks on them todds face was bleeding mostly where twodayold wounds had reopened the matron of the childhouse came in almost immediately after they subdued sandy what in heavens name are you doing in here she demanded they told her she narrowed her eyes and looked at todd dr halking what do you mean bringing a woman who was over the edge into a childhouse what did you mean letting her watch separation therapy what in heavens name were you thinking of are you trying to create catatonia are you trying to get some of my staff killed youve certainly got some of them fired for letting this happen todd mumbled his apologies urging her not to fire anyone it was all my fault i lied to them i well dr halking im calling the police at once this woman is obviously ready to be turned over obviously i cant understand a man of your stature playing these games with a womans safety and just plain ignoring the law todd apologized again praised the fine work they were doing told her he would make a favorable report on their behavior and finally the matron calmed down todd managed to extricate himself the matron did not call the police sandy took todds hand and followed him docilely out of the building when he got her home he let got of her hand she stayed standing where he had let go of her when he came back into the room a few minutes later she was still standing there in exactly the same position he spoke to her but she didnt answer he took her hand and led her she followed him to the bedroom she stood by the bed when he let go gently he pushed her onto the bed she lay on it not moving he raised her arm she left it raised until he reached out and lowered it again he closed her eyes because she wouldnt blink then he sat on the bed beside her and wept dry tears into his hands his body shuddering with rapid uncontrollable sobs though not a sound came then he slept feeling as sick as he had claimed to be that morning sandy remained catatonic for the rest of the week he hired a student from the university to come in and feed sandy and clean up after her on friday todd and ryan gathered their hastily prepared reports and flew to san francisco for the meeting val lassiter was on the same plane but they all pretended not to know each other the secrecy continued when they reached the city the scientists were all put in separate hotels they were brought to the meeting at different times through different entrances some of the were instructed to wear casual clothes others wore business suits one man wore a white uniform another wore a hard hat why all the secrecy ryan asked todd laughing at a neurologist in a rather overdone fishermans outfit to prevent the public from getting too much hope if the papers report that this meeting is taking place todd answered why not why not a little hope ryan asked why not a lot of heroin ryan looked coldly at todd dr halking i find your despair disgusting todd looked back and smiled and i find your insistence on hope touchingly naive the meeting went on the reports varied between cautious negative statements and utter despair todd read ryans and his report toward the end of the first day except for the viral microscopy reports all were slowly and deliberately doublechecked my assistant wants me to assure you that the viral microscopy reports were hurried through the second check that is true because the meeting couldnt wait and the computer could be made to work overtime there was some laughter however we never found any discrepancy between first and second runs on any other tests and we did carefully check and found no discrepancies on the first run of the viral microscopy tests either therefore i can safely conclude that there is no significant difference between contemporary blood samples and the blood samples prior to the premature aging phenomenon except such differences as reflect our conquest of certain wellknown diseases and these antibodies were not stimulated until long after the pap was first noted ergo not significant there were some careful questions easily answered and they moved on however jovial a presenter might be the answer was always the same no answers after the papers were presented the data examined the statistical results questioned and upheld the heads of the projects gathered in one small room at the top of the old hyatt regency todd halking and val lassiter arrived together only a couple of men were already there on impulse todd walked to the chalkboard at one end of the room and wrote on itabandon hope all ye who enter here not funny val said when todd sat down next to him come on theyll die laughing val looked at todd quizzically get a grip todd he said todd smiled i have a grip if not on myself then on reality everyone who came into the room saw the sign on the chalkboard some chuckled a little finally someone got up and erased the message the room was only half full todd got up and left the room his aging bladder more demanding than it had been a few years a few weeks before he washed his hands afterward and looked at himself in the mirror he was haggard his face cried out death he smiled at himself the smile was ghastly he went back to the room he was not yet seated when a militarylooking man entered and said ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states everybody stood and applauded the president walked in no one could have recognized him from the publicity pictures they all dated from his second campaign and then he had not been bald well youve done it the president said and within my term of office thank you the effort was magnificent the results are remarkably thorough im told by those who should know the president coughed into a handkerchief he sounded like he had pleurisy and if youre right he said if youre right the picture is pretty grim the president laughed todd wondered why but a few of the scientists laughed too including anne hallam the geneticist she spoke to the dinosaurs things once looked grim too a million mammals chewing on their eggs the dinosaurs died out the president said no hallam answered only the ones that hadnt become birds or mammals or some more viable type of reptile she smiled at them all hope springs eternal todd thought its small comfort she went on but one thing this early aging has done the species has shorter generations were better able to adapt genetically whatever happens when mankind gets out of this we will not be the same as we were when we went in yes todd said cheerfully well all be dead anne looked at him in irritation and several people coughed but the mood of joviality the president had set at first was gone now val wrote on his notebook and shoved it toward todd as the president started talking again youre speaking of aeons and species the president said i must think of nations and societies ours is dying if what you say is true in a few years it will be dead the nation the way we live civilization if i may use the romantic word todd read vals note it said shut your mouth you bastard its bad enough already todd smiled at val val glared back people were telling the president its hardly that bleak we weathered the worst already oh yes the president agreed we lasted through the depression we adapted to the collapse of world trade we made the transition from the cities back to the farms we have endured the death of huge industry and global interactions we have adapted to having our population cut in half in less than half what clever little adapters we are mr president todd said aware that he was breaking protocol to interrupt the president and not particularly giving a damn but tell me has anyone figured out an adaptation to death odd isnt it that in millions of years of evolution nature has never managed to select for immortality val stood obviously angry mr president i suggest that dr halking be asked to contribute constructively or leave this meeting theres no way we can accomplish anything with these constant interjections of pessimism there was a murmur half of protest half of agreement val todd said im only trying to be realistic and what do you think we are dreamers dont we know were all old men and doomed to die the president coughed and val sat down i believe said the president that dr halking will take this as a reminder that we are talking here as men of science dispassionately impersonally if you will now lets review they went over the findings again is there any chance the president asked again and again that you might be wrong a chance they all answered of course theres a chance but we have done the best our instruments will let us do what if you had more sophisticated instruments he asked of course they said but we do not have them youll have to wait another generation or two or three and by then the damage will be done well never live to see it then the president said we must get busy make sure your assistants and their assistants and their assistants as well know everything you know prepare them to continue your work we cant give up todd looked around the table as everyone nodded sagely lips pursed in the identical expression of grim courage the spirit of man we shall overcome todd couldnt bear it anymore like his bladder his emotions could be contained for progressively shorter periods of time for christs sake do you call this optimism he said and was instantly embarrassed that tears came unbidden to his eyes they would dismiss him as an emotional wreck not listen to his ideas at all sound clinical he warned himself try to sound clinical and careful and scientific and impartial and uninvolved and all those other impossible virtuous things i have the cure to the premature aging phenomenon todd said or at least i have the cure to the misery eyes all watching him intently at last i have their attention he thought the cure to the misery is to go home and go to bed and stop trying weve done all we can do and if we cant cure the disease we can live with it we can adapt to it we can try to be happy but the eyes were gone again and two of the scientists came over to him and dabbed at his eyes with their handkerchiefs and helped him get up from the table they took him to another room where he sat guarded by four men just in case and sobbed at last he was dry he sat and looked at the window and wondered why he had said the things he had said what good would it do men didnt have it in them to stop trying we are not bred for despair and yet we learn it for even in our efforts to repair the damage done by premature aging we are as blind as lemmings struggling to go down the same old road to a continent that a million years before had sunk under the sea yet the road could not be changed the age of forty had its tasks therefore we must strive to live to forty however far away it might be now the meeting ended he heard voices in the hall the words could not be deciphered but through them all was the tone of boisterous good cheer good luck my friend and ill see you soon heres to the future the door to todds private except for the guards room opened anne hallam and ryan came in stepping quietly im not asleep todd said nor am i emotionally discommoded at the moment so you neednt tiptoe anne smiled then todd im sorry about the embarrassment to you it happens to all of us now and then todd smiled back thank god for a little warmth how had she kept it and then shook his head not then just now well what did the meeting find out have the chinese found a magic cure and only now are radioing the formula to honolulu ryan laughed as if there were any chinese anymore anne said we decided two things first we havent found the cure yet astute todd aid raising an imaginary glass to clink with hers and second we decided that there is a cure and we will find it and while you were at it todd asked did you decide that fasterthanlight travel was possible and declare that it would be discovered next week by two youngsters in france who by chance were walking in the field one day and plunged into hyperspace not only that anne said but one of the children immediately will follow a rabbit down a hole and find herself in wonderland blunderland todd added and anne and todd laughed together with understanding and mutual compassion ryan looked at them puzzlement in his eyes todd noticed it the younger generation still knows only life ah youthful caesar we who are about to die salute you though we have no hope of actually communicating with you but there is a cause anne insisted and therefore it can be found your faith is touching todd said theres a cause for everything we dont change overnight with no reason or else nothing that any human being has ever called true can be counted on at all will gravity fail tomorrow afternoon at three todd said only if theres a cause but sometimes right now with pap the cause eludes us thats all why did the dinosaurs die out why did the apes drop from the trees and start talking and lighting fires we can guess perhaps but we dont know and yet there was a cause or theres no reason in the world i rest my case todd said my basket case to be precise ryans face twisted and todd laughed at him ryan the nearly dead are free to joke about death its only the living to whom death is tabu maybe anne hallam said leaning back in a chair and the guards eyes followed her because they watched everybody guarded everybody maybe theres some system some balance some ecosystem we havent discovered until now a system that demands that when one species or group gets out of hand that species changes not for survival of the fittest but for survival of the whole perhaps the dinosaurs were destroying the earth and so they stopped perhaps man was no we know man was destroying the earth and we know we were stopped any talk of nuclear war now any chance of too much industry raping the earth utterly beyond of hope of survival and in a moment ryan said his mouth curled with distaste youll be mentioning the thought that god is punishing us for our sins i personally find the idea ridiculous and seeing two of our finest minds seriously discussing it is pathetic ryan got up and left anne smiled again warmly at todd patted his hand and left after a few minutes todd followed a plane ride east midnight at the airport nevertheless a crowd bustling through at one end of the terminal a ragged old man was shouting to an oblivious crowd todd and the others tried to pass him without paying attention but he called to them you you with the briefcases you in the suits ryan stopped and turned and so they all had to todd was irritated he was tired he wanted to get home to sandy youre scientists arent you the man shouted they didnt answer he took that for agreement its your fault the earth couldnt bear so many men so many machines lets get out of here todd said and the others agreed the old man kept calling after them rape thats all it was rape of a planet rape of each other rape of life you bastards people stared at them all the way out of the terminal there was a day ryan said when people expected science to work miracles and cursed us when we failed now they curse us for the miracles we did give them todd hunched his shoulders scientists hell who were scientists people with blue security cards the old mans voice echoed even out in the parking lot the earth gets even the violated virgins will have their revenge todd got in his car and drove home alone shaking when he got home he found all as he had left it the student from the university had come in and fed sandy there were dishes in the sink that the boy apparently hadnt thought of cleaning up sandy was where todd had left her lying on the bed breathing her eyes were closed todd lay on the bed beside her he had carried despair with him to the meeting and carried it as a burden multiplied many times over when he came back with a gentle finger he traced the wrinkles that radiated from sandys eyes followed the folds of skin down her neck twisted the brown hair now showing gray roots pressed his lips against her closed eyes he could remember when the skin was smooth not cracked and hard as parchment not thin and veinlined im sorry he said again and again unsure who he was apologizing to or what for im so sorry and then he told his wifes unhearing ears about the conference they had found nothing and finding nothing they could find no cure youre going to die he said softly into her ear youre going to die id stop it if i could but i cant youre going to die he got up and sat at his desk he wrote by hand on the blank envelope sitting there because he felt too tired to type too tired to reach up to the shelf above the desk and pick up the sheets of paper the ink scrawled our senility is not just age in the books it is possible to age gracefully let us age with grace and strength please not madly and with terror and in the darkness and clinging to our pillows and our blankets calling names of parents we never knew names of soft friends who never answered us he stopped writing for as little reason as he had begun he wondered who he had been writing to he leaned back and touched the mattress it was soft he buried his hand in the blanket it was soft on his knees by the bed he clung to the blanket saying quietly dappa and then coopie dappa youre back lying naked on the bed curled up with a pillow tucked under his arm he knew somewhere back in his mind that he was not quite what he should be not quite thinking and acting as he ought but it was too good to have dappa and coopie back he fell asleep with tears of comfort and relief spotting the sheets he woke with blood pumping upward out of his heart his wife sandy knelt on the bed straddling him the letter opener still in her hand her face splotched red with his blood poogy she said angrily her face contorted youve got poogy and i want him she stabbed him again and todd felt the letter opener in his chest it fit as snugly and comfortably as a new organ that had long been missing from his body it was however cold sandy pulled out the letter opener and a new spout erupted and spattered she stuck out her lower lip im taking poogy now she said then she reached down and pulled the bloody pillow from under his arm dappa todd said in feeble protest but as the pillow moved away cradled in his wifes arms he saw clearly again he recognized what was happening and as his arms and legs got colder and the bloodspout weakened he longed to cry out for help but his voice did not work there was no rescue death and madness he thought in the last moment left to him they are the only rescuers and where madness fails death will do and it did arties arent stupid by jeremiah tolbert jeremiah tolberts fiction has appeared in fantasy magazine interzone ideomancer and shimmer as well as in the anthologies federations and polyphony hes also been featured several times on the escape pod and podcastle podcasts in addition to being a writer he is a web designer photographer and graphic artist and he shows off each of those skills in his dr roundbottom project located at wwwclockpunkcom he lives in colorado with his wife and cats this story first appeared in my anthology seeds of change does it hurt an artist to go a week without painting does it pain a singer to spend a day without singing do creative people suffer when they are denied the chance to create our next story is the story of artists who do suffer when circumstances keep them from creating art they suffer real pain because they are genetically engineered constructs whose bodies are specially designed to make art these arties arent alone in their specialization there are brainiacs whose bodies are atrophied beneath massive brains and thicknecks and skinnybois too each group has their own skills their own weaknesses their own strange places in a strange world in such a regimented society its not surprising that even a temporary mural needs to be licensed but when their latest art experiment is rejected the crew of artists have to find a new kind of creativity an art so big it will transcend the boundaries between every specialty this piece sketches a dark reality where art is dangerous and creativity hurts it confronts us with the value of art in our own time and place it asks can society thrive without art can we live without it would we want to a few of us arties were hanging out in tube station d in the dry part that hadnt flooded tin men had busted blaze and ransom doing an unlicensed mural on q street behind a soytein shop and a small crowd of us watching too chickshit to make with the tin men cracking down scattered when the pigbots hummed in from every direction like it was some kind of puzzle bust and not just a bunch of arties trying to wind down wed all clustered back down in the station on niless turf tin men didnt bother below ground so long as the elderfolk couldnt see turd they didnt give a turd niles wasnt there so some ratfaced kid started posing and posturing about taking a little swatch of wall for himself doing it up special pecking order is pecking order so nobody wanted to be near the turdhead if niles heard him talking like that so every bodies was giving him space and lots of it lookouts on the street announced with sharp whistles that niles was headed down and the kid shut right up niles was a year or two older than the rest of us some bodies liked to say he was a protoarty but i dont know about that he was different and it didnt have nothing to do with his age or make all age did was give him a few inches of height to make bossing easier he bossed good not mean like elderfolk but kept us out of trouble with the thicknecks and justplains something about him was plain special we few girlies knew it specially he was taller than me by a head hair burnt umber and long styled nice with lipcurl and spike he wore a worker mans jumpsuit adorned with patches and swatches of fabric that he liked very anime very hip arties have good fashion sense but niles set trends in our clade boo was with him as usual a stunted runt of a melodie that niles had found sleeping on his turf she wore an old fashioned mp player around her neck earbuds nearly soldered into her ear bits whenever you got close to her you could make out tinny music but what kind of music it was you couldnt figure unlike other melodies boo never sung not once didnt speak either bum batch probably it happens although most get recycled early nobody questioned her hanging around seeings how niles tolerated her this stuff is snazzy he said no paint just water and plant stuff nozzle works the same though sprays right on i recognized the stuff id seen advertisements for it on my elderfolks vidiot box mossinacan they sold it to elderfolk for the recreation yards for making everything look all old and natural whatever that meant simple biotech nothing too crazy nothing like us arties niles tossed us each a metal can from a satchel that boo carried except for the ratfaced kid niles gave him zip you get out of here go home to your elderfolk i heard what you were saying before i stalked aon down he said to him wagging his finger and ratfaces eyes got all comic and big ratface sputtered something about how his elderfolk didnt want him around but niles just shook his head no bodies do zinger thats right i remembered ratface was a new transfer to the city hood named zinger somethingsomething niles was a lot better at names than the rest of us but you could see that he had to think real hard for it sometimes his faced scrunch up and hed just freeze to concentrate past all the shapes and colors that dance in an arties head from wake to sleep yah said tops he stepped up out of the crowd and gave zinger a short shove on the shoulder tops was ransoms best friend and hed been spoiling for a fight all day ever since the tin men busted ransom cerulean niles said and the color flashed through our heads and everybody calmed down just a little go on you can come back tomorrow this is my studio dont forget it kay zinger nodded then turned and ran up the stone steps to street level niles sighed and finished handing out the mossinacan we supposed to make with this instead of paint its all one color tops said his voice all whiny like some spoiled justplain thats right niles said better mossy than going in the pokeypokey i winced at the word which was both the name of a bad place and a description of what they did to you there i took my can happy feeling better already designshapes were practically pushing out my ears my elderfolk wouldnt give me any scratch for paints lately using it all on themselves and drugas to feel better was okay with me niles gave stuff that he got from trading to the thicknecks and skinnybois for gang logos drugas made my elderfolk less shouty which was just goodnogreat with me i went up and found some alley space and i made until it all went away into an eggshell white haze we messed around with the mossinacan for a few days until the elderfolk decided they didnt like the mess and the tin men got new marching orders they started spraying down all the fractals and designs with some kind of ick and it all turned turdbrown and dusted away hurt to see it but what can arties do tin men cant be argued or fought with like elderfolk we were all sulking in niles station feeling the pain of notmaking like aching all over and niles got mad and stomped off without even waking up boo we were a little scared because niles only left boo behind when he was going to do something that might get him sent into the pokey for a long long time and without niles to keep everything straight wed all be in trouble boo woke up while we were fighting about what to do and came and cuddled up to me i could almost feel the music vibrating through her into me it made me feel a little sick dont know why she likes you so much tops said with a sneer your make sucks the big dong i shrugged niles knew my make was okay didnt much care if tops and the other arties did i dont know i said maybe because mona isnt a big dong like you sneered tess she helped whenever the boys thought they could gangup on me and monas make is okay youre just scared because niles is doing something bad shut up tops said and turned away tess smiled at me a little i tried to smile back but the symmetry felt off boo tapped me on the arm and i looked down she raised her eyebrows at me then looked at the steps to the street i nodded he went upside for a while hell be fine she didnt look convinced neither was i we held each other and it made the ache a little better i worried sometimes that boo felt that way all the time she was a melodie and had to make just like we poor arties did but nobody ever heard her sing and bang or anything broken little thing made me feel sorry and sad it was a good thing niles took care of her or shed be used up and swept away just like our mossy makes nobody went home to their elderfolk while we waited for niles to come back that was a rule if niles never came back then we wouldnt have to nobody wanted to see the meanies anyway they had us made and then hated us afterwards which wasnt fair all arties know you love the things you make no matter what but elderfolk were justplains all grown up and they didnt make any sense at all some of the younger arties started to talk about going back but we older arties who knew niles better said no that wed wait three days passed before niles came back it was dark and everyone was sleeping but me because little boos music itched in my brain he came in carrying big boxes and i cried big tears of happy at that hed brought some new supplies and wed be making again in no time flat i watched him for a while carrying in box after box and finally i fell asleep it felt good knowing he was back in the morning laughing woke me up i turned to see what arty could be so rude niles was sitting in a corner with his back to the room playing with something he never laughed when he was making so he had to be playing i left boo to cuddle into the pile of other arties and crawled over to see what niles was doing he had some weird gadget a silver disk covered in letterbuttons and it was projecting onto the wall some kind of tridimensional animalthing it had three legs and one arm and was galloping in place like a creature with three legs would a kind of hop between steps i laughed too when i looked at the weird little thing what is it i asked in a whisper i made it just now niles said its complicated but the brainiacs on pstreet showed me how i only sort of made it its just pretend now but i can send it into the factories he pointed at the stack of boxes next to us then itll make for real wow i said i couldnt think of anything else to speak niles was like that always thinking ahead of the elderfolk and the tin men does it help the ache i asked my pulse racing i almost felt good even with the hurt just at the chance ayep he said feels good like sculpting sort of but you can paint on them too paint in texture scales hair you know all sorts of things but theres a sense to it like how you know good colors going together yes like that you cant just do anything he said he nodded and pressed a large button on the disk words came up and the creature disappeared whats that say i asked dunno he answered but the brainiacs said if i push that button the factory will make a humming sound came just then from one of the boxes and then the other arties started to stir and wake here niles said handing me the disk ill teach you how it works we have to teach everybody the tin men cant kill animals besides pests you know we pretendmade all sorts of little creatures on the screen then pushed the button that made for real the little factories we set up in one corner of the station and they hummed and popped out little eggs of all rainbowcolors every few hours niles sent the little kids out onto the street with the eggs to hide them where the tin men and elderfolk wouldnt see the eggs will hatch and our makes will come out alive and the tin men cant do anything about it he said his eyes were shiny it made me ache a little and i worried that maybe pretendmaking didnt count for arties but niles was always making me ache a little like that especially when he left it scared me that maybe i was like little boo and something wasnt right with me bum batch pretty soon we started seeing the little animals around the city they werent good makes though they stumbled into traffic sometimes and got splattered they fell off of roofs got tangled in wires and cooked like bad soytein on a hot plate they werent there in the head and they starved not a lot of food out in the city just for the taking they couldnt take chits and buy it we were stumped the tin men werent doing anything but our little makes couldnt last on their own i hated so much seeing them laying dead in gutters in the street drains their little selves were all over stinking and falling apart like windworn paints i have an idea i said to niles after thinking as hard as i could go to the brainiacs and ask them for help they will tell us what we can do right niles thought for a moment and shook his head no this is an arty problem but arties are too stupid i said raising my voice so everyone could hear it niles bared his teeth at me and i cried out scrambling away from him arties arent stupid he shouted arties arent stupid but we are i said to my own head we are not smart like brainiacs i ran away back to my stupid elderfolks but even they were smarter than arties i was drawing on the sidewalk just to ease the ache when niles found me i had stolen a little bit of charcoal from the crematorium and kept it in my pocket i only used it when things were really bad really really and now i didnt know what to do your repeating patterns niles said what do you call them i shrugged cant think of words for it maybe your brainiac friends could guess he frowned they could but who cares he sat beside me and took out a piece of old paper it had shapes drawn on it like my patterns only more random i was fascinated where did you get that i asked i reached out to touch it and he let me take it i held it up to the light the little bits were a faded green like the mossinacan plants he said theyre called plants plants i said snazzy ayap he said the old world was full of them who told you that i asked the brainiacs he said i stood up and hugged him tight make some plants with the factories he said theyll be pretty so we did this time the eggs were smaller and we hid everywhere in the city niles helped me to make them he understood the rightness of the animal bits but to me plants made more sense they didnt move except to stretch for sun or rain wherever you put them thats where they stayed just like murals the ache almost went allaway for a while the little planteggs hatched and grew quickly all around the city we made so much more of them and they lasted good the tin men noticed them everywhere arties were seeing the tin men staring at the little plants growing bigger every day they didnt know what to do but all arties knew what happened then the tin men asked the elderfolk while i made plants the other arties made more little animals some that flew in the air and some that could squeeze into tiny little cracks this time the little animals didnt die they grew bigger too like the plants had to come first for them to work niles said it was a secret why and wouldnt tell me which made me angry but the ache was staying away so long as i made my plants so i couldnt fight him over it boo spent more time with me too when i was making plants she loved their shapes and would smile and point and smile whenever we found another one growing up in the cracks out on the street one night i even woke up and saw her toying with one of the silver disks when she thought no one was watching the shapes on the screen were colorful but they had no coherence no pattern sad sad little boo she wanted to make plants and animals too but she was just a melodie and she couldnt make i was in the white of making when i heard the shouts coming down the stairs tin men coming tin men they cried theres a brainiac with them zinger shouted everyone scattered like mossdust on the breeze no direction to go just bumping around in the station only one way out up and the tin men had it blocked i took the silver disk i was using and one of the factories and pushed them into the flooded part of the station then tried to run for the door the tin men galomped down the steps carefully using their long arms to steady themselves on the uneven steps they had three brainiacs with them each held their big heads in their hands and moaned from all the effort of walking brainiacs didnt like to do that if they could help it the tin man corralled us arties up into a tight bunch and others stole away with the disks and factories one sheriff tin man goldcoated and round prodded the brainiacs and they pointed at niles all three at the same time then the tin men took niles too we arties tried to fight then and boo did too but were not made for fighting and we all hurt ourselves on the cold sleek shells of the tin men when niles was gone they let us ago and left following the sheriff we wailed and cried doomed topps moaned doomed the ache wasnt over us yet but it would be now every time we find something new to make they take it away tess said dabbing tears from her eyes the tin men dont care zinger said of course they dont i said they only do what the elderfolk tell them to do and the elderfolk dont care they dont care about anything but themselves we have to get niles back topps said starting to cry again arties are too dumb on their own too dumb i snapped up at that no i said arties arent dumb niles said doesnt matter anymore zinger said niles is gone to the pokeypokey theyll never let him out then we get him out said a tiny voice i had never heard before it halfsung the words just like a melodie did whenever it talked but the sound was wrong harsh around the edges it was a bad make boo didnt look scared she was younger than all of us but she wasnt scared everyone tried to wipe up tears then just so they didnt look like little babies when the real baby didnt even cry boo can talk zinger said after a long silence of course she can talk i snapped but she didnt want to before now this is important boo nodded hurts my she touched her throat not made right she winced from the effort of talking i grabbed her and held her close boo is right i said we arties have to get niles back but how asked tess i didnt know i looked at boo boo didnt know well ask the brainiacs i said then it was what niles had done and they owed us after turning niles in the brainiacs spent most of their times at the libraries and there was one on pstreet that i had remembered because it had pretty statues on each side of its big doors boo and i marched inside past the tin men that watched the door and inside before they could get a good sniff of us the first brainiac we saw we cornered against a shelf she was locked into her little wheelchair and couldnt move very fast tell us how to rescue niles i demanded boo made menacing gestures with her hands that she must have learned from watching thicknecks who said the brainiac oh that arty kid with the stolen gengineering kits hes gone uptower to see council the elderfolk are real pissed about that little scheme of his not even a platoon of thicknecks could get in there the tower is crawling with tin men i shuddered the council were the elderfolk to the elderfolk they told everyone what to do if they had niles then there really was no hope the aching bent me over in two like a folded piece of paper boo shook her head and pointed at the brainiac i guessed at what she was trying to say and fought through my pains youre smarter than arties and the justplains the council is just a bunch of justplains all grown up you can help us rescue him i said not really believing but hoping the brainiac sighed and nodded i can think of dozens thousands of ways to free your friend but logistically you arties cant manage it whats logistically i said tools resources she said rolling her eyes youre just a bunch of stupid beatniks maybe if you still had some gengineering factories you could make something but i hid one i said quickly under the water when the tin men came well then youve ruined it its no good but you could fix it boo rasped in singsong the brainiac nodded i could fix it but then youd need to make something that could get you into the tower without having to fight tin men and thatd be almost impossible said the brainiac making is what arties do you fix the factory and well do the rest i said i could see the shapes forming already my fingers itched to work the disk fine but this makes the arties and the brainiacs even she said deal i said the tin men were killing all the animals and plants in the city with ick someone must have changed their orders they werent supposed to do that it hurt us arties to know but it kept the tin men busy while we made in shifts with the factory we had a plan one that the brainiacs thought would get us all tossed in the pokey but boo and i both believed it would work the other arties made animals that would go into the tower and distract and i worked on special plants with exploding seeds weapons like thicknecks used on one another we tested the seeds on a lone tin man and it stunned it we smashed it up good while it was down the brainiac who repaired our factory met us in the shadows outside the tower before we launched our attack she pressed a sheet of paper into my hands one last little bit of help the brainiac said this will show you where theyre keeping your friend why i asked the brainiac laughed you have no idea how bored we are your little creations are an adhoc ecosystem springing up all over the city weve been studying things your creations are immensely complex and function cohesively even though they are artificial this bit of information has vast implications on issues such as the jungian overmind the brainiac blinked and cut off her speech i hadnt understood a word of it only that they liked our makes that made me feel good sorry anyway we hope you can make more it was niles idea i said without him we arties are too stupid to figure anything out the brainiac frowned i wouldnt be so sure about that this plan of yours might actually work and it looks like your friends are ready us arties were gathering from all over the city each had a wild little animal frantic and tugging at a leash of plantrope each carried a satchel of bombseeds across the corner a few thicknecks had gathered they made catcalls and threats but none dared to cross the street i could hardly believe my eyes everyone waited for my command i hesitated if i said so we arties would all go home to our elderfolk maybe some would get supplies to ease the ache and maybe some wouldnt and they might die or we could attack the tower and some would die and the rest would end up in the pokeypokey or we might win and get back niles and all his crazy ideas for making and it was my decision little mona whose art nobody understood nobody but niles i gave the word the arties rushed the tower tin men spilled out from the doors and seeds flew from everywhere they crashed to the ground in beautiful purple sparks and we swept past them inside we arties freed the frantic little animals and they ran free the tin men couldnt decide whether to chase us or chase the animals and split up i led us arties up up following the drawings on the paper we pushed past many many tin men leaving them smoking behind us and finally we got to the end place and it was a place we all remembered a birthing lab cold white and metal and there were justplains the birthers watching niles and he was sleeping in the tank just like a baby arty we scared away the justplains they tried to tell us to stop that they needed niles but we needed him more so we took him and we left we didnt go back to the station we found a new hiding place in the basement of a power station and there we waited for niles to wake up and we cried all of us arties all as one wed done it but niles wouldnt wake up he wasnt dead we knew that because he was breathing at first no one would leave him but even arties get hungry and so we started watching in shifts taking turns every one wanted to be the arty who was there when he woke but it was me that was there and it was boo that woke him up she sang it was beautiful even if it was broken the pattern in the sound reminded me of the colors on her screen the sound grew louder as she continued and then i saw that little flying animals had come from the sky and joined her together adding their voices and fixing where hers was broken it must have been the best sound in the world because then finally niles woke up and he smiled heya boo he said you can sing as if he had always known and it wasnt a surprise to him and maybe he did niles was smart especially for an arty then he turned and smiled at me heya mona you rescued me we did i said and the brainiacs hardly helped at all he laughed thats good but ibeen thinking about what you said you right we should ask the brainiacs for help more often arties cant do everything i cried and hugged and cried some more niles is getting better he told me the secret of how the animals work and at first it made me sad but we can eat the plants and the animals too so we dont have to go back to the elderfolk for chits were staying here in our hiding places and were sharing what we know with the brainiacs theyre slipping away from their elderfolk too we need the thicknecks help too and the brainiacs are talking to them for us thicknecks listen to them at least sometimes there are plants and animals everywhere now and they grow too fast for the tin men to stop them and the little flying ones they all sing such sweet songs boo and niles and i sit and listen to them for hours boo says that she only made some of them and doesnt know where the rest of them come from the brainiacs have theories but we dont understand them and we still make more plants and more animals each day with more stolen factories the ache is still there but its not the same its the ache you feel when things are good not when things are bad and thats the kind of ache that makes you feel good niles says he understands it but i dont believe him nobody understands that not even the smartest brainiac of them all jordans waterhammer by joe mastroianni joe mastroiannis short fiction has appeared in realms of fantasy and tomorrow speculative fiction hes currently working on a novel that he describes as a psychic antarctic love story hes done five deployments to antarctica and two to the south pole where he worked on instrumentation for climatic research hes been a silicon valley executive for twentyfive years and says hes currently writing and building tesla coils most of the worst atrocities in human history spring out of the dehumanization of particular groups germanys war crimes during world war ii are some of the most horrifying examples with over million people put to death not as individual humans but as faceless jews and gypsies and antiestablishment criminals but genocide isnt the only crime people commit when they strip the humanity from each other apartheid came from the same ugly source slavery child labor and even indentured servitude also depend upon devaluing a human being its sickening to imagine a society that encourages people to see a man merely as a tool not even worthy of a name our next story gives us just such a society the workers in this world fight to teach each other a man could be worth as much as the ore they work to mine not because a man can be bought and sold for a particular price but because a human being is valuable in and of himself here is a world without the right to liberty the pursuit of happiness or even life itself after all how can a tool be free the gaffer tripped he fell into jordans blade and was cut in half with the ore pile perhaps it was confusion the boy may have had his hearing confusion in the mine was common among the young men who could hear the crash of shovels against rock the impact of turbopressured water against stone and the roar of the loader engines jordan felt the slight hesitation as his machine sliced through the soft human body on its way to the heavy pile of ore a less experienced man may never have noticed the barely perceptible difference between the hydraulic shovels passage through air and its passage through human flesh and bone jordan typed a command on his console he marked the ore load dirty the ore would have to be washed clean of blood and bone before it reached the refinery he ordered another gaffer he received an acknowledgment for the ore load but the tone sounded before his gaffer order was processed he made a mental note to reorder a gaffer in the morning at least the dirty load wouldnt be charged against him the lights in his cab went dark his control sticks grew sluggish then immobile in his hands as the hydraulics of the huge mining machine wound down steel bolts retracted with a jolt and the unlocked cab door swung open a crack he could smell the air fill his cab the atmosphere in the mine was damp and full of dust the filters in the loader kept the air clean for him to breathe but every time the cab door opened he could smell the sweat of the men amid the rock dust and steam it reminded him of his boyhood jordan unlatched the control connector and pulled it from his neck he switched his connector from cable to radio control then he stepped from the cab into the dimly lit mine he got in line with the other men and moved down the tunnel toward the elevators to the dormitories the last load of ore lay still in his shovel he saw the gaffers hand poking out of it as he passed the front of his machine as they walked they passed through larger and larger tunnels until they arrived in the main gallery where hundreds of miners stood in singlefile lines waiting to board the elevators to the dormitories he joined the sea of white helmets and blue overalls and kept his eye on the number lit above the elevator door to his home jordan felt a tingling on his neck as his audio monitor sprang to life his ears had been damaged long before by the continuous din of the mines time as a gaffer and waterhammer had left him deaf he heard the control voice from within his brain the signal came through the contact on his neck and was relayed to the probes that had been embedded in his brain when he was sent to the mines loader jforjordan group a tons on a team three one neutralized load credited at half rate said the voice the tingling stopped control had deducted for the dirty load but they hadnt yet processed the gaffer request he would have to take the deduction for that on tomorrows work he wondered if he had enough credit for a few hours in the sunroom a man in line for elevator two fell to his knees as the other men stepped away from him they created a zone of emptiness between him and the community jordan felt the tingling again in his neck step away from loader sforsolomon group k said the control voice jordan took a small step away from the man who solemnly raised his hand a man in white overalls and a blue helmet approached solomon jordan felt the tingling in his neck and heard the controller say loader solomon is in violation of quota as required by ordinance jordan didnt bother to watch it happened every work period there was something about termination that made him feel unwell he imagined the maintenance man pressing the particle gun to solomons temple there would be no struggle as solomon dropped dead to the floor the tingling in jordans neck stopped out of the corner of his eye he saw the maintenance vehicle pick up the body for disposal the doors to elevator six slid open and thirtyone men stepped into the car when they were in the doors slid shut jordan walked two steps forward and stopped he felt someone press two fingers into the small of his back the sensation was brief but unmistakable he kept his eyes fixed ahead he recognized the sign the silent language of the deaf the language of men it was the sign for i understand jordan let his arms hang at his side he made a fist with his left hand and held out two fingers in acknowledgment he wondered what understanding waterhammer had come to jordan walked along the catwalk until he came to thomass sleeping chamber without looking he forced himself into the upright sarcophagus thomas was already inside the chamber barely big enough for one thomas exhaled the door swung shut and compressed jordans naked body against the other mans in total darkness the two men stood compressed chesttochest jordan could feel thomass ribs smashing painfully against his he could feel the vibration of his heartbeat the two men interlaced their legs and their arms they stood compressed cheektocheek as the sarcophagus sealed the last inch shut thomas strained his neck to touch jordans jordan could feel thomass breath against his face with all the strength he could muster jordan pushed his head past thomass the control connectors on their necks touched the compartment rotated to the horizontal as the door bolts slammed into place locking them in carefully they synchronized their breathing jordan exhaled while the other man inhaled your body is getting large loader jordan thomass voice appeared in his head as the voice of control had for years i killed timer matthew simply by growing too much for my lessons im afraid you will do the same to me if you can finish the lessons soon you wont have to worry about that youll live happily to full termination age thomas exhaled as jordan took a breath dont breathe so heavily the monitor will register abnormally high oxygen consumption and control will think im sick okay said jordan he tried to calm himself he was eager to get to the lesson thomas said lets begin then the words floated in jordans mind in the beginning was the word and from the word came the change jordan repeated what thomas said he visualized the words and imagined them appearing in thomass mind much as thomass words appeared voiceless inside his own head have you found someone to pass the book to asked thomas yes jordan replied thats good very good does he have caring i think so said jordan and how could you tell jordan hesitated hes from farm iowa hes first one ive ever met good said thomas they are very smart in iowa i wish i had been bred there did i tell you i was from illinois thats very close to iowa yes you have said jordan he continued the iowa is my waterhammer i terminated a gaffer two months ago the waterhammer used his equipment to try to extract the gaffer from the load he couldnt succeed and he did not i asked him why he tried he said he felt very comfortable with that gaffer he never feared for the safe function of his machine or an error with the gaffer around he said he was afraid the new gaffer wouldnt supply him so much comfort if he has caring said thomas the book will be safe otherwise we will wait many times the length of our lives for this chance to come again such is the way love will save the men i still dont understand love driver thomas none of us do not one of us ever has how do we know it exists driver thomas took a deep breath forcing jordan to exhale then wince against the pain of thomas ribs crushing against his thomas said we have only the word of timer andrew who visited the surface for a short time and brought the book into the world maybe timer andrew was defective maybe he misunderstood what he saw on the surface timer matthew told me that andrew was very smart he said that andrew was able to refine the ore to purity at volumes never achieved before he is the only man who has been allowed to live beyond his termination date did he know love did timer matthew thomas said timer matthew never completely understood the word like most of us he believed the book held simple commands but he couldnt understand them he read the book many times but there were so many unknown words all he could do was give the book to me and pass the knowledge of timer andrew love will save all men jordan said the command without feeling what good is it what good is it if we dont know what it means we have our lives we work and are terminated what else is there why do we need to be saved what does it mean to be saved timer andrew saw many things on the surface he saw many men with functions he didnt understand he wondered if the purpose of men was wrong perhaps the purpose should be changed this is what he meant when he said we should be saved jordan swallowed and waited for his time to breathe driver thomas he said how can the purpose of men be wrong men live to mine the ore we work well and are promoted to new functions each function is more challenging and exciting than the one before when we do very well we have the sunroom we have our lives and our rewards why isnt that enough thomas lay silently catching his breath timing his breathing with jordans thomas said i dont know loader jordan to me there seems perfection in our system i remember my training at illinois breeding farm i was excited to come down to the world to become a gaffer when i was a young gaffer i dreamed of operating the hammer from the hammer to the loader from the loader to the transport train now as a transport driver i want nothing more than to attain the timer position how i want to schedule the ore arrival at the plant to plan the flow through the refinery many times ive thought all i desire is to perform the timer function for one work period before im terminated i have only work periods left the job of a driver is not dangerous you are not expected to die not like the poor gaffers surely youll last to be promoted before long but the word said thomas the word of timer andrew and the book he brought into the world make me feel ill i feel strange in my thinking as if im diseased i believe the word of timer andrew is right i feel my belief in him as i feel my desire to become a timer i know i must follow his instructions but i cant understand them jordan could feel the need for air press against his abdomen he tried to take a deep breath but succeeded only in hurting thomas he could feel the muscles in thomass neck tighten as he strained to breathe another millimeter in the chest loader thomas and ill suffocate for sure im not as strong as you are i will try to breathe calmly said jordan here is the lesson for today thomas said this is something timer matthew told me when i was a loader timer andrew said that on the surface men are not bred on farms men are bred from each other their love creates men jordan breathed deeply again and thomas strained to hold air in his lungs as jordan compressed him hard loader jordan please thomas said in pain those words make no sense at all thomas waited for the pain to subside before he spoke again timer andrew said that all men on the surface were different from the men in the world each mans body has a different shape their skin is not smooth like ours they have something like clothing growing from their bodies as we grow arms and legs its like the strands from torn work clothes he said that some had an additional limb with which they could produce love others had no additional limb but had a body shape different from both the men with the limb and the men like us in the world when these two types of surface men touched they could produce love this love produces other surface men loader jordan lay still imagining the grotesque shapes assumed by the surface men i dont expect you to understand it jordan timer andrew said we need only keep the word alive and the day will come when a man will understand he will teach the others suddenly jordans memory brightened he felt the poke in his back my waterhammer he started but there was a strong vibration as the sleeping chamber rotated vertical and bolts on the cover to the coffin slammed open the sleep period had ended the word lives in me thomas said quickly the word lives in me jordan repeated the coffin door swung open and jordan dashed into the flow of men as they moved down the catwalk to the dressing area jordan joined them in dim yellow light no one noticed when driver thomas emerged from the same sleep chamber only seconds later the waterhammer found a rich vein of ore and jordan was happy he was sure to double his tonnage for the day his time in the sunroom would be increased tenfold there would be no reward for the waterhammer or young gaffer they could only hope to be promoted to loader someday then they would receive a name and the privilege of reward for tonnage logged there was a new gaffer that day he had come from farm iowa and he treated his job with the enthusiasm and ignorance typical of the young boys they threw their tiny bodies into the paths of the great machines they pulled impurities from the ore and performed perfunctory maintenance on the machines that bored into the rock they followed the waterhammer deeper and deeper into the ore veins carrying their tool a heavy crowbar they kept the hoses and cables that fed the machines out of the way of the loaders and other waterhammers jordans waterhammer had just been promoted from gaffer he was young enough in his job to be excited about his first position operating the heavy machinery then he trained his blade of high pressure water on the rock and cut the ore like a surgeon removing a tumor waterhammer had vision it was as if he would see the ore behind the layers of worthless rock waterhammers hoses snagged on the growing pile of hewn rock and the helmeted gaffer ran out in front of the loader to unsnag them jordan stopped his machine just inches from the child gaffer watch where youre going jordan said into his communicator the child stood and pressed his hand to his neck he squinted the pain in his ears would be intense for several weeks it would take months before his hearing would decay to a level that would allow him to work comfortably in the mine soon he would be completely deaf and rely entirely on his implant for aural input the crashing of the machinery pounded his young ears and made it difficult for him to understand the voice that came directly from within his brain gaffer clear the waterhammer and get out of the way of the loader jordan ordered finally understanding the boy pulled the hoses free and ran to a safety along the edge of the freshly hewn tunnel in his plastic armor waterhammer walked forward several steps and trained the liquid blade on the ore vein in the wall in front of him from safe within the loaders cab jordan could see rocks steam and pebbles burst out from in front of the man jordan scooped up several shovel loads and placed them into the waiting train carrier he calculated the tonnage in his mind he planned his time in the sunroom first he would lay naked on his back on the table and absorb the warmth on his face then he would roll to his stomach and feel his back muscles loosen a flash of light brought him back to his senses the gaffer burst out in front of the loader the childs body flashed bright in the loaders headlights like a strobe as the kid ran past jordan jammed on the brakes i may not be able to avoid terminating if you continue this behavior jordan said into the communicator he gunned the loaders engine and released the air brake as the tires began to roll the kid ran in front of the loaders shovel blade and stopped he stood staring at jordan his eyes bored into jordans mind jordan pressed his foot onto the brake pedal and slowed the machine the shovel inched toward the child get out of the way gaffer i need to collect the load jordan calculated the mass of the ore already freed by waterhammer he would need every moment of the work period to get all that rock into the delivery train his foot lightened on the brake the kid stood his ground jordan stared into the kids eyes from the cab he released the brake and the huge machine lurched forward the young gaffer didnt move instead he held his hands forward toward jordan he held his hands palms up and cupped them as if he was holding something invisible the loader jolted to a halt at first jordan couldnt figure why he checked the engine statistics automatically expecting to see a mechanical failure there was none it was only when he looked back toward the gaffer that he felt the tension in his leg his foot shook as he pressed down on the brake pedal a feeling he had never felt before rippled down his spine why had he stopped the load was dry and waiting raw tonnage for the taking time in the sunroom the kid turned slowly and knelt as the gaffer sank below the shovel jordan put the machine in reverse and pulled backward until he could see him again he stood on the brake pulling himself up out of his seat and aimed the loaders headlights on the gaffer the boy knelt aside the waterhammer who had gotten tangled in his hoses he lay amid the rock his equipment damaged a thin stream of blood running onto the mine floor beside him jordan typed a command into his console damage to the waterhammer please repair he waited a few seconds for the request to transmit the response came replace or repair jordan thought he could have a replacement in under seven minutes he could drive over the gaffer and the waterhammer and collect the load and no one would question his decision to terminate the men hed tell control to wash the ore theyd deduct half the tonnage and replace the crew it could take hours to repair the waterhammer jordans legs shook as he held his leg tense on the brake pedal he felt himself needing air but he didnt know why he typed the word repair the word acknowledged appeared on the console jordan secured the loader in place the gaffer turned and looked at him jordan held his hand up to the cab window for the gaffer to see the sign two fingers then he waited for the work period to end the men queued up in a single file row and removed their coveralls and hard hats they stood naked and hairless shivering in the mines damp cool air one by one they got onto the conveyer belt that pulled them through the washing and feeding facility as jordan stood waiting for an empty place on the belt he felt the poke in his back again jordan held two fingers down at his side as he raised his leg to mount the belt he looked quickly toward waterhammer he held up two fingers in v then rotated his hand to the horizontal the sign for sleep then he lay on his back on the belt and felt straps seal over him warm water coated his body brushes scoured his skin he could feel his abdomen shrink as a robot arm attached a tube to a connection at his waist and removed the liquid and solid wastes from his gut he heard the control voice say stop breathing as the belt pulled him into the cleaning solution his heart rate quickened he thought he felt the belt stop as it had when he was a young gaffer ten men were killed when the belt broke and they were strapped beneath the surface of the cleaning solution he had just been immersed he strained against the straps and dislocated his shoulders he survived by withstanding the pain and forcing his head out of the solution to the air one wash period in thousands the memory stayed with him he imagined it would be with him forever his desire for air increased with his fear until he felt he would be forced to inhale the solution but his body broke water into the air and he took his first breath with a gasp a robot arm connected a tube to the feeding connector mounted in his side he felt his stomach fill with the warm nutrient then the tube was disconnected and he was moved into a large gallery filled with men naked he walked up the metal stairs and across the steel catwalk to his sleeping chamber he felt the tingling in his neck as the control voice said enter the chamber he remained standing enter the chamber the voice said again he could feel the vibration in the catwalk as someone walked close behind him he turned and saw the waterhammer jordan turned quickly and put his arms around him hugged the muscular man tightly against his body and pulled him into the upright sleeping chamber waterhammer resisted for a moment then he realized what jordan was trying to do and he yielded he winced as the door slammed closed and compressed his head and body against jordans jordan moved his head to the side and waterhammers cheek fell against his they interlaced their legs and arms jordan turned his head he pressed the control connector on the side of his neck toward waterhammers but he couldnt make contact waterhammer was nervous he pulled in air and wouldnt exhale jordan was could only take quick shallow breaths breathe out jordan said with his mouth hoping waterhammer was young enough to have some of his hearing exhale or ill die waterhammer exhaled and quickly pulled in air during the brief moment in which there was enough room for his chest to expand jordan inhaled then he exhaled again jordan felt waterhammers heartbeat slow as the young man began to breathe calmly jordan took in air he concentrated on the timing of waterhammers breathing letting the young man breathe freely while he paced himself waterhammer shifted his head slightly in the coffin and jordan was could press his neck against the young mans and make connection this is how we pass the word said jordan forming the words in his mind it was time for you to learn loader jordan thank you for not terminating me the young man spoke through his connector jordan ignored him he said you said you understand the instructions yes oh yes i do said waterhammer when i first read the manual it didnt make any sense i read the commands over and over soon i understood what they meant what do you think they are jordan asked they are instructions for operating our lives maybe they were written a long time ago it refers to positions and machinery i dont understand are we supposed to follow those instructions loader jordan this seems like an unauthorized manual i think i will be section sixtytwoed if control finds out ive learned these commands that manual is a book waterhammer its a manual from the surface it was written by surface men for surface machinery and positions many work periods ago timer andrew visited the surface and brought the book down to us many men have read it but none of us understand it the work it describes it hard for us to imagine this is a surface manual asked waterhammer i remember the surface i was on the surface when i was at the breeding farm it was a horrible place strange machines no work why would we want to keep words from the surface here in the world jordan said you know the words of men dont you yes of course we all know them i learned them at the breeding farm no jordan said not the words of instruction not the reading for manuals and commands the words of men jordan groped with his right hand and found waterhammers hand next to his he put his hand under waterhammers and made a fist he extended three fingers in the sign for be still then he made the sign for run a single extended finger you know these jordan said i know you do yes said waterhammer i learned those at the farm too jordan said these are the words of men control does not understand these words the words in the book and the words i give you now are also the words of men timer andrew told us perhaps timer andrew was defective many men thought that but his word requires my agreement the word requires agreement from many of us today i ordered your repair because the gaffer would not yield to the loader gaffers action required my agreement he expected you would drive through us said waterhammer if he did why did he put his body in front of me jordan asked waterhammer was silent he let two breaths pass between them then he said i know that gaffer from the breeding farm he always kept his body close to mine when we learned he sat in proximity when we were washed and fed he stood behind me in the queue he was always close to me in the elevators now he is assigned to you as i am and he remains close to me i think he follows commands from the book have you shown him the book no said waterhammer why do you think he follows the commands in the book if he has never seen the instructions i think the instructions are in him i think he has been programmed jordan said timer andrew said some instructions were in all of us not just the instructions for work to gaff to hammer to load to drive and to time but further instruction information we know but do not act on he said one instruction above all would help the men its the instruction to love i have read that instruction many times still i dont completely understand it but i feel the instruction in my body i do too said jordan and that is why i have chosen you to carry the word of timer andrew in secret you have shown caring caring it is a word of timer andrew you have done your work with energy that comes from your feeling you smile when the work is going well i know you can feel your actions you feel them as i yes i do feel my work said waterhammer each of us learns the word of timer andrew and does his best to understand it before you are terminated you will choose another man and give him the word i will teach you how to find someone in the mean time you must know that it is not for you to understand andrew you need only pass the words to another timer andrew said it was important that the word remains alive in men the salvation of the men depends on the word when all men know the word men will be saved saved why do we need to be saved waterhammer asked i dont know said jordan perhaps in time one of us will know for now you must keep the word to yourself control will terminate you for having heard it they will terminate you for simply mentioning the name andrew loaders are no longer given that name so you may never mention it if they find you they will terminate all of us i will keep the word said waterhammer and when you are promoted to loader and are given your name you will be given the power to terminate men and then you will pass the word to another whom you can watch and if you feel he will slip if you feel he will make a mistake and utter the word of andrew to any other you will terminate him before he takes a step forward these instructions will not be repeated i understand loader jordan very good now lets begin jordan removed his clothing and stood before the massive doors the bolts on the doors slid open jordan could feel the vibration in his feet as the giant door swung wide there was a vibration in his neck as the controller spoke loader a twentypercent reward period beginning immediately had he retrieved the entire load drilled by waterhammer he could have expected a tenfold period for exceeding his quota by a wide margin he had simply let the loader idle while the maintenance crew collected waterhammer and took him for repair when the work period had ended he found himself only slightly over his quota performance worthy of only the smallest period allotted he would spend the first fifth of the work day in the sunroom the remainder of the day he would spend at his station remembering the bright warmth he remembered pieces of an instruction the book thomas had given him tiger burning bright what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry but he had only been taught enough to read the machine manuals what was a tiger what symmetry should he fear as the door opened the light from inside escaped into the hallway where it touched him there was warmth and white he never knew his skin could be so white as he stepped into the room and felt the light engulf him as if he had fallen into liquid it was a feeling he remembered from somewhere long before he hardly noticed the massive door swing shut behind him there was a man lying naked on a flat tables arranged along the walls of the square white room on the ceiling was a round white light source the man sensed the vibration of the door closing he slowly lifted his head and looked at jordan his eyes were openings onto a cold emptiness jordan hardly recognized him his skin so white eyes so black and deep he raised a fist and signed the mens greeting to his mentor driver thomas thomas sat up on the table and motioned for jordan to sit beside him as jordan sat thomas reached over and put his hand around the back of jordans neck he jumped off the table stood in front of him and pulled jordans head toward him he leaned forward until jordans chin was over his shoulder then he pressed jordans neck against his touching his control connector against jordans instinctively jordan pulled away dont be afraid driver thomas said a voice coming from the center of jordans head control doesnt monitor here jordan relaxed and leaned into driver thomas driver thomas said but we wont have much time if the door opens well be on monitor theyll sixtytwo us jordan tried to pull away to look into driver thomass face but thomas kept jordans neck pinned in an iron grip why are you doing this said jordan last lesson jordan said thomas control knows about the book even now maintenance is searching for it they searched the k group and suspected loader solomon thats why he was terminated when they couldnt find the book they terminated everyone i saw the order pass for three hundred replacements an entire group jordan three hundred men three hundred lives waterhammer didnt show the book to anyone jordan said he felt a tightness grow in his chest it was a pain like the one he had felt the day before when stared down the shovel of the loader at gaffer and waterhammer on the mine floor i have to give you all lessons at once now thomas said there are many books many carry the word my waterhammer said he understands said jordan love is the lives of the men said thomas does he understand that jordan looked down at the muscles in thomass back then he stared out at the blank wall and the empty tables in the sunroom the warm white light loosened the muscles in his back and arms the lives of the men said jordan my life all life the decision to repair rather than to replace the worth of a man to himself worth of life as that of the ore men worth as ore on the surface timer andrew learned that men are bred from other men they value their own lives as reward love is the value of mens lives it is somehow like time in the sunroom like promotion it is the value of men for other men in his mind jordan saw the gaffer kneeling beside the wounded waterhammer he remembered the boys eyes as he threatened with the shovel of his machine why hadnt the boy moved my gaffer said jordan last work period he prevented me from taking a dirty load waterhammer was injured i should have taken him with the ore how did gaffer stop you asked thomas he stood in front of my machine why didnt you simply take the ore with them both i dont know said jordan he looked at me as if as if he could damage my machine with his eyes now you are seeing what i see said thomas there are instructions not learned but known the gaffer knows without teaching i had hoped you could come to this conclusion as well but time is short thomas pulled back from jordan and took the mans head in his hands he pulled jordans face toward his and pressed his lips against jordans then he leaned aside and made connection with his neck again that is the sign for love that is the symbol of the value of mans life they felt a vibration that could only mean the door was opening the period is not over said jordan control must monitor this room after all said thomas scanning the blank walls thomas pointed and jordan spotted an imperfection in the seamless walls a spot slightly darker than the brilliant white all around jordan felt his heart race his breathing deepened and he felt the white of the room intensify he felt he could hear with his ears again its as if the word itself is more powerful then the men said thomas they saw the dark crack between the wall and the door as the massive hinge swung open what do we do jordan said he looked back at the door then quickly touched his neck connector to thomass these are the final words of timer andrew said thomas the last lesson remember this and run control is on the surface they cannot terminate all of us jordan felt thomas press his hands into his back he could feel the warmth from thomass body the vibration of thomass heart the rhythm of thomass breathing thomas continued have the men switch their control connections from radio to cable go to your machine and destroy the yellow control box then it too will ignore signals from control thomas grabbed jordans arm and pulled him to the center of the room as the door stopped in its travel and the mobile particle weapon appeared in the doorway jordan felt a tingling in his neck as thomas pulled him close for the last time thomas embraced jordan and made connection he said timer andrew walked out he walked out of the mine and they didnt stop him he worked for them on the surface and they gave him time he worked for them in the mine and they gave him more time now i will give you time then thomas put both his hands on jordans chest and pushed him away surprised jordan fell to the floor he heard the control voice driver tforthomas group m and loader jforjordan group in violation of quota as required by ordinance thomas quickly he raised his fist and thrust one finger into the air as jordan looked up from the floor jordan remembered the sign instinctively he had seen it as a boy at the breeding farm his muscles tensed as if he had been programmed as the particle weapon charged he propelled himself through the narrow darkness between the machine and the door from the white sunroom to the dark of the mine he could feel the burning backscatter on his legs as he pulled himself through the gap the beam blast ricocheted off the rear wall of the room and tore through the same space he claimed for himself he didnt turn back outside he grabbed his work suit and put it on with his helmet he stepped into his boots and ran down the catwalk to the elevators he reached the cars leading to the mine entrance and watched the lights flash as the elevator rose to meet him he felt tired and he didnt know why the air had grown thick it was hard to breathe the elevator arrived and he entered the car with another shift the weight in the car was offbalance and the doors would not close slowly he edged his way past the thirtyone men in the car when he neared the front he placed his hands on the back of the man in front of him with a spark of thought he pushed the startled man clear of the car and out into the empty gallery the elevator sensed the change in weight the doors closed and they began to descend jordan felt a tingling in his neck then he heard the control voice stand clear of loader jforjordan group a the men in the car pressed themselves into the walls of the car clearing a space around him as the elevator came to a halt as the door opened jordan could see the metallic gleam of the particle weapon stationed at the elevator door he thought of the hot beam he could see the warning lights on the unit make the spectral shift from green to red as it charged he remembered the ricochet from the strike that had killed driver thomas only moments before the doors opened completely and the machine inched forward to fill the chamber with its deadly radiation jordan dove toward the machine he clawed at the cables on its exposed surface and pulled himself past it and out of the elevator he stood behind the machine and turned briefly to see the thirty men in blue overalls and white hardhats fall limp in the elevator car jordan ran to his machine he followed the empty mine corridors until he felt vibration in the air he could feel the rumbling in his feet the pressure waves in the air pounded against his chest as he neared the mine activity he could feel the steam and dust in his face he saw the clouds of yellowgray rock and black ore blasted to dust under the pressure of the waterhammer and the loader suddenly the vibration stopped the men turned as he arrived waterhammer and gaffer stood looking at him as he approached his silent machine he found the heavy gaffers crowbar lying on the ground next to the loader he lifted it as the lights began to flicker jordan leveled the rod at the yellow box mounted on the side of his machine and swung he propelled the heavy iron rod against the yellow box with the vibration of each impact the muscles in his arms tightened bulged and burned like a beam flash he could feel the memory of driver thomas grow like an animal in him its arms and legs pressed outward from his chest it was a cold uncomfortable feeling he imagined the maintenance men lifting thomass limp body and putting it in the disposal chute he could see thomass face limp and expressionless a face that had only moments before told him he was as valuable as the ore he drilled men valued as ore men valued as men the men in the mine watched him then looked upward toward the portable lighting that began to go dark under command from control jordan pulled his body into each crowbar swing he could feel the metal box yield slightly under each blow darkness enveloped them like termination he swung in the blackness remembering where the box had been he could feel it crumpling under the blows of the heavy iron bar suddenly he took a swing and the rod continued farther than it had gone before he dropped the rod and felt the machine he could feel the box dangling from cables connecting it to the loader he grabbed the box and pulled the cables hung firm then he felt arms around his waist he stopped for a moment the arms released him and he felt hands travelling along body up to his shoulders over the ripples in his arms then the hands were on his hands and then they were gone he felt the box move in his hands someone was pulling on it jordan leaned backward and pulled in time with the second pair of hands time after time he pulled until the box came free and he stumbled backward jordan dropped the box and mounted the machine once inside felt along the control console and flipped the switch he felt the vibration in his seat as the loader sprang to life he turned on the head lights and illuminated the mine shaft instinctively he reached for the control socket and slapped it to his neck instead of hearing a hiss of static and the voice from within his head there was silence the gauge and display panels were dark he sat and stared at the men standing in the mine they looked back at him motionless they waited for an action jordan left the cab he went to each man on the floor and pushed the switches on the control connections on their necks to cable without a cable connected they would not hear commands an offense for which they could all be killed waterhammer stood along side the loader looking in his waterknife hung limp around his chest from its straps the gaffer stood holding the crowbar jordan got back into the cab he remembered the tightness he felt in his legs when he stopped the loader in front of the wounded men the feeling returned he thought of thomas he smashed his foot onto the accelerator and turned the machine around he grit his jaws tight he gripped the controls as his palms grew wet and his knuckles faded white and bloodless he felt he was watching someone else jordan aimed the machines shovel at a yellow control box on the wall and drove into it with such force that the metal shovel blade slashed through it and into the soft rock in the wall the gaffers and waterhammers were free there was a burst of white steam from beside the vehicle as waterhammer regained control of his tool gaffer freed the hoses and followed behind as waterhammer aimed his tool forward and leapt onto the tracks for the ore train he stopped turned toward jordan and held his hand up in a fist jordan felt the adrenaline jolt as it hit his bloodstream and scratched energy against his muscles he turned the loader and drove onto the tracks waterhammer nodded and jordan hit the accelerator the loader lurched forward up the tracks toward salvation and the word jordan could see the track appearing from the blackness of the mine shaft as his loader rolled forward he could feel unfamiliar vibrations in his seat he knew a train was coming but he knew there was a vibration within himself as well he imagined the vibration was burning an intensity he had never known in an eye blink an ore train was upon him it plowed at full speed into his shovel and drove the loader backward jordan was thrown out of his seat his body crashed into the gaugepanel and windshield of his cab the loader door flapped open against its hinges he shook his head the pain started as an annoying itch then crescendoed to an intolerable explosion his vision blurred he tried to see out of the front window of the loader wetness dripped from his forehead and stung his eyes through the fog of pain and blood he could see men leaving the train maintenance men surface men men with weapons he heard thomass words they cant terminate us all jordan pushed himself backward onto the seat and smashed his foot down onto the accelerator the loader lurched forward its shovel cut into the small train the train yielded twisting and rolling off the tracks as the shovel mangled the metal in front of it a maintenance man in white overalls and a blue helmet appeared in the loader doorway jordan saw the man level a particle gun toward him there was a blast of white from behind that turned into a dark mist the maintenance man fell from the loader in two pieces as the white blade of water slashed again jordan leaned over and looked out of the loader door the uniformed man had been cut in half his feet and arms twitched as a blotch of dark liquid widened around him jordan had seen so many gaffers and waterhammers in the same condition the sight held no significance to him unconsciously he tapped the command to signify a dirty load there was another burst of white with a single twist of his waist waterhammer had cut across the ranks of men escaping the train then he trained his water blade on the train and sliced across it jordan took a breath and manipulated the loaders controls his mind filled with thomass words as he worked the machine unconsciously he pushed the train pieces aside with his mechanical arms and legs man and machine tiger he thought i am the tiger burning bright his arms and legs shook waterhammer trotted up the tunnel firing his tool as a weapon jordan watched him disappear into the darkness he took a breath and felt the pain in his head sink to his chest and open a void an emptiness opened in him again as he watched the gaffer follow waterhammer up the tunnel freeing the hoses disconnecting and reconnecting them to new water sources as they moved fearful symmetry jordan followed them and kept them in the flaming life of the vehicle headlights waterhammer destroyed the yellow control boxes that he found mounted on the tunnel walls they came to a junction of tunnels where a group of men were returning from a shift at the mine face the men stopped and watched as jordan rolled past he held his fist up with one finger extended run then they were past the junction and back into the shaft jordan rolled forward and upward and suddenly there were men all around waterhammers and gaffers they marched along side jordans loader some were curious and threw question signs in the mens sign language most just followed at each junction in the tunnel they met more men who joined them jordan forgot the pain in his head he wiped the blood from his eyes and kept the headlights from his machine trained forward waterhammer cut into a yellow control box and a connector fell out jordan heard words the voice was the control voice but the words were those of andrew the words of change love will save the men they cant terminate us all he could see the men touch their necks they looked at each other wondering what had happened and he saw the strange connector from the broken box attached to waterhammers neck waterhammers face split wide in a smile jordan saw andrew and thomas in his mind from the pain and the emptiness from the void within him came a spark as warm as the sunroom a spark as warm as life waterhammer quoted andrews book for them to hear i will not cease from mental fight nor shall my sword sleep in my hand till we have built jerusalem in englands green and pleasant land jordan wiped the blood from his eyes and willed his machine forward as the men followed he could feel the vibration of their footsteps as the crowd multiplied and then there was light in the distance it was a light he had never seen before bright and blue white it didnt flicker or strobe against his blinking eyes he pressed down on the accelerator as the train track slid beneath his wheels and reflected the white light the light grew he could see shapes inside it colors colors he had never seen it grew until it was as large as the loader then it was along side him it was above him it was all around his head swiveled under command from his eyes to absorb to know his dark world faded behind him as a new bright world opened ahead he secured the vehicle and jumped to the ground a strange soft ground the light engulfed him it warmed him caressing his body from all sides as if he were immersed in a warm ocean his head his body his legs all warmed to life and refueled by the glory of the brightness he looked up and saw the lamp he felt light and full of power men rushed around him they waved their arms and ran some fell on the ground and stared upward jordan saw machines and shapes he had never seen before he looked from side to side but couldnt find the walls the ceiling was invisible the power inside him burst and he felt his face tighten his mouth opened he bared his teeth as he felt himself press the air from his lungs he saw other men doing the same teeth bared they ran with the edges of their mouths pulled up toward their eyes then he was running too running through the chambers without the walls or ceiling running past the shapes and the machines the warmth of the great lamp above powering his strength he ran he bared his teeth and forced the air from his lungs until his throat ached jordan came upon waterhammer standing alone the man had removed his tool and his clothing he opened his mouth and held his arms outstretched as jordan approached jordan walked between his arms put his head over waterhammers shoulders and pressed his neck against waterhammers neck their control sockets touched what the hammer what the chain waterhammer said did he who made the lamb make thee replied jordan the truth can never be told so as to be understood and not be believed jordan pushed away he put his hands on waterhammers shoulders and looked into his eyes he was sure he could see the tiger burning life burning for salvation waterhammers body stiffened as if each of his muscles pulsed simultaneously jordan released him wondering what had happened he stood back and saw waterhammers eyes roll back in his head the muscular man collapsed to the ground motionless jordan looked forward a maintenance man leveled a particle gun toward him there were machines in the sky machines rolled toward them from all directions flashing red lights armed maintenance men wearing uniforms he had never seen before leapt from the vehicles and chased the miners the bluecoated men fell lifeless around him jordan stretched his arms outward to communicate and closed his eyes he waited for the blast it never came when he opened his eyes he saw the maintenance man standing with his gun at his side pointed down jordan held his hand out toward the man and moved slowly toward him jordan said in his mind lord grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can he knew the man wouldnt hear him and the wisdom to know the difference jordan put his arms around the maintenance man he put his chin on the mans shoulder and touched his neck against the maintenance mans he could feel the maintenance mans arms rise around him the maintenance man patted his hands against jordans back jordan said did he who made you make me there was a flash of light and a brief pain in his head then there was nothing of a sweet slow dance in the wake of temporary dogs by adamtroy castro adamtroy castros work has been nominated for several awards including the hugo nebula and stoker his novels include emissaries from the dead and the third claw of god he has also collaborated on two alphabet books with artist johnny atomic z is for zombie and v is for vampire which are due to come out next year castros short fiction has appeared in such magazines as the magazine of fantasy science fiction science fiction age analog cemetery dance and in a number of anthologies i previously included his work in the living dead the living dead the way of the wizard and in lightspeed magazine his story collections include a desperate decaying darkness and tangled strings weve heard it so many times that it has become a cliché let us eat and drink for tomorrow we shall die isaiah most of us only dream of living that way but in our next story we present a society that makes merry for nine remarkable days and on the tenth gives its citizens a taste of a fate worse than death castro says that this story came as a response to new york post after he learned that some people didnt think they could ever visit the city again his response new york is so exciting so rich so vibrant so much a feast for the heart and for the senses that if anything made me want to be there even more but the world of this story is far more intense than that of new york it raises an interesting question is it possible to keep living merrily in the face of repeated torment after all how can you live through hell without losing a piece of your soul before on the last night before the end of everything the stars shine like a fortune in jewels enriching all who walk the quaint cobblestoned streets of enysbourg it is a celebration night like most nights in the capital city the courtyard below my balcony is alive with light and music young people drink and laugh and dance gypsies in silk finery play bouncy tunes on harmonicas and mandolins many wave at me shouting invitations to join them one muscular young man with impossibly long legs and a face equipped with a permanent grin takes it upon himself to sprint the length of the courtyard only to somersault over the glittering fountain at its center for a heartbeat out of time he seems to float enchanted over the water then i join his friends in applause as he bellyflops drenching himself and the longhaired girls wading at the fountains other rim the girls are not upset but delighted their giggles tinkle like wind chimes as they splash across the fountain themselves flinging curtains of silver water as their shiny black hair bobs back and forth in the night intoxicated from a mixture of the excellent local wine and the even better local weed i consider joining them perhaps the boring way via the stairs and perhaps via a great daredevil leap from the balcony i am after all stripped to the waist the ridiculous boxers i brought on the ship here could double as a bathing suit and the way i feel right now i could not only make the fountain but also sail to the moon but after a moments consideration i decide not thats the kind of grand theatrical gesture visitors to enysbourg make on their first night when theyre still overwhelmed by its magic i have been here nine nights i have known the festivals that make every night in the capital city a fresh adventure i have explored the hanging gardens with all their deceptive challenges i have climbed the towers of pearl just down the coast i have ridden stallions across enysbourgs downs and plunged at midnight into the warm waters of the eastern sea i have tasted a hundred pleasures and wallowed in a hundred more and though far from sick of them feel ready to take them at a more relaxed pace partaking not as a starving man but as a connoisseur i want to be less a stranger driven by lust but a lover driven by passion so i just take a deep breath and bask in the air that wafts over the slanting tiled roofs a perfume composed of equal parts sex and spice and the tang of the nearby ocean all the more precious for being part of the last night before the end of everything it occurs to me not for the first time that this might be the best moment of my life a life that back home with its fast pace and its anonymous workplaces and climatecontrolled gleaming plastic everything was so impoverished that its amazing i have any remaining ability to recognize joy and transcendence at all in enysbourg such epiphanies seem to come several times a minute the place seems determined to make me a poet and if i dont watch out i might hunt down paper and pen and scrawl a few lines struggling to capture the inexpressible in a cage of fool amateurish junemoon andspoon the curtains behind me rustle and a familiar presence leaves my darkened hotel room to join me on the balcony i dont turn to greet her but instead close my eyes as she wraps me in two soft arms redolent of wine and perfume and sex her hands meet at the center of my chest she rests a chin on my shoulder and murmurs my name in the musical accent that marks every word spoken by every citizen of enysbourg robert she says and theres something a little petulant about the way she stresses the first syllable something adorable and mocking in the way she chides me for not paying enough attention to her by the time i register the feel of her bare breasts against my bare back and realize in my besotted way that shes mad shes insane shes come out on the balcony in full view of everybody without first throwing on something to cover herself the youths frolicking in the fountain have already spotted her and begun to serenade us with a chorus of delighted cheers kiss her shouts a boy come on begs a girl let us see yells a third dont go inside make love out here when i turn to kiss the woman behind me i am cheered like a conqueror leading a triumphant army into rome her name is caralys and she is of course one of the flowers of enysbourg a rare beauty indeed even in a country where beauty is everywhere she is tall and lush with a dark eyes skin the color of caramel and a smile that seems to hint at secrets propriety wont let her mention her shiny black hair cascades down her back in waves reflecting light even when everything around her seems to be dark i met her the day after my arrival when i was just a dazed and exhausted tourist sitting alone in a café redolent with rich ground coffee i wasnt just off the boat then not really id already enjoyed a long awkward night being swept up by one celebration after another accepting embraces from strangers determined to become friends and hearing my name once given become a chant of hearty congratulation from those applauding my successful escape from the land of everyday life i had danced the whole night cheered at the fires of dawn wept for reasons that puzzled me still and stumbled to bed where i enjoyed the dreamless bliss that comes from exhaustion it was the best night id known in a long time but i was a visitor still reluctant to surrender even the invisible chains that shackled me and even as id jerked myself awake with caffeine id felt tired surfeited at odds i was so adrift that when caralys sauntered in her hair still tousled and cheeks still shining from the celebrations of the night before her dress of many patches rustling about her ankles in a riot of multiple colors i almost failed to notice her but then shed sat down opposite me and declared in the sternest of all possible tones that even foreigners with all their worries werent allowed to wear grimaces like mine in enysbourg i blinked almost believing her because id heard words just like those the previous night from a pair of fellow visitors who had caught me lost in a moment of similar repose then she tittered first beneath her breath and then with unguarded amusement not understanding my resistance to enysbourgs charms but still intrigued she explained much later by the great passion she saw imprisoned behind my gray civilized mein you are my project she said in one expansive moment i am going to take a tamed man and make him a native of enysbourg she may well succeed for we have been in love since that first day both with each other and with the land whose wonders she has been showing me ever since we have fought only once just yesterday when in a thoughtless lapse i suggested that she return with me on the ship home her eyes flashed the exasperation she always showed at my moments of thoughtless naïveté an irritation so grand that it bordered on contempt she told me it was an arrogant idea the kind only a foreigner could have why would she leave this place that has given her life and why would i think so much of her to believe that she would was that all she was to me a prize to be taken home like a souvenir to impress my friends with my trip abroad didnt i see how diminished she would be if i ever did that to her would you blind me she demanded would you amputate my limbs would you peel strips off my skin slicing off piece after piece until there was nothing left of me but the parts that remained convenient to you this is my country robert my blood and she was right for she embodies enysbourg as much as the buildings themselves and for her to abandon it would be a crime against both person and place both would be diminished as much as ill be diminished if i have to leave her behind we leave the balcony and go back inside where for a moment in the warm and sweetsmelling room we come close to collapsing on the bed again for what seems the thousandth time since we woke sore but passionate this morning but this is the last night before the end of everything when enysbourgs wonders emerge in their sharpest relief they are not to be missed just so we can keep to ourselves and so she touches a finger to the tip of my nose and commands that its time to go back into the world i obey we dress i wear an open vest over baggy trousers with a great swooping slouch hat glorious in its vivid testimony to enysbourgs power to make me play the willing fool she wears a fringed blouse and another anklelength skirt of many patches slit to midthigh to expose a magnificent expanse of leg dozens of carved wooden bracelets all loose enough to shift when she moves clack like maracas along her forearms her lips are red her flowered hair aglow with reflected light two curling locks meet in the center of her forehead right above her eyes like mischievous parentheses somewhere she wears bells laughing she leads me from the room and down the narrow stairs chattering away at our fellow guests as they march in twos and threes toward their own celebrations of this last night we pass a man festooned with parrots a woman with a face painted like an italian landscape a fireeater a juggler in a suit of carnival color a cavorting clownfaced monkey who hands me a grape and accepts a small coin in payment lovers of all possible and some impossible gender combinations flash inebriated grins as they surrender their passions in darkened alcoves almost everybody we pass is singing or dancing or sharing dizzy disbelieving embraces everytime i pause in sheer amazement at something i see caralys chuckles at my saucereyed disbelief and pulls me along whispering that none of this would be half as marvelous without me there to witness it even the two fellow tourists we jostle as we pass through the arched entranceway and into the raucous excitement of the street become part of the excitement because i know them they are the ones i met on that first lost day before caralys before i learned that enysbourg was not just a vacation destination offered as brief reward for a earning enough to redeem a year of dullness and conformity but the repository of everything id ever missed in my flavorless excuse for a life jerry and dee martel are gray retirees from some awful industrial place where dee had done something or other with decorating and jerry had managed a firm that molded the plastic shells other companies used to enclose the guts of useful kitchen appliances when they talk about their jobs now as they did when they found me that first night they shudder with the realization that such things swallowed so many years of finite lives they were delivered when they vacationed in enysbourg choosing it at random among all the other oases of tamed exoticism the modern world maintains to make people forget how sterile and homogenous things have become on arriving theyd discovered that it was not a tourist trap not an overdeveloped sham not a fraud and not an excuse to sell plastic souvenirs that testify to nothing but the inane gullibility of the people who buy them but the real thing the special place the haven that made them the people they had always been meant to be theyd emigrated in what jerry said with a wink was their alternative to senility was it a sacrifice for us jerry asked when we met did it mean abandoning our security did it even mean embracing some hardships of course it did it meant all those things and more you may not think so but then youre a baby you havent even been in enysbourg long enough to know but our lives back home were empty they were nothing at least here life has a flavor at least here life is something to be treasured living seven years later as natives spending half their time in the capital and half their time out in the country exploring caves and fording rivers and performing songs they make up on the spot they each look thirty years younger than their mere calendar ages with jerry lean and robust and tanned dee shorter and brighter and interested in everything they remember me from nine days ago and embrace me like a son exclaiming how marvelous i look how relaxed i seem in comparison to the timid creature they met then they want to know if this means im going to stay i blush and admit i dont know i introduce them to caralys and they say it seems an easy choice to them the women hit it off jerry suggests a local inn where we can hear a guitarist he knows and before long were there claiming a corner table between dances listening to his friend another old man an ancient man really with twinkling eyes and spotted scalp and a wispy comicopera moustache that dangling to his collarbone looks like a boomerang covered with lint its not that i hate my country jerry says when the women have left together in the way that women have his eyes shine and his voice slurs from the effects of too much drink i cant i know my history i know the things shes accomplished the principles shes stood for the challenges shes faced ive even been around for more of it than i care to remember but coming here was not abandoning her it was abandoning what shed become it was abandoning the drivethroughs and the atms and the talking heads who pretend they have the answers but would be lucky to remember how to tie their shoes it was remembering what life was supposed to be all about and seizing it with both hands while we still had a few good years still left in us it was victory robert an act of sheer moral victory do you see robert do you see i tell him i see you think you do but you still have a ticket out day after tomorrow sundown right ach youre still a tourist youre still too scared to take the leap but stay here a few more weeks and then tell me that you see i might just do that i say i might stay here the rest of my life he dismisses me with a wave of his hand sure you say that you say that now you say that because you think its so easy to say that you havent even begun to imagine the commitment it takes but i love caralys of course you do but will you be fair to her in the end will you youre not her first tourist you know jerry has become too intense for me in a way utterly at odds with the usual flavor of life in enysbourg if he presses on i might have to tell him to stop but i am rescued the man with the wispy moustache returns from the bar with a fresh mug of beer sets it beside him on a threelegged stool picks up a stringed instrument a lot like a misshapen guitar and begins to sing a ballad in a language i dont understand its one of enysbourgs many dialects a tongue distinguished by deep rolling consonants and rich sensual tones so expressive in its the way it cavorts the length of an average sentence that i dont need a translation to know that hes singing a hymn to lost love long remembered when he closes his eyes i can almost imagine him as the freshfaced young boy staring with earnest panic at the eyes of the freshfaced young woman whose beauty first made him want to sing such songs he sings of pain a sense of loss a longing for something denied to him but there is also wonder a sense of amazement at all the dreams hes ever managed to fulfill or maybe thats just my head making the song mean what i want it to mean in either event the music is slow and heartfelt until some kind of midverse epiphany sends its tempo flying and all of a sudden the drum beats and the hands clap and the darkened room bursts with men and women rising from the shadows to meet on the dance floor in an explosion of flailing hair and whirling bodies there are children on shoulders and babies on backs and a hundred voices united in the chorus of the moustached mans song which seems to fill our veins with fire jerry has already slid away his rant of a few moments before forgotten in the urgency of the moment i recognize nobody around me but nevertheless see no strangers as i decide to stay in enysbourg to spend the rest of my life with caralys to raise a family with her to keep turning pages in this book ive just begun to write the natives seem to recognize the difference in me i am handed a baby which i kiss to the sound of cheers i hand it back and am handed another then another the music grows louder more insistent a wisp of smoke drifts by clove tobacco hashish or something else it is there and then it is gone i blink and catch a glimpse of caralys cut off by the crowd she is trying to get to me her eyes wide her face shining her need urgent she knows i have decided she can tell she is as radiant as i have ever seen her and though jostled by the mob she is determined to make her way to my side she too has something to say something that needs to be spoken through shattered teeth and a mouth filled with blood during there is no sunlight the skies are too sullied by the smoke of burning buildings to admit the existence of dawn what arrives instead are gray and sickly shadows over a moonscape so marked with craters and shattered rubble that in most places its hard to tell where the buildings stood in the first place every few seconds the soot above us brightens becomes as blinding as a parody of the light its usurped and rocks the city with flame and thunder debris pelts everything below a starving dog cowering in a hollow formed by two shattered walls bolts seeking better haven in a honeycomb of fallen masonry fifty meters of sheer hell away but even before it can round the first twisted corpse a solid wall of shrapnel reduces the animal to a scarlet mist falling on torn flesh i witness its death from the site of my own i am already dead i still happen to be breathing but thats a pure accident location is all the little girl whod been racing along two paces ahead of me mad with fear forced her to rip off her flaming clothes to reveal the bubbling black scar the chemical burns have made of her back is now a corpse shes a pair of legs protruding from a mound of fallen brick her left foot still bears a shoe her right is pale naked moonwhite perfect unbloodied i who had been racing along right behind her am not so fortunate the same concussion wave that put her out of her misery sent me flying runaway stones have torn deep furrows in my legs my belly my face my chest i have one seeping gash across my abdomen and another across one cheek both painful but nothing next to the greater damage done by the cornice that landed on my right knee splintering the bone and crushing my leg as close to flat as a leg can get without bursting free of its cradling flesh the stone tumbled on as soon as it did its work settling in a pile of similar rocks it looks like any other but i still think i can identify it out from over here using the marks it left along the filthy ground i have landed in a carpet of broken glass a meter or so from what for a standing person would be a ragged waisthigh remnant of wall it is good fortune i suppose judging from the steady tattoo of shrapnel and rifle fire impacting against the other side its that wall which for the moment spares me the fate of the little girl and the dog chance has also favored me by letting me land within sight of a irregular gap in that wall affording me a view of what used to be the street but which is right now is just a narrow negotiable path between craters and mounds of smoking debris my field of vision is not large but it was enough to show me what happened to the dog if im to survive this it must also allow me to see rescue workers refugees even soldiers capable of dragging me to wherever the wounded are brought but so far there has no help to be seen most of the time even my fragmentary view is obscured by smoke of varying colors white which though steaming hot is also as thin and endurable passing over me without permanent damage black which sickens me with its mingled flavors of burning rubber and bubbling flesh and the caustic yellow which burns my eyes and leaves me gagging with the need to void a stomach already long empty i lick my lips which are dry and cracked and pitted and recognize both hunger and thirst in the way the world pales before me it is the last detail everything i consumed yesterday when enysbourg was paradise is gone it and everything i had for several days before suddenly im starving to death there is another great burst of sound and light so close parts of me shake apart i try to scream but my throat is dry my voice a mere wisp my mouth a sewer sickening from the mingled tastes of blood and ash and things turned rotten inside me i see a dark shape a man jerry martel in fact move fast past the gap in the wall i hear automatic fire and i hear his brief cry as he hits the dirt in a crunch of flesh and gravel he is not quite dead at first and though he does not know i am here just out of sight a collaborator in his helplessness he cries out to me anyway a bubbling childish cry aware that its about to be cut off but hoping in this instant that it reaches a listener willing to care i cant offer the compassion jerry craves because i hate him too much for bringing fresh dangers so close to the place where i already lie broken i want him gone a second later fate obliges me with another burst of automatic weapons fire brick chips fill the air like angry bees digging more miniature craters one big one strikes my ravaged knee and i spasm grimacing as my bowels let loose knowing it wont matter because i released everything i had inside me long ago i feel relief he was my friend but im safer with him gone i smell more smoke i taste mud i hear taunts in languages i dont recognize cries and curses in the tongues spoken in enysbourg a wave of heat somewhere near me alerts me that a fire has broken out i drag myself across ragged stones and broken glass closer to the gap in the wall entertaining vainglorious ambitions of perhaps crawling through and making it untouched through the carnage to someplace where people can fix me but the pain is too much and i collapse bleeding now from a dozen fresher wounds having accomplished nothing but to provide myself a better view i see the elderly musician with the huge moustache stumble on by his eyes closed his face a sheen of blood his arms dangling blistered and lifeless at his sides each blackened and swollen to four times its natural size i see a woman halfmad her mouth ajar in an unending silent scream clutching a tightly wrapped but still ragged bundle in a flannel blanket unwilling to notice that whatever it held is now just a glistening smear across her chest i see a tall and robust and athletic man stumble on by his eyes vacant his expression insane his jaw ripped free and dangling from his face by a braided ribbon of flesh i see all that and i hear more explosions and i watch as some of the fleeing people fall either whole or in pieces and i listen as some are released by death and more importantly as others are not something moving at insane speed whistles through the sky above passing so near that its slipstream tugs at my skin i almost imagine it pulling me off the ground lifting me into the air allowing me a brief moment of flight behind it before it strikes and obliterates its target for a moment i wish it would even that end would be better than a deathbed of shattered rock and slivered glass then comes the brightest burst of light and most deafening wave of thunder yet and for a time i become blind and deaf with everything around me reduced to a field of pure white when the world comes back not at all improved it is easy to see the four young men in identical uniforms who huddle in a little alcove some twenty meters away there is not much to them these young men they all carry rifles they all wear heavy packs theyre all little more than boys and their baggy uniforms testify to a long time gone without decent food when one turns my way facing me and perhaps even seeing me but not registering me as a living inhabitant of the corpsestrewn landscape his eyes look sunken haunted unimaginably ancient he is i realize as mad as the most pitiful among the wounded a reasonable response to his environment and one i would share if i could divest the damnable sanity that forces me to keep reacting to the horror he turns back to his comrades and says something then he looks over them at something beyond my own limited field of vision and his smile is enough to make me crave death all over again his comrades look where hes looking and smile the same way all four of them showing their teeth the three additional soldiers picking their way through the rubble bear a woman between them it is caralys two stand to either side of her holding her arms a third stands behind her holding a serrated knife to her throat with one hand and holding a tight grip on her hair with the other that soldier keeps jabbing his knee into the small of her back to keep her going he has to shes struggling with every ounce of strength available to her pulling from side to side digging her feet into the ground cursing them to a thousand hells every time they jerk her off her feet and force her onward she is magnificent my caralys she is stronger more vibrant than any one of them in any fair fight she would be the only one left standing but she is held by three and while she could find an opportunity to escape three the soldiers from the alcove who now rush to help their comrades bring the total all the way up to seven there is no hope with seven i know this even as i drag myself toward her from the place where i lie broken i know this even as she struggles to drive her tormentors away with furious kicks but these boys are too experienced with such things they take her by the ankles lift her off the ground and bear her squirming and struggling form across the ravaged pavement to a clear place in the rubble where they pin her to the ground each one taking a limb they must struggle to keep her motionless the soldier with the darkest eyes unslings his rifle weighs it in his arms and smashes its butt across her jaw the bottom half of her face crumples like shattered pottery there is nothing i can do but continue to crawl toward her toward them caralys coughs out a bubble of fresh blood fragments of teeth driven from her mouth cling to whats left of her chin she shrieks and convulses and tries to kick her legs remain held the same soldier who just smashed her face now sees that his job is not yet done he raises his rifle above his head and drives the stock hard into her belly she wheezes and chokes she tries to curl into a ball of helpless misery seeking escape within herself but the soldiers wont even permit that another blow this one to her forehead takes what little fight is left her eyes turn to blackened smears her nose blows pink bubbles which burst and dribble down her cheeks in rivulets she murmurs an animal noise the soldier responsible for making her manageable makes a joke in a language i dont know which cant possibly be funny but still makes the others laugh they rip off her filthy dress and spread her legs farther apart the leader steps away props his rifle against a fragment of wall and returns dropping his pants as he gives his swollen penis a lascivious little waggle i observe something wrong with it something i can see from a distance it looks green diseased halfrotted but he descends forcing himself into her cursing her with every thrust his cruel animal grunts matched by her own bubbling exhalations less gasps of pain or protests at her violation than the involuntary noises made as her diaphragm is compressed again and again and again it doesnt last long but by the time he pulls out shakes himself off and pulls his pants back up the glimpse i catch of her face is enough to confirm that shes no longer here caralys is alive all right i can see her labored breath i can feel the outrage almost as much as she does but shes not in this place and time her mind has abandoned this particular battlefield for another inside her head which might not provide any comfort but nevertheless belongs only to her whats left in this killing ground doesnt even seem to notice as one of the other soldiers releases his grip on her right arm takes his position and commences a fresh rape there are no words sufficient for the hate i feel i am a human being with a human beings dimensions but the hate is bigger than my capacity to contain it it doesnt just fill me it replaces me it becomes everything i am i want to claw at them and snap at them and spew hatred at them and rip out their throats with my teeth i want to leave them blackened corpses and i want to go back to wherever they came from and make rotting flesh of their own wives and mothers i want to bathe in their blood i want to die killing them i want to scar the earth where they were born i want to salt the farmland so nothing ever grows there again if hatred alone lent strength i would rend the world itself but i cry out without a voice and i crawl forward without quite managing to move and i make some pathetic little sound or another and it carries across the smoky distance between me and them and it accomplishes nothing but advise the enemy that im here in a single spasm of readiness they all release caralys grab their weapons scan the rubblefield for the source of the fresh sound the one using her at the moment needs only an extra second to disengage but he pulls free in such a panicked spasm that he tumbles backward slamming his pantless buttocks into a puddle of something too colored by rainbows to qualify as water the leader sees me he rolls his eyes pulls a serrated blade from its sheath at his hip and covers the distance between us in three seconds the determined hatred i felt a heartbeat ago disappears i know that hes the end of me and that i cant fight him and i pray that i can bargain with him instead that i can barter caralys for mercy or medical attention or even an easier death i think all this betraying her and it makes me hate myself thats the worst this moment of seeing myself plain this illustration of the foul bargains id be willing to make in exchange for a few added seconds of life it doesnt matter that there arent any bargains i shouldnt have wanted any i grope for his knife as it descends but it just opens the palms of my hands and christens my face and chest with blood soon matched by that which flows when he guts me from crotch to ribcage my colon spills out in thick ropes steaming in the morning air i feel cold the agony tears at me i cant even hope for death i want more than death i want more than oblivion i want erasure i want a retroactive ending i want to wipe out my whole life starting from my conception nothing not even the happy moments is worth even a few seconds of this it would be better if id never lived but i dont die yet i dont die when he walks away or when he and his fellow soldiers return to their fun with caralys i dont die when they abandon her and leave in her place a broken thing that spends the next hours choking on its own blood i dont even die when the explosions start again and the dust salts my wounds with little burning embers i dont die when the ground against my back shakes like a prehistoric beast about to tear itself apart with rage i dont even die when the rats come to me to enjoy a fresh meal i want to die but maybe that release is more than i deserve so i lie on my back beneath a cloudscape of smoke and ash and i listen to caralys choke and i listen to the gunfire and i curse that sociopathic monster god and i do nothing nothing when the flies come to lay their eggs after i wake on a bed of freshlymowed grass the air is cool and refreshing the sky as blue as a dream the breeze a delicious mixture of scents ranging from sea salt to the sweatier perfume of passing horses from the light i know it cant be too long after dawn but i can tell im not the first one up i can hear songbirds the sounds of laughing children barking dogs music played at low volumes from little radios unwilling to trust the sensations of peace i resist getting up long enough to first grab a fistful of grass luxuriating in the feel of the long thin blades as they bunch up between my fingers theyre miraculous theyre alive im alive i turn my head and see where i am one of the citys many small parks a place lined with trees and decorated with orchid gardens the buildings visible past the treeline are uncratered and intact im intact the other bodies i see scattered here and there across the lawn are not corpses but sleepers still snoring away after a long lazy evening beneath the stars there are many couples even a few families with children all peaceful all unworried about predators either animal or human even the terror the trauma the soulwithering hate the easy savagery that subsumes all powerless victims all the emotional scars that had ripped me apart have faded and the only nearby smoke comes from a sandpit not far upwind where a jolly bearded man in colorful suspenders has begun to cook himself an outdoor breakfast i rise unscarred and unbroken clad in comfortable native clothing baggy shorts a vest a jaunty feathered hat i even have a wine bottle threequarters empty and a pleasant taste in my mouth to go with it i drink the rest and smile at the pleasant buzz the thirst remains but for something nonalcoholic i need water i itch from the stray blades of grass peppering my exposed calves and forearms i contort my back feeling the vertebrae pop it feels good i stretch to get my circulation going i luxuriate in the tingle of the morning air across the meadow a little girl points at me and smiles she is the same little girl i saw crushed by masonry yesterday it takes me a second to smile back and wave a second spent wondering if she recognizes me if she finds me an unpleasant reminder if so there is no way to tell from the way she bears herself she betrays no trauma at all rather she looks as blessed as any other creature of enysbourg the inevitable comparison to caralys assigns me my first mission for the day i have to find her hold her confirm that she too has emerged unscathed from the madness of the day before she must have given the rules here but the protective instincts of the human male still need to be respected so i wander from the park into the streets of a capital city just starting to bustle with life past the gondolas taking lovers down the canals past the merchants hawking vegetables swollen with flavor past a juggler in a coat of carnival color who has put down his flaming batons and begun to toss delighted children instead i see a hundred faces i know all of whom nod with the greatest possible warmth upon seeing me perhaps recognizing in my distracted expression the look of a foreigner who has just experienced his first taste of enysbourgs greatest miracle nobody looks haunted nobody looks terrorized nobody looks like the survivors of madness they have shaken off the fire bombings that reduced them to screaming torches the bayonets that jabbed through their hearts the tiny rooms where they were tortured at inhuman length for information they did not have they have shrugged away the hopelessness and the rampant disease and the mass graves where they were tossed beside their bulletriddled neighbors while still breathing themselves they remember it all as i remember it all but that was yesterday not today and this is enysbourg a land where it never happened a land which will know nothing but joy until the end of everything comes again ten days from now on my way back to the hotel i pass the inn where caralys and i went dancing the night before the end of everything the scents that waft through the open door are enough to make me swoon i almost pass by determined to find caralys before worrying about my base animal needs but then i hear deep braying laughter from inside laughter i recognize as jerry martels i should go inside he has been in enysbourg for years and may know the best ways to find loved ones after the end of everything the hunger is a consideration too stopping to eat now before finding caralys might seem like a selfish act but i wont do either one of us any good unless i do something to keep up my strength guilt wars with the needs of an empty stomach my mouth waters caralys will understand i go inside the place is dim and nearly empty the old man with the enormous moustache is on stage playing something inconsequential jerry who seems to be the only patron is in a corner table waiting for me he waves me over asks me if im all right urges me to sit down and waits for me to tell him how it was my words halting i tell him it doesnt feel real anymore he claps me on the back he says hes proud of me he says he wasnt sure about me in the beginning he says he had me figured for the kind of person who wouldnt be able to handle it but look at me now refreshed invigorated ready to handle everything he says i remind him of himself he beams and expects me to take that as a compliment i give him a weak nod he punches me in the shoulder and says that its going to be fun having me around from now on a new person he says to guide around the best of enysbourg who doesnt yet know all the sights the sounds the tastes the joys and adventures there are parts of enysbourg both in and outside the capital that even most of those who live here dont know he says its enough to fill lifetimes he says that the other stuff the nasty stuff the stuff we endure as the price of admission is just a reason to cherish everything else he says that the whole country is a treasure trove of experience for people willing to take the leap and he says i look like one of those people and of course he says punching my arm again theres caralys sweet wanton caralys whom he has already seen taking her morning swim by the sea caralys who will be so happy to see me again he says i should remember what caralys is like when shes delighted he says that now that i know i can handle it i would have to be a fool to let her go he chuckles then says tell you what stay right here ill go find her im sure the two of you have a lot to talk about and then he disappears all before i have said anything at all on stage the man with the enormous moustache starts another song playing this time not the misshapen guitarthing from two nights ago but something else a ushaped device with two rows of strings forming a crisscross between ends and base its music is clear and resonant with a wobbly quality that only adds to its emotional impact the song is a slow one a relief to me since the raucous energy of enysbourgs nights might be a bit much for me right now i nod at the old man he recognizes me his grin broadens and his eyes slit with amusement theres no telling whether he has some special affection for me as a person or just appreciates the arrival of any audience at all either way his warmth is genuine he is grateful to me for being here but he does not stop playing just to greet me the song continues the lyrics once again in a language unknown to me are once again still easy to comprehend whatever the particulars this song is impossible to mistake as anything but a tribute to being alive when the song ends i toss him a coin and he tosses it back not insulted just not interested he is interested in the music for musics sake alone in celebration because celebration is the whole point i think hard on the strange cycle of life in enysbourg dictated by law respected as a philosophical principle and rendered possible by all the technological genius the modern world can provide this endless cycle which always follows nine days of sheer exuberance with one day of sheer hell on earth it would be so much easier if exposure to that tenth day were not the price of admission it would be so much better if we could be permitted to sail in on the day after and sail out on the night before enjoying those nine days of sweet abandon without any obligation to endure the unmitigated savagery of the tenth the weekly exodus wouldnt be a tide of refugees it would be a simple fact of life if such a choice were possible i would make it of course i would also have to make caralys come with me each time for even if she was determined to remain behind and support her nations principles i could never feel at peace standing on the deck of some distant ship watching enysbourgs beautiful shoreline erupt in smoke and fire aware that i was safe but knowing that she was somewhere in that no mans land being brutalized and killed and there is no way she would ever come with me to such a weekly safe haven when her land was a smoking ruin behind her she would know the destruction temporary the same way i know it temporary but she would regard her escape from the regular interval of terror an act of unforgivable treason against her home it is as she said that time i almost lost her by proposing that she come back home with me a suggestion i made not because home is such a great place but because home would be easier she said that leaving would be cowardice she said that leaving would be betrayal she said that leaving would be the end of her and she said that the same went for any other attempt to circumvent the way things were here including my own which is why shed despise me forever if i tried the tenth day she said is the whole point of enysbourg its the main reason the ships come and go only on the day after nobody not the natives like caralys and not the visitors like myself is allowed their time in paradise unless we also pay the price the question that faces everybody on that day after is the same question that faces me now whether life in enysbourg is worth it i think of all the countries my own included that never know the magic enysbourg enjoys nine days out of ten that have become not societies but efficient machines where life is all about keeping that machine in motion those nations know peace and they know prosperity but do they know life the way enysbourg knows life nine days out of every ten i come from such a place and i suffocated in such a place maybe because i was too much a part of the machine to recognize the consolations available to me maybe because they werent available to be found either way i know that ive never been happy not before i came here here i found my love of being alive but only nine days out of ten and is that tenth day really too much to endure anyway i think about all the countries that know that tenth day not at safe predictable intervals but for long stretches lasting months or years or centuries i think about all the countries that have never known anything else i think about all the terrorized generations who have lived and died and turned to bones with nothing but that tenth day to color their days and nights for all those people millions of them enysbourg with that tenth day always lurking in recent memory and always building in the near future is still a paradise beyond comprehension bring all those people here and theyd find this choice easy almost laughable theyd leap at the chance knowing that their lives would only be better most of the time its only the comfortable the complacent the spoiled who would even find the question an issue for internal debate the rest would despise me for showing such reluctance to stay and theyd be right ive seen enough and experienced enough to know that theyd be right but i dont know if i have what it takes to be right with them i might prefer to be wrong and afraid and suffering their disdain at a safe distance in a place untouched by times like enysbourgs tenth day i remember a certain moment when we had been together for three days caralys had led me to a gorge a few hours from the capital a place she called a secret and which actually seemed to be as there were no legions of cameratoting tourists climbing up and down the few safe routes to the sparkling river below the way down was not a wellworn path carved by the weight of human feet it was a series of compromises with what otherwise would have been a straight vertical drop places where it became possible to slide down dirt grades or descend from one rock ledge to another much of the way down was overgrown with plants so thick that only her unerring sense of direction kept us descending on the correct route and not via a sudden fatal boneshattering plunge from a height she moved through it all with a grace unlike i had ever seen and also with an urgency i could not understand but which was nevertheless intense enough to keep me from complaining through my hoarse breath and aching bones every once in a while she turned to smile and call me her adventurer and every time she did the special flavor she gave the word was enough to keep me going determined to rush anyplace she wanted me to follow the grade grew gentler the closer we came to the river at the gorge bottom it became a mild grade dim beneath thick forest canopy surrounded on all sides by the rustling of a thousand leaves and the chittering of a thousand birds once the water itself grew audible there was nothing but a wall of sound all around us she picked up speed and began to run tearing off her clothes as she went i ran after her gasping almost breaking my neck a dozen times as i tripped over this root that halfburied rock by the time i emerged in daylight at a waterfront of multicolored polished stones she was well ahead of me i was hopping on one leg to remove my boots and pants and she was already naked and up to her waist in midriver her perfect skin shiny from wet and glowing from the sun she had led us directly to a spot just below one of the grandest waterfalls i had ever seen with my own eyes it was an unbroken wall of rushing silver descending from a flat rock ledge some fifty meters above us the grotto at its base was bowlshaped and just wide enough to collect the upriver rapids in a pool of relative calm the water was so cold that i emitted an involuntary yelp but caralys just laughed at me enjoying my reaction i dove in feeling the temperature shock in every pore then stood up dripping exuberant wanting nothing in this moment but to be with her she caught my wrist before i could touch her no i stopped confused no why no wasnt this what she wanted in this perfect place shed found for us she released my arm and headed toward the wall of water splashing through the river as it grew deeper around her swallowing first her hips and then her breasts and then her shoulders finally requiring her to swim her urgency was almost frightening now i thought of how easy it might be to drown here for someone who allowed herself to get caught beneath that raging wall of water and i said hey rushing after her not enjoying the cold quite as much anymore i dont know what fed that river but it was numbing enough to be glacial runoff thoughts of hypothermia struck for the first time and i felt the first stab of actual fear just as she disappeared beneath the wall the moment i passed through with sheets of freezing water assaulting my head and shoulders was one of the loudest id ever known it was a roaring rumbling bubbling cacophony so intense that it drowned out all the other sounds that filled this place the birds the wind the softer bubbling of the water downstream they were wiped out eliminated by this one allencompassing noise i almost turned around but i kept going right through the wall on the other side i found air and a dark dank place caralys had pulled herself onto a mossy ledge just above the waterline set against a great stone wall there she sat with her back to the wall hugging her legs her knees tucked tight beneath her chin her eyes were white circles reflecting the light passing through the water now behind me i waded toward her found an empty spot on the ledge beside her and pulled myself up too the stone i found without much surprise was like ice not a place i wanted to stay for long but i joined her in contemplating the daylight as it prismed through a portal of plummeting water it seemed brilliant out there a lot like another world seen through an enchanted gateway its beautiful i said she said nothing so i turned to see if she was all right she was still staring at the water she was in shadow and a trick of the light had shrouded most of her profile in darkness reducing her outline to a dimly lit crescent the droplets balancing on the tip of her nose were like little glistening pearls i saw too that she was trembling though at the time i attributed that to the cold alone she said listen i listened and heard only the sound of the waterfall less deafening now that wed passed some distance beyond it and something else her teeth chattering she said the silence it took me a second to realize that this was the miracle shed brought me here to witness the way the waterfall in all its harmless fury now insulated us from all the sounds we had been hearing all morning it was as if none of what wed heard out there all the time it had taken us to hike to this place she knew so well now existed at all none of it was there none of it could touch us it seemed important to her at that moment i could not understand why i am in the little restaurant thinking all this when a soft voice calls my name i look up and of course its caralys sweet beautiful caralys who has found me in the place where we prefer to think we saw each other last she is of course unmarked and unwounded all the insults inflicted by the soldiers either healed or wiped away like bad rumors she looks exactly like she did the night before last complete with fringed blouse and patchy dress and two curling strands of hair that meet in the center of her forehead if there is any difference in her it lies in what i now recognize was there all along the storm clouds of memory roiling behind her piercing black eyes shes not insane or hard the way she should be after enduring what shes endured enysbourg always wipes away all scars physical and psychological both but it does not wipe away the knowledge and her smile always so guileless in its radiance now seems to hold a dark challenge i can see that she has always held me and my naïveté in the deepest possible contempt she couldnt have felt any other way in the presence of any man who had never known the tenth day i was an infant by enysbourgs standards a man who could not understand her or the forces that shaped her i must have seemed bland dull and in my own comfortable way even retarded i find to my surprise that i feel contempt as well part of me is indignant at her effrontery at looking down at me after all she has had other tourists she has undertaken other projects with other men from other places trying time and time again to make outsiders into natives of her perverse little theme park to savagery what does she expect from me in the end who am i to her if i leave wont she just find another tourist to play with for ten days and why should i stay when i should just see her as the easy vacation tramp always eager to go with the first man who comes off the boat its hard not to be repulsed by her but that hate pales beside the awareness that in all my days only she has made me feel alive and her own contempt great as it is seems drowned by her love shining at me with such intensity that for a moment i almost forget the fresh secrets now filling the space between us i stand and fall into her arms we close our eyes and taste each others tears she whispers it is all right robert i understand it is all right i want you to stay but wont hate you if you go she is lying of course she will despise me even more if i go she will know for certain that enysbourg has taught me nothing but her love will be just as sincere if i stay its the entire reason she seeks out tourists she loathes our naïveté but its also the one thing she cant provide for herself jerry martel stands nearby beaming and selfcongratulatory dee has joined him approving cooing maternal maybe they hope well pay attention to them again or maybe were just a new flavor for them a novelty for the expatriates living in enysbourg either way i ignore them and pull caralys close taking in the scent of her the sheer absolute ideal of her laughing and weeping and unable to figure out which is which she makes sounds that could be either murmuring words that could be balms for my pain or laments for her own she tells me again that its going to be all right and i dont know whether shes telling the truth i dont even know whether shes all that sure herself i just know that if i take that trip home i will lose everything she gave me and be left with nothing but the gray dullness of my everyday life and if i stay deciding to pay the price of that tenth day in exchange for the illusion of eden well never be able to acknowledge the tenth day on the other days when everything seems to be all right we wont mention the times spent suffocating beneath rubble or spurting blood from severed limbs or choking out our lungs from poison gas i will never know how many hells shes known and how many times shes cried out for merciful death ill never be able to ask if what i witnessed yesterday was typical worse than average or even an unusually good day considering shell never ask about any of the horrors that happen to me these are not things discussed during peacetime in enysbourg we wont even talk about them if i stay and if we remain in love and if we marry and have children and if they grow up bright and beautiful and filled with wonder and if every ten days we find ourselves obliged to watch them ground beneath tanktreads or worse in enysbourg such things are not the stuff of words in enysbourg a certain silence is just the price of being alive and a small price it is in light of how blessed those who live here have always been just about all caralys can do as the two of us begin to sway together in a sweet slow dance is continue to murmur reassurances just about all i can do is rest my head against her chest and close my eyes to the sound of her beating heart just about all we can do together is stay in this moment putting off the next one as long as possible and try not to remember the dogs the hateful snarling dogs caged for now but always thirsty for a fresh taste of blood the mere absence of war is not peace president john f kennedy for j h resistance by tobias s buckell tobias s buckell is the author of the novels crystal rain ragamuffin sly mongoose and the new york times bestseller halo the cole protocol he is a writers of the future winner and has published more than thirty short stories which have appeared in magazines such as nature lightspeed science fiction age and analog and in anthologies including mojo conjure stories new voices in science fiction and i alien much of his short work has been collected in tides from the new worlds he currently lives in ohio with a pair of dogs a pair of cats twin daughters and his wife in november american voters elected barack obama president of the united states the race was not as close as it has been in recent elections but the real excitement of the day was the high voter turnout with an estimated of all registered voters choosing to cast votes the election stands as the highest voter turnout in more than three decades of course that means or so of all registered voters didnt bother to turn up and who knows how many u s citizens never got around to even registering in the first place there are thousands of explanations for voter apathy but in the world buckell portrays in our next story none of those excuses really matter its a technodemocracy failed by its own voters but buckell knows firsthand about systems that begin with high hopes only to crumble into disaster he was born during a coup detat in grenada where the new government according to buckell fell into the spiral of quashing opposition to the point where it became draconian and people ended up lined up against walls and shot it would appear that a utopian government is only as strong as the voices of its resistance four days after the coup stanuel was ordered to fake an airlock pass the next day he waited inside a cramped equipment locker large enough to hold two people while an armed rover the size and shape of a helmet wafted around the room twisting and counterrotating pieces of itself as it scanned the room briefly stanuel held his breath and willed himself not to move or make a sound he just floated in place thankful for the lack of gravity that might have betrayed him had he needed to depend on locked nervous muscles the rover gave up and returned to the corridor the airlock door closing behind it stanuel slipped back out the rover had missed him because hed been fully suited up for vacuum no heat signature behind the rovers lenses had been the eyes of pan and since the coup anyone knew better than to get noticed by pan even the airlock pass cut it too close he would disappear when pans distributed networks noticed what hed done by then pan would not be a problem stanuel checked his suit over again then cycled the airlock out the outer door split in two and pulled apart but where was the man stanuel was supposed to bring in he realized there was an inky blackness in the space just outside the ring of the lock a blotch that grew larger and then tumbled in the suit flickered and turned a dull gray to match the general interior color of the airlock the person stood up and stanuel repressurized the airlock they waited as stanuel snapped seals and took his own helmet off he hung the suit up in the locker hed just been hiding in we have to hurry we only have about ten minutes before the next rover patrol behind him stanuel heard crinkling and crunching when he turned around the spacesuit had disappeared he now faced a tall man with dark skin and long dreadlocks past his shoulders and eyes as gray as the bench behind him the spacesuit had turned into a long black trenchcoat rovers the man asked stanuel held his hand up and glyphed a d picture in the air above his palm the man looked at the rover spin and twist and shoot originally they were station maintenance bots semiautonomous remote operated vehicles now theyre armed i see the man pulled a large backpack off his shoulders and unzipped it so what now stanuel asked the gray eyes flicked up from the pack you dont know im part of a cell but we run distributed tasks only checking it with people who assign them it keeps us insulated i was only told to open this airlock and let you in you would know what comes next is the attack tonight should i get armed are you helping the attack the man opened the pack all the way to reveal a small arsenal of guns grenades explosives and oddly knives very large knives he looked up at stanuel i am the attack ive been asked to shut pan down but youre not a programmer i can do all things through explosives who destroy for me the man began moving the contents of the pack inside the pockets and straps of the trenchcoat clipped more to his belt and thigh as well as to holsters under each arm and then added pieces to his ankles he was now a walking arsenal but only half the pack had been emptied the mysterious mercenary tossed it at stanuel besides youre going to help stanuel coughed me according to the resistance message youre a maintenance manager recently promoted you still know all the sewer lines access ducts and holes required to get me to the tower how long do you guess we have before it notices your unauthorized use of an airlock an hour stanuel said the last time hed accidentally gone somewhere pan didnt like rovers had been in his office within an hour and can we get to the tower within an hour stanuel without being noticed stanuel nodded the large wellarmed man pointed at the airlock door into the corridor well lets not dally can i ask you something stanuel asked yes your name you know mine i dont know yours pepper said the mercenary now can we leave a single tiny sound ended the secrecy of their venture the buzz of wings peppers head snapped in the direction of the sound locks spinning out from his head he slapped his palm against the side of the wall crushing a butterflylike machine perfectly flat a bug stanuel said pepper launched down the corridor bouncing off the walls until he hit the bulkhead at the far end he glanced around the corner clear pan knows youre in haven now stanuel felt fear bloom an instant explosion of paralysis that left him hanging in the air it will mobilize then get me into the tower quick lets go stanuel were not engaged in something that rewards the slow but stanuel remained in place they chose me because i had no family he said i had less to lose i would help them against pan but pepper folded his arms its already seen you youre already dead that sunk in stanuel had handled emergencies breaches where vacuum flooded in sucking the air out hed survived explosions dumb mistakes and even being speared by a piece of rebar all by keeping cool and doing what needed to be done he hadnt expected when told that hed need to let in an assassin that hed become this involved but what did he expect that he could be part of the resistance and not ever risk his life hed risked it the moment one of his coworkers had started whispering to him talking about overthrowing pan and hed only stood there and listened stanuel took a deep breath and nodded okay im sorry the space station haven was a classic wheel rotating slowly to provide some degree of gravity for its inhabitants so that they did not have to lose bone mass and muscle the price of living in no gravity at havens center lay the hub here lay an atrium the extraordinary nogravity gardens and play areas for havens citizens auditoriums and pools and labs and tourist areas and fields the heart of the community dripping down from the hub docking ports airlocks antennae and spare mass from the original asteroid haven had taken its metals this was where they floated now but on the other side of the hub hung a long and spindly structure that had once housed the central command for the station a bridge of sorts with a view of all of haven sat at the very tip of the tower the bridge was duplicated just below in the form of an observation deck and restaurant for visitors and proud citizens and school trips all things the tower existed for in that more innocent time before now pan sat in the bridge looking out at all of them both through the large portallike windows up there and through the network of rovers and insect cams scattered throughout haven one of which pepper had just flattened stanuel knew they no longer had an hour now pepper squatted in front of the hatch its good im not claustrophobic this runs all the way to the restaurant at the tower its the fastest way there if we dont choke on fumes and grease first pepper scraped grease off the inside stanuel handed him a mask with filters from the tiny utility closet underneath the pipe he also found a set of headlamps get in ill follow we need to hurry pepper hauled himself into the tube and stanuel followed worming his way in when he closed the hatch after them the darkness seemed infinite until pepper clicked a tiny penlight on moving down the tube was simple enough they were in the hub they were weightless they could use their fingertips to slowly move their way along after several minutes pepper asked voice muffled by the filter so how did it happen haven was one of the most committed to the idea of technodemocracy there were hundreds of little bubbles of life scattered all throughout the asteroid belt hidden away from the mess of earth and her orbit by distance and anonymity each one a petri dish of politics and culture each a pearl formed around a bit of asteroid dirt that birthed it there are problems with a technodemocracy muttered stanuel if youre a purist like we were you had to have the citizenry decide on everything the sheer amount of things that a society needed decided had almost crushed them every minute everyone had to decide something pass a new law agree to send delegates to another station accept taxes divvy out taxes pay a bill the stream of decisions became overwhelming constantly popping up and requiring an electronic yes or no and research was needed for each decision the artificial intelligence modelers came up with our solution they created intelligences that would vote just as you would if you had the time to do nothing but focus on voting they werent real artificial intelligences the modelers took your voting record and paired it to your buying habits social habits and all the other aspects of your life that were tracked in modern life to model your habits after all if a bank could use a financial profile to figure out if an unusual purchase didnt reflect the buyers habits and freeze an account for safety reasons why couldnt the same black box logic be applied to a voters patterns pepper snorted you turned over your voting to machines stanuel shook his head making the headlamps light dart from side to side not machines us the profiles were incredible they modeled what votes were important enough or that the profilers were uncertain to get right so that they only passed on the important ones to us they were like spam filters for voting they freed us from the incredible flood of meaningless minutiae that the daily running of a government needed but they failed pepper grunted yes and no quiet pepper pointed his penlight down i hear something clinking around back the way we came from someone chasing us no its mechanical stanuel thought about it for a moment he couldnt think of anything rover pepper stopped and stanuel collided with his boots so our time has run out i dont know a faint clang echoed around them back up pepper said pushing him away with a quick shove of the boot to the top of his head what are you doing weve come far enough four extremely loud bangs filled the tube with absurdly bright flashes of light pepper moved out through the ragged rip in the pipe another large wall blocked him what is this stanuel still blinking looked at it from still inside the pipe youll want the other side nothing but vacuum on the other side had pepper used more explosive they might have just been blown right out the side of haven right pepper twisted further out and another explosion rocked the pipe when stanuel wriggled out and around the tube he saw trees theyd blown a hole in the lawn of the gardens they carefully climbed out pushing past dirt and the tubes and support equipment that monitored and maintained the gardens and soaked the roots with water now what stanuel asked were going to be seen now it gets messy pepper said he pulled stanuel along toward the large elevator at the center im going with a frontal assault itll be messy but i do well at messy theres no reason for me to be here then stanuel said what use will i be i failed to get you there through the exhaust pipes why not just let me go pepper laughed not quite ready to die for the cause stanuel no yes im not sure it just feels like suicide and im not sure who that helps youre safer with me pepper launched them from branch to branch through the trees now that curfews were in effect no families perched in the great globe of green no kids screaming and racing through the trees it was eerily silent pepper slowed them down in the last grove of trees before the elevators at the core of the gardens as they gently floated towards the lobby at the bottom of the shaft three wellbuilt men the kind who obviously trained their bodies up on the rim of the wheel turned the corner they carried stun guns nonlethal but still menacing stanuel heard a click pepper held out a gun in each hand real guns perfectly lethal id turn those off pepper said to the men and pass them over and then noone would get hurt they hesitated but then the commanding voice of pan filled the gardens do as he says and then escort him to me they looked at each other unhappy and tossed the guns over pepper threw them off into the trees youre escorting us the three unhappy security men nodded pan says you have an electromagnetic pulse weapon were not to provoke you stanuel bit his lip it felt like a trap these traitors were taking them into the maw of the beast and pepper as far as he could see looked cheerful about it its a trap he muttered well of course it is pepper said but its a good one that avoids us skulking about getting dirtier or having to shoot our way through the mercenary followed pans lackeys into the elevator he turned and looked at stanuel hovering outside and pans right i do have an e m p device but if i trigger it this deep into the hub i take out all your power generating capabilities and computer core systems really stanuel was intrigued pepper held up a tiny metal tube with a button on the end if i get to the tower pepper said i can trigger it and take out pan while leaving the rest of the station unaffected stanuel had weathered five days of his beloved haven under the autocratic rule of pan the trickster hed travel with pepper to see it end he realized he pulled himself into the elevator for five days havens populace had a ruler a single being whose word was law whose thoughts were made policy pan stood in the center of the command console its face lit by the light of a hundred screens and the reflections off the inner rim of havens great wheel pan wore a simple blue suit had tan skin brown eyes and brown hair his androgynous face and thin body meant that had he stood in a crowd of havens citizens he would hardly have been noticed he could be anybody or everybody he also flickered slightly as he turned my executioner and his companion im delighted pan said if i could shake your hand i would he gave a slight bow pepper returned it pan smiled ive been waiting for you two for quite a while i apologize for sending the rover up the exhaust pipe pepper shrugged no matter so what now i have something that can take you out you have me surrounded by nasty surprises pan folded its arms i dont do nasty surprises pepper im not a monster contrary to what stanuel might say you have an e m p device and if you were to set it off further down the tower you would shut all haven down true i have backup capabilities that mitigate that but your device presents a terrible risk to the well being of the citizenry with the device and you up here the only risk is to me an easy enough decision stanuel thought trigger the damn device but pepper glanced around the room maybe seeing traps that stanuel couldnt if you dont do nasty surprises what stops me from zapping you out right here right now i would like to make you an offer if youd listen peppers lips quirked i wouldnt be much of a mercenary if i just accepted the higher bid in the middle of the job you dont get repeat work very often that way pan held its hands up i understand but consider this i am indirectly the one who hired you stanuel had to object the resistance i run it pan smiled i know everything it does who it hires and in many cases i give it the orders stanuel felt like hed been thrown into a freezing cold vat of water he lost his breath what do you mean you infiltrated it they had lost even before theyd started pan turned to the mercenary stanuel is bewildered as are many by what they created pepper im merely the amalgamated avatar of the converged will of all the simulations made to run this colony the voter simulations kept taking up energy so the master processing program came up with a more elegant solution me why run millions of emulators when it could fuse them all into a single expression of its will that would run the government a clever solution pepper said a technodemocracy even more so than the vanilla kind is messy dangerously so with study committees and votes on everything things that needed to be done quickly didnt get done in time so the emulations decided to put forward a bill buried in the middle of some other obscure administrivia the vote was that emulations be given command of the government stanuel stepped forward we woke up and found that in a single moment all of haven had been disenfranchised by your own desires and predictive voting algorithms pan said in a way yes in a way no stanuel spit at the dictatorial hologram in front him then the emulators decided that a single amalgamation an avatar and expression of all their wills would work better so then even our own voting patterns turned over their power not surprising pepper said you didnt have the maturity to keep your own vote you turned it over to the copies of yourselves why be surprised that the copies would do something similar and turn to a benevolent dictator of their own creation pan looked pleased dictators arent so bad if theyre the right dictator and its hard coded into my very being to look out for the community thats why i look like this it waved a hand over its face im the average of all the faces in haven political poll modeling shows that were i to run for office if would be almost guaranteed based on physiological responses alone stanuel looked at pepper pan may have infiltrated but you were still paid to destroy it do it no pan said you might pull that trigger but if you do you destroy what the people of haven really wanted what they desired and what they worked very hard to create pepper even if they didnt realize they consciously wanted it ive heard you get the government you deserve pepper said but this is something else they created their own tyranny but pepper im not a tyrant if they vote as a whole to oust me they can do it pepper moved over to the one of great windows to look out at the inside rim of haven thousands of distant portholes dotted the giant wheel lit up by the people living inside the rooms across from them look around you pan implored there are plenty who like what im doing im rebuilding parts of haven that have been neglected for years im improving agriculture as we speak ive made the choices that were hard got things into motion that just sat there while people quibbled over them i am action i am progress stanuel kicked forward and pepper glanced back at him i think stanuel objects pan sighed yes a few will be disaffected they will always be disaffected that was why i created outlets for the disaffected because they are a part of me as well but my plea to you pepper is not to break this great experiment i can offer you more money a place of safety here whenever you would want it and haven as a powerful ally to your needs pepper nodded and sat in the air his legs folded i have a question proceed why do they call you pan they call me pan because its short for panopticon an old experiment if you were to create a round jail with a tower in the center with open cell walls facing it and the ability to look into every cell you would have the ultimate surveillance society the panopticon in some ways haven is just that with me at its center pepper chuckled id half expected some insane military dictator wearing a head of antlers calling himself pan pan did not laugh it leaned closer pepper understand me this is not your fight im the naturally elected ruler of haven the choice to remove me that isnt yours i did not bring you here to destroy me but for other reasons the choice the word affected pepper in some way stanuel could not figure out he looked over at stanuel then if youre a benevolent ruler you will escort me off haven leave stanuel alive and move on to other things after all it was your orders that set stanuel down this path of course its that or a sentence in one of havens residential rooms youll be locked in but comfortable there do have to be ways to handle such things exile or confinement okay mr pan okay my work here is done pepper moved towards stanuel with a flick of his feet come on stanuel its time to leave the tower stanuel could hardly look pepper in the eye i cant believe you left there pan made a good argument pan offered to pay you more thats all theres that but i wont take it pepper scratched his head if i destroyed pan what would you do stanuel frowned what do you mean you said the emulations wouldnt be allowed to hold direct control earlier does that mean youd allow the emulations to come back and decide votes for you one assumes we might have not gotten them right but if we can fix that error things can go back to the way they were pepper unpacked his suit and stepped into it it crinkled and cracked as he zipped it up and then ill be back because youll repeat the same patter all over again what for all your assumptions youre not quite seeing the pattern deep down somewhere you all want pan you dont want the responsibility of voting you want the easy result thats not true stanuel objected oh come on think of all the times princes and princesses are adored and feted think of all the actors and great people we adore and fawn over that doesnt make us slavish followers pepper cocked his head no but we still cant escape the instincts we carry from being a small band of huntergatherers making their way across a plain depending on a single leader who knew the ins and outs of their tiny tribe and listened to their feedback that doesnt scale so we have inelegant hacks around it stanuel you all created a technological creature able to view you all and listen to all your feedback and embody a benevolent single tribal leader not only was it born out of your unconscious needs even your own emulations overwhelmingly voted it into power as sole ruler of haven stanuel raised his hand to halt pepper thats all true and over the last four days weve argued around all this when we found out about the vote but pepper whether perfect or not we cant allow a single person to rule us it goes against everything we believe in everything we worked for when we created haven pepper nodded i know and youre going to walk away i have to because this wasnt some power grab it was the will of your people there was a vote pan is right it is the rightful ruler but pepper pointed at him im not leaving you emptyhanded what do you mean he handed over the backpack and pressed a small stick with a button into stanuels hand the e m p device is in the backpack you wont get anywhere near the tower to take out just pan but if you trigged it in the hub after i leave it will shut haven down pan will have backups and his supporters will protect the tower but if enough people feel like you do you can storm it with the guns in that pack youre asking me to fight you know your history the tree of liberty needs to be watered with some blood every now and then thomas jefferson i think said that most of your ancestors fought for it you could have kept it had you just taken the time to vote yourself instead of leaving it to something else i dont know if i can stanuel was bewildered hed never done anything violent in his life pepper smiled you might find pan is more willing to fold than you imagine think about it with that he stepped into the airlock the door shut with a hiss and the spacesuit faded into camouflage black as pepper disappeared inside whatever stealth ship had bought him to haven stanuel stood there he pulled the backpacks straps up over onto his shoulders and made his way toward the gardens mulling over the mercenarys last words a hologram of pan waited for him at the entrance to the gardens but no goons were nearby stanuel had expected to be captured with the threat of a long confinement ahead of him but it was just the electronic god of haven and stanuel you didnt understand what he meant did you pan said it really was the panopticon listening to everything that happened in haven no stanuel held the switch to the e m p in his hand waiting for some trick was he going to get shot in the head by a sniper but pan said it didnt use violence maybe a tranquilizer dart of some sort i told you pan said i also created the resistance but that doesnt make any sense stanuel said it does if you stop thinking of me as a person but as an avatar of your collective emulators every ruling system has an opposition the day after i was voted into power i had to create a series of checks and balances against myself that was the resistance but i was recruited by people and they were recruited by my people working for me who were told they were to create an opposition tame as a honey trap pan flickered as he walked through a tree an incongruous vision as stanuel floated through the no gravity garden why would you want to die because i may not be what all of you want just what most of you want i have to create an opportunity for myself to be stopped or else i really am a tyrant and not the best solution that is why pepper was hired to bring the e m p device aboard that was why ultimately he left it with you so its all in my hands stanuel said yes live in a better economy a safer economy but one ruled by what you have created or muddle along yourselves pan moved in front of stanuel floating with him stanuel held up the metal tube and hovered his thumb over the button men should be free pan nodded sadly but stanuel you all will never be able to get things done the way i can it will be such a mess of compromise personality mistakes wrong choices emotional choices mob rule and imperfect decisions you could well destroy haven with your imprecise decisions it was a siren call but even though pan was perfect and right it was the same song that led smart men to call tyrants leaders and do so happily the promise of quick action clean and fast decisions alluring i know it will be messy stanuel said voice quavering and i have no idea how it will work out but at least it will be ours he pressed the button and watched as the lights throughout haven dimmed and flickered pan disappeared with a sigh a ghost banished the darkness marched its glorious way through the cavernous gardens toward stanuel who folded up in the air by a tree while he waited for the dark to take him in its freeing embrace civilization by vylar kaftan vylar kaftan writes speculative fiction of all genres including science fiction fantasy horror and slipstream her work has appeared in lightspeed magazine giganotosaurus realms of fantasy strange horizons clarkesworld cosmos escape pod beneath ceaseless skies sybils garage the way of the wizard and in the world fantasy awardwinning anthology paper cities she lives with her husband shannon in northern california if you were young in the s you probably read at least one choose your own adventure novel getting to pick your own way through the story always seemed so thrilling until you came to the end and realized no matter what choices you made it always turned out the same sometimes you even found yourself stuck in a loop repeating the same stupid action over and over it was good training for real life wasnt it our next story isnt a cautionary tale of government gone bad or a social principle run amok its quite simply an analysis of civilization and the chilling recognition that for good or bad people in groups just cant seem to get things right historians will agree society after society keeps making the same ridiculous mistakes just like your characters did when you steered them through those choose your own adventure books beginning you have a civilization it doesnt matter which one lets say its modern western civilization its got fast food and sporting events which is all you really need western technology gives you great military power you have fantastic unstoppable tanks and heatseeking missiles to keep you safe its a good place to start you could also have chosen a remote aboriginal tribe in the center of australia one with nuts and berries and spears and ropes or you could have chosen communist china or that group of scientists living in antarctica but lets stick to modern western civilization lets give you people too well call them john and jane if you have a civilization then you probably have at least two people in it now with your civilization comes a political system maybe your system is a democracy and everyone gets a vote except the felons and child molesters maybe your system is a republic and you market it as a democracy because it looks better on the brochures maybe your system is totalitarian and you force everyone to enjoy the sound of that complicated word totalitarian but a major choice awaits you are you traditional bound by the past certain that the old ways are the best because weve always done it that way so there or are you radical lured by the future always hoping that the new ways will be better than the old because weve never done it that way so there be warned the future of your civilization depends on your choice john and janes lives are at stake if you choose tradition go to section if you choose radicalism go to section tradition youre a traditionalist or a blind follower or just someone who reads everything in order from start to finish it doesnt matter you end up in the same place anyway so you have a civilization you have tv dinners and expensive cars you hold elections this is the way its always been done and this is the way it must be never mind those fruitcakes in wigs who fought against the colonial powers they were supporting freedom and liberty and other words that make great advertising the corporations live off the people and the people trust the corporations john and jane relax knowing that everything around them has worked for centuries things stagnate you hold more elections or pretend to the people in power have always been in power the world is the way its always been the police have always arrested people in the streets the freedom to speak has always been restricted in the name of security the corporations destroy the people and thats the way its always been and why would you question that citizen congratulations youve got fascism go to section fascism how nice for you that you look so good in jackboots and a uniform your secret police are so dangerous that theyre sexy they kick the enemies of the state in the street like rockettes in steeltoed boots you sleep with national security books on your nightstand and a revolver under your pillow or maybe you just have secret meetings of secret societies in secret boardrooms sealing fates with secret handshakes the artists fill the gulags and hey cheap labor so what if its not fair and equal equality is for hippies john and jane trust you to keep them safe at all times when youre fascist youre always right because god or satan or your left boot told you what to do divine power is with you that means that youre right and youd better make sure everyone else knows it too lets go to war go to section complacency youve been in power an awfully long time now why pay attention any longer theres too many good shows on tv or in the bullring or in the arenas or whatever youve got you talk about the great sporting events on television and visit fastfood drivethroughs you worry about whether your toothpaste is really doing all that a toothpaste should after a while you stop paying attention to anything at all john and jane are off doing something but youre not sure what this is the way its always been and this is the way it will always be is this progress you arent sure go to section radicalism you decide to experiment artists love your society painters color skyscrapers and sculptors make art of garbage directors shoot movies in black light and show them in darkened theatres musicians shred the works of previous centuries corporations hold festivals to mock their own logos people are changing things from the way theyve always been just to make changes broken furniture becomes the new fashion everyone lives with six uncles and an aunt john and jane change their names to isthmus and quagmire no matter what the new idea is it must be better than the old you remember that you havent changed governments in a while throw out the old bring in the new its time for a revolution go to section revolution you hand out pamphlets in the street citizens march in protest of everything the hero of the people takes over in a bloodless coup the former powers all commit a penitent suicide on the same day in the same prison under your watchful eye how convenient you take note of all the former rules because if thats how they did it now you must do it differently you charter a new constitution in a different font from the old one oh good this regime is much better than the last one you suppress the counterrevolutionaries they want to change everything any disagreement in society must be squelched john and jane must have their freedom for the good of the new regime go to section war oh boy its war your regiments march like clockwork toys colonel mustard is your general with his dashing moustache and monocle your hats are quite classy with a feather for each soldier for officers two on the streets your noble supporters weep with pride as their loved ones march past the people support the cause both sides if its a civil war or if they dont you silence them for national security jane blows john a kiss as he shoulders his weapon and heads away hell come back a hero and they will marry your soldiers fight bravely they pose for photos every time they save a small child from tyranny theres no blood at least not in the photos the enemy cant oppose the side of truth and justice which youre quite certain is you congratulations youve won the war now for the next step what kind of society do you want to build is your future an ideal utopia or a dark dystopia if you build utopia go to section if you build dystopia go to section utopia medicine disease has been eliminated and people live to be in perfect health as a result your people have more time to contribute to society and to enjoy their lives agriculture food is massproduced by advanced techniques so that there is plenty for everyone special additives in the food guarantee nutrition and health for every citizen employment everyone is guaranteed a job that pays a living wage so that all people have the means to support themselves housing no one is homeless citizens are guaranteed safe affordable housing education citizens may study any available information the government provides the entirety of human history and current events and encourages people to read law all issues are decided by fair courts mistakes are never made government the government wants to make sure the citizens are happy wow what a wonderful world youve built for yourself now all that remains is to help everyone else enjoy utopia go to section dystopia medicine disease has been eliminated and people live to be in perfect health as a result your world is overpopulated and resources are scarce agriculture food is massproduced by advanced techniques so that there is plenty for everyone special additives in the food guarantee obedience to the government employment everyone is guaranteed a job that pays a living wage so that people are trapped in nightmarish jobs that they cant leave housing no one is homeless people without homes live in institutions where they are subjected to conditioning and experiments education citizens may study any available information the government provides the information that citizens are authorized to see and records who is reading it law all issues are decided by fair courts mistakes of course are never made how could they be government the government wants to make sure the citizens are happy oh dear what a horrible world youve made for yourself hey those people next door in that other place they have utopia and you dont misery loves company its time to change some things go to section zeal rows of smiling identical people sing a patriotic anthem in perfect tune in utopiadystopia you are never alone your society is happy or its not someone else has it better or they dont but youre sure about one thing other people are different from you and thats dangerous everyone else must share in your happiness or unhappiness everyone else must be just like you like jane like john oh boy its war again go to section war again i hope youre not surprised it always comes back to war the details change but the patterns remain the same the last war was just for fun but this one is serious youre blowing the left arms off babies and burning yearold monasteries you perfect the technique of keeping a soldier alive despite mortal injury the technique is quite helpful for spies on suicide missions your soldiers pray to god in the field but you dont have time to answer youre busy making military decisions this war is serious and hard choices must be made john marches off again and someday will return to jane or he wont thats war the question is did you win will you dominate these notlikeyou people and rule them with an iron hand or did you lose and now face the destruction of your society if you won go to section if you lost go to section tyranny youre mad at these people these pathetic creatures you conquered they started that horrible war now you must teach them a lesson you make them build bigger stadiums and better fast food restaurants perhaps its tyranny but its oppression with a smile because you love them thats why you want them to be like you just like you and once they learn your lesson they will be like you you want them to enjoy their world as much as you enjoy yours or hate it the way you hate your own its all for the good of john and jane who really should appreciate you more unfortunately your smiles arent enough to convince them of your love theres always room for assassination go to section assassination oops someone got crabby and killed your leader in the shower its terribly messy with brains splattered on the bathroom wall who do you blame why its obvious its the vicepresident secret police communists students boy scouts mothers against drunk driving anyone who isnt you people not you are responsible people not you must pay retaliation is swift and effective you kill their leader and the other leaders and some people who arent leaders and they kill more of your leaders and nonleaders the streets flow with blood is this war again again no its just collapse government structures tumble schools are boarded up garbage piles up because no one removes it people burn textbooks for warmth john and jane live on scraps from their neighbors maybe someone finds an atomic weapon and maybe they use it maybe they dont need to whichever way it happens youve reached the apocalypse go to section apocalypse oh no your civilization is destroyed no more fast food no more sporting events no more twoforone buffalo wing specials its a mushroom cloud billowing away in the breeze or a plague where everyones skin explodes with toxic pustules or intense radiation that boils the brains of of the population all of the nice families with children maybe happy maybe not are vaporized like rain in a volcano or the corpses pile up like ants that ate poisoned bait the survivors walk among the living dead stealing granola bars from their purses but leaving the wallets because who needs money anymore nuclear winter sets in or a biological disaster or just sheer depression but there are a few survivors there always are and they can start over go to section survival groups of ragged survivors struggle across the wasteland or rubble or abandoned cities john and jane take things one day at a time their challenge is to live until the night then to live through the night and to live another day food and shelter are scarce many people dont make it with time the population balances so that it can support itself on the meager resources this takes months or it takes years but when enough time passes a small tribe sits in a cave or at an oasis or by a river john or jane says remember how much better things used to be the others throw rocks at him or her and demand not to be reminded they want to forget the dead times that cant be revived but jane or john watches and waits and remembers once the others have truly forgotten and the past has become myth she has an idea she says to the others i will lead you to happiness and freedom everyone follow me john or jane unifies the tribes jane or john thinks that she has a new idea better than anyones ever had something that will work as always certain choices must be made but jane and john are no different from you in the end they arent smarter or wiser theyre just someone else go to section beginning again did you think the choices were terrible they were are you disappointed in where your choices have led you dont be other leaders have tried and failed the future is full of the same choices as the past nobody likes the choices but civilization keeps moving do you feel that youre at the beginning again you are its a circle but theres always hope for change hope that the circle becomes a spiral staircase look here see this a room with a table its evening or night look closely at the three people sitting around the table john jane their child john smiles he needs a shave or perhaps he is bearded jane serves lasagna or chicken casserole as she tells her family about her day the child is a girl or a boy the child sits in a highchair and gazes adoringly at john and jane after they eat the parents take the child upstairs singing a lullaby its been a good day their world is radical or traditional they vote like responsible citizens but theyre more excited by the child learning to walk the child grows up in revolution or not and marries a man or a woman or no one at all she raises a family in utopiadystopia or a world that is neither when the apocalypse comes she stays with the kids who are grown up themselves and having a child despite the destruction a baby is born you have a civilization for further reading compiled by ross e lockhart what follows is a selected bibliography of noteworthy dystopian and utopian fiction dystopia and utopia are often considered to be opposing sides of a coin but perhaps the two lie closer than one might at first suspect orwells nineteen eightyfour for instance may have ended badly for winston smith but inner party loyalist obrien undoubtedly got a promotion for bringing such a dangerous radical as smith to justice titles notable for their high
