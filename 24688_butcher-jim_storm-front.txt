storm front jim butcher for debbie chester who taught me everything i really needed to know about writing and for my father who taught me everything i really needed to know about living i miss you dad chapter one i heard the mailman approach my office door half an hour earlier than usual he didnt sound right his footsteps fell more heavily jauntily and he whistled a new guy he whistled his way to my office door then fell silent for a moment then he laughed then he knocked i winced my mail comes through the mail slot unless its registered i get a really limited selection of registered mail and its never good news i got up out of my office chair and opened the door the new mailman who looked like a basketball with arms and legs and a sunburned balding head was chuckling at the sign on the door glass he glanced at me and hooked a thumb toward the sign youre kidding right i read the sign people change it occasionally and shook my head no im serious can i have my mail please so uh like parties shows stuff like that he looked past me as though he expected to see a white tiger or possibly some skimpily clad assistants prancing around my oneroom office i sighed not in the mood to get mocked again and reached for the mail he held in his hand no not like that i dont do parties he held on to it his head tilted curiously so what some kinda fortuneteller cards and crystal balls and things no i told him im not a psychic i tugged at the mail he held on to it what are you then whats the sign on the door say it says harry dresden wizard thats me i confirmed an actual wizard he asked grinning as though i should let him in on the joke spells and potions demons and incantations subtle and quick to anger not so subtle i jerked the mail out of his hand and looked pointedly at his clipboard can i sign for my mail please the new mailmans grin vanished replaced with a scowl he passed over the clipboard to let me sign for the mail another late notice from my landlord and said youre a nut thats what you are he took his clipboard back and said you have a nice day sir i watched him go typical i muttered and shut the door my name is harry blackstone copperfield dresden conjure by it at your own risk im a wizard i work out of an office in midtown chicago as far as i know im the only openly practicing professional wizard in the country you can find me in the yellow pages under wizards believe it or not im the only one there my ad looks like this harry dresdenwizard lost items found paranormal investigations consulting advice reasonable rates no love potions endless purses parties or other entertainment youd be surprised how many people call just to ask me if im serious but then if youd seen the things id seen if you knew half of what i knew youd wonder how anyone could not think i was serious the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of the new millennium had seen something of a renaissance in the public awareness of the paranormal psychics haunts vampiresyou name it people still didnt take them seriously but all the things science had promised us hadnt come to pass disease was still a problem starvation was still a problem violence and crime and war were still problems in spite of the advance of technology things just hadnt changed the way everyone had hoped and thought they would science the largest religion of the twentieth century had become somewhat tarnished by images of exploding space shuttles crack babies and a generation of complacent americans who had allowed the television to raise their children people were looking for somethingi think they just didnt know what and even though they were once again starting to open their eyes to the world of magic and the arcane that had been with them all the while they still thought i must be some kind of joke anyway it had been a slow month a slow pair of months actually my rent from february didnt get paid until the tenth of march and it was looking like it might be even longer until i got caught up for this month my only job had been the previous week when id gone down to branson missouri to investigate a country singers possibly haunted house it hadnt been my client hadnt been happy with that answer and had been even less happy when i suggested he lay off of any intoxicating substances and try to get some exercise and sleep and see if that didnt help things more than an exorcism id gotten travel expenses plus an hours pay and gone away feeling i had done the honest righteous and impractical thing i heard later that hed hired a shyster psychic to come in and perform a ceremony with a lot of incense and black lights some people i finished up my paperback and tossed it into the done box there was a pile of read and discarded paperbacks in a cardboard box on one side of my desk the spines bent and the pages mangled im terribly hard on books i was eyeing the pile of unread books considering which to start next given that i had no real work to do when my phone rang i stared at it in a somewhat surly fashion we wizards are terrific at brooding after the third ring when i thought i wouldnt sound a little too eager i picked up the receiver and said dresden oh is this um harry dresden the ah wizard her tone was apologetic as though she were terribly afraid she would be insulting me no i thought its harry dresden the ah lizard harry the wizard is one door down it is the prerogative of wizards to be grumpy it is not however the prerogative of freelance consultants who are late on their rent so instead of saying something smart i told the woman on the phone yes maam how can i help you today i um she said im not sure ive lost something and i think maybe you could help me finding lost articles is a specialty i said what would i be looking for there was a nervous pause my husband she said she had a voice that was a little hoarse like a cheerleader whod been working a long tournament but had enough weight of years in it to place her as an adult my eyebrows went up maam im not really a missingpersons specialist have you contacted the police or a private investigator no she said quickly no they cant that is i havent oh dear this is all so complicated not something someone can talk about on the phone im sorry to have taken up your time mr dresden hold on now i said quickly im sorry you didnt tell me your name there was that nervous pause again as though she were checking a sheet of written notes before answering call me monica people who know diddly about wizards dont like to give us their names theyre convinced that if they give a wizard their name from their own lips it could be used against them to be fair theyre right i had to be as polite and harmless as i could she was about to hang up out of pure indecision and i needed the job i could probably turn hubby up if i worked at it okay monica i told her trying to sound as melodious and friendly as i could if you feel your situation is of a sensitive nature maybe you could come by my office and talk about it if it turns out that i can help you best i will and if not then i can direct you to someone i think can help you better i gritted my teeth and pretended i was smiling no charge it must have been the no charge that did it she agreed to come right out to the office and told me that she would be there in an hour that put her estimated arrival at about twothirty plenty of time to go out and get some lunch then get back to the office to meet her the phone rang again almost the instant i put it down making me jump i peered at it i dont trust electronics anything manufactured after the forties is suspectand doesnt seem to have much liking for me you name it cars radios telephones tvs vcrsnone of them seem to behave well for me i dont even like to use automatic pencils i answered the phone with the same false cheer i had summoned up for monica husbandmissing this is dresden may i help you harry i need you at the madison in the next ten minutes can you be there the voice on the other end of the line was also a womans cool brisk businesslike why lieutenant murphy i gushed overflowing with saccharine its good to hear from you too its been so long oh theyre fine fine and your family save it harry ive got a couple of bodies here and i need you to take a look around i sobered immediately karrin murphy was the director of special investigations out of downtown chicago a de facto appointee of the police commissioner to investigate any crimes dubbed unusual vampire attacks troll mauraudings and faery abductions of children didnt fit in very neatly on a police reportbut at the same time people got attacked infants got stolen property was damaged or destroyed and someone had to look into it in chicago or pretty much anywhere in chicagoland that person was karrin murphy i was her library of the supernatural on legs and a paid consultant for the police department but two bodies two deaths by means unknown i hadnt handled anything like that for her before where are you i asked her madison hotel on tenth seventh floor thats only a fifteenminute walk from my office i said so you can be here in fifteen minutes good um i said i looked at the clock monica nolastname would be here in a little more than fortyfive minutes ive sort of got an appointment dresden ive sort of got a pair of corpses with no leads and no suspects and a killer walking around loose your appointment can wait my temper flared it does that occasionally it cant actually i said but ill tell you what ill stroll on over and take a look around and be back here in time for it have you had lunch yet she asked what she repeated the question no i said dont there was a pause and when she spoke again there was a sort of greenish tone to her words its bad how bad are we talking here murph her voice softened and that scared me more than any images of gore or violent death could have murphy was the original tough girl and she prided herself on never showing weakness its bad harry please dont take too long special crimes is itching to get their fingers on this one and i know you dont like people to touch the scene before you can look around im on the way i told her already standing and pulling on my jacket seventh floor she reminded me see you there okay i turned off the lights to my office went out the door and locked up behind me frowning i wasnt sure how long it was going to take to investigate murphys scene and i didnt want to miss out on speaking with monica askmenoquestions so i opened the door again got out a piece of paper and a thumbtack and wrote out briefly back for appointment at dresden that done i started down the stairs i rarely use the elevator even though im on the fifth floor like i said i dont trust machines theyre always breaking down on me just when i need them besides which if i were someone in this town using magic to kill people two at a time and i didnt want to get caught id make sure that i removed the only practicing wizard the police department kept on retainer i liked my odds on the stairwell a lot better than i did in the cramped confines of the elevator paranoid probably but just because youre paranoid doesnt mean that there isnt an invisible demon about to eat your face chapter two karrin murphy was waiting for me outside the madison karrin and i are a study in contrasts where i am tall and lean shes short and stocky where i have dark hair and dark eyes shes got shirley temple blond locks and baby blues where my features are all lean and angular with a hawkish nose and a sharp chin hers are round and smooth with the kind of cute nose youd expect on a cheerleader it was cool and windy like it usually is in march and she wore a long coat that covered her pantsuit murphy never wore dresses though i suspected shed have muscular wellshaped legs like a gymnast she was built for function and had a pair of trophies in her office from aikido tournaments to prove it her hair was cut at shoulder length and whipped out wildly in the spring wind she wasnt wearing earrings and her makeup was of sufficient quality and quantity that it was tough to tell she had on any at all she looked more like a favorite aunt or a cheerful mother than a hardbitten homicide detective dont you have any other jackets dresden she asked as i came within hailing distance there were several police cars parked illegally in front of the building she glanced at my eyes for a half second and then away quickly i had to give her credit it was more than most people did it wasnt really dangerous unless you did it for several seconds but i was used to anyone who knew i was a wizard making it a point not to glance at my face i looked down at my black canvas duster with its heavy mantling and waterproof lining and sleeves actually long enough for my arms whats wrong with this one it belongs on the set of el dorado and she snorted an indelicate sound from so small a woman and spun on her heel to walk toward the hotels front doors i caught up and walked a little ahead of her she sped her pace so did i we raced one another toward the front door with increasing speed through the puddles left over from last nights rain my legs were longer i got there first i opened the door for her and gallantly gestured for her to go in it was an old contest of ours maybe my values are outdated but i come from an old school of thought i think that men ought to treat women like something other than just shorter weaker men with breasts try and convict me if im a bad person for thinking so i enjoy treating a woman like a lady opening doors for her paying for shared meals giving flowersall that sort of thing it irritates the hell out of murphy who had to fight and claw and play dirty with the hairiest men in chicago to get as far as she has she glared up at me while i stood there holding open the door but there was a reassurance about the glare a relaxation she took an odd sort of comfort in our ritual annoying as she usually found it how bad was it up on the seventh floor anyway we rode the elevator in a sudden silence we knew one another well enough by this time that the silences were not uncomfortable i had a good sense of murphy an instinctual grasp for her moods and patterns of thoughtsomething i develop whenever im around someone for any length of time whether its a natural talent or a supernatural one i dont know my instincts told me that murphy was tense stretched as tight as piano wire she kept it off her face but there was something about the set of her shoulders and neck the stiffness of her back that made me aware of it or maybe i was just projecting it onto her the confines of the elevator made me a bit nervous i licked my lips and looked around the interior of the car my shadow and murphys fell on the floor and almost looked as though they were sprawled there there was something about it that bothered me a nagging little instinct that i blew off as a case of nerves steady harry she let out a harsh breath just as the elevator slowed then sucked in another one before the doors could open as though she were planning on holding it for as long as we were on the floor and breathing only when she got back in the elevator again blood smells a certain way a kind of sticky almost metallic odor and the air was full of it when the elevator doors opened my stomach quailed a little bit but i swallowed manfully and followed murphy out of the elevator and down the hall past a couple of uniform cops who recognized me and waved me past without asking to see the little laminated card the city had given me granted even in a bigcity department like chicago pd they didnt exactly call in a horde of consultants i went down in the paperwork as a psychic consultant i think but still unprofessional of the boys in blue murphy preceded me into the room the smell of blood grew thicker but there wasnt anything gruesome behind door number one the outer room of the suite looked like some kind of a sitting room done in rich tones of red and gold like a set from an old movie in the thirtiesexpensivelooking but somehow faux nonetheless dark rich leather covered the chairs and my feet sank into the thick rustcolored shag of the carpet the velvet velour curtains had been drawn and though the lights were all on the place still seemed a little too dark a little too sensual in its textures and colors it wasnt the kind of room where you sit and read a book voices came from a doorway to my right wait here a minute murphy told me then she went through the door to the right of the entryway and into what i supposed was the bedroom of the suite i wandered around the sitting room with my eyes mostly closed noting things leather couch two leather chairs stereo and television in a black glossy entertainment center champagne bottle warming in a stand holding a brimming tub of what had been ice the night before with two empty glasses set beside it there was a red rose petal on the floor clashing with the carpeting but then in that room what didnt a bit to one side under the skirt of one of the leather recliners was a little piece of satiny cloth i bent at the waist and lifted the skirt with one hand careful not to touch anything a pair of blacksatin panties a tiny triangle with lace coming off the points lay there one strap snapped as though the thong had simply been torn off kinky the stereo system was state of the art though not an expensive brand i took a pencil from my pocket and pushed the play button with the eraser gentle sensual music filled the room a low bass a driving drumbeat wordless vocals the heavy breathing of a woman as background the music continued for a few seconds more and then it began to skip over a section about two seconds long repeating it over and over again i grimaced like i said i have this effect on machinery it has something to do with being a wizard with working with magical forces the more delicate and modern the machine is the more likely it is that something will go wrong if i get close enough to it i can kill a copier at fifty paces the love suite came a mans voice drawing the word love out into luuuuuuuv what do you think mister man hello detective carmichael i said without turning around carmichaels rather light nasal voice had a distinctive quality he was murphys partner and the resident skeptic convinced that i was nothing more than a charlatan scamming the city out of its hardearned money were you saving the panties to take home yourself or did you just overlook them i turned and looked at him he was short and overweight and balding with beady bloodshot eyes and a weak chin his jacket was rumpled and there were food stains on his tie all of which served to conceal a razor intellect he was a sharp cop and absolutely ruthless at tracking down killers he walked over to the chair and looked down not bad sherlock he said but thats just foreplay waitll you see the main attraction ill have a bucket waiting for you he turned and killed the malfunctioning cd player with a jab from the eraser end of his own pencil i widened my eyes at him to let him know how terrified i was then walked past him and into the bedroom and regretted it i looked noted details mechanically and quietly shut the door on the part of my head that had started screaming the second i entered the room they must have died sometime the night before as rigor mortis had already set in they were on the bed she was astride him body leaned back back bowed like a dancers the curves of her breasts making a lovely outline he stretched beneath her a lean and powerfully built man arms reaching out and grasping at the satin sheets gathering them in his fists had it been an erotic photograph it would have made a striking tableau except that the lovers rib cages on the upper left side of their torsos had expanded outward through their skin the ribs jabbing out like ragged snapped knives arterial blood had sprayed out of their bodies all the way to the mirror on the ceiling along with pulped gelatinous masses of flesh that had to be what remained of their hearts standing over them i could see into the upper cavity of the bodies i noted the now greyish lining around the motionless left lungs and the edges of the ribs which apparently were forced outward and snapped by some force within it definitely cut down on the erotic potential the bed was in the middle of the room giving it a subtle emphasis the bedroom followed the decor of the sitting rooma lot of red a lot of plush fabrics a little over the top unless viewed in candlelight there were indeed candles in holders on the wall now burned down to the nubs and extinguished i stepped closer to the bed and walked around it the carpet squelched as i did the little screaming part of my brain safely locked up behind doors of selfcontrol and strict training continued gibbering i tried to ignore it really i did but if i didnt get out of that room in a hurry i was going to start crying like a little girl so i took in the details fast the woman was in her twenties in fabulous condition at least i thought she had been it was hard to tell she had hair the color of chestnuts cut in a pageboy style and it seemed dyed to me her eyes were only partly open and i couldnt quite guess at their color beyond notdark vaguely green the man was probably in his forties and had the kind of fitness that comes from a lifetime of conditioning there was a tattoo on his right bicep a winged dagger that the pull of the satin sheets half concealed there were scars on his knuckles layers deep and across his lower abdomen was a vicious narrow puckered scar that i guessed must have come from a knife wound there were discarded clothes arounda tux for him a little sheath of a black dress and a pair of pumps for her there were a pair of overnight bags unopened and set neatly aside probably by a porter i looked up carmichael and murphy were watching me in silence i shrugged at them well murphy demanded are we dealing with magic here or arent we either that or it was really incredible sex i told her carmichael snorted i laughed a little tooand that was all the screaming part of my brain needed to slam open the doors id shut on it my stomach revolted and heaved and i lurched out of the room carmichael true to his word had set a stainlesssteel bucket outside the room and i fell to my knees throwing up it only took me a few seconds to control myself againbut i didnt want to go back in that room i didnt need to see what was there anymore i didnt want to see the two dead people whose hearts had literally exploded out of their chests and someone had used magic to do it they had used magic to wreak harm on another violating the first law the white council was going to go into collective apoplexy this hadnt been the act of a malign spirit or a malicious entity or the attack of one of the many creatures of the nevernever like vampires or trolls this had been the premeditated deliberate act of a sorcerer a wizard a human being able to tap into the fundamental energies of creation and life itself it was worse than murder it was twisted wretched perversion as though someone had bludgeoned another person to death with a botticelli turned something of beauty to an act of utter destruction if youve never touched it its hard to explain magic is created by life and most of all by the awareness intelligence emotions of a human being to end such a life with the same magic that was born from it was hideous almost incestuous somehow i sat up again and was breathing hard shaking and tasting the bile in my mouth when murphy came back out of the room with carmichael all right harry murphy said lets have it what do you see happening here i took a moment to collect my thoughts before answering they came in they had some champagne they danced for a while made out over there by the stereo then went into the bedroom they were in there for less than an hour it hit them when they were getting to the high point less than an hour carmichael said how do you figure cd was only an hour and ten long figure a few minutes for dancing and drinking and then theyre in the room was the cd playing when they found them no murphy said then it hadnt been set on a loop i figure they wanted music just to make things perfect given the room and all carmichael grunted sourly nothing we hadnt already figured out for ourselves he said to murphy hed better come up with more than this murphy shot carmichael a look that said shut up then said softly i need more harry i ran one of my hands back over my hair theres only two ways anyone could have managed this the first is by evocation evocation is the most direct spectacular and noisy form of expressed magic or sorcery explosions fire that sort of thing but i doubt it was an evocator who did this why murphy demanded i heard her pencil scritching on the notepad she always kept with her because you have to be able to see or touch where you want your effect to go i told her line of sight only the man or woman would have had to be there in the room with them tough to hide forensic evidence with something like that and anyone who was skilled enough to pull off a spell like that would have had the sense to use a gun instead its easier whats the other option murphy asked thaumaturgy i said as above so below make something happen on a small scale and give it the energy to happen on a large scale carmichael snorted what bullshit murphys voice sounded skeptical how would that work harry could it be done from somewhere else i nodded the killer would need to have something to connect him or her to the victims hair fingernails blood samples that sort of thing like a voodoo doll exactly the same thing yes theres fresh dye in the womans hair murphy said i nodded maybe if you can find out where she got her hair styled you could find something out i dont know is there anything else you could tell me that would be of use yes the killer knew the victims and im thinking it was a woman carmichael snorted i dont believe we got to sit here and listen to this nine times out of ten the killer knows the victim shut up carmichael murphy said what makes you say that harry i stood up and rubbed at my face with my hands the way magic works whenever you do something with it it comes from inside of you wizards have to focus on what theyre trying to do visualize it believe in it to make it work you cant make something happen that isnt a part of you inside the killer could have murdered them both and made it look like an accident but she did it this way to get it done this way she would have had to want them dead for very personal reasons to be willing to reach inside them like that revenge maybe maybe youre looking for a lover or a spouse also because of when they diedin the middle of sex it wasnt a coincidence emotions are a kind of channel for magic a path that can be used to get to you she picked a time when theyd be together and be charged up with lust she got samples to use as a focus and she planned it out in advance you dont do that to strangers crap carmichael said but this time it was more of an absentminded curse than anything directed at me murphy glared at me you keep saying she she challenged me why the hell do you think that i gestured toward the room because you cant do something that bad without a whole lot of hate i said women are better at hating than men they can focus it better let it go better hell witches are just plain meaner than wizards this feels like feminine vengeance of some kind to me but a man could have done it murphy said well i hedged christ you are a chauvinist pig dresden is it something that only a woman could have done well no i dont think so you dont think so carmichael drawled some expert i scowled at them both angry i havent really worked through the specifics of what id need to do to make somebodys heart explode murph as soon as i have occasion to ill be sure to let you know when will you be able to tell me something murphy asked i dont know i held up a hand forestalling her next comment i cant put a timer on this stuff murph it just cant be done i dont even know if i can do it at all much less how long it will take at fifty bucks an hour it better not be too long carmichael growled murphy glanced at him she didnt exactly agree with him but she didnt exactly slap him down either i took the opportunity to take a few long breaths calming myself down i finally looked back at them okay i asked who are they the victims you dont need to know that carmichael snapped ron murphy said i could really use some coffee carmichael turned to her he wasnt tall but he all but loomed over murphy aw come on murph this guys jerking your chain you dont really think hes going to be able to tell you anything worth hearing do you murphy regarded her partners sweaty beadyeyed face with a sort of frosty hauteur tough to pull off on someone six inches taller than she no cream two sugars dammit carmichael said he shot me a cold glance but didnt quite look at my eyes then jammed his hands into his pants pockets and stalked out of the room murphy followed him to the door her feet silent and shut it behind him the sitting room immediately became darker closer with the grinning ghoul of its former chintzy intimacy dancing in the smell of the blood and the memory of the two bodies in the next room the womans name was jennifer stanton she worked for the velvet room i whistled the velvet room was a highpriced escort service run by a woman named bianca bianca kept a flock of beautiful charming and witty women pandering them to the richest men in the area for hundreds of dollars an hour bianca sold the kind of female company that most men only see on television and the movies i also knew that she was a vampiress of considerable influence in the nevernever she had power with a capital p id tried to explain the nevernever to murphy before she didnt really comprehend it but she understood that bianca was a badass vampiress who sometimes squabbled for territory we both knew that if one of biancas girls was involved the vampiress must have been involved somehow too murphy cut right to the point was this part of one of biancas territorial disputes no i said unless shes having it with a human sorcerer a vampire even a vamp sorcerer couldnt have pulled off something like this outside of the nevernever could she be at odds with a human sorcerer murphy asked me possible but it doesnt sound like her she isnt that stupid what i didnt tell murphy was that the white council made sure that vampires who trifled with mortal practitioners never lived to brag about it i dont talk to regular people about the white council it just isnt done besides i said if a human wanted to take a shot at bianca by hitting her girls hed be better off to kill the girl and leave the customer healthy to let him spread the tale and scare off business mmph murphy said she wasnt convinced but she made notes of what i had said who was the man i asked her murphy looked up at me for a moment and then said evenly tommy tomm i blinked at her to let her know she hadnt revealed the mystery of the ages who tommy tomm she said johnny marcones bodyguard now it made sense gentleman johnny marcone had been the thug to emerge on top of the pile after the vargassi family had dissolved into internal strife the police department saw marcone as a mixed blessing after years of merciless struggle and bloody exchanges with the vargassis gentleman johnny tolerated no excesses in his organization and he didnt like freelancers operating in his city muggers bank robbers and drug dealers who were not a part of his organization somehow always seemed to get ratted out and turned in or else simply went missing and werent heard from again marcone was a civilizing influence on crimeand where he operated it was more of a problem in terms of scale than ever before an extremely shrewd businessman he had a battery of lawyers working for him that kept him fenced in from the law behind a barricade of depositions and papers and tape recordings the cops never said it but sometimes it seemed like they were almost reluctant to chase him marcone was better than the alternativeanarchy in the underworld i remember hearing he had an enforcer i said i guess he doesnt anymore murphy shrugged so it would seem so what will you do next run down this hairstylist angle i guess ill talk to bianca and to marcone but i can already tell you what theyll tell me she flicked her notebook closed and shook her head irritated i watched her for a minute she looked tired i told her so i am tired she replied tired of being looked at like im some sort of nutcase even carmichael my own partner thinks ive gone over the edge in all of this the rest of the station think so too i asked her most of them just scowl and spin their index fingers around their temples when they think im not looking and file my reports without ever reading them the rest are the ones who have run into something spooky out there and theyre scared shitless they dont want to believe in anything they didnt see on mister science when they were kids how about you me murphy smiled a curving of her lips that was a vibrantly feminine expression making her look entirely too pretty to be such a hardass the worlds falling apart at the seams harry i guess i just think people are pretty arrogant to believe weve learned everything there is to know in the past century or so what the hell i can buy that were just now starting to see the things around us in the dark again it appeals to the cynic in me i wish everyone thought like you do i said it would cut down on my crank calls she continued to smile at me impish but could you imagine a world where all the radio stations played abba we shared a laugh god that room needed a laugh hey harry murphy said grinning i could see the wheels spinning in her head yeah what you said about being able to figure out how the killer did this about how youre not sure you can do it yeah i know its bullshit why did you lie to me about it i stiffened christ she was good or maybe im just not much of a liar look murph i said theres some things you just dont do sometimes i dont want to get into the head of the slime i go after either but you do what needs to be done to finish the job i know what you mean harry no i said shortly you dont know and she didnt she didnt know about my past or the white council or the doom of damocles hanging over my head most days i could pretend i didnt know about it either all the council needed now was an excuse just an excuse to find me guilty of violating one of the seven laws of magic and the doom would drop if i started putting together a recipe for a murder spell and they found out about it that might be all the excuse they needed murph i told her i cant try figuring this spell out i cant go putting together the things id need to do it you just dont understand she glared at me without looking at my eyes i hadnt ever met anyone else who could pull that one off oh i understand i understand that ive got a killer loose that i cant catch in the act i understand that you know something that can help or you can at least find out something and i understand that if you dry up on me now im tearing your card out of the department rolodex and tossing it in the trash son of a bitch my consulting for the department paid a lot of my bills okay most of my bills i could sympathize with her i supposed if i was operating in the dark like she was id be nervous as hell too murphy didnt know anything about spells or rituals or talismans but she knew human hatred and violence all too well it wasnt as though i was actually going to be doing any black magic i told myself i was just going to be figuring out how it was done there was a difference i was helping the police in an investigation nothing more maybe the white council would understand that yeah right and maybe one of these days id go to an art museum and become well rounded murphy set the hook a second later she looked up at my eyes for a daring second before she turned away her face tired and honest and proud i need to know everything you can tell me harry please classic lady in distress for one of those liberated professional women she knew exactly how to jerk my oldfashioned chains around i gritted my teeth fine i said fine ill start on it tonight hoo boy the white council was going to love this one id just have to make sure they didnt find out about it murphy nodded and let out a breath without looking at me then she said lets get out of here and walked toward the door i didnt try to beat her to it when we walked out the uniform cops were still lazing around in the hall outside carmichael was nowhere to be seen the guys from forensics were there standing around impatiently waiting for us to come out then they gathered up their plastic bags and tweezers and lights and things and filed past us into the room murphy was brushing at her windblown hair with her hand while we waited for the ancient elevator to take its sweet time getting up to the seventh floor she was wearing a gold watch which reminded me oh hey i asked her what time is it she checked two twentyfive why i breathed out a curse and turned for the stairs im late for my appointment i fairly flew down the stairs ive had a lot of practice at them after all and i hit the lobby at a jog i managed to dodge a porter coming through the front doors with an armload of luggage and swung out onto the sidewalk at a lope i have long legs that eat a lot of ground i was running into the wind my black duster billowing out behind me it was several blocks to my building and after covering half of them i slowed to a walk i didnt want to arrive at my appointment with monica missingman puffing like a bellows with my hair windblown and my face streaming with sweat blame it on being out of shape from an inactive winter season but i was breathing hard it occupied enough of my attention that i didnt see the dark blue cadillac until it had pulled up beside me and a rather large man had stepped out of it onto the sidewalk in front of me he had bright red hair and a thick neck his face looked like someone had smashed it flat with a board repeatedly when he was a babyexcept for his jutting eyebrows he had narrow little blue eyes that got narrower as i sized him up i stopped and backed away then turned around two more men both of them as tall as me and a good deal heavier were slowing down from their own jog they had apparently been following me and they looked annoyed one was limping slightly and the other wore a buzz cut that had been spiked up straight with some kind of styling gel i felt like i was in high school again surrounded by bullying members of the football team can i help you gentlemen i asked i looked around for a cop but they were all over at the madison i supposed everyone likes to gawk get in the car the one in front of me said one of the others opened the rear door i like to walk its good for my heart you dont get in the car it isnt going to be good for your legs the man growled a voice came from inside the car mister hendricks please be more polite mister dresden would you join me for a moment id hoped to give you a lift back to your office but your abrupt exit made it somewhat problematic perhaps you will allow me to convey you the rest of the way i leaned down to look into the backseat a man of handsome and unassuming features dressed in a casual sports jacket and levis regarded me with a smile and you would be i asked him his smile widened and i swear it made his eyes twinkle my name is john marcone i would like to discuss business with you i stared at him for a moment and then my eyes slid aside to the very large and very overdeveloped mister hendricks the man growled under his breath and it sounded like cujo just before he jumped at the woman in the car i didnt feel like duking it out with cujo and his two buddies so i got into the back of the caddy with gentleman johnny marcone it was turning out to be a very busy day and i was still late for my appointment chapter three gentleman johnny marcone didnt look like the sort of man who would have my legs broken or my jaw wired shut his saltandpepper hair was cut short and there were lines from sun and smiling etched into the corners of his eyes his eyes were the green of wellworn dollar bills he seemed more like a college football coach goodlooking tanned athletic and enthusiastic the impression was reinforced by the men he kept with him cujo hendricks hulked like an allpro player who had been ousted for extreme unnecessary roughness cujo got in the car again glowered at me in the rearview mirror then pulled out into the street driving slowly toward my office the steering wheel looked tiny and delicate in his huge hands i made a mental note do not let cujo put his hands around your throat or hand it looked almost like one of them could manage it the radio was playing but as i got in the car it fouled up squealing feedback out over the speakers hendricks scowled and thought about it for a second maybe he had to relay the message through his second brain or something then he reached out and fiddled with the knobs before finally turning the radio off at this rate i hoped the car would make it all the way to my office mister dresden marcone said smiling i understand that you work for the police department from time to time they throw the occasional tidbit my way i agreed hey hendricks you should really wear your seat belt statistics say youre fifty or sixty percent safer cujo growled at me in the rearview mirror again and i beamed at him smiling always seems to annoy people more than actually insulting them or maybe i just have an annoying smile marcone seemed somewhat put off by my attitude maybe i was supposed to be holding my hat in my hand but i had never really liked francis ford coppola and i didnt have a godfather i do have a godmother and she is inevitably perhaps a faery but thats another story mister dresden he said how much would it cost to retain your services that made me wary what would someone like marcone want me for my standard fee is fifty dollars an hour plus travel expenses i told him but it can vary depending on what you need done marcone nodded along with my sentences as if encouraging me to speak he wrinkled up his face as if carefully considering what he would say and taking my wellbeing into account with grandfatherly concern how much would it set me back to have you not investigate something you want to pay me to not do something lets say i pay you your standard fee that comes out to fourteen hundred a day right twelve hundred actually i corrected him he beamed at me an honest man is a rare treasure twelve hundred a day lets say i pay you for two weeks worth of work mister dresden and you take some time off go catch a few movies get some extra sleep that sort of thing i eyed him and for more than a thousand dollars a day you want me to do nothing mister dresden marcone smiled nothing at all just relax and put your feet up and stay out of detective murphys way ahhah marcone didnt want me looking into tommy tomms murder interesting i looked out the window and squinted my eyes as though thinking about it ive got the money with me marcone said cash on the spot ill trust you to fulfill your end of the deal mister dresden you come highly recommended for your honesty mmmm i dont know john im kind of busy to be accepting any more accounts right now the car was almost to my office building the car door was still unlocked i hadnt worn my seat belt eitherjust in case i needed to throw the door open and jump out see how i think ahead its that wizardly intellectand paranoia marcones smile faltered his expression became earnest mister dresden i am quite eager to establish a positive working relationship here if its the money i can offer you more lets say double your usual fee he steepled his hands in front of him as he talked halfturning toward me my god i kept expecting him to tell me to go out there and win one for the gipper he smiled how does that sound it isnt the money john i told him i lazily locked my eyes onto his i just dont think its going to work out to my surprise he didnt look away those who deal in magic learn to see the world in a slightly different light than everyone else you gain a perspective you had never considered before a way of thinking that would just never have occurred to you without exposure to the things a wizard sees and hears when you look into someones eyes you see them in that other light and for just a second they see you in the same way marcone and i looked at one another he was a soldier a warrior behind that relaxed smile and fatherly manner he was going to get what he wanted and he was going to get it in the most efficient way possible he was a dedicated mandedicated to his goals dedicated to his people he never let fear affect him he made a living on human misery and suffering peddling in drugs and flesh and stolen goods but he took steps to minimize that suffering because it was simply the most efficient means of running his business he was furious over tommy tomms deatha cold and practical kind of fury that his rightful dominion had been invaded and challenged he intended to find those responsible and deal with them in his own wayand he didnt want the police interfering he had killed before and would again and it would all mean nothing more to him than a business transaction than paying for groceries in the checkout line it was a dry and cool place inside gentleman johnny marcone except for one dim corner there hidden away from his everyday thoughts there lurked a secret shame i couldnt quite see what it was but i knew that somewhere in the past there was something that he would give anything to undo would spill blood to erase it was from that dark place that he drew his resolve his strength that was the way i saw him when i looked inside past all his pretenses and defenses and i was on some instinctual level certain that he had been aware of what i would see if i lookedthat he had deliberately met my gaze knowing what he would give away that was his purpose in getting me alone he wanted to take a peek at my soul he wanted to see what sort of man i was when i look into someones eyes into their soul their innermost being they can see mine in returnthe things i had done the things i was willing to do the things i was capable of doing most people who did that got really pale at least one woman had passed out entirely i didnt know what they saw when they looked in thereit wasnt a place i poked around much myself john marcone wasnt like the other people who had seen my soul he didnt even blink an eye he just looked and assessed and after the moment had passed he nodded at me as though he understood something i got the uncomfortable impression that he had duped me that he had found out more about me than i had about him the first thing i felt was anger anger at being manipulated anger that he should presume to soulgaze upon me just a second later i felt scared to death of this man i had looked on his soul and it had been as solid and barren as a stainlesssteel refrigerator it was more than unsettling he was strong inside savage and merciless without being cruel he had a tigers soul all right then he said smoothly and as though nothing had happened i wont try to force my offer on you mister dresden the car was slowing down as it approached my building and hendricks pulled over in front of it but let me offer you some advice he had dropped the fathertalkingtoson act and spoke in a calm and patient voice if you dont charge for it thank god for wisecracks i was too rattled to have said anything intelligent marcone almost smiled i think youll be happier if you come down with the flu for a few days this business that detective murphy has asked you to look into doesnt need to be dragged out into the light you wont like what you see its on my side of the fence just let me deal with it and it wont ever trouble you are you threatening me i asked him i didnt think he was but i didnt want him to know that it would have helped if my voice hadnt been shaking no he said frankly i have too much respect for you to resort to something like that they say that youre the real thing mister dresden a real magus they also say im nutty as a fruitcake i choose which they i listen to very carefully marcone said think about what ive said mister dresden i do not think our respective lines of work need overlap often i would as soon not make an enemy of you over this matter i clenched my jaw over my fear and spat words out at him quick and hard you dont want to make an enemy of me marcone that wouldnt be smart that wouldnt be smart at all he narrowed his eyes at me lazy and relaxed he could meet my eyes by then without fear we had taken a measure of one another it would not happen in such a way again you really should try to be more polite mister dresden he said its good for business i didnt give him an answer to that i didnt have one that wouldnt sound frightened or stupidly macho instead i told him if you ever lose your car keys give me a call dont try offering me money or threats again thanks for the ride he watched me his expression never changing as i got out of the car and shut the door hendricks pulled out and drove away after giving me one last dirty look i had soulgazed on several people before it wasnt the sort of thing you forgot i had never run into someone like that someone so cool and controlledeven the other practitioners i had met gazes with had not been that way none of them had simply assessed me like a column of numbers and filed it away for reference in future equations i stuck my hands in the pockets of my duster and shivered as the wind hit me i was a wizard throwing around real magic i reminded myself i was not afraid of big men in big cars i do not get rattled by corpses blasted from life by magic more intense than anything i could manage really honest but those dollarbillcolored eyes backed by that cool and nearly passionless soul had me shaking as i took the stairs back up to my office i had been stupid he had surprised me and the sudden intimacy of the soulgaze had startled and frightened me all added together it had caused me to fall apart throwing threats at him like a frightened schoolkid marcone was a predator he practically smelled my fear if he got to thinking i was weak i had a feeling that polite smile and fatherly facade would vanish as thoroughly and as quickly as it had appeared what a rotten first impression oh well at least i was going to be on time for my appointment chapter four monica nolastname was standing outside of my office when i got there writing on the back of the note i had left taped to my office door i walked toward her and she was too intent upon her writing to look up she was a goodlooking woman in her midthirtysomethings ash blond hair that i thought must be natural after a morbid and involuntary memory of the dead womans dye job her makeup was tasteful and well applied and her face was fair friendly with enough roundness of cheek to look freshfaced and young enough fullness of mouth to look very feminine she was wearing a long full skirt of palest yellow with brown riding boots a crisp white blouse and an expensivelooking green cardigan over it to ward off the chill of early spring she had to be in good shape to pull off a color combination like that and she did it overall it was a naggingly familiar look something like annette funicello or barbara billingsley maybewholesome and allamerican monica i asked i put on my most innocent and friendly smile she blinked at me as i approached oh are you um harry i smiled and offered her my hand harry dresden maam thats me she took my hand after a tiny pause and kept her eyes firmly focused on my chest at this point i was just as glad to be dealing with someone who was too nervous to risk looking at my eyes i gave her a firm but gentle handshake and let go of her brushing past her to unlock the office door and open it up i apologize for being late i got a call from the police that i had to look in on you did she asked you mean the police um she waved her fingers instead of finishing the sentence and entered when i held the door open for her sometimes i nodded they run into something and want my take on it what sorts of things i shrugged and swallowed i thought of the corpses at the madison and felt green when i looked up at monica she was studying my face chewing on her lip nervously she hurriedly averted her gaze can i get you some coffee i asked her i shut the door behind us flicked on the lights oh no thank you im fine she stood there looking at my box of discarded paperbacks and holding her purse over her tummy with both hands i thought she might scream if i said boo so i made sure to move carefully and slowly making myself a cup of instant coffee i breathed in and out going through the familiar motions until i had calmed down from my encounter with marcone by the time i was done so was my coffee i went to my desk and invited her to have a seat in one of the two chairs across from me okay monica i said what can i do for you today well um i told you that my husband was was she nodded at me gesturing missing i supplied yes she said with an exhalation of almost relief but hes not mysteriously missing or anything just gone she flushed and stammered like he just packed up a few things and left but he didnt say anything to anyone and he hasnt showed up again im concerned about him uhhuh i said how long has he been gone this is the third day she said i nodded there must be some reason why youre coming to me rather than a private investigator or the police she blushed again she had a good face for blushing fair skin that colored girlishly it was quite fetching really yes um he had been interested in in magic yes he had been buying books on it in the religion section at the bookstore not like those dungeons and dragons games the real thing he bought some of those tarot cards she pronounced it like carrot amateurs and you think his disappearance might have had something to do with this interest im not sure she confessed but maybe he was very upset he had just lost his job and was under a lot of pressure im worried about him i thought whoever found him might need to be able to talk to him about all of this stuff she took a deep breath as if the effort of completing so many sentences without a single um had tired her im still not clear on this why me why not the police her knuckles whitened on her purse he packed a bag mr dresden i think the police will just assume he left his wife and his children they wont really look but he didnt hes not like that he only wants to make a good life for us really thats all he wants i frowned at her nervous that maybe hubby has run out on you after all dear even so i said why come to me why not a private investigator i know a reliable man if you need one because you know about she gestured fitfully about magic i said monica nodded i think it might be important i mean i dont know but i think it might where did he work i asked her while i spoke i got a pad of paper out of my pocket and jotted down a few notes silverco she told me theyre a trading company they locate good markets for products and then advise companies where they can best spend their money uhhuh i said what is his name monica she swallowed and i saw her twitching trying to think of something to tell me other than his real name george she supplied at last i looked up at her she was staring furiously down at her hands monica i said i know this must be really hard for you believe me maam there are plenty of people who are nervous when they come into my office but please hear me out i am not out to hurt you or anyone else what i do i do to help people its true that someone with the right skills could use your names against you but im not like that i borrowed a line from johnny marcone it isnt good business she gave a nervous little laugh i feel so silly she confessed but theres so many things that ive heard about wizards i see i put my pencil down and steepled my fingers in wizardly fashion the woman was nervous and had certain expectations i might ease her fears a little if i fulfilled some of them i tried not to look over her shoulder at the calendar i had hanging on the wall and the red circle around the fifteenth of last month late rent need money even with the fee from today and what i would make in the future it would take the city forever to pay up besides i could never resist going to the aid of a lady in distress even if she wasnt completely one hundred percent sure that she wanted to be rescued by me monica i told her there are powers in the universe that most people dont even know about powers that we still dont fully understand the men and women who work with these powers see things in a different light than regular people they come to understand things in a slightly different way this sets them apart sometimes it breeds unwarranted suspicion and fear i know youve read books and seen movies about how horrible people like me are and that whole suffer not a witch to live part of the old testament hasnt made things all roses but we really arent any different from anyone else i gave her my best smile i want to help you but if im going to do that youre going to have to give me a little trust i promise i give you my word that i wont disappoint you i saw her take this in and chew on it for a while while staring down at her hands victor she said at last victor sells all right i said picking up my pencil and duly noting it is there anyplace he might have gone that you can think of offhand she nodded the lake house we have a house down by she waved her hand the lake she beamed at me and i reminded myself to be patient in lake providence over the state line around lake michigan its beautiful up there in the autumn okay then are you aware of any friends he might have run off to see family he might have visited anything like that oh victor wasnt on speaking terms with his family i never knew why he didnt talk about them really weve been married for ten years and he never once spoke to them okay i said noting that down too friends then she fretted her lip a gesture that seemed familiar to her not really he was friends with his boss and some people at work but after he was fired uhhuh i said i understand i continued writing things down drawing bold lines between thoughts to separate them i spilled over onto the next page before i was finished writing down the facts and my observations about monica i like to be thorough about this kind of thing well mr dresden she asked can you help me i looked over the page and nodded i think so monica if possible id like to see these things your husband collected which books and so on it would help if i had a picture of him too i might like to take a look around your house at lake providence would that be all right of course she said she seemed relieved but at the same time even more nervous than before i noted down the address of the lake house and brief directions youre aware of my fees i asked her im not cheap it might be less costly for you to hire someone else weve got quite a bit of savings mr dresden she told me im not worried about the money that seemed an odd statement from her at the timeout of tune with her generally nervous manner well then i told her i charge fifty dollars an hour plus expenses ill send you an itemized list of what i do so youll have a good idea what im working on a retainer is customary im not going to guarantee that i work exclusively on your case i try to handle each of my customers with respect and courtesy so i cant put any one of them before another she nodded to me emphatically and reached into her purse she drew out a white envelope and passed it over to me theres five hundred inside she told me is that enough for now chaching five hundred dollars would take care of last months rent and a good bit of this months too i could get into this bit with nervous clients wanting to preserve the anonymity of their checking accounts from my supposed sorcerous might cash always spends that will be fine yes i told her i tried not to fondle the envelope at least i wasnt crass enough to dump the money on my desk and count it out she drew out another envelope he took most of his things with him she said at least i couldnt find them where he usually keeps them but i did find this there was something in the envelope making it bulge an amulet ring or charm of some kind i was betting a third envelope came out of her pursethe woman must be compulsively well organized theres a picture of him in here and my phone number inside thank you mr dresden when will you call as soon as i know something i told her probably by tomorrow afternoon or saturday morning sound good she almost looked at my eyes caught herself and smiled directly at my nose instead yes yes thank you so much for your help she glanced up at the wall oh look at the time i need to go schools almost out she closed her teeth over her words and flushed again as though embarrassed that she had let such an important fact about her slip out ill do whatever i can maam i assured her rising and walking her to the door thank you for your business ill be in touch soon she said her goodbyes never looking me in the face and fled out the door i shut it behind her and went back to the envelopes first the money it was all in fifties which always look new even when theyre years old because they get so little circulation there were ten of them i put them in my wallet and trashed the envelope the envelope with the photo in it was next i took it out and regarded a picture of monica and a man of lean and handsome features with a wide forehead and shaggy eyebrows that skewed his handsomeness off onto a rather eccentric angle his smile was whiterthanwhite and his skin had the smooth dark tan of someone who spends a lot of time in the sun boating maybe it was a sharp contrast against monicas paleness victor sells i presume the phone number was written on a plain white index card that had been neatly trimmed down to fit inside the envelope there was no name or area code just a sevendigit number i got out my crosslisting directory and looked it up i noted that down as well i wondered what the woman had expected to accomplish by only giving out first names when she had been going to hand me a dozen other ways of finding out in any case it only goes to show that people are funny when theyre nervous about something they say screwy things make odd choices which in retrospect they feel amazingly foolish for making i would have to be careful not to say anything to rub that in when i spoke to her again i trashed the second envelope and opened the last one turning it upside down over my desk the brown husk of a dead dried scorpion glistening with some sort of preservative glaze clicked down onto my desk a supple braided leather cord led off from a ring set through the base of its tail so that if it was worn it would hang head down tail up and curled over the dried body to point at the ground i shuddered scorpions were symbolically powerful in certain circles of belief they werent usually symbols of anything good or wholesome either a lot of petty mean spells could be focused around a little talisman like that if you wore it next to your skin as such things are supposed to be worn the prickly legs of the thing would be a constant poking and agitation at your chest a continual reminder that it was there the dried stinger at the tails tip might actually pierce the skin of anyone who tried to give the wearer a hug its crablike pincers would catch in a mans chest hair or scratch at the curves of a womans breasts nasty unpleasant thing not evil as suchbut you sure as hell werent likely to do happy shiny things with magic with such an item around your neck maybe victor sells had gotten involved in something real something that had absorbed his attention the art could do that to a personparticularly the darker aspects of it if he had turned to it in despair after losing his job maybe that would explain his sudden absence from his home a lot of sorcerers or wannabe sorcerers secluded themselves in the belief that isolation would increase their ability to focus on their magic it didntbut it did make it easier for a weak or untrained mind to avoid distractions or maybe it wasnt even a true talisman maybe it was just a curiosity or a souvenir from some visit to the southwest there wasnt any way for me to tell if it was indeed a device used to improve the focus and direction of magical energies short of actually using it to attempt a spelland i really didnt want to be using such a dubious article for a variety of good reasons i would have to keep this little unbeauty in mind as i tried to run this man down it might well mean nothing on the other hand it might not i looked up at the clock a quarter after three there was time to check with the local morgues to see if they had turned up any likely john doeswho knew my search might be over before the days endand then to get to the bank to deposit my money and fire off a check to my landlord i got out my phone book and started calling up hospitalsnot really my routine line of work but not difficult either except for the standard problems i had using the telephone static line noise other peoples conversations being louder than mine if something can go wrong it will once i thought i saw something out of the corner of my eye a twitch of motion from the dried scorpion that sat on my desk i blinked and stared at it it didnt move cautiously i extended my senses toward it like an invisible hand feeling about for any traces of enchantment or magical energy nothing it was as dry of enchantment as it was of life never let it be said that harry dresden is afraid of a dried dead bug creepy or not i wasnt going to let it ruin my concentration so i scooped it up with the corner of the phone book and popped it into the middle drawer of my desk out of sight out of mind so i have a problem with creepy dead poisonous things so sue me chapter five mcanallys is a pub a few blocks from my office i go there when im feeling stressed or when i have a few extra bucks to spend on a nice dinner a lot of us fringe types do mac the pubs owner is used to wizards and all the problems that come along with us there arent any video games at mcanallys there are no televisions or expensive computer trivia games there isnt even a jukebox mac keeps a player piano instead its less likely to go haywire around us i say pub in all the best senses of the word when you walk in you take several steps down into a room with a deadly combination of a low clearance and ceiling fans if youre tall like me you walk carefully in mcanallys there are thirteen stools at the bar and thirteen tables in the room thirteen windows set up high in the wall in order to be above ground level let some light from the street into the place thirteen mirrors on the walls cast back reflections of the patrons in dim detail and give the illusion of more space thirteen wooden columns carved with likenesses from folktales and legends of the old world make it difficult to walk around the place without weaving a circuitous routethey also quite intentionally break up the flow of random energies dispelling to one degree or another the auras that gather around broody grumpy wizards and keeping them from manifesting in unintentional and colorful ways the colors are all muted earth browns and sea greens the first time i entered mcanallys i felt like a wolf returning to an old favorite den mac makes his own beer ale really and its the best stuff in the city his food is cooked on a woodburning stove and you can damn well walk your own self over to the bar to pick up your order when its ready according to mac its my sort of place since the calls to the morgues had turned up nothing i kept a few bills out of monica sellss retainer and took myself to mcanallys after the kind of day id had i deserved some of macs ale and someone elses cooking it was going to be a long night too once i went home and started trying to figure out how whoever it was had pulled off the death spell used on johnny marcones hatchet man tommy tomm and his girlfriend jennifer stanton dresden mac greeted me when i sat down at the bar the dim comfortable room was empty but for a pair of men i recognized by sight at a back table playing chess mac is a tall almost gangly man of indeterminate age though theres a sense to him that speaks of enough wisdom and strength that i wouldnt venture that he was less than fifty he has squinty eyes and a smile that is rare and mischievous when it manifests mac never says much but when he does its almost always worth listening to hey there mac i hailed him been one hell of a day give me a steak sandwich fries ale ungh mac said he opened a bottle of his ale and began to pour it warm staring past me into the middle distance he does that with everyone considering his clientele i dont blame him i wouldnt chance looking them in the face either you hear about what happened at the madison ungh he confirmed nasty business such an inane comment apparently didnt merit even a grunted reply mac set my drink out and turned to the stove behind the bar checking the wood and raking it back and forth to provide even heating for it i picked up a prethumbed newspaper nearby and scanned the headlines hey look at this another threeeye rampage jesus this stuff is worse than crack the article detailed the virtual demolition of a neighborhood grocery store by a pair of threeeye junkies who were convinced that the place was destined to explode and wanted to beat destiny to the punch ungh you ever seen anything like this mac shook his head they say the stuff gives you the third sight i said reading the article both junkies had been admitted to the hospital and were in critical condition after collapsing at the scene but you know what mac looked back at me from the stove while he cooked i dont think thats possible what a bunch of crap trying to sell these poor kids on the idea that they can do magic mac nodded at me if it was serious stuff the department would have already called me by now mac shrugged turning back to the stove then he squinted up and peered into the dim reflection of the mirror behind the bar harry he said you were followed i had been too tense for too much of the day to avoid feeling my shoulders constrict in a sudden twinge i put both hands around my mug and brought a few phrases of quasilatin to mind it never hurt to be ready to defend myself in case someone was intending to hurt me i watched someone approach a dim shape in the reflection cast by the ancient worn mirror mac went on with cooking unperturbed nothing much perturbed mac i smelled her perfume before i turned around why miss rodriguez i said its always pleasant to see you she came to an abrupt stop a couple of paces from me apparently disconcerted one of the advantages of being a wizard is that people always attribute anything you do to magic if no other immediate explanation leaps to mind she probably wouldnt think about her perfume giving her identity away when she could assign my mysterious blind identification of her to my mystical powers come on i told her sit down ill get you a drink while i refuse to tell you anything harry she admonished me you dont know im here on business she sat down on the barstool next to me she was a woman of average height and striking dark beauty wearing a crisp business jacket and skirt hose pumps her dark straight hair was trimmed in a neat cut that ended at the nape of her neck and was parted off of the dark skin of her forehead emphasizing the lazy appeal of her dark eyes susan i chided her you wouldnt be in this place if you werent did you have a good time in branson susan rodriguez was a reporter for the chicago arcane a yellow magazine that covered all sorts of supernatural and paranormal events throughout the midwest usually the events they covered werent much better than monkey man seen with elviss love child or jfks mutant ghost abducts shapeshifting girl scout but once in a great great while the arcane covered something that was real like the unseelie incursion of when the entire city of milwaukee had simply vanished for two hours gone government satellite photos showed the river valley covered with trees and empty of life or human habitation all communications ceased then a few hours later there it was back again and no one in the city itself the wiser she had also been hanging around my investigation in branson the previous week she had been tracking me ever since interviewing me for a feature story right after id opened up my business i had to hand it to hershe had instincts and enough curiosity to get her into ten kinds of trouble she had tricked me into meeting her eyes at the conclusion of our first interview an eager young reporter investigating an angle on her interviewee she was the one who had fainted after wed soulgazed she smirked at me i liked her smirk it did interesting things to her lips and hers were already attractive you should have stayed around for the show she said it was pretty impressive she put her purse on the bar and slid up onto the stool beside me no thanks i told her im pretty sure it wasnt for me my editor loved the coverage shes convinced its going to win an award of some kind i can see it now i told her mysterious visions haunt drugusing country star real hardhitting paranormal journalism that i glanced at her and she met my eyes without fear she didnt let me see if my jibe had ruffled her i heard you got called in by the si director today she told me she leaned toward me enough that a glance down would have afforded an interesting angle to the v of her white shirt id love to hear you tell me about this one harry she quirked a smile at me that promised things i almost smiled back at her sorry i told her i have a standard nondisclosure agreement with the city something off the record then she asked rumor has it that these killings were pretty sensational cant help you susan i told her wild horses couldnt drag it out of me et cetera just a hint she pressed a word of comment something shared between two people who are very attracted to one another which two people would that be she put an elbow on the counter and propped her chin in her hand studying me through narrowed eyes and thick long lashes one of the things that appealed to me about her was that even though she used her charm and femininity relentlessly in pursuit of her stories she had no concept of just how attractive she really wasi had seen that when i looked within her last year harry dresden she said you are a thoroughly maddening man her eyes narrowed a bit further you didnt look down my blouse even once did you she accused i took a sip of my ale and beckoned mac to pour her one as well he did guilty most men are offbalance by now she complained what does it take with you anyway dresden i am pure of heart and mind i told her i cannot be corrupted she stared at me in frustration for a moment then she tilted back her head to laugh she had a good laugh too throaty and rich i did look down at her chest when she did that just for a second a pure heart and mind only takes you so farsooner or later the hormones have their say too i mean im not a teenager or anything anymore but im not exactly an expert in things like this either call it an overwhelming interest in my professional career but ive never had much time for dating or the fair sex in general and when i have it hasnt turned out too well susan was a known quantityshe was attractive bright appealing her motivations were clear and simple and she was honest in pursuing them she flirted with me because she wanted information as much as because she thought i was attractive sometimes she got it sometimes she didnt this one was way too hot for susan or the arcane to touch and if murphy heard id tipped someone off about what had happened shed have my heart between two pieces of bread for lunch ill tell you what harry she said how about if i ask some questions and you just answer them with a yes or a no no i said promptly dammit i am a poor liar and it didnt take a reporter with susans brains to tell it her eyes glittered with cheerfully malicious ambition was tommy tomm murdered by a paranormal being or means no i said again stubbornly no he wasnt susan asked or no it wasnt a paranormal being i glanced at mac as though to appeal for help mac ignored me mac doesnt take sides mac is wise no im not going to answer questions i said do the police have any leads any suspects no are you a suspect yourself harry disturbing thought no i said exasperated susan would you mind having dinner with me saturday night no i i blinked at her what she smiled at me leaned over and kissed me on the cheek her lips that id admired so much felt very very nice super she said ill pick you up at your place say around nine did i just miss something i asked her she nodded dark eyes sparkling with humor im going to take you to a fantastic dinner have you ever eaten at the pump room at the ambassador east i shook my head steaks you wouldnt believe she assured me and the most romantic atmosphere jackets and ties required can you manage um yes i said carefully this is the answer to the question of whether or not ill go out with you right no susan said with a smile that was the answer i tricked out of you so youre stuck there i just want to make sure you own something besides jeans and buttondown western shirts oh yes i said super she repeated and kissed me on the cheek once more as she stood up and gathered her purse saturday then she drew back and quirked her smirky little smile at me it was a killer look sultry and appealing ill be there with bells on she turned and walked out i sort of turned to stare after her my jaw slid off the bar as i did and landed on the floor had i just agreed to a date or an interrogation session probably both i muttered mac slapped my steak sandwich and fries down in front of me i put down some money morosely and he made change shes going to do nothing but try to trick information out of me that i shouldnt be giving her mac i said ungh mac agreed why did i say yes mac shrugged shes pretty i said smart sexy ungh any redblooded man would have done the same thing hngh mac snorted well maybe not you mac smiled a bit mollified still its going to make trouble for me i must be crazy to go for someone like that i picked up my sandwich and sighed dumb mac said i just said she was smart mac macs face flickered into that smile and it made him look years younger almost boyish not her he said you i ate my dinner and had to admit that he was right this threw a wrench into my plans my best idea for poking around the sells lake house and getting information had to be carried out at night and i already had tomorrow night slated for a talk with bianca since i had a feeling murphy and carmichael would fail to turn up any cooperation from the vampiress that meant i would have to drive out to lake providence tonight since saturday night was now occupied by the date with susanor at least the premidnight portion was my mouth went dry when i considered that maybe the rest of the night might be occupied too one never knew she had dizzied me and made me look like an idiot and she was probably going to try every trick she knew to drag more information out of me for the monday morning release of the arcane on the other hand she was sexy intelligent and at least a little attracted to me that indicated that more might happen than just talk and dinner didnt it the question was did i really want that to happen i had been a miserable failure in relationships ever since my first love went sour i mean a lot of teenage guys fail in their first relationships not many of them murder the girl involved i shied away from that line of thought lest it bring up too many old memories i left mcanallys after mac had handed me a doggy bag with a grunt of mister by way of explanation the chess game in the corner was still in progress both players puffing up a sweetsmelling smog cloud from their pipes i tried to figure out how to deal with susan while i walked out to my car did i need to clean up my apartment did i have all the ingredients for the spell i would cast at the lake house later tonight would murphy go through the roof when i talked to bianca i could still feel susans kiss lingering on my cheek as i got in the car i shook my head bewildered they say we wizards are subtle but believe you me weve got nothing nothing at all on women chapter six mister was nowhere to be seen when i got home but i left the food in his dish anyway he would eventually forgive me for getting home late i collected the things i would need from my kitchenfreshbaked bread with no preservatives honey milk a fresh apple a sharp silver penknife and a tiny dinner set of a plate bowl and cup that i had carved myself from a block of teakwood i went back out to my car the beetle isnt really blue anymore since both doors have been replaced one with a green clone one with a white one and the hood of the storage trunk in front had to be replaced with a red duplicate but the name stuck anyway mike is a super mechanic he never asked questions about the burns that slagged a hole in the front hatch or the claw marks that ruined both the doors you cant pay for service like that i revved up the beetle and drove down i around the shore of lake michigan crossing through indiana briefly and then crossing over the state line into michigan itself lake providence is an expensive highclass community with big houses and sprawling estates it isnt cheap to own land there victor sells must have been doing well in his former position at silverco to afford a place out that way the lakeshore drive wound in and out among thick tall trees and rolling hills down to the shore the properties were well spread out several hundred yards between them most of them were fenced in and had gates on the right side of the road away from the lake as i drove north the sells house was the only one i saw on the lake side of the drive a smooth gravel lane lined by trees led back from the lakeshore drive to the sells house a peninsula jutted out into the lake leaving enough room for the house and a small dock at which no boats were moored the house was not a large one by the standards of the rest of the lake providence community built on two levels it was a very modern dwellinga lot of glass and wood that was made to look like something more synthetic than wood by the way it had been smoothed and cut and polished the drive curved around to the back of the house where a driveway big enough to host a fiveonfive game of basketball around a backboard erected to one side was overlooked by a wooden deck leading off the second level of the house i drove the blue beetle around to the back of the house and parked there my ingredients were in a blacknylon backpack and i picked that up and brought it with me as i got out of the car and stretched my legs the breeze coming up from the lake was cool enough to make me shiver a little and i drew my mantled duster closed across my belly first impressions are important and i wanted to listen to what my instincts said about the house i stopped for a long moment and just stared up at it my instincts must have been holding out for another bottle of macs ale they had little to say other than that the place looked like a pricey little dwelling that had hosted a family through many a vacation weekend well where instinct fails intellect must venture almost everything was fairly new the grass around the house had not grown long enough this winter to require a cutting the basketball net was stretched out and loose enough to show that it had been used fairly often the curtains were all drawn on the grass beneath the deck something red gleamed and i went beneath the deck to retrieve it it was a plastic film canister red with a grey cap the kind you keep a roll of film in when you send it in to the processors film canisters were good for holding various ingredients i used sometimes i tucked it in my dusters pocket and continued my inspection the place didnt look much like a family dwelling really it looked like a rich mans love nest a secluded little getaway nestled back in the trees of the peninsula and safe from spying eyes or an ideal location for a novice sorcerer to come to try out his fledgling abilities safe from interruptions a good place for victor sells to set up shop and practice i made a quick circuit of the house tried the front and rear doors and even the door up on the deck that led presumably to a kitchen all were locked locks really werent an obstacle but monica sells hadnt invited me actually to take a look inside the house just around it its bad juju to go tromping into peoples houses uninvited one of the reasons vampires as a rule dont do itthey have enough trouble just holding themselves together outside of the nevernever it isnt harmful to a human wizard like me but it can really impair anything you try to do with magic also it just isnt polite like i said im an oldfashioned sort of guy of course the tektronic securities control panel that i could see through the front window had some say in my decisionnot that i couldnt hex it down to a useless bundle of plastic and wires but a lot of security systems will cause an alarm with their contact company if they abruptly stop working without notice it would be a useless exercise in any casethe real information was to be had elsewhere still something nagged at me a sense of notquiteemptiness to the house on a hunch i knocked on the front door several times i even rang the bell no one came to answer the door and no lights were on inside i shrugged and walked back to the rear of the house passing a number of empty trash cans as i did now that was a bit odd i mean i would expect a little something in the trash even if someone hadnt been there in a while did the garbage truck come all the way down the drive to pick up the trash cans that didnt seem likely if the sellses came out to the house for the weekend and wanted the trash emptied it would stand to reason that theyd have to leave it out by the drive near the road as they left which would seem to imply that the garbage men would leave the empty trash cans out by the road someone must have brought them back to the house of course it neednt have been victor sells it could have been a neighbor or something or maybe he tipped the garbagemen to carry the cans back away from the road but it was something to go on a little hint that maybe the house hadnt been empty all week i left the house behind me and walked out toward the lake the night was breezy but clear and a bit cool the tall old trees creaked and groaned beneath the wind it was still early for the mosquitoes to be too bad the moon was waxing toward full overhead with the occasional cloud slipping past her like a gauzy veil it was a perfect night for catching faeries i swept an area of dirt not far from the lakeshore clear of leaves and sticks and took the silver knife from the backpack using the handle i drew a circle in the earth then covered it up with leaves and sticks again marking the location of the circles perimeter in my head i was careful to focus in concentration on the circle without actually letting any power slip into it and spoil the trap then working carefully i prepared the bait by setting out the little cup and bowl i poured a thimbleful of milk into the cup and daubed the bowl full of honey from the little plastic bear in my backpack then i tore a piece of bread from the loaf i had brought with me and pricked my thumb with the knife in the silver light of the moon a bit of dark blood welled up against the skin and i touched it daintily to the underside of the coarse bread letting it absorb the blood then i set the bread bloody side down on the tiny plate my trap was set i gathered up my equipment and retreated to the cover of the trees there are two parts of magic you have to understand to catch a faery one of them is the concept of true names everything in the whole world has its own name names are unique sounds and cadences of words that are attached to one specific individualsort of like a kind of theme music if you know somethings name you can associate yourself with it in a magical sense almost in the same way a wizard can reach out and touch someone if he possesses a lock of their hair or fingernail clippings or blood if you know somethings name you can create a magical link to it just as you can call someone up and talk to them if you know their phone number just knowing the name isnt good enough though you have to know exactly how to say it ask two john franklin smiths to say their names for you and youll get subtle differences in tone and pronunciation each one unique to its owner wizards tend to collect names of creatures spirits and people like some kind of huge rolodex you never know when it will come in handy the other part of magic you need to know is magiccircle theory most magic involves a circle of one kind or another drawing a circle sets a local limit on what a wizard is trying to do it helps him refine his magic focus and direct it more clearly it does this by creating a sort of screen defined by the perimeter of the circle that keeps random magical energy from going past it containing it within the circle so that it can be used to make a circle you draw it out on the ground or close hands with a bunch of people or walk about spreading incense or any of a number of other methods while focusing on your purpose in drawing it then you invest it with a little spark of energy to close the circuit and its ready one other thing such a circle does it keeps magical creatures like faeries or even demons from getting past it neat huh usually this is used to keep them out its a bit trickier to set up a circle to keep them in thats where the blood comes into play with blood comes power if you take in some of someone elses blood there is a metaphysical significance to it a sort of energy its minuscule if you arent really trying to get energy that way the way vampires do but its enough to close a circle now you know how its done but i dont recommend that you try it at home you dont know what to do when something goes wrong i retreated to the trees and called the name of the particular faery i wanted it was a rolling series of syllables quite beautiful reallyespecially since the faery went by the name of toottoot every time id encountered him before i pushed my will out along with the name just made it a call something that would be subtle enough to make him wander this way of his own accord or at least that was the theory what was his name please do you think wizards just give information like that away you dont know what i went through to get it about ten minutes later toot came flickering in over the water of lake michigan at first i mistook him for a reflection of the moon on the side of the softly rolling waves of the lake toot was maybe six inches tall he had silver dragonflys wings sprouting from his back and the pale beautiful tiny humanoid form that echoed the splendor of the fae lords a silver nimbus of ambient light surrounded him his hair was a shaggy silken little mane like a bird of paradises plumes and was a pale magenta toot loved bread and milk and honeya common vice of the lesser fae they arent usually willing to take on a nest of bees to get to the honey and theres been a real dearth of milk in the nevernever since hitech dairy farms took over most of the industry needless to say they dont grow their own wheat harvest it thresh it and then mill it into flour to make bread either toot alighted on the ground with caution scanning around the trees he didnt see me i saw him wipe at his mouth and walk in a slow circle around the miniature dining set one hand rubbing greedily at his stomach once he took the bread and closed the circle id be able to bargain information for his release toot was a lesser spirit in the area sort of a dockworker of the nevernever if anyone had seen anything of victor sells toot would have or would know someone who had toot dithered for a while fluttering back and forth around the meal but slowly getting closer faeries and honey moths and flame toot had fallen for this several times before and it wasnt in the nature of the fae to keep memories for very long or to change their essential natures all the same i held my breath the faery finally hunkered down picked up the bread dipped it in the honey then greedily gobbled it down the circle closed with a little snap that occurred just at the edge of my hearing its effect on toot was immediate he screamed a shrill little scream like a trapped rabbit and took off toward the lake in a buzzing flurry of wings at the perimeter of the circle he smacked into something as solid as a brick wall and a little puff of silver motes exploded out from him in a cloud toot grunted and fell onto his little faery ass on the earth i should have known he exclaimed as i approached from the trees his voice was highpitched but more like a little kids than the exaggerated kind of faery voices id heard in cartoons now i remember where ive seen those plates before you ugly sneaky hamhanded bignosed flatfooted mortal worm hiya toot i told him do you remember our deal from last time or do we need to go over it again toot glared defiantly up at me and stomped his foot on the ground more silver faery dust puffed out from the impact release me he demanded or i will tell the queen if i dont release you i pointed out you cant tell the queen and you know just as well as i do what she would say about any dewdrop faery who was silly enough to get himself caught with a lure of bread and milk and honey toot crossed his arms defiantly over his chest i warn you mortal release me now or you will feel the awful terrible irresistible might of the faery magic i will rot your teeth from your head take your eyes from their sockets fill your mouth with dung and your ears with worms hit me with your best shot i told him after that we can talk about what you need to do to get out of the circle i had called his bluff i always did but he probably wouldnt remember the details very well if you live a few hundred years you tend to forget the little things toot sulked and kicked up a little spray of dirt with one tiny foot you could at least pretend to be afraid harry sorry toot i dont have the time time time toot complained is that all you mortals can ever think about everyones complaining about time the whole city rushes left and right screaming about being late and honking horns you people used to have it right you know i bore the lecture with good nature toot could never keep his mind on the same subject long enough to be really trying in any case why i remember the folk who lived here before you pale wheezy guys came in and they never complained about ulcers or toots eyes wandered to the bread and milk and honey again and glinted he sauntered that way then snatched the remaining bread sopping up all the honey with it and eating it with greedy birdlike motions this is good stuff harry none of that funny stuff in it that we get sometimes preservatives i said whatever toot drank down the milk too in a long pull then promptly fell down on his back patting at his rounded tummy all right he said now let me out not yet toot i need something first toot scowled up at me you wizards always needing something i really could do the thing with the dung you know he stood up and folded his arms haughtily over his chest looking up at me as though i werent a dozen times taller than he very well he said his tone lofty i have deigned to grant you a single request of some small nature for the generous gift of your cuisine i worked to keep a straight face thats very kind of you toot sniffed and somehow managed to look down his little pug nose at me it is my nature to be both benevolent and wise i nodded as though this were a very great wisdom uhhuh look toot i need to know if you were around this place for the past few nights or know someone who was im looking for someone and maybe he came here and if i tell you toot said i take it you will disassemble this circle which has by some odd coincidence no doubt made its way around me it would be only reasonable i said all seriousness toot seemed to consider it as though he might be inclined not to cooperate then nodded very well you will have the information you wish release me i narrowed my eyes are you sure do you promise toot stamped his foot again scattering more silver dust motes harry youre ruining the drama i folded my arms i want to hear you promise toot threw up his hands fine fine fine i promise i promise i promise ill dig up what you want to know he started to buzz about the circle in great agitation wings lifting him easily into the air let me out let me out a promise thrice made is as close to absolute truth as you can get from a faery i went quickly to the circle and scuffed over the line drawn in the dirt with my foot willing the circle to part it did with a little hiss of released energy toot streaked out over lake michigans waters again a miniature silver comet and vanished in a twinkling just like santa claus though i should say that santa is a much bigger and more powerful faery than toot and i dont know his true name anyway youd never see me trying to nab saint nick in a magic circle even if i did i dont think anyone has stones that big i waited around walking about to keep from falling asleep if i did that toot would be perfectly within his rights as a faery to fulfill his promise by telling me the information while i was sleeping and given that i had just now captured and humiliated him hed probably do something to even the scalestwo weeks from now he wouldnt even remember it but if i let him have a free shot at me tonight i might wake up with an asss head and i didnt think that would be good for business so i paced and i waited toot usually took about half an hour to round up whatever it was i wanted to know sure enough half an hour later he came sparkling back in and buzzed around my head drizzling faery dust from his blurring wings at my eyes hah harry he said i did it what did you find out toot guess i snorted no aw come on just a little guess i scowled tired and irritated but tried not to let it show toot couldnt help being what he was toot its late you promised to tell me no fun at all he complained no wonder you cant get a date unless someone wants to know something from you i blinked at him and he chortled in glee hah i love it were watching you harry dresden now that was disconcerting i had a sudden image of a dozen faery voyeurs lingering around my apartments windows and peering inside id have to take precautions to make sure they couldnt do that not that i was afraid of them or anything just in case just tell me toot i sighed incoming he shrilled and i held out my hand fingers flat and palm up he alighted in the center of my palm i could barely feel his weight but the sense the aura of him ran through my skin like a tiny electric current he stared fearlessly at my eyesthe fae have no souls to gaze upon and they could not fathom a mortals soul even if they could see it okay toot said i talked to blueblossom who talked to rednose who talked to meg o aspens who said that goldeneyes said that he was riding the pizza car when it came here last night toot thrust out his chest proudly pizza car i asked bewildered pizza toot cried jubilant pizza pizza pizza his wings fluttered again and i tried to blink the damned faery dust out of my eyes before i started sneezing faeries like pizza i asked oh harry toot said breathlessly havent you ever had pizza before of course i have i said toot looked wounded and you didnt share i sighed look maybe i can bring you guys some pizza sometime soon to thank you for your help toot leapt about in glee hopping from one fingertip to the other yes yes wait until i tell them well see who laughs at toottoot next time toot i said trying to calm him did he see anything else toot tittered his expression sly and suggestive he said that there were mortals sporting and that they needed pizza to regain their strength which delivery place toot the faery blinked and stared at me as though i were hopelessly stupid harry the pizza truck and then he darted off skyward vanishing into the trees above i sighed and nodded toot wouldnt know the difference between dominos and pizza hut he had no frame of reference and couldnt readmost faeries were studiously averse to print so i had two pieces of information one someone had ordered a pizza to be delivered here that meant two things first that someone was here last night second that someone had seen them and talked to them maybe i could track down the pizza driver and ask if he had seen victor sells the second piece of information had been toots reference to sporting faeries didnt think too much of mortals idea of sporting unless there was a lot of nudity and lust involved they had a penchant for shadowing necking teenagers and playing tricks on them so victor had been here with a lover of some kind for there to be any sport going on i was beginning to think that monica sells was in denial her husband wasnt wandering around learning to be a sorcerer spooky scorpion talismans notwithstanding he was lurking about his love nest with a girlfriend like any other husband bored with a timid and domestic wife might do under pressure it wasnt admirable but i guess i could understand the motivations that could cause it the only problem was going to be telling monica i had a feeling that she wasnt going to want to listen to what i had found out i picked up the little plate and bowl and cup and put them back into my blacknylon backpack along with the silver knife my legs ached from too much walking and standing about i was looking forward to getting home and getting some sleep the man with the naked sword in his hands appeared out of the darkness without a warning rustle of sound or whiff of magic to announce his presence he was tall like me but broad and heavychested and he carried his weight with a ponderous sort of dignity perhaps fifty years old his listless brown hair going grey in uneven patches he wore a long black coat a lot like mine but without the mantle and his jacket and pants too were done in dark colorscharcoal and a deep blue his shirt was crisp pure white the color that you usually only see with tuxedos his eyes were grey touched with crowsfeet at the corners and dangerous moonlight glinted off those eyes in the same shade it did from the brighter silver of the swords blade he began to walk deliberately toward me speaking in a quiet voice as he did harry blackstone copperfield dresden irresponsible use of true names for summoning and binding others to your will violates the fourth law of magic the man intoned i remind you that you are under the doom of damocles no further violations of the laws will be tolerated the sentence for further violation is death by the sword to be carried out at once chapter seven have you ever been approached by a grimlooking man carrying a naked sword with a blade about ten miles long in his hand in the middle of the night beneath the stars on the shores of lake michigan if you have seek professional help if you have not then believe you me it can scare the bejeezus out of you i took in a quick breath and had to work not to put it into a quasilatin phrase on the exhale one that would set the mans body on fire and reduce him to a mound of ashes i react badly to fear i dont usually have the good sense to run or hidei just try to smash whatever it is that is making me afraid its a primitive sort of thing and one i dont question too much but reflexbased murder seemed a tad extreme so rather than setting him on fire i nodded instead evening morgan you know as well as i do that those laws apply to mortals not faeries especially for something as trivial as i just did and i didnt break the fourth law he had the choice whether to take my deal or not morgans sour leathery face turned a bit more sour the lines at the corners of his mouth stretching and becoming deeper thats a technicality dresden a pair of them his hands broad and strong resettled their grip upon the sword he held his unevenly greying hair was tied into a ponytail in the back like sean connerys in some of his movies except that morgans face was too pinched and thin to pull off the look your point being i did my best to keep from looking nervous or impressed truth be told i was both morgan was my warden assigned to me by the white council to make sure i didnt bend or break any of the laws of magic he hung about and spied on me mostly and usually came sniffing around after id cast a spell of some kind i would be damned if i was going to let the white councils guard dog see any fear out of me besides he would take it as a sign of guilt in the true spirit of paranoid fanatics everywhere so all i had to do was keep a straight face and get out before my weariness made me slip up and do or say something he could use against me morgan was one of the deadliest evocators in the world he wasnt bright enough to question his loyalties to the council and he could do quickanddirty magic like few others could quick and dirty enough to rip the hearts out of tommy tomm and jennifer stantons chests in fact if he wanted to my point he said scowling is that it is my assigned duty to monitor your use of your power and to see to it that you do not abuse it im on a missingpersons case i said all i did was call up a dewdrop faery to get some information come on morgan everybody calls up faeries now and then theres no harm in it its not as though im mindcontrolling the things just leaning on them a little technicality morgan growled i stuck out my chin at him belligerently we were of a height though he outweighed me by about a hundred pounds i could pick better people to antagonize but hed really gotten under my skin a technicality im prepared to hide wildly behind so unless you want to convene a meeting of the council to call me on it we can just drop the discussion right here im pretty sure it will only take them about two days to cancel all their plans make travel arrangements and then get here i can put you up until then i mean youd be dragging a bunch of really crotchety old men away from their experiments and things for nothing but if you really think its necessary morgan scowled at me no it isnt worth it he opened his dark trench coat and slid the sword away into its scabbard i relaxed a little the sword wasnt the most dangerous thing about him not by a long shot but it was his symbol of the authority given to him by the white council and if rumors were true it was enchanted to cut through the magical spells of anyone resisting him i didnt want things ever to go far enough for me to find out if the rumors were true im glad we agree about something i said nice seeing you again i started to walk past him morgan put one of those big hands on my arm as i went by and his fingers closed around it im not finished with you dresden i didnt dare mess around with morgan when he was acting in his role as a warden of the white council but he wasnt wearing that hat now once hed put the sword away he was acting on his own without any more official authority than any other manor at least that was the technical truth morgan was big on technicalities he had scared the heck out of me and annoyed the heck out of me in rapid succession now he was trying to bully me i hate bullies so i took a calculated risk used my free hand and hit him as hard as i could in the mouth i think the blow startled him more than anything he took a step back letting go of my arm in surprise and just blinked at me he put one hand to his mouth and when he drew his fingers away there was blood on them i planted my feet and faced him without meeting his eyes dont touch me morgan continued to stare at me and then i saw anger creep over his face set his jaw make the veins at his temple stand out how dare you he said how dare you strike me it wasnt so hard i said if youve got council business with me im willing to give you whatever respect is your due when you come on strong to me on personal business i dont have to put up with it i saw the steam coming out of his ears as he mulled it over he looked for a reason to come after me and realized that he didnt have one according to the laws he wasnt too brightdid i mention that already and he was a big one for following the laws youre a fool dresden he sputtered finally an arrogant little fool probably i told him i tensed myself to move quickly if necessary i may not like to run away from what scares me but i try not to fight hopeless battles either and morgan had me by years of experience and a hundred pounds at least there was no law of magic that protected me from him and his fists either and if that occurred to him he might decide to do something about it that punch id landed had been lucky coming out of the blue i wouldnt get away with it again someone killed two people with sorcery last night dresden i think it was you and when i find how you did it and can trace it back to you dont think youre going to live long enough to cast the same spell at me morgan swiped at the blood with one big fist it was my turn to blink i tried to shift mental gears to keep up with the change in subject morgan thought i was the killer and since morgan didnt do too much of his own thinking that meant that the white council thought i was the killer holy shit of course it made sense from morgans narrow and singleminded point of view a wizard had killed someone i was a wizard who had already been convicted of killing another with magic even if the selfdefense clause had kept me from being executed cops looked for people who had already committed crimes before they started looking for other culprits morgan was just another kind of cop as far as i was concerned and as far as he was concerned i was just one more dangerous con youre not serious i told him you think i did it he sneered at me his voice was contemptuous confident and seethed with absolute conviction dont try to hide it dresden im sure you think youre clever enough to come up with something innovative that we hidebound old men wont be able to trace but youre wrong well determine how you did it and well follow it back to you and when we do ill be there to make sure you never hurt anyone again knock yourself out i told him it was hard really hard to keep my voice as blithe as i wanted it to sound i didnt do it but im helping the police find the man who did the police morgan asked he narrowed his eyes as though gauging my expression as if they could have any authority on this matter they wont do you any good even if you do set someone up to take the fall for you under mortal law the white council will still see that justice is done his eyes glittered fanaticbright underneath the stars whatever look if you find something out about the killer anything that could help the cops out would you give me a call morgan looked at me with profound distaste you ask me to warn you when we are closing in on you dresden you are young but i never thought you stupid i bit back the obvious comment that leapt to mind morgan was on the edge of outrage already if id realized how rabid he was to catch me slipping i wouldnt have added more fuel to his fire by hitting him in the mouth okay i probably still would have hit him in the mouth but i wouldnt have done it quite so hard good night morgan i told him i started to walk away again before i could let my mouth get me into more trouble he moved faster than i would have given a man his age credit for his fist went across my jaw at approximately a million miles an hour and i spun down to the dirt like a stringcut puppet for several long moments i was unable to do anything at all even breathe morgan loomed over me well be watching you dresden he turned and started walking away the shadows of the evening quickly swallowing up his black coat his voice drifted back to me well find out what really happened i didnt dare spout out a snappy comeback i felt my jaw with my fingers and made sure it wasnt broken before i stood up and walked back to the beetle my legs feeling loose and watery i fervently hoped that morgan would find out what had really happened it would keep the white council from executing me for breaking the first law for one thing i could feel his eyes on my back all the way to the beetle damn that morgan he didnt have to take quite so much pleasure in being assigned to spy on me i had a sinking feeling that anywhere i went over the next few days he would be likely to turn up watching he was like this big cartoon tomcat waiting outside the mousehole for the little mouse to stick its nose out so he could smash it flat with one big paw i was feeling a lot like that little mouse i let that analogy cheer me up a bit the cartoon cats always seemed to get the short end of the stick in the final analysis maybe morgan would too part of the problem was that seeing morgan always brought up too many memories of my angsty teenage days that was when id started to learn magic when my mentor had tried to seduce me into black wizardry and when he had attempted to kill me when he failed i killed him instead mostly by luckbut he was just as dead and id done it with sorcery i broke the first law of magic thou shalt not kill there is only one sentence if someone is found guilty and one sword that they use to carry it out the white council commuted the death sentence because tradition demands that a wizard can resort to the use of deadly force if he is defending his own life or the lives of the defenseless and my claim that i had been attacked first could not be contested by my masters corpse so instead theyd stuck me on a kind of accelerated probation one strike and i was out there were some wizards who thought that the judgment against me was a ludicrous injustice i happened to be one of them but my vote didnt really count and others who thought that i should have been executed regardless of extenuating circumstances morgan belonged to that latter group just my luck i was feeling more than a bit surly at the entire white council benevolent intentions aside i guess it only made sense that theyd suspect me and god knows id been a thorn in their side flying in the face of tradition by practicing my art openly there were plenty of people on the council who might well want me dead i would have to start being more careful i rolled down the beetles windows on the way back to chicago to help me stay awake i was exhausted but my mind was racing around like a hamster on an exercise wheel working furiously getting nowhere the irony was thick enough to make my tongue curl the white council suspected me of the killings and if no other suspect came forward i was going to take the rap murphys investigation had just become very very important to me but to pursue the investigation i would have to try to figure out how the killer had pulled off that spell and to do that i would have to indulge in highly questionable research that would probably be enough to get me a death sentence all by itself catch twentytwo if i had any respect at all for morgans intelligence i would have suspected him of pulling off the killings himself and setting me up to take the blame but that just didnt track morgan might twist and bend the rules to get what he saw as justice but hed never blatantly violate them but if not morgan then who could have done it there just werent all that many people who could get enough power into that kind of spell to make it workunless there was some flaw in the quasiphysics that governed magic that let hearts explode more easily than other things and i wouldnt know that until i had pursued the forbidden research bianca would have more information on who might have done itshe had to i had already planned on talking to the vampiress but morgans visit had made it a necessity rather than merely a priority murphy was not going to be thrilled that i was thrusting myself into her side of this investigation and better and better because white council business was all hushhush to nonwizards i wouldnt be able to explain to her why i was doing it further joy you know sometimes i think someone up there really hates me chapter eight by the time i got home it was after two oclock in the morning the clock in the beetle didnt work of course but i made a pretty good guess from the position of the stars and the moon i was strung out weary and my nerves were stretched as tight as guitar strings i didnt think sleep was likely so i decided to do a little alchemy to help me unwind ive often wished that i had some suave and socially acceptable hobby that i could fall back on in times like this you know play the violin or was it the viola like sherlock holmes or maybe twiddle away on the pipe organ like the disney version of captain nemo but i dont im sort of the arcane equivalent of a classic computer geek i do magic in one form or another and thats pretty much it i really need to get a life one of these days i live in a basement apartment beneath a big roomy old house that has been divided up into lots of different apartments the basement and the subbasement below it are both mine which is sort of neat im the only tenant living on two floors and my rent is cheaper than all the people who have whole windows the house is full of creaks and sighs and settling boards and time and lives have worn their impressions into the wood and the brick i can hear all the sounds all the character of the place above and around me all through the night its an old place but it sings in the darkness and is in its own quirky little way alive its home mister was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs that led down to the apartments front door mister is an enormous grey cat i mean enormous there are dogs smaller than mister he weighs in at just over thirty pounds and there isnt an undue amount of fat on his frame i think maybe his father was a wildcat or a lynx or something i had found mister in a garbage can about three years before a mewling kitten with his tail torn off by a dog or a cari was never sure which but mister hated both and would either attack or flee from them on sight mister had recovered his dignity over the next few months and shortly came to believe that he was the apartments tenant and i was someone he barely tolerated to share the space with him right now he looked up and mrowed at me in an annoyed tone i thought you had a hot date i told him he sauntered over to me and rammed one shoulder playfully against my knee i wavered recovered my balance and unlocked the door mister as was his just due entered before i did my apartment is a studio one nottoolarge room with a kitchenette in the corner and a fireplace to one side theres a door that leads to the other room my bedroom and bathroom and then theres the hinged door in the floor that goes down to the subbasement where i keep my lab ive got things pretty heavily texturedthere are multiple carpets on the floor tapestries on the walls a collection of knickknacks and oddities on every available surface my staff and my sword cane in the corner and several bulging bookshelves which i really will organize one day mister went to his spot before the fireplace and demanded that it be made warm i obliged him with a fire and lit a lamp as well oh i have lights and so on but they foul up so often it almost isnt worth turning them on and im not even about to take chances with the gas heater i stick with the simple things the fireplace and my candles and lamps i have a special charcoal stove and a vent to take most of the smoke out though the whole place smells a little of woodsmoke and charcoal no matter what i do i took off my duster and got out my heavy flannel robe before i went down into the lab thats why wizards wear robes i swear to you its just too damned cold in the lab to go without one i clambered down the ladder to the lab carrying my candle with me and lit a few lamps a pair of burners and a kerosene heater in the corner the lights came up and revealed a long table in the center of the room other tables against three of the walls around it and a clear space at one end of the room where a brass circle had been laid out on the floor and fastened into the cement with ushaped bolts shelves over the tables were crowded with empty cages boxes tupperware jars cans containers of all descriptions a pair of unusual antlers a couple of fur pelts several musty old books a long row of notebooks filled with my own cramped writing and a bleached white human skull bob i said i started clearing space off of the center table dumping boxes and grocery sacks and plastic tubs over the brass circle on the floor i needed room to work bob wake up there was a moment of silence while i started getting some things down from the shelves bob i said louder come on lazybones a pair of lights came up in the empty sockets of the skull orangish flickering like candle flames it isnt enough the skull said that i have to wake up i have to wake up to bad puns what is it about you that you have to make the bad puns quit whining i told him cheerfully weve got work to do bob the skull grumbled something in old french i think though i got lost when he got to the anatomical improbabilities of bullfrogs he yawned and his bony teeth rattled when his mouth clicked closed again bob wasnt really a human skull he was a spirit of airsort of like a faery but different he made his residence inside the skull that had been prepared for him several hundred years ago and it was his job to remember things for obvious reasons i cant use a computer to store information and keep track of the slowly changing laws of quasiphysics thats why i had bob he had worked with dozens of wizards over the years and it had given him a vast repertoire of knowledgethat and a really cocky attitude blasted wizards he mumbled i cant sleep so were going to make a couple of potions sound good like i have a choice bob said whats the occasion i brought bob up to speed on what had happened that day he whistled no easy trick without lips and said sounds sticky pretty sticky i agreed tell you what he said let me out for a ride and ill tell you how to get out of it that made me wary bob i let you out once remember he nodded dreamily scraping bone on wood the sorority house i remember i snorted and started some water to boiling over one of the burners youre supposed to be a spirit of intellect i dont understand why youre obsessed with sex bobs voice got defensive its an academic interest harry oh yeah well maybe i dont think its fair to let your academia go peeping in other peoples houses wait a minute my academia doesnt just peep i held up a hand save it i dont want to hear it he grunted youre trivializing what getting out for a bit means to me harry youre insulting my masculinity bob i said youre a skull you dont have any masculinity to insult oh yeah bob challenged me pot kettle black harry have you gotten a date yet huh most men have something better to do in the middle of the night than play with their chemistry sets as a matter of fact i told him im set up for saturday night bobs eyes fluttered from orange to red oooooo he leered is she pretty dark skin i said dark hair dark eyes legs to die for smart sexy as hell bob chortled think shed like to see the lab get your mind out of the gutter no seriously bob said if shes so great whats she doing with you you arent exactly sir gawain you know it was my turn to get defensive she likes me i said is that such a shock harry bob drawled his eye lights flickering smugly what you know about women i could juggle i stared at bob for a moment and realized with a somewhat sinking feeling that the skull was probably right not that i would admit that to him not in a million years but he was were going to make an escape potion i told him i dont want to be all night so can we get to work huh i can only remember about half the recipe theres always room to make two if youre making one harry you know that that much was true the process of mixing up an alchemical potion is largely stirring simmering and waiting you can always get another one going and alternate between them sometimes you can even do three though thats pushing it okay so well make a copy oh come on bob chided me thats dull you should stretch yourself try something new like what bobs eye sockets twinkled cheerfully a love potion harry if you wont let me out at least let me do that spirits know you could use it and no i said firmly no way no love potion fine he said no love potion no escape potion either bob i said warningly bobs eye lights winked out i growled i was tired and cranky and under the best of circumstances i am not exactly a type a personality i stalked over picked up bob by the jaws and shook him hey i shouted bob you come out of there or im going to take this skull and throw it down the deepest well i can find i swear to you ill put you somewhere where no one can ever let you out ever again bobs eyes winked on for a moment no you wont im far too valuable then they winked out again i gritted my teeth and tried not to smash the skull to little pieces on the floor i took deep breaths summoning years of wizardly training and control to not throw a tantrum and break the nice spirit to little pieces instead i put the skull back on the shelf and counted slowly to thirty could i make the potion by myself i probably could but i had the sinking feeling that it might not have precisely the effect i wanted potions were a tricky business and a lot more relied upon precise details than upon intent like in spells and just because i made a love potion didnt mean i had to use it right it would only be good for a couple of days in any casesurely not through the weekend how much trouble could it cause i struggled to rationalize the action it would appease bob and give him some kind of vicarious thrill love potions were about the cheapest things in the world to make so it wouldnt cost me too much and i thought if susan should ask me for some kind of demonstration of magic as she always did i could always no that would be too much that would be like admitting i couldnt get a woman to like me on my own and it would be unfair taking advantage of the woman what i wanted was the escape potion i might need it at biancas place and i could always use it if worse came to worst to make a getaway from morgan and the white council i would feel a lot better if i had the escape potion okay bob fine you win well do them both all right bobs eye lights came up warily youre sure youll do the love potion just like i say dont i always make the potions like you say bob what about that diet potion you tried okay that one was a mistake and the antigravity potion remember that we fixed the floor it was no big deal and the fine fine i growled you dont have to rub it in now cough up the recipes bob did so in fine humor and for the next two hours we made potions potions are all made pretty much the same way first you need a base to form the essential liquid content then something to engage each of the senses and then something for the mind and something else for the spirit eight ingredients all in all and theyre different for each and every potion and for each person who makes them bob had centuries of experience and he could extrapolate the most successful components for a given person to make into a potion he was right about being an invaluable resourcei had never even heard of a spirit with bobs experience and i was lucky to have him that didnt mean i didnt want to crack that skull of his from time to time though the escape potion was made in a base of eight ounces of jolt cola we added a drop of motor oil for the smell of it and cut a birds feather into tiny shavings for the tactile value three ounces of chocolatecovered espresso beans ground into powder went in next then a shredded bus ticket id never used for the mind and a small chain which i broke and then dropped in for the heart i unfolded a clean white cloth where id had a flickering shadow stored for just such an occasion and tossed it into the brew then opened up a glass jar where i kept my mouse scampers and tapped the sound out into the beaker where the potion was brewing youre sure this is going to work bob i said always thats a super recipe there smells terrible bobs lights twinkled they usually do whats it doing is this the superspeed one or the teleportation version bob coughed a little of both actually drink it and youll be the wind for a few minutes the wind i eyed him i havent heard of that one before bob i am an air spirit after all bob told me thisll work fine trust me i grumbled and set the first potion to simmering then started on the next one i hesitated after bob told me the first ingredient tequila i asked him skeptically are you sure on that one i thought the base for a love potion was supposed to be champagne champagne tequila whats the difference so long as itll lower her inhibitions bob said uh im thinking its going to get us a um sleazier result hey bob protested whos the memory spirit here me or you well whos got all the experience with women here me or you bob harry bob lectured me i was seducing shepherdesses when you werent a twinkle in your greatgrandcestors eyes i think i know what im doing i sighed too tired to argue with him okay okay sheesh tequila i got down the bottle measured eight ounces into the beaker and glanced up at the skull right now three ounces of dark chocolate chocolate i demanded chicks are into chocolate harry i muttered more interested in finishing than anything else and measured out the ingredients i did the same with a drop of perfume some namebrand imitation that i liked an ounce of shredded lace and the last sigh at the bottom of the glass jar i added some candlelight to the mix and it took on a rosy golden glow great bob said thats just right okay now we add the ashes of a passionate love letter i blinked at the skull uh bob im fresh out of those bob snorted how did i guess look on the shelf behind me i did and found a pair of romance novels their covers filled with impossibly delightful flesh hey where did you get these my last trip out bob answered blithely page one seventyfour the paragraph that starts with her milkywhite breasts tear that page out and burn it and add those ashes in i choked that will work hey women eat these things up trust me fine i sighed this is the spirit ingredient uhhuh bob said he was rocking back and forth on his jawbones in excitement now just a teaspoon of powdered diamond and were done i rubbed at my eyes diamond i dont have any diamonds bob i figured youre cheap thats why women dont like you look just tear up a fifty into real little pieces and put that in there a fiftydollar bill i demanded money bob opined very sexy i muttered and got the remaining fifty out of my pocket shredding it and tossing it in to complete the potion the next step was where the effort came in once all the ingredients are mixed together you have to force enough energy through them to activate them it isnt the actual physical ingredients that are importantits the meaning that they carry too the significance that they have for the person making the potion and for those who will be using it the energy from magic comes from a lot of places it can come from a special place usually some spectacular natural site like mount st helens or old faithful from a focus of some kind like stonehenge is on a large scale or from inside of people the best magic comes from the inside sometimes its just pure mental effort raw willpower sometimes its emotions and feelings all of them are viable tinder to be used for the proverbial fire i had a lot of worry to use to fuel the magic and a lot of annoyance and one hell of a lot of stubbornness i murmured the requisite quasilatin litany over the potions over and over feeling a kind of resistance building just out of the range of the physical senses but there nonetheless i gathered up all my worry and anger and stubbornness and threw them all at the resistance in one big ball shaping them with the strength and tone of my words the magic left me in a sudden wave like a pitcher abruptly emptied out i love this part bob said just as both potions exploded into puffs of greenish smoke and began to froth up over the lips of the beakers i sagged onto a stool and waited for the potions to fizz down all the strength gone out of me the weariness building up like a load of bricks on my shoulders once the frothing had settled i leaned over and poured each potion into its own individual sports bottle with a squeezetop then labeled the containers with a permanent magic markervery clearly i dont take chances in getting potions mixed up anymore ever since the invisibilityhair tonic incident from when i was trying to grow out a decent beard you wont regret this harry bob assured me thats the best potion ive ever made i made it not you i growled i really was exhausted nowway too tired to let petty concerns like possible execution keep me from bed sure sure bob agreed whatever harry i went around the room putting out all the fires and the kerosene heater then climbed the ladder back to the basement without saying good night bob was chortling happily to himself as i did i stumbled to my bed and fell into it mister always climbs in and goes to sleep draped over my legs i waited for him and a few seconds later he showed up settling down and purring like a miniature outboard motor i struggled to put together an itinerary for the next couple of days through the haze of exhaustion talk to the vampire locate missing husband avoid the wrath of the white council find the killer before he found me an unpleasant thoughtbut i decided that i wasnt going to let that bother me either and curled up to go to sleep chapter nine friday night i went to see bianca the vampiress i didnt just leap out of bed and go see her of course you dont go walking into the proverbial lions den lightly you start with a good breakfast my breakfast took place around three in the afternoon when i woke up to hear my phone ringing i had to get out of bed and pad into the main room to answer it mmmrrmmph i grumbled dresden murphy said what can you tell me murphy sounded stressed her voice had that distinct edge that she got whenever she was nervous and it rankled me like fingernails scraping on bones the investigation into tommy tomms murder must not be going well nothing yet i said then i lied to her a little i was up most of the night working but nothing to show yet she answered me with a swear word thats not good enough harry i need answers and i need them yesterday ill get to it as quick as i can get to it faster she snarled she was angry not that this was unusual for murphy but it told me that something else was going on some people panic when things get rough harried some people fall apart murphy got pissed commissioner riding your back again city police commissioner howard fairweather used murphy and her team as scapegoats for all sorts of unsolvable crimes that he had dumped in her lap fairweather was always lurking around trying for an opportunity to make murphy look bad as though by doing so he could avoid being crucified himself like a winged monkey from the wizard of oz kind of makes you wonder whos leaning on him to get things done her voice was sour as ripe lemons i heard her drop an alkaseltzer into a glass of liquid im serious harry you get me those answers i need and you get them to me fast i need to know if this was sorcery and if so how it was done and who could have done it names placesi need to know everything it isnt that simple mur then make it simple how long before you can tell me i need an estimate for the commissioners investigative committee in fifteen minutes or i might as well turn in my badge today i grimaced if i was able to get something out of bianca i might be able to help murph on the investigationbut if it proved fruitless i was going to have spent the entire evening doing nothing productive and murphy needed her answers now maybe i should have made a stayawake potion does the committee work weekends murphy snorted are you kidding well have something by monday then you can have it figured out by then she asked i dont know how much good it will do you even if i can puzzle it out i hope youve got more to go on than this i heard her sigh into the phone and drink the fizzy drink dont let me down harry time to change the subject before she pinned me down and smelled me lying i had no intention of doing the forbidden research if i could find a way out of doing it no luck with bianca another swear word that bitch wont talk to us just smiles and nods and blows smoke makes small talk and crosses her legs you should have seen carmichael drooling well tough to blame him maybe i hear shes cute listen murph what if i just no harry absolutely not you will not go over to the velvet room you will not talk to that woman and you will not get involved in this lieutenant murphy i drawled a little jealous are we dont flatter yourself youre a civilian dresden even if you do have your investigators license if you get your ass laid out in the hospital or the morgue itll be me that suffers for it murph im touched ill touch your head to a brick wall a few times if you cross me on this harry her voice was sharp vehement hey wind down murph if you dont want me to go no problem whups a lie shed be all over that like a troll on a billy goat youre a lousy liar harry godammit i ought to take you down to lockup just to keep you from what i said loudly into the receiver murph youre breaking up i cant hear you damn phone again call me back then i hung up on her mister padded over to me and batted at my leg he watched me with serious green eyes as i leaned down and unplugged the phone as it started to ring again okay mister you hungry i got us breakfast leftover steak sandwich for him spaghettios heated up on the wood stove for me i rationed out my last can of coke which mister craves at least as badly as i do and by the time i was done eating and drinking and petting i was awake and thinking againand getting ready for sundown daylight savings time hadnt cut in yet and dark would fall around six i had about two hours to get set to go you might think you know a thing or two about vampires maybe some of the stuff youve heard is accurate likely its not either way i wasnt looking forward to the prospect of going into biancas lair to demand information from her i was going to assume that things were going to get ugly before all was said and done just to make sure i didnt get caught with my staff down wizardry is all about thinking ahead about being prepared wizards arent really superhuman we just have a leg up on seeing things more clearly than other people and being able to use the extra information we have for our benefit hell the word wizard comes from the same root as wise we know things we arent any stronger or faster than anyone else we dont even have all that much more going in the mental department but were godawful sneaky and if we get the chance to get set for something we can do some impressive things as a wizard if youre ready to address a problem then its likely that youll be able to come up with something that will let you deal with it so i got together all the things i thought i might need i made sure my cane was polished and ready i put my silver knife in a sheath that hung just under my left arm i put the escape potion in its plastic squeezebottle into my dusters pocket i put on my favorite talisman a silver pentacle on a silver chainit had been my mothers my father had passed it down to me and i put a small folded piece of white cloth into my pocket i had several enchanted items aroundor halfenchanted items anyway carrying out a full enchantment is expensive and timeconsuming and i just couldnt afford to do it very much we bluecollar wizards just have to sling a few spells out where we can and hope they dont go stale at the wrong time i would have been a lot more comfortable if i had been carrying my blasting rod or my staff but that would be like showing up at biancas door in a tank walking in carrying a machine gun and a flamethrower while announcing my intention to fight i had to maintain a fine balance between going in ready for trouble and going in asking for trouble not that i was afraid mind you i didnt think bianca would be willing to cause problems for a mortal wizard bianca wouldnt want to piss off the white council by messing with me on the other hand i wasnt exactly the white councils favorite guy they might even look the other way if bianca decided to take me quietly out of the picture careful harry i warned myself dont get entirely paranoid if you get like that youll be building your little apartment into a basement of solitude what do you think i asked mister once i was decked out in what paraphernalia i was willing to carry mister went to the door and batted at it insistently everyones a critic fine fine i sighed i let him out then i went out got into my car and drove down to the velvet room in its expensive lakeside location bianca runs her business out of a huge old mansion from the early days of the roaring twenties rumor has it that the infamous al capone had it built for one of his mistresses there was a gate with an iron fence and a security guard i pulled the beetle up into the little swath of driveway that began at the street and ended at the fence there was a hiccoughing rattle from back in the engine as i brought the machine to a halt i rolled down the window and stuck my head out peering back something went whoomph and then black smoke poured out from the bottom of the car and scuttled down the slope of the drive and into the street i winced the engine gave an almost apologetic rattle and shuddered to its death great now i had no ride home i got out of the beetle and stood mourning it for a moment the security guard on the other side of the gate was a blocky man not overly tall but overly muscled and hiding it under an expensive suit he studied me with attackdog eyes and then said through the gate do you have an appointment no i told him but i think bianca will want to see me he looked unimpressed im sorry he said bianca is out for the evening things are never simple anymore i shrugged at him folded my arms and leaned on the hood of the beetle suit yourself ill just stay until a tow truck comes by then until i can get this thing out of the drive for you he stared at me his eyes narrowed down to tiny slits with the effort of thinking eventually the thoughts got to his brain got processed and sent back out with a message to pass the buck ill call your name in he said good man i approved you wont be sorry name he growled harry dresden if he recognized my name it didnt show on his face he glared at me and the beetle then walked a few paces off lifting a cellular phone from his pocket and to his ear i listened listening isnt hard to do no one has practice at it nowadays but you can train yourself to pay attention to your senses if you work at it long enough ive got a guy down here says that bianca will want to talk to him the guard said says his name is harry dresden he was silent for a moment i couldnt quite make out the buzz of the other voice other than that it was female uhhuh he said he glanced back at me uhhuh he said again sure sure i will of course maam i reached in through the window of the beetle and got out my cane i rested it on the concrete beside my boots and tapped it a few times as though impatient the guard turned back to me leaned over to one side and pushed a button somewhere the gate buzzed and clicked open come on in mr dresden he said i can have someone come tow your car if you like super i told him i gave him the name of the wrecker mike has a deal with and told him to tell the guy that it was harrys car again fido the guard dutifully noted this down writing on a small notebook he drew from a pocket while he did i walked past him toward the house clicking my cane on the concrete with every pace stop he told me his voice calm and confident people dont speak with that kind of absolute authority unless they have a gun in their hands i stopped put the cane down he told me and put your arms up you are to be searched before you are allowed inside i sighed did what he said and let him pat me down i didnt turn around to face him but i could smell the metal of his gun he found the knife and took it his fingers brushed the nape of my neck felt the chain there whats this he said pentacle i told him let me see it use one hand i used my left to draw it out of my shirt and show it to him a silver fivepointed star within a circle all smooth geometry he grunted and said fine the search went on and he found the plastic squeezebottle he took it out of my pocket opened it and sniffed at it whats this a health cola i told him smells like shit he said capped it and put it back in my pocket what about my cane returned when you leave he said damn my knife and my cane had been my only physical lines of defense anything else i did would have to rely wholly upon magic and that could be dicey on the best of days it was enough to rattle me of course fido the guard had missed a couple of things first hed overlooked the clean white handkerchief in my pocket second hed passed me on with my pentacle still upon my neck he probably figured that since it wasnt a crucifix or a cross that i couldnt use it to keep bianca away from me which wasnt true vampires and other such creatures dont respond to symbols as such they respond to the power that accompanies an act of faith i couldnt ward off a vampire mosquito with my faith in the almightyhe and i have just never seemed to connect but the pentacle was a symbol of magic itself and i had plenty of faith in that and of course fido had overlooked my getaway potion bianca really ought to trust her guards with more awareness of the supernatural and what sort of things to look for the house itself was elegant very roomy with the high ceilings and the broad floors that they just dont make anymore a wellgroomed young woman with a short straight haircut greeted me in the enormous entry hall i was passing polite to her and she showed me to a library its walls lined with old books in leather bindings similar to the leathercushioned chairs around the enormous old dogfoot table in the rooms center i took a seat and waited and waited and waited more than half an hour went by before bianca finally arrived she came into the room like a candle burning with a cold clear flame her hair was a burnished shade of auburn that was too dark to cast back any ruddy highlights but did anyway her eyes were dark clear her complexion flawlessly smooth and elegantly graced with cosmetics she was not a tall woman but shapely wearing a black dress with a plunging neckline and a slash in one side that showed off a generous portion of pale thigh black gloves covered her hands to above the elbows and her threehundreddollar shoes were a study in highheeled torture devices she looked too good to be true mister dresden she greeted me this is an unexpected pleasure i rose when she entered the room madame bianca i replied nodding to her we meet at last hearsay neglected to mention how lovely you are she laughed lips shaping the sounds head falling back just enough to show a flash of pale throat a gentleman they said i see that they were correct it is a charmingly passe thing to be a gentleman in this country you and i are of another world i said she approached me and extended her hand a motion oozing feminine grace i bowed over her hand briefly taking it and brushing my lips against the back of her glove do you really think im beautiful mister dresden she asked me as lovely as a star madame polite and a pretty one too she murmured her eyes flickered over me from head to toe but even she avoided meeting gazes with me whether from a desire to avoid inadvertently directing her power at me or being on the receiving end of mine i couldnt tell she continued into the room and stopped beside one of the comfortable chairs as a matter of course i stepped around the table and drew out the chair for her seating her she crossed her legs in that dress in those shoes and made it look good i blinked for just a moment then returned to my own seat so mister dresden what brings you to my humble house care for an evening of entertainment i quite assure you that you will never have another experience like it she placed her hands in her lap smiling at me i smiled at her and put one hand into my pocket onto the white handkerchief no thank you i came to talk her lips parted in a silent ah i see about what if i might ask about jennifer stanton and her murder i had all of a seconds warning biancas eyes narrowed then widened like those of a cat about to spring then she was coming at me over the table faster than a breath her arms extended toward my throat i toppled over backward in my chair even though id started to move first it almost wasnt enough to get away from her reaching nails in time one grazed my throat with a hot sensation of pain and she kept coming following me down to the floor those rich lips drawn back from sharp fangs i jerked my hand out of my pocket and flapped open my white hanky at her releasing the image of sunlight id been storing for use in potions it lit up the room for a moment brilliant the light smashed into bianca hurled her back across the old table into one of the shelves and tore pieces of flesh away from her like bits of rotten meat being peeled off a carcass by a sandblaster she screamed and the flesh around her mouth sloughed and peeled away like a snakes scales i had never seen a real vampire before i would have time to be terrified later i took in the details as i tugged my talisman off over my neck it had a batlike face horrid and ugly the head too big for its body gaping hungry jaws its shoulders were hunched and powerful membranous wings stretched between the joints of its almost skeletal arms flabby black breasts hung before it spilling out of the black dress that no longer looked feminine its eyes were wide black and staring and a kind of leathery slimy hide covered its flesh like an inner tube lathered with vaseline though there were tiny holes corroded in it by the sunlight i had brought with me it recovered quickly crouching and spreading long arms that ended in clawtipped fingers to either side with a hiss of rage i drew my pentacle into my fist raised it like every vampire slayer you ever saw does it and said jesus christ lady i just came here to talk the vampire hissed and started toward me with a gangling weirdly graceful step its clawed feet were still wearing the threehundreddollar black pumps back i said taking a step towards it myself the pentacle began to burn with the cold clear light of applied will and beliefmy faith if you will that it could turn such a monster aside it hissed and turned its face aside lifting its membranous arms to shield its eyes from the light it took one step back and then another until its hunched back was pressed against a wall of books now what did i do i wasnt going to go try to put a stake through her heart but if i lowered my will she might come at me againand i didnt think i had anything even the quickest evocations that i could get out of my mouth before she tore it off of my head and even if i got past her she probably had mortal lackies like the security guard at the gate who would be happy to kill me if they saw me trashing their mistress you killed her the vampire snarled and its voice was exactly the same sultry and feminine even though twisted by rage and coming from that horrid mouth it was unsettling you killed jennifer she was mine mageling look i told her i didnt come here for any of this and the police know im here save yourself a lot of trouble sit down talk with me and then well both go away happy christ bianca do you think that if id killed jennifer and tommy tomm that id just be waltzing in here like this you expect me to believe that you didnt you will never leave this house alive i was feeling angry myself and frightened christ even the vampire thought i was the bad guy whatll it take to convince you that i didnt do it black bottomless eyes stared at me through the burning fire of my faith i could feel some sort of power there trying to get at me and held off by the force of my will just as the creature itself was the vampire snarled lower the amulet wizard if i do are you going to come at my throat again if you do not i most certainly will shaky logic that i tried to work through the situation from her point of view she had been scared when i showed up shed had me searched and divested of weapons as best she could if she thought that i was jennifer stantons murderer would the mere mention of that name have brought that sudden violence out of her i began to get that sinking feeling you get when you realize that not everything is as it appears if i put this down i told her i want your word that youll sit down and talk to me i swear to you by fire and wind that i had nothing to do with her death the vampire hissed at me shielding its eyes from the light with one taloned hand why should i believe you why should i believe you i countered yellowed fangs showed in its mouth if you do not trust my word wizard then how can i trust yours then you give it the vampire stiffened and though its voice was still harsh with rage and pain still sexy as a silk shirt without any buttons i thought i heard the ring of truth in its words you have my promise lower your talisman and we will talk time for another calculated risk i tossed the pentacle onto the table the cold light drained away leaving the room lit by mere electricity once more the vampire slowly lowered its arms blinking its toobig eyes at me and then at the pentacle upon the table a long pink tongue flickered out nervously over its jaws and lower face then slipped back into its mouth it was surprised i realized surprised that i had done it my heart was racing but i forced my fear back down out of my forebrain and into the background vampires are like demons like wolves like sharks you dont let them think that you are potential food and get their respect at the same time the vampires true appearance was grotesquebut it wasnt as bad as some of the things i had seen in my day some demons were a lot worse and some of the elder things could rip your mind apart just by letting you look at them i regarded the creature with a level gaze how about it i said lets talk the longer we sit around staring at one another the longer jennifers killer stays free the vampire stared at me for a moment more then it shuddered drawing its wing membranes about itself black slime turned into patches of pale perfect flesh that spread over the vampires dark skin like a growth of fungus the flabby black breasts swelled into softly rounded rosytipped perfection once more bianca stood before me a moment later settling her dress back into modesty again her arms crossed over her as though she was cold her back stiff and her eyes angry she was no less beautiful than she had been a few moments before not a line or a curve any different but for me the glamour had been ruined she still had the same eyes dark and fathomless and alien i would always remember what she truly looked like beneath her flesh mask i stooped and picked up my chair righting it then i went around the table turned my back on her and stood hers up as well then i held it out for her just as i had when i had entered the room she stared at me for a long minute some expression flickered across her face she was disconcerted by my apparent lack of concern about the way she looked and it told then she lifted her chin proud and settled gracefully into the chair again regal as any queen every line stiff with anger the old world rules of courtesy and hospitality were holdingbut for how long i returned to my seat and leaned over to pick up my white handkerchief toying with it biancas angry eyes flickered down to it and once again she repeated the nervous gesture of licking her teeth and lips though this time her tongue looked human so tell me about jennifer and tommy tomm i said she shook her head almost sneering i can tell you what i told the police i dont know who could have killed them come on bianca we dont have to hide things from one another were not a part of the mortal world her eyebrows slanted down revealing more anger no youre the only one in the city with the kind of skill required to cast that sort of spell if you didnt do it i have no idea who else could have you dont have any enemies anyone who might have been wanting to make an impression on you a bitter little line appeared at the corner of her lips something that was not quite a smile of course but none of them could have managed what happened to tommy and jenny she drummed her fingernails over the tabletop leaving little score marks in the wood i dont let any enemies that dangerous run around alive at least not for long i settled back in my chair frowning and did my damnedest not to let her see how scared i was how did you know tommy tomm she shrugged her shoulders gleaming like porcelain and just as brittle you may have thought he was just a bruiser for johnny marcone mister dresden but tommy was a very gentle and considerate man underneath he was always good to his women he treated them like real people her gaze shifted from side to side not lifting like human beings i wouldnt take on a client if i thought he wouldnt be a gentleman but tommy was better than most i met him years ago elsewhere i always made sure he had someone to take care of him when he wanted an evening of company you sent jennifer out to him that night she nodded her expression bleak her nails drummed the tabletop again gouging out more wood was there anyone else he saw on a regular basis maybe someone who would have talked to him known what was going on in his life bianca shook her head no she said but then she frowned i just watched her and absently tossed the handkerchief on the tabletop her eyes flicked to it then up to mine i didnt flinch i met her bottomless gaze and quirked my mouth up in a little smile as though i had something more and worse to pull out of my hat if she wanted to come after me again i saw her anger her rage and for just a moment i got a peek inside saw the source of it she was furious that i had seen her true form horrified and embarrassed that i had stripped her disguise away and seen the creature beneath and she was afraid that i could take away even her mask forever with my power more than anything else bianca wanted to be beautiful and tonight i had destroyed her illusion i had rattled her gilded little world she sure as hell wasnt going to let me forget that she shuddered and jerked her eyes away furious and frightened at the same time before i could see any deeper into heror she into me if i had not given you my word dresden she whispered i would kill you this instant that would be unfortunate i said i kept my voice hard you should know the risks in a wizards death curse youve got something to lose bianca and even if you could take me out you can bet your pretty ass id be dragging you into hell with me she stiffened then turned her head to one side and let her fingers go limp it was a silent bitter surrender she didnt move quickly enough for me to miss seeing a tear streak down one cheek id made the vampire cry great i felt like a real superhero harry dresden breaker of monsters hearts there may be one person who might know something she said her lovely voice dull flat lifeless i had a woman who worked for me linda randall she and jennifer went out on calls together when customers wanted that sort of thing they were close where is she now i asked shes working as a driver for someone some rich couple who wanted a servant that would do more than windows she wasnt the type i usually keep around in any case i think jennifer had her phone number i can have someone fetch it for you mister dresden she said my name as though it were something bitter and poisonous that she wanted to spit out thank you that would be very kind i kept my tone carefully formal neutral formality and a good bluff were all that was keeping her from my throat she remained quiet controlling her evident emotions before she started to look up again at last her eyes froze then widened when they came to my throat her expression went perfectly inhumanly still i grew tense not just tense but steeltight wirebound springcoiled i was out of tricks and weapons if she came after me now i wasnt going to get the chance to defend myself there was no way i would be able to drink the potion before she tore me apart i gripped the arms of my chair hard to keep myself from bolting do not show fear do not run away it would only make her chase me snap her instincts into the reaction of pursuing the prey youre bleeding mister dresden she whispered i lifted my hand slowly to my throat where her nails had scored me earlier my fingertips came away slick with my own blood bianca kept on staring her tongue flickered around her mouth again cover it she whispered a strange mewling sound came out of her mouth cover it dresden i picked up my handkerchief and pressed it over my throat bianca blinked her eyes closed slowly and then turned away halfhunched over her stomach she didnt stand up go she told me go now paulas coming ill send her down to the gate with the phone number in a little while i walked toward the door but then stopped glancing back at her there was a sort of horrid fascination to it to knowing what was beneath the alluring exterior the flesh mask but seeing it twist and writhe with need go bianca whimpered fury hunger and some emotion i couldnt even begin to fathom made her voice stretched out thinner go and do not think that i will not remember this night do not think that i will not make you regret it the door to the library opened and the straighthaired young woman who had greeted me earlier entered the room she gave me a passing glance then walked past me kneeling at biancas side paula i presumed paula murmured something too soft to hear gently brushing biancas hair back from her face with one hand then she unbuttoned the sleeve of her blouse rolled it up past her elbow and pressed her wrist to biancas mouth i had a good view of what happened biancas tongue flashed out long and pink and sticky smearing paulas wrist with shining saliva paula shuddered at the touch her breath coming quicker her nipples stiffened beneath the thin fabric of the blouse and she let her head fall slowly backwards her eyes were glazed over with a narcotic languor like a junkie who had just shot up biancas fangs extended and slashed open paulas pale pretty skin blood welled biancas tongue began to flash in and out faster than could really be seen lapping the blood up as quickly as it appeared her dark eyes were narrowed distant paula was gasping and moaning in pleasure her entire body shivering i felt a little sick and withdrew step by step not turning my back on the scene paula toppled slowly to the floor writhing her way toward unconsciousness with an evident glee bianca followed her down unladylike now a creature of bestial hunger she crouched over the supine woman and in the hunch of her pale shoulders i could see the batlike thing beneath the flesh mask lapping up paulas blood i got out of there fast shutting the door behind me my heart was hammering too quickly the scene with paula might have aroused me if i hadnt seen what was underneath biancas mask instead it only made me sick to my stomach afraid the woman had given herself to that thing as quickly and as willingly as any woman to her lover the saliva some part of me rationalized desperate to latch on to something cold and logical and detached the saliva was probably narcotic perhaps even addictive it would explain paulas behavior the need to have more of her drug but i wondered if paula would have been so eager had she known biancas true face now i understood why the white council was so hardnosed with vampires if they could get that kind of control over a mortal what would happen if they could get their hooks into a wizard if they could addict a wizard to them as thoroughly as bianca had the girl id just seen surely it wasnt possible but if it wasnt why would the council be so nervous about them do not think i will not make you regret it she had said i felt cold as i hurried down the dark driveway toward the gate fido the security guard was waiting for me at the front gate and passed back my knife and my cane without a word a tow truck was out front latching itself to the beetle i put one hand on the cold metal of the gate and kept the other with its handkerchief pressed to my throat as i watched george the towtruck guy work he recognized me and waved flashing a grin that showed the white teeth in his dark face i nodded back i wasnt up to answering the smile a few minutes later the guards cellular phone beeped at him he withdrew several paces repeated several affirmatives then took a notebook from his pocket writing something down he put the phone away and walked back over to me offering me the piece of paper whats this i said the phone number you were looking for and a message i glanced at the paper but avoided reading it just then i thought bianca was going to send paula down with it he didnt say anything but his jaw tightened and i saw his eyes flick toward the house where his mistress was he swallowed paula wasnt coming out of the house and fido was afraid i took the paper i kept my hand from shaking as i looked at it on it was a phone number and a single word regret i folded the piece of paper in half and put it away into the pocket of my duster another enemy super at least with my hands in my pockets fido couldnt see them shaking maybe i should have listened to murphy maybe i should have stayed home and played with some nice safe forbidden black magic instead chapter ten i departed biancas place in georges loaner a woodpanel studebaker that grumbled and growled and squealed everywhere it went i stopped at a pay phone a short distance from the house and called linda randalls number the phone rang several times before a quiet dusky contralto answered beckitts this is linda linda randall i asked mmmm she answered she had a furry velvety voice something tactile whos this my name is harry dresden i was wondering if i could talk to you harry who she asked dresden im a private investigator she laughed the sound rich enough to roll around naked in investigating my privates mr dresden i like you already i coughed ah yes ms randall miss she said cutting in miss randall im not occupied at the moment miss randall i amended id like to ask you some questions about jennifer stanton if i could silence on the other end of the line i could hear some sounds in the background a radio playing perhaps and a recorded voice talking about white zones and red zones and loading and unloading of vehicles miss randall no she said it wont take long and i assure you that you arent the subject of anything im doing if you could just give me a few moments of your time no she told me im on duty and will be the rest of the night i dont have time for this jennifer stanton was a friend of yours shes been murdered if theres anything you could tell me that might help she cut me off again there isnt she said goodbye mr dresden the line went dead i scowled at the phone frustrated that was it then i had gone through all the preparation the faceoff with bianca and possible future trouble for nothing no way i thought no way in hell bianca had said that linda randall was working as a driver for someone the beckitts i presumed whoever they were id recognized the voice in the background as a recorded message that played outside the concourses at ohare airport so she was in a car at the airport maybe waiting to pick up the beckitts and definitely not there for long with no time to lose i kicked the wheezing old studebaker into gear and drove to ohare it was far easier to blow off someone over the phone than it was to do it in person there were several concourses but i had to trust to luckluck to guide me to the right one and luck to get me there before miss iamnotoccupied randall had the opportunity to pick up her employers and leave and a little more luck to keep the studebaker running all the way to ohare the studebaker did make it all the way there and on the second concourse i came across a silver baby limo idling in a parking zone the interior was darkened so i couldnt see inside very well it was a friday evening and the place was busy business folk in their sober suits returning home from long trips about the country cars continually purred in and out of the semicircular drive a uniformed cop was directing traffic keeping people from doing brainless things like parking in the middle of one of the traffic lanes in order to load up the car i swerved the old studebaker into a parking place racing a volvo for it and winning by dint of driving the older and heavier vehicle and having the more suicidal attitude i kept an eye on the silver limo as i got out of the car and strode over to a bank of pay phones i plopped my quarter in and once more dialed the number provided by bianca the phone rang in the silver limo someone stirred beckitts this is linda she purred hello linda i said this is harry dresden again i could almost hear her smirk there was a flicker of light from inside the car the silhouette of a womans face then the orange glow of a cigarette being lit i thought i told you i didnt want to talk to you mr dresden i like women who play hard to get she laughed that delicious laugh i could see her head move in the darkened car when she did im getting harder to get by the second goodbye again she hung up on me i smiled hung up the phone walked over to the limo and rapped on the window it buzzed down and a woman in her midtwenties arched an eyebrow at me she had beautiful eyes the color of rain clouds a little too much eye shadow and brilliant scarlet lipstick on her cupidsbow lips her hair was a medium brown drawn back into a tight braid that made her cheeks look almost sharp severe except for her forelocks which hung down close to her eyes in insolent disarray she had a predatory look to her harsh sharp she wore a crisp white shirt grey slacks and held a lit cigarette in one hand the smoke curled up around my nose and i exhaled trying to push it away she looked me up and down frankly assessing dont tell me harry dresden i really need to talk to you miss randall it wont take long she glanced at her watch and then at the terminal doors then back up at me well youve got me cornered dont you im at your mercy her lips quirked she took a drag of her cigarette and i like a man who just wont stop i cleared my throat again the woman was attractive but not unduly so yet there was something about her that revved my engines something about the way she held her head or shaped her words that bypassed my brain and went straight to my hormones best to head directly to the point and minimize my chances of looking moronic how did you know jennifer stanton she looked up at me through long lashes intimately ahem you uh worked for bianca with her linda blew more smoke that prissy little bitch yes i worked with jen we were even roommates for a while shared a bed she wrapped her lips around the last word drawing it out with a little tremor that dripped wicked secret laughter did you know tommy tomm i asked oh sure fantastic in bed she lowered her eyes and shifted on the cars seat lowering one of her hands out of sight and making me wonder where it had gone he was a regular customer maybe twice a month jen and i would go over to his place have a little party she leaned toward me he could do things to a woman that would turn her into a real animal harry dresden you know what i mean growling and snarling in heat she was driving me crazy that voice of hers inspired the kinds of dreams you wish you could remember more clearly in the morning her expression promised to show me things that you dont talk about with other people if i would give her half a chance your job harry think about your job some days i really hate my job when was the last time you talked to her she took another drag and this time i saw a small shake to her fingers one she quickly hid just not quickly enough she was nervous nervous enough to be shaking and now i could see what she was up to she was wearing the alleycat mask appealing to my glands instead of my brain and trying to distract me with it trying to keep me from finding something out im not inhuman i can be distracted by a pretty face or body like any other youngish man linda randall was damned good at playing the part but i do not like to be made the fool so miss sex goddess what are you hiding i cleared my throat and asked mildly when was the last time you spoke to jennifer stanton miss randall she narrowed her eyes at me she wasnt dumb whatever else she was shed seen me reading her seeing through her pretense the flirting manner vanished are you a cop she demanded i shook my head scouts honor im just trying to find out what happened to her dammit she said softly she flicked the butt of the cigarette out onto the concrete and blew out a mouthful of smoke look i tell you anything and see a cop coming around i never saw you before got it i nodded i talked to jen on wednesday evening she called me it was tommys birthday she wanted to get together again her mouth twisted sort of a reunion i glanced about and leaned down closer to her did you her eyes were roving about now nervous like a cat who has found herself shut into a small room no she said i had to work i wanted to but did she say anything unusual anything that might have made you suspect she was in danger she shook her head again no nothing we hadnt talked much for a while i didnt see her as much after i split from the velvet room i frowned at her do you know what else she was doing anything she might have been involved with that could have gotten her hurt she shook her head no no nothing like that that wasnt her style she was sweet a lot of girls get likethey get pretty jaded mr dresden but it never really touched her she made people feel better about themselves somehow she looked away i could never do that all i did was get them off theres nothing you can tell me nothing you can think of she pressed her lips together and shook her head she shook her head and she lied to me as she did it i was just sure of it she was closing in tightening up and if there was nothing to tell me she wouldnt be trying to hide it she must know somethingunless she was just shutting down because id stomped all over her feelings as i had biancas either way she wasnt telling me anything else i tightened my fist frustrated if linda randall had no information for me i was at a dead end and id romped all over another womans feelingstwo in one night you are on a roll dresden even if one of them had been something nothuman why i asked her the words slipping out before i thought about them why the slut act she looked up at me again and smirked i saw the subtle shifting in her magnifying that sort of animal appeal she had once more as she had been doing when i first approached herbut it didnt hide the selfloathing in her eyes i looked away quickly before i had to see any more of it i got the feeling that i didnt want to see linda randalls soul because its what i do mr dresden for some people its drugs booze for me orgasms sex passion just another addict citys full of them she glanced aside next best thing to love and it keeps me in work excuse me she swung open the door i took a quick step back and out of her way as she moved to the back of the limo long legs taking long steps and opened the trunk a tall couple both wearing glasses and dressed in stylish grey business clothes emerged from the terminal and approached the limo they had the look of lifestyle professionals the kind that have a career and no kids with enough money and time to spend on making themselves look gooda nordictrack couple he was carrying an overnight bag over his shoulder and a small suitcase in one hand while she bore only a briefcase they wore no jewelry not even watches or wedding rings odd the man slung the luggage items into the limos trunk and looked from linda to me linda avoided his eyes he tried to speak quietly enough not to be heard but i have good ears whos this he asked his voice had a strained note to it just a friend mr beckitt a guy i used to see she answered him more lies more interesting i looked across the limo to the woman presumably mrs beckitt she regarded me with a calm face entirely void of emotion it was a little spooky she had the look id seen in films on the faces of prisoners released from the german stalags at the end of world war ii empty numb dead and just didnt know it yet linda opened the back door and let mr and mrs beckitt into the car mrs beckitt briefly put a hand on lindas waist in passing a gesture that was too intimate and possessive for the hired help i saw linda shiver then close the door she walked back around the car to me get out of here she said quietly i dont want to get in any trouble with my boss i reached for her hand grabbed it and held it between both of mine as an old lover might i supposed my business card was pressed between our palms my card if you think of anything else give me a call okay she turned away from me without answering but the card vanished into a pocket before she got back into the limo mrs beckitts dead eyes watched me through the side window as the limo went by me it was my turn to shiver like i said spooky i went on into the airport the monitors displaying flight times flickered to fuzz when i walked by i went to one of the cafes inside sat down and ordered myself a cup of coffee i had to pay for it with change most of my money had gone into paying off last months rent and into the love potion id let bob talk me into making money i needed to get to work on monica sellss case finding her husband i didnt want to get out of hot water with the white council only to lose my office and apartment because i couldnt pay the bills i sipped coffee and tried to organize my thoughts i had two areas of concern the most important was finding who had killed tommy tomm and jennifer stanton not only to catch the killer before any more corpses turned up but because if i didnt the white council would probably use the opportunity to have me put to death and while tracking down killers and avoiding execution squads i had to do some work for someone who would pay me tonights excursion wasnt something i could charge murphy forshed have my ass in a sling if she knew i was running around asking questions poking my nose in where it shouldnt be so if i wanted money from chicago pd i would have to spend time doing the research murphy wantedthe blackmagic research that could get me killed all by itself or i could work on monica sellss missing husband case i thought i had that one pretty well pegged down but it wouldnt hurt to get it fleshed out fully i could spend time working on it fill out the hours on the retainer maybe even get a few more added on that appealed to me a lot more than trying to work out some black magic so i could follow up on the lead toottoot had given me thered been pizza delivered out to the lake providence home that night time to talk to the deliveryman if possible i left the cafe went out to the pay phones and dialed directory assistance there was only one place near the lake providence address that delivered pizza i got the number and dialed through pizza spress someone with his mouth full said whatll it be tonight hey there i said i wonder if you can help me out im looking for the driver who took an order out to an address on wednesday night i told him the address and asked if i could speak to the driver another one he snorted sure hang on jack just got in from a run the voice on the other end of the line called out to someone and a minute later the high baritone of a young man spoke tentatively into my ear hhello hello i answered are you the driver who took pizza to look he said his voice exasperated and nervous i said i was sorry already it wont happen again i blinked for a minute off balance sorry for what jeezus he said i heard him move across a room with a lot of music and loud talk in the background and then the background noise cut off as though he had stepped into another room and shut the door behind him look he said in a half whine i told you im not gonna say anything to anyone i was only looking you cant blame me right no one answered the door what was i supposed to do his voice cracked in the middle of his sentences hell of a party but hey thats your business right i struggled to keep up with the kid what exactly did you see jack i asked him no ones face he assured me his voice growing more nervous he gave a jittery little laugh and tried to joke better things to look at than faces right i mean i dont give a damn what you do in your own house or your friends or whoever dont worry about me never going to say a thing next time ill just leave the pizza and run a tab right friends plural interesting the kid was awfully nervous he must have gotten an eyeful but i had a gut instinct that he was hiding something else keeping it back what else i asked him i kept my voice calm and neutral you saw something else what was it none of my business he said instantly none of my business look i gotta get off this line we have to keep it open for orders its friday night were busy as hell what i said separating my words keeping them clipped else oh shit he breathed his voice shaking look i wasnt with that guy didnt know anything about him i didnt tell him you were having an orgy out there honest jeezus mister i dont want any trouble victor sells seemed to have a real good idea of how to partyand of how to frighten teenagers one more question and ill let this go i told him who was it you saw tell me about him i dont know i dont know him didnt recognize him some guy with a camera thats all i went around the back of the house to try the back door got up on your deck and just saw inside i didnt keep on looking but he was up there all in black with this camera taking pictures he paused as someone pounded on the door he had closed earlier oh god i have to go mister i dont know you i dont know nothing and then there was a scrambling of feet and he hung up the phone i hung up the phone myself and ambled back to georges loaner i worked out the details i had just learned on the way back to my apartment someone else had called pizza spress evidently just before i had someone else had gone asking after the pizza boy who why victor sells of course tracing down people who might have information about him his possible presence in the lake house victor sells who had been having some sort of gettogether out there that night maybe hed been drunk or one of his guests had and ordered the pizzaand now victor was trying to cover his tracks which implied that victor knew someone was looking for him hell as far as i knew hed been in the house when id gone out there last night this made things a lot more interesting a missing man who doesnt want to be found could get dangerous if someone came snooping after him and a photographer someone lurking around outside of windows and taking pictures i rummaged in my duster pocket and felt the round plastic film canister that explained where the canister had come from at any rate but why would someone be out there at the house taking pictures of victor and his friends maybe because monica had hired someone else a pi without telling me maybe just a neighbor with the hots for taking dirty pictures no way to tell really more mysteries i pulled the studebaker into my drive and killed the engine i tallied the score for the evening enigmas lots harry zero my investigation for monica sells had netted me one husband throwing wild parties in his beach house after losing his job and working hard not to be found probably an advanced case of male menopause monica didnt seem to be the kind of woman who would take such a thing with good gracemore like the kind who would close her eyes and call me a liar if i told her the truth but at least it merited a little more looking intoi could log a few more hours in on the case maybe earn some more money out of it before i gave her the bill but i still didnt really know anything the angle with bianca had come to a dead end at linda randall all i had were more questions for miss randall and she was as closed as a bank on sunday i didnt have anything solid enough to hand to murphy to let her pursue the matter dammit i was going to have to do that research after all maybe it would turn up something helpful some kind of clue to help lead me and the police to the murderer and maybe dragons would fly out my butt but i had to try so i got out of the car to go inside and get to work he was waiting for me behind the trash cans that stood next to the stairs leading down to my front door the baseball bat he swung at me took me behind the ear and pitched me to the bottom of the stairs in a nearsenseless heap i could hear his footsteps but couldnt quite move as he came down the stairs toward me it figured it was just the kind of day i was having i felt his foot on the back of my neck felt him lift the baseball bat and then it came whistling down toward my skull with a mighty crack of impact except that it missed my motionless head and whacked into the concrete next to my face right by my eyes instead listen up dresden my attacker said his voice was rough low purposefully hoarse you got a big nose stop sticking it where it doesnt belong you got a big mouth stop talking to people you dont need to talk to or were going to shut that mouth of yours he waited a melodramatically appropriate moment and then added permanently his footsteps retreated up the stairs and vanished i just lay there watching the stars in front of my eyes for a while mister appeared from somewhere probably drawn by the groaning noises and started licking at my nose i eventually regained my mobility and sat up my head was spinning and i felt sick to my stomach mister rubbed up against me as though he sensed something was wrong purring in a low rumble i managed to stand up long enough to unlock my apartment door let mister and myself in and lock it behind me i staggered over to my easy chair in the darkness and sat down with a whuff of expelled breath i sat motionless until the spinning slowed down enough to allow me to open my eyes again and until the pounding of my head calmed down pounding head someone could have been pounding on my head with a baseball bat just then pounding my head into new and interesting shapes that were inconducive to carrying on businesslike pursuits someone could have been pounding harry dresden right into the hereafter i cut off that line of thought you are not some poor rabbit dresden i reminded myself sternly you are a wizard of the old school a spellslinger of the highest caliber youre not going to roll over for some schmuck with a baseball bat because he tells you to galvanized by the sound of my own voice or maybe only by the somewhat unsettling realization that i had begun talking to myself i stood up and built up the fire in the fireplace then walked unsteadily back and forth in front of it trying to think to work out the details had this evenings visits triggered the warning who had reason to threaten me what were they trying to keep me from finding and most importantly what was i going to do about it someone had seen me talking to linda randall maybe or more likely someone had seen me showing up at biancas place asking questions the blue beetle may not be glitzy but it is sort of difficult to mistake for anyone elses car who would have reason to have me watched why hadnt gentleman johnny marcone followed me so that he could have a word with me so he could ask me to keep out of this business with tommy tomms murder yes he had maybe this had been another reminder from the mob boss it had that kind of mafioso feel to it i staggered to my kitchenette and fixed myself a tisane tea for the headache then added in some aspirin herbal remedies are well and good but i dont like to take chances working on that same principle i got my smith wesson chiefs special out of its drawer took the cloth covering off of it and made sure it was loaded then i stuck the revolver in my jacket pocket wizardry aside its tough to beat a gun for discouraging men with baseball bats and i sure as hell wasnt going to roll over for the tigersouled johnny marcone let him push me around let him know that it was all right to walk all over me whenever he felt like it no way in hell or on earth either my head was throbbing and my hands were shaking but i went down the ladder to my workroomand started figuring out how to rip someones heart out of his chest from fifty miles away who says i never do anything fun on a friday night chapter eleven it took me the rest of the night and part of the morning but i worked out how i could murder someone in the same manner that tommy tomm and jennifer stanton had been killed after the fifth or sixth time id checked the figures i stared at my calculations it didnt make any sense it was impossible or maybe we were all underestimating just how dangerous this killer was i grabbed my duster and headed out without bothering to check my looks i dont keep any mirrors in my home too many things can use mirrors as windowsor doorsbut i was pretty sure i looked like a wreck the studebakers rearview mirror confirmed this my face was haggard with a shadow of a beard deep circles under bloodshot eyes and hair that looked as though it had been riding a speeding motorcycle through a cloud of greasy smoke smoothing your hair back with sweaty palms as a study habit will do that to you especially if you do it for twelve or fourteen hours straight it didnt matter murphy wanted this information and she needed to have it things were bad they were very very bad i made quick time down to the station knowing murphy would want to hear this from me facetoface the police station murphy worked in was one in an aged complex of buildings that housed the metro police department it was rundown sagging in places like an old soldier who nonetheless stood at attention and struggled to hold in his gut there was graffiti along one wall that the janitor wouldnt come to scrub off until monday morning i parked in the visitors parkingeasy to do on a saturday morningand headed up the steps and into the building the desk sergeant wasnt the usual mustached old warhorse who i had run into before but a greying matron with steely eyes who disapproved of me and my lifestyle in a single glance then made me wait while she called up murphy while i waited a pair of officers came in dragging a handcuffed man between them he wasnt resisting themjust the opposite in fact his head was down and he was moaning in an almost musical way he was on the thin side and i got the impression that he was young his denim jeans and jacket were battered unkempt as was his hair the officers dragged him past the desk and one of them said that dui we called in were going to take him up to holding until he can see straight the desk sergeant passed a clipboard over and one of the officers took it under his arm before the two of them dragged the young man up the stairs i waited rubbing at my tired eyes until the sergeant managed to get through to someone upstairs she gave a rather surprised hmph and then said all right lieutenant ill send him on up she waved a hand at me to go on past i could feel her eyes on me as i went by and i smoothed my palm selfconsciously over my head and jaw special investigations kept a little waiting area just within the door at the top of the staircase it consisted of four wooden chairs and a sagging old couch that would probably kill your back if you tried to sleep on it murphys office was at the end of a double row of cubicles murphy stood just inside her office with a phone pressed to her ear wearing a martyred expression she looked like a teenager having a fight with an outoftown boyfriend though shed tear my head off if she heard me saying any such thing i waved my hand and she nodded back at me she pointed at the waiting area then shut her office door i took a seat in one of the chairs and leaned my head back against a wall i had just closed my eyes when i heard a scream from behind me in the hallway there was a struggling sound and a few startled exclamations before the scream repeated itself closer this time i acted without thinkingi was too tired to think i rose and went into the hall towards the source of the sound to my left was the staircase and to my right the hallway stretched ahead of me a figure appeared the silhouette of a running man moving toward me with long strides it was the man who had hung so limply between the two officers humming a few minutes before he was the one screaming i heard a scrabbling sound and then the pair of officers i had seen downstairs a few moments before came around the corner neither of them was a young man anymore and they both ran with their bellies out puffing for breath holding their gun belts against their hips with one hand stop one of the officers shouted panting stop that man the hair on the back of my neck prickled the man running toward me kept on screaming high and terrified his voice a long and uninterrupted peal of something terror panic lust rage all rolled up into a ball and sent spewing out into the air through his vocal cords i had a quick impression of wide staring eyes a dirty face a denim jacket and old jeans as he came down the shadowy hallway his hands were behind his back presumably held there by cuffs he wasnt seeing the hall he was running through i dont know what he was looking at but i got the impression that i didnt want to know he came hurtling toward me and the stairs blind and dangerous to himself it wasnt any of my business but i couldnt let him break himself apart in a tumble down the stairs i threw myself toward him as hard as i could attempting to put my shoulder into his stomach and drive him backward in a footballstyle tackle there is a reason i got cut every year during high school i rammed into him but he just whuffed out a breath and spun to one side into a wall it was as though he hadnt seen me coming and had no realization that i was there he just kept staring blindly and screaming careening off the wall and continuing on his way toward the stairs i went down to the floor my head abruptly throbbing again where the unknown tough had rapped me with a baseball bat last night one good thing about being as tall as i ami have long arms i rolled back toward him and lashed out with one hand fingers clutching i caught his jeans at the cuff and gave his leg a solid sideways tug that did it he spun offbalance and went down to the tile floor the scream stopped as the fall took the wind from him he slid to the top of the stairs and stopped feebly struggling the officers pounded past me toward him one going to either side and then something strange happened the young man looked up at me and his eyes rounded and dilated until i thought they had turned into huge black coins dotted onto his bloodshot eyeballs his eyes rolled back into his head until he could hardly have been able to see and he started to shout in a clarion voice wizard he trumpeted wizard i see you i see you wizard i see the things that follow those who walk before and he who walks behind they come they come for you jesus christ on a crutch the shorter rounder officer said as they took the man by his arms and started dragging him back down the hall junkies thanks for the assist buddy i stared at the man stunned i caught the sleeve of the taller officer whats going on sir i asked him he stopped letting the prisoner hang between him and his partner the prisoners head was bowed forward and his eyes were still rolled back but he had his head turned toward me and was grinning a horrible toothy grin his forehead was wrinkled oddly almost as though he were somehow focusing on me through the bones of his browridges and the frontal lobes of his brain junkie the taller officer said one of those new threeeye punks caught him down by the lake in his car with nearly four grams of the stuff probably more in him he shook his head you okay fine fine i assured him threeeye that new drug the shorter officer snorted one thats supposed to make them see the spirit world that kind of crap the taller one nodded stuff hooks harder than crack thanks for the help didnt know you were a civilian though didnt expect anyone but police down here this time of day no problem i assured him im fine hey the stouter one said he squinted at me and shook his finger arent you the guy that psychic consultant carmichael told me about ill take the fifth i said to him with a grin that i didnt feel the two officers chuckled and turned back to their business quickly shouldering me aside as they dragged their prisoner away he whispered in a mad little voice all the way down the hall see you see you wizard see he who walks behind i returned to my chair in the waiting area at the end of the row of cubicles and sat down my head throbbing my stomach rolling uncomfortably he who walks behind i had never seen the junkie before never been close to him i hadnt sensed the subtle tension of power in the air around him that signified the presence of a magical practitioner so how the hell had he seen the shadow of he who walks behind flowing in my wake for reasons i dont have time to go into now i am marked indelibly with the remnants of the presence of a hunterspirit a sort of spectral hit man known as he who walks behind i had beaten long odds in surviving the enemy of mine who had called up he who walks behind and sent him after mebut even though the hunterspirit had never gotten to me the mark could still be seen upon me by those who knew how by using the third sight stretching out behind me like a long and horribly shaped shadow sort of a spiritual scar to remind me of the encounter but only a wizard had that kind of vision the ability to sense the auras and manifestations of magical phenomena and that junkie had been no wizard was it possible that i had been wrong in my initial assessment of threeeye could the drug genuinely grant to its users the visions of the third sight i shuddered at the thought the kind of things you see when you learn how to open your third eye could be blindingly beautiful bring tears to your eyesor they could be horrible things that made your worst nightmares seem ordinary and comforting visions of the past the future of the true natures of things psychic stains troubled shades spiritfolk of all description the shivering power of the nevernever in all its brilliant and subtle huesand all going straight into your brain unforgettable permanent wizards quickly learn how to control the third eye to keep it closed except in times of great need or else they go mad within a few weeks i shivered if the drug was real if it really did open the third eye in mortals instead of just inflicting ordinary hallucinations upon its users then it was far more dangerous than it seemed even with the deleterious effects demonstrated by the junkie i had tackled even if a user didnt go mad from seeing too many horrible or otherworldly things he might see through the illusions and disguises of any of a number of beings that passed among mankind regularly unseenwhich could compel such creatures to act in defense for fear of being revealed double jeopardy dresden murphy snapped wake up i blinked not asleep i slurred just resting my eyes she snorted save it harry and pushed a styrofoam cup into my hands shed made me coffee with a ton of sugar in it just the way i like and even though it was a little stale it smelled like heaven youre an angel i muttered i took a sip then nodded down the row of cubicles you want to hear this one in your office i could feel her eyes on me as i drank all right she said lets go and the coffees fifty cents harry i followed her to her office a hastily assembled thing with cheap plywood walls and a door that wasnt hung quite straight the door had a paper sign taped to it neatly lettered in black magic marker with lt karrin murphy there was a rectangle of lighter wood where a plaque had once held some other hapless policemans name that the office never bothered to put up a fresh plaque was a notsosubtle reminder of the precarious position of the special investigations director her office furniture the entire interior of the office in fact was a contrast with the outside her desk and chair were sleek dark and new her pc was always on and running on its own desk set immediately to her left a bulletin board covered most of one little wall and current cases were neatly organized on it her college diploma the aikido trophies and her marksmans awards were on the wall to ones immediate right as you entered the office and sitting there right next to your face if you were standing before her desk or sitting in the chair in front of it that was murphyorganized direct determined and just a little bit belligerent hold it murphy told me i stopped outside of her office as i always did while she went inside and turned off then unplugged her computer and the small radio on her desk murphy is used to the kind of mayhem that happens whenever i get around machinery after she was done i went on in i sat down and slurped more coffee she slid up onto the edge of her desk looking down at me her blue eyes narrowed she was dressed no less casually on a saturday than she was on a workdaydark slacks a dark blouse set off by her golden hair and bright silver necklace and earrings very stylish i in my rumpled sweats and tshirt black duster and mussed hair felt very slouchy all right harry she said what have you got for me i took one last drink of coffee stifled a yawn and put the cup down on her desk she slipped a coaster under it as i started speaking i was up all night working on it i said keeping my voice soft i had a hell of a time figuring out the spell and as near as i can figure it its almost impossible to do it to one person let alone two at once she glared at me dont tell me almost impossible ive got two corpses that say otherwise keep your shirt on i growled at her im just getting started youve got to understand the whole thing if youre going to understand any of it her glare intensified she put her hands on the edge of her desk and said in a deadly reasonable tone all right why dont you explain it to me i rubbed at my eyes again look whoever did this did it with a thaumaturgic spell that much im sure of he or she used some of tommy tomm and jennifer stantons hair or fingernails or something to create a link to them then they ripped out a symbolic heart from some kind of ritual doll or sacrificial animal and used a whale of an amount of energy to make the same thing happen to the victims this doesnt tell me anything new harry im getting there im getting there i said the amount of energy you need to do this is staggering it would be a lot easier to manage a small earthquake than to affect a living being like that bestcase scenario i might be able to do it without killing myself to one person who had really really pissed me off youre naming yourself as a suspect murphys mouth quirked at the corner i snorted i said i was strong enough to do it to one person i think it would kill me to try two youre saying that some sort of wizard version of arnold schwarzenegger pulled this off i shrugged its possible i suppose more likely someone whos just really good pulled it off raw power doesnt determine all that you can do with magic focus matters too the better your focus is the better you are at putting your power in one place at the same time the more you can get done sort of like when you see some ancient little chinese martialarts master shatter a tree trunk with his hands he couldnt lift a puppy over his head but he can focus what power he does have with incredible effect murphy glanced at her aikido trophies and nodded okay she said i can understand that i think so were looking for the wizard version of mister miyagi or i said lifting a finger more than one wizard worked on this at the same time pooled their power together and used it all at once my pounding head combined with the queasy stomach and the caffeine was making me a little woozy teamwork teamwork thats what counts multiple killers murphy drawled i dont have one and youre telling me there might be fifty thirteen i corrected her you can never use more than thirteen but i dont think thats very likely its a bitch to do everyone in the circle has to be committed to the spell have no doubts no reservations and they have to trust one another implicitly you dont see that kind of thing from your average gang of killers it just isnt something thats going to happen outside of some kind of fanaticism a cult or political organization a cult murphy said she rubbed at her eyes the arcane is going to have a field day with this one if it gets out so bianca is involved in this after all surely shes got enough enemies out there who could do this she could inspire that kind of effort to get rid of her i shook my head the pain was getting worse heavier but pieces were falling into place no youre thinking the wrong angle here the killer wasnt taking out the hooker and tommy tomm to get at bianca how do you know i went to see her i responded dammit harry i didnt react to her anger you know she wasnt going to talk to you murph shes an oldfashioned monster girl no cooperation with the authorities but she did talk to you murphy demanded i said pretty please i would beat you to crap if you didnt already look like it murphy said what did you find out bianca wasnt in on it she didnt have a clue who it could have been she was nervous scared i didnt mention that shed been scared enough to try to take me to pieces so someone was sending a messagebut not to bianca to johnny marcone i confirmed gang war in the streets murphy said and now the outfit is bringing sorcery into it as well mafioso magic spells jesus christ she drummed her heels on the edge of the desk gang war threeeye suppliers versus conventional narcotics right she stared at me for a minute yeah murphy said yeah it is how did you know weve been holding out details from the papers i just ran into this guy who was stoned out of his mind on threeeye something he said makes me think that stuff isnt a bunch of crap its for real and you would have to be one very very badass wizard to manufacture a large quantity of this kind of drug murphys blue eyes glittered so whoever is the one supplying the streets with threeeye is the one who murdered jennifer stanton and tommy tomm im pretty sure of it it feels right id tend to agree murphy said nodding all right then how many people do you know of who could manage the killing spell christ murphy i said you cant ask me to just hand you a list of names of people to drag downtown for questioning she leaned down closer to me blue eyes fierce wrong harry i can ask you i can tell you to give them to me and if you dont i can haul you in for obstruction and complicity so quick it will make your head spin my heads already spinning i told her a little giggle slipped out throbbing head pound pound pound you wouldnt do that murph i know you you know damned well that if i had anything you could use i would give it to you if youd just let me in on the investigation give me the chance to no harry she said her voice flat not a chance i am ass deep in alligators already without you getting difficult on me youre already hurt and dont ask me to buy some line about falling down the stairs i dont want to have to scrape you off the concrete whoever did tommy tomm is going to get nasty when someone comes poking around and it isnt your job to do it its mine suit yourself i told her youre the one with the deadline her face went pale and her eyes blazed youre such an incredible shit harry i started to answer her i really didbut my skull got loose and shaky on my neck and things spun around and my chair sort of wobbled up onto its back legs and whirled about precariously i thought it was probably safest to slide my way along to the floor rubbery as a snake the tiles were nice and cool underneath my cheek and felt sort of comforting my head went boom boom boom the whole time i was down there spoiling what would have otherwise been a pleasant little nap chapter twelve i woke up on the floor of murphys office the clock on the wall said that it was about twenty minutes later something soft was underneath my head and my feet were propped up with several phone books murphy was pressing a cool cloth against my forehead and throat i felt terrible exhausted achy nauseous my head throbbing i wanted to do nothing so much as curl up and whimper myself to sleep given that i would never live that down i made a wisecrack instead do you have a little white dress ive had this deepseated nurse fantasy about you murphy a pervert like you would who hit your head she demanded no one i mumbled fell down the stairs to my apartment bullshit harry she said her voice hard her hands were no less gentle with the cool cloth though youve been running around on this case thats where you got the bump on the head isnt it i started to protest oh save it she said letting out a breath if you didnt already have a concussion id tie your heels to my car and drive through traffic she held up two fingers how many fingers am i holding up fifty i said and held up two of my own its not a concussion just a little bump on the head ill be fine i started to sit up i needed to get home get some sleep murphy put her hand on my neck and pressed me back down on the pillow beneath my head which was apparently her jacket because she wasnt wearing it stay down she growled how did you get here not in that heap of a car i hope the beetle is doing its phoenix impression i told her ive got a loaner look ill be fine just let me out of here and ill go home and get some sleep you arent in any shape to drive murphy said youre a menace id have to arrest myself if i let you behind a wheel in your condition murph i said annoyed unless you can pay up what you owe me already right now i cant exactly afford a cab dream on harry murphy said and save your breath ill give you a ride home i dont need a i began but she got up from her knees and stalked out of her office foolishness i thought stupidity i was perfectly capable of moving myself around so i sat up and heaved myself to my feet or tried to i actually managed to half sit up and then i just heaved murphy came back in to find me curled on my side her office stinking from where id thrown up she didnt for a change say anything she just knelt by me again cleaned off my mouth and put another cool cloth over the back of my neck i remember her helping me out to her car i remember little pieces of the drive back to my apartment i remember giving her the keys to the loaner and mumbling something about mike and the towtruck driver but mostly i remember the way her hand felt on minecold with a little bit of nervousness to the soft fingers small beneath my great gawking digits and strong she scolded and threatened me the entire way back to the apartment i think but i remember the way she made sure she held my hand as though to assure herself that i was still there or to assure me that she was that she wasnt going anywhere theres a reason ill go out on a limb to help murphy shes good people one of the best we got back to my apartment sometime before noon murphy helped me down the stairs and unlocked the door for me mister came running up and hurled himself against her legs in greeting maybe being short gives her better leverage or something since she didnt really wobble when mister rammed her like i do or maybe its the aikido christ harry she muttered this place is dark she tried the light switch but the bulbs had burnt out last week and i hadnt had the cash to replace them so she sat me down on the couch and lit some candles off of the glowing coals in the fireplace all right she said im putting you in bed well if you insist the phone rang it was in arms reach so i picked it up dresden i mumbled mister dresden this is linda linda randall do you remember me heh do men remember the scene in the movie with marilyn standing over the subway grating i found myself remembering linda randalls eyes and wondering things a gentleman shouldnt are you naked i said it took me a minute to register what id said whoops murphy gave me an arch look she stood up and walked into my bedroom and busied herself straightening the covers and giving me a modicum of privacy i felt cheered my slip had thrown murphy off better than any lie i could have managed maybe a woozy harry was not necessarily a bad harry linda purred laughter into the phone im in the car right now honey maybe later look ive come up with a few things that might help you can you meet me tonight i rubbed at my eyes it was saturday tonight was saturday night wasnt there something i was supposed to do tonight to hell with it i thought it couldnt have been all that important if i couldnt even remember it sure i told her fine she mmmmed into the phone youre such a gentleman i like that once in a while i get off at seven all right do you want to meet me say at eight my car exploded i said my tongue felt fuzzy i can meet you at the eleven down the street from my apartment she poured that rich creamy laughter into my ear again tell you what give me an extra hour or so to go home get a nice hot bath make myself all pretty and then ill be there in your arms sound good to you well okay she laughed again and didnt say goodbye before disconnecting murphy appeared again as soon as i hung up the phone tell me you didnt just make a date dresden youre just jealous murphy snorted please i need more of a man than you to keep me happy she started to get an arm beneath me to help me up youd break like a dry stick dresden youd better get to bed before you get any more delusions i put a hand against her shoulder to push her back i didnt have that kind of strength but she backed off frowning what something i said i rubbed at my eyes something was bothering me i was forgetting something i was sure of it something i said i would do on saturday i struggled to push thoughts of drug wars and people driven mad by the third sight visions given them by the threeeye drug and tried to concentrate it didnt take long to click monica i had told her i would get in contact with her i patted at my duster pockets until i found my notepad and took it out fumbled it open and waved at murphy candle need to read something christ dresden i swear youre at least as bad as my first husband he was stubborn enough to kill himself too she sighed and brought a candle over the light hurt my eyes for a moment i made out monicas number and i dialed her up hello a male childs voice asked hi i said i need to speak to monica please whos this i remembered i was working for her on the sly and answered her fourth cousin harry from vermont kay the kid said hold on then he screamed without lowering the mouthpiece of the phone from his lips mom your cousin harry from vermont is on the phone longdistance kids you gotta love them i adore children a little salt a squeeze of lemonperfect i waited for the pounding in my head to resolve into mere agony as the kid dropped the phone and ran off feet thumping on a hardwood floor a moment later there was the rattle of the phone being picked up and monicas quiet somewhat nervous voice said um hello its harry dresden i told her i just wanted to call to let you know what id been able to find out for y im sorry she interrupted me i dont um need any of those i blinked uh monica sells i read her the phone number yes yes she said her voice hurried impatient we dont need any help thank you is this a bad time no no its not that i just wanted to cancel my order discontinue the service dont worry about me there was an odd quality to her voice as though she were forcing a housewifes good cheer into it cancel you dont want me looking for your husband anymore but maam the money the phone began to buzz and static made the line fuzzy i thought i heard a voice in the background somewhere and then the sound went dead except for the static for a moment i thought id lost the connection entirely blasted unreliable phones usually they messed up on my end not on the receiving end you cant even trust them to foul up dependably hello hello i said cross and grumpy monicas voice returned dont worry about that thank you so much for all of your help good day byebye thank you then she hung up on me i took the phone away from my ear and stared at it bizarre i said come on harry murphy said she took the phone from my hand and planted it firmly in its cradle aww mom its not even dark yet i made the lame joke to try to think about something besides how terribly my head was going to hurt when murphy helped me up she did it did we hobbled into the bedroom and when i stretched out on the cool sheets i was reasonably certain i was going to set down roots murphy took my temperature and felt my scalp with her fingers careful around the goose egg on the back of my skull she shined a penlight into my eyes which i did not like she also got me a drink of water which i did like and had me swallow a couple of aspirin or tylenol or something i only remember two more things about that morning one was murphy stripping me out of my shirt boots and socks and leaning down to kiss my forehead and ruffle my hair then she covered me up with blankets and put out the lights mister crawled up and lay down across my legs purring like a small diesel engine comforting the second thing i remember was the phone ringing again murphy was just about to leave her car keys rattling in her hand i heard her turn back to pick up the phone and say harry dresdens residence there was a silence hello murphy said after another pause murphy appeared in the doorway a small shadow looking down at me wrong number get some rest harry thanks karrin i smiled at her or tried to it must have looked ghastly she smiled back and im sure hers was nicer than mine she left then the apartment got dark and quiet mister continued to rumble soothingly in the dark it kept nagging at me even as i fell asleep what had i forgotten and another less sensible questionwho had been on the line who hadnt wanted to speak to murphy had monica sells tried to call me back why would she call me off the case and tell me to keep the money i pondered that and baseball bats and other matters until misters purring put me to sleep chapter thirteen i woke up when thunder rattled the old house above me true dark had fallen i had no idea of what time it was i lay in bed for a moment confused and a little dizzy there was a warm spot on my legs where mister must have been until a few moments before but the big grey cat was nowhere to be seen he was a chicken about thunderstorms rain was coming down in sheets i could hear it on the concrete outside and on the old building above me it creaked and swayed in the spring thunderstorm and the wind timbers gently flexing wise enough with age to give a little rather than put up stubborn resistance until they broke i could probably stand to learn something from that my stomach was growling i got out of bed wobbled a little and rooted about for my robe i couldnt find it in the dark but came across my duster where murphy had left it on a chair neatly folded laying on top of it was a scattering of cash along with a napkin bearing the words you will pay me back murphy i scowled at the money and tried to ignore the flash of gratitude i felt i picked up my duster and tugged it on over my bare chest then i padded on naked feet out into the living room thunder rumbled again growling outside i could feel the storm in a way that a lot of people cant and that most of those who can put down to nerves it was raw energy up there naked and pulsing through the clouds i could feel the water in the rain and clouds the moving air blowing the droplets in gusts against the walls of the house above i could sense waiting the fire of the deadly lightning leaping from cloud to cloud above and seeking a path of least resistance to the patient timeless earth that bore the brunt of the storms attack all four elements interacting moving energy flashing from place to place in each of its forms there was a lot of potential in storms that a sorcerer could tap into if he was desperate or stupid enough a lot of energy to be used up there where the forces of ancient nature brawled and tumbled i frowned thinking about that it hadnt occurred to me before had there been a storm on wednesday night yes there had i remember thunder waking me for a few moments in the hours before dawn could our killer have tapped into it to fuel his spells possibly it bore looking into such tapped magic was often too unstable or volatile to use in such a carefully directed fashion lightning flashed again and i counted three or four seconds before the rumble reached me if the killer was using the storms it would make sense that if he or she were to strike again it would happen tonight i shivered my stomach growled and more mundane matters took my attention my head was feeling somewhat better i wasnt dizzy anymore my stomach was furious with melike a lot of tall skinny men i eat endlessly but it never stays on i have no idea why i shambled into the kitchen and started building up the grill mister i called you hungry bud im gonna fry up some burgers mmm mmm mmm lightning flashed again closer this time the thunder following right on its heels the flash was bright enough to sear through my halfsunken windows and make me wince against it but in the flash of light i caught sight of mister the cat was up on the top of my bookshelf in the far corner of the apartmentas far as it was possible to get away from my front door he was watching it his eyes luminous in the half dark and though he had the catlazy look of any lounging feline his ears were tilted forward and his gaze focused unwaveringly upon the door if hed had a tail it would have been twitching there came a knocking a rapping at my chamber door maybe it was the storm making me nervous but i quested out with my senses feeling for any threat that might have been there the storm made a mess of things and all of that noise both physical and spiritual kept me from being able to tell anything more than that there was someone outside my door i felt in the pocket of my duster for the gunbut i remembered that i had set it aside in the lab last night and not taken it with me down to the police station police dont take kindly to anyone but police toting firearms inside the station dont ask me why in any case it was out of easy reach now and then i remembered that linda randall was supposed to be showing up i berated myself for getting spooked so easily and then again for sleeping so long and then again for looking and smelling like i hadnt showered in a couple of days or combed my hair or shaved or anything else that might have made me marginally less unappealing ah well i got the impression that with linda that sort of thing didnt seem to matter too much maybe she was into eau des hommes i walked over to the door and opened it smoothing back my hair with one hand and trying to keep a sheepish grin off of my face susan rodriguez waited outside in the rain her black umbrella held above her she wore a khaki trench coat and an expensive black dress beneath it with heels pearls shone at her throat and ears she blinked at me when i appeared in the door harry i stared at her oh my gosh i had forgotten my date with susan how in the world could i have forgotten that i mean the white council the police vampires concussions junkies mob bosses and baseballbatswinging thugs notwithstanding well no there probably werent any women incredible enough to make me keep my mind on them through all of that but all the same it seemed a little rude of me hi susan i said lamely i peered past her when had susan said she was going to show up nine and when had linda said eightno wait shed said eight oclock at first and then said shed be by in another hour after that at nine hooboy this was not going to be pretty susan read me like a book and glanced back behind her in the rain before looking back up at me expecting someone harry not exactly i told her uh well maybe look come on in youre getting drenched which wasnt exactly true i was getting drenched my bare feet soaked standing there in the open door the wind blowing rain down the stairway at me susans mouth quirked in a malicious predatory little smile and she came in folding down her umbrella and brushing past me this is your apartment nah i told her this is my summer home in zurich she eyed me as i closed the door took her coat and hung it up on a tall old wooden hat stand near the doorway susan turned away from me as i hung up her coat her dress showed her back the long curve of her spine all the way down to her waist it had a fairly tame hemline and long tight sleeves i liked it a lot she let me see her back for a while as she walked away from me toward the fireplace then slowly turned to face me smirking leaning one smooth hip on the couch her midnight hair was bound up on top of her head displaying a long and slender neck her skin an advertisement for something smooth and wonderful her lips quirked up at the corners and she narrowed her dark flashing eyes at me the police having you put in overtime harry she drawled the killings must be sensational major crime figure murdered with magic care to make a statement i winced she was still hunting for an angle for the arcane sure i told her her eyes widened in surprise i need a shower i said ill be right back mister keep an eye on the lady eh susan gave me a little roll of her eyes then glanced up and studied mister on his perch on the bookcase mister for his part flicked an ear and continued staring at the door more thunder rumbled overhead i lit a few candles for her then took one with me into the bathroom think harry get awake and get your head clear what to do get clean i told myself you smell like a horse get some cool water over your head and work this out linda randall is going to be here in a minute and you need to figure out how to keep susan from prying her nose into the murders so advised i agreed with myself and hurriedly got undressed and into the shower i dont use a water heater and consequently i am more than used to cold showers actually given how often i and wizards in general get to date actual real women maybe thats just as well i was just lathering up with shampoo when the lightning got a lot worse the thunder a lot louder the rain a lot harder the height of the storm had hit the old house and hit it hard it was almost possible to see clearly in the violent electrical discharge almost impossible to hear over the thunder but i caught a flicker of motion out of the corner of my eye a shadow that moved across the sunken window covered by modest curtains in the bathroom someone was moving toward the stairs down to my apartment did i mention how i havent had a ton of success with women nights like this are one reason why i panicked hard i leapt out of the shower my head all asudsy wrapped a towel around my waist and headed out into the front room i couldnt let linda just come to the door and have susan answer it that would be the cattiest thing youve ever seen and i would be the one to get all the scratches and bites too i rounded the corner from my bedroom into the main room and saw susan reaching for the doorknob lightning flashed again and thunder kept me from hearing the knobs clickclack i heard something else though a snarling spitting sound and saw mister on his feet now his back arched up and all his fur fluffed out teeth bared his nolongersleepy eyes fastened on the door the thunder passed as susan swung the door open i could see her face in profile one hand was on her hip and there was an amused dangerous little smile on her pretty mouth as the door opened i felt it the cloud of energies that accompanies a spiritbeing when it comes into the mortal world disguised until now by the background clutter of the storm a figure stood in the doorway rather squat less than five feet tall dressed in a plain brown trench coat illuminated by blue lightning overhead there was something wrong to the shape something that just wasnt a part of good old mother earth its head turned to look at me and sudden twin points of fire as blue as the lightning dancing above flared up illuminating the leathery inhuman curves of a face that most closely resembled that of a large and warty toad susan got a good look at the demons eyes and face from two feet away and screamed susan i shouted already moving toward the couch get out of the way i threw myself to the floor behind the couch landed with a whumph of hard floor hitting my ribs the demons jaws parted in a silent hiss and its throat constricted weirdly as i vanished behind the couch there was a hissing sound and a heartsized section of the couch just dissolved in a cloud of mist and foul stench droplets of liquid spattered through onto the floor near me and where they touched little holes corroded outward in the space of two seconds i rolled away from the couch and the demons acid susan i shouted get back toward the kitchen dont get between it and me what is it she screamed back at me a bad guy i poked my head up and peered through the smoking hole in the couch ready to duck back down at a moments notice the demon squat and bulkier than a human was standing in the doorway both longfingered padtipped hands leaning forward toward the inside of the house it paused as though resting against a light screen why isnt it coming in susan asked from the far corner near the door her back was pressed to the wall and her eyes were wide and terrified my god i thought just dont pass out on me susan homestead laws i said it isnt a mortal creature it has to gather its energy to push through the barrier around a home can it get in she said her voice was thin reedy she was asking questions gathering information data falling back on her ingrained career instinctsbecause i suspected her rational brain had shortcircuited that happens to people who get a good hard look at a demon for the first time i hurried over to her and grabbed her arm dragging her back toward the door leading down to my lab get down there i shouted jerking the door up and revealing the folding ladderstaircase its dark susan protested oh god she blinked down at my waist harry why are you naked i looked down and blushed the towel must have fallen off while i was dancing around looking down made the shampoo suds still in my hair runnel down into my eyes making them sting and burn could this evening get any worse there was a tearing sound from the doorway and the toaddemon sort of surged forward a stumbling step it was now in my house lightning still danced in the sky behind it and i could only see it in ugly hunchbacked outline except for the electric light of its wide round googly eyes as it came toward me its throat was working in little undulating motions crap i said im quite eloquent in times of crisis i shoved susan toward the stairs and turned toward the demon tips of my thumbs touching fingers spread palms out toward it the demons mouth opened again and it made a slick spittooning sound vento riflittum i shouted willing my fear and anxiety into a tangible shape throwing it down from my pounding heart through my shoulders and arms directed at the foe the globule of demonacid sped toward my face my terror and adrenaline roared out of my fingertips in the form of wind gathering up speed enough to tear the hair from a mans head it caught the blob of acid and flung it back at the demon in a fine spray stopped the thing dead in its tracks and even drove it back several feet its clawtipped feet sliding on my smooth floor catching on the rugs the acid sizzled and spat little electric blue sparks on its skin but it didnt seem to harm the demon it did however dissolve the trench coat to shreds in less time than it takes to draw a breath and wreaked havoc on my rugs and furniture the demon shook its head gathering its wits i turned to the far corner near the door and extended my hand trumpeting vento servitas the pale smooth wood of my wizards staff all but glowed in the darkness as it flew toward me driven by a gentler finer blast of the same wind i caught it in my hand and spun it toward the demon calling on the lines of power and force deep within the long unbroken grains of wood in the staff i extended the staff toward it horizontally like a bar and shouted out out out you are not welcome here a touch dramatic in any other circumstance maybebut when youve got a demon in your living room nothing seems too extreme the toaddemon hunched its shoulders planted its broad feet and grunted as a wave of unseen force swept out from my staff like a broom whisking along the floor i could feel the demon resist me pressing against the strength of the staff as though i were leaning the wood against a vertical steel bar and attempting to snap it across that length we strained silently for several seconds until i realized that this thing was just too strong for me i wasnt going to be able to brush it off like a minor imp or a niggling poltergeist it wouldnt take me long to exhaust myself and once the demon could move again it was either going to dissolve me with its acid or else just waddle up to me and rip me into pieces it would be stronger than a mortal a hell of a lot faster and it was not going to stop until i was dead or the sun had come up or one of any of a number of other unlikely conditions were met susan i shouted my chest heaving are you down there yes she said is it gone not exactly no i felt my palms get sweaty the smooth wood of the staff begin to slip the burning of the soap suds in my eyes increased and the lights of the demons eyes brightened why dont you set it on fire shoot it blow it up her voice had a searching quality to it as though she were looking around down there in the lab i cant i said to her i cant pump enough juice into it to hurt the thing without blowing us up along with it youve got to get out of there my mind was racing along calculating possibilities numbers my reserves of energy cold and rational the thing was here for me if i drew it off to one side into my bedroom and bathroom susan might be able to escape on the other hand it might be under orders to kill me and any witnesses in which case after it had finished me it would simply go after her as well there had to be another way to get her out of here and then i remembered it susan i shouted theres a sports bottle on my table down there drink whats in it and think about being away from here okay think about being far away i found it she called up a second later it smells bad dammit its a potion itll get you out of here drink it there was a gagging noise and then a moment later she said now what i blinked and looked at the stairs going down it should have work i broke off as the toad thing leaned forward reached out a clawed foot and in that stride gained three feet of ground toward me i was able to stop it again barely but i knew that it was going to be coming for my throat in a few more seconds nothing happened she said dammit harry we have to do something and then she came pounding up the ladder dark eyes flashing my revolver in her hand no i told her dont i felt the staff slip more the demon was getting ready to come through all my defenses susan raised the gun face pale her hands shaking and started shooting a chiefs special carries six rounds and i use a mediumspeed load rather than armorpiercing or explosive bullets or anything fancy like that fewer chances that something will go wrong in the presence of a lot of magic a gun is a pretty simple machine a revolver approaches very simple wheels gears and a simple lever impact to ignite the powder its tough for magic to argue with physics most of the time the revolver roared six times the first two shots must have gone wide and hit somewhere else the next two struck the demons hide and made deep dents in it before springing off and rebounding wildly around the room as i had feared they would more of a threat to us than to it fortunately neither of us was injured or killed by the ricochets the fifth shot went between its long oddly shaped legs and past it the sixth hit the thing square between its lightninglantern eyes knocked it offbalance and sent it tumbling over with a toady hiss of frustration i gasped and grabbed at susans wrist basement i wheezed as she dropped the gun we both scrambled down the ladder i didnt bother to shut it behind me the thing could just tear its way through the floor if it needed to this way i would at least know where it would come down rather than have it tunnel through the floor and come out on top of my head at my will the tip of the staff i still held burst into light illuminating the room harry bobs voice came from the shelf the skulls eyelights came on and he swiveled around to face me what the hell is going on woo woo who is the babe susan jumped what is that ignore him i said and followed my own advice i went to the far end of my lab table and started kicking boxes bags notebooks and old paperbacks off the floor help me clear this floor space hurry she did and i cursed the lack of cleaning skills that had left this end of the lab such a mess i was struggling to get to the circle i had laid in the floor a perfect ring of copper an unbroken loop in the concrete that could be empowered to hold a demon inor out harry bob gulped as we worked theres a um a seriously badass toaddemon coming down the ladder i know that bob i heaved a bunch of empty cardboard boxes aside as susan frantically tossed some papers away exposing the entirety of the copper ring about three feet across i took her hand and stepped into the circle drawing her close to me whats happening susan asked her expression bewildered and terrified just stay close i told her she clung tightly to me it sees you harry bob reported its going to spit something at you i think i didnt have time to see if bob was right i leaned down touched the circle with the tip of my staff and willed power into it to shut the creature out the circle sprang up around us a silent and invisible tension in the air something splattered and hissed against the air a few inches from my face i looked up to see dark sputtering acid slithering off the invisible shield the circles power provided us half a second earlier and it would have eaten my face off cheery thought i tried to catch my breath stand straight and not let any part of me extend outside the circle which would break its circuit and negate its power my arms were shaking and my legs felt weak susan too was visibly trembling the demon stalked over to us i could see it clearly in the light of my staff and i wished that i couldnt it was horribly ugly misshapen foul heavily muscled and i compared it to a toad only because i knew of nothing else that even remotely approached a description of it it glared at us and drove a fist at the circles shield it rebounded in a shower of blue sparks and the thing hissed a horrible and windy sound outside the storm continued to rumble and growl muffled by the thick walls of the subbasement susan was holding close to me and almost crying why isnt it killing us why isnt it getting us it cant i said gently it cant get through and it cant do anything to break the circle so long as neither of us crosses that line well be safe oh god susan said how long do we have to stand here dawn i said until dawn when the sun rises it has to go theres no sun down here she said doesnt work that way its got a sort of power cord stretching back to whoever summoned it a fuel line as soon as the sun comes up that line gets cut and he goes away like a balloon with no air when does the sun come up she asked oh well about ten more hours oh she said she laid her head against my bare chest and closed her eyes the toaddemon paced in a slow circuit around the circle searching for a weakness in the shield it would find none i closed my eyes and tried to think uh harry bob began not now bob but harry bob tried again dammit bob im trying to think if you want to be really useful you could try to figure out why that escape potion you were so confident of didnt work for susan harry bob protested thats what im trying to tell you susan murmured against my chest is it getting warm in here or is it just me a terrible suspicion struck me i looked down at susan and got a sinking feeling surely not no it couldnt be she looked up at me her dark eyes smoky were going to die arent we harry have you ever thought youd want to die making love she kissed my chest almost absently it felt nice really really nice i tried not to notice all the bare lovely back that was naked underneath my hand ive thought that many times she said against my skin bob i began my voice getting furious i tried to tell you bob wailed i did she grabbed the wrong potion and just chugged it down bobs skull turned toward me a bit and the lights brightened youve got to admit though the love potion works great susan was kissing my chest and rubbing her body up against me in a fashion that was unladylike and extremely pleasant and distracting bob i swear i am going to lock you in a wall safe for the next two hundred years its not my fault bob protested the demon watched what was happening in the circle with froggy eyes and kicked a section of floor clear enough of debris for it to squat down on its haunches and stare restless and ready as a cat waiting for a mouse to stick its head out of its hole susan stared up at me with sultry eyes and tried to wrench me to the floor and consequently out of the circles protective power bob continued to wail his innocence who says i dont know how to show a lady a good time chapter fourteen susan tugged at my neck and jerked my head down to hers for a kiss as kisses went well it was um extremely interesting perfectly passionate abandoned not a trace of selfconsciousness or hesitation to it or at any rate not from her i came up for air a minute later my lips itching with the intensity of it and she stared up at me with burning eyes take me harry i need you uh susan thats not really a good idea right now i said the potion had taken hold of her hard no wonder she had recovered from her terror enough to come back up the stairs and fire my gun at the demon it had lowered her inhibitions to a sufficient degree that it must also have dulled her fears susans fingers wandered and her eyes sparkled your mouth says no she purred but this says yes i went up on my toes and swallowed trying to keep my balance and get her hand off me at the same time that thing is always saying something stupid i told her she was beyond reason the potion had kicked her libido into suicidal overdrive bob help me out here im stuck in the skull bob said if you dont let me out i cant do much of anything harry susan stood up on tiptoe to gnaw at my ear wrapped her shapely thigh around one of mine and started whimpering and pulling me toward the floor my balance wavered a threefoot circle was not enough to perform wrestling or gymnastics or anything else in without leaving something sticking out for the waiting demon to chew on is the other potion still there i asked sure bob said i can see it where it fell on the floor could throw it to you too okay i said growing excitedwell more excited i might yet get out of this basement alive im going to let you out for five minutes i want you to help me by throwing me the potion no boss bob said his voice maddeningly cheerful no no i get a twentyfourhour leave or nothing dammit bob im responsible for what you do if i let you out you know that susan whispered into my ear im not wearing any underwear and tried something approximating a prowrestling takedown to drop me to the floor i wavered in balance and barely managed to stave her off the demons frogeyes narrowed and it came to its feet ready to leap on us bob i yelled you slimy jerk you try living in a bony old skull for a few hundred years harry youd want to get a night off once in a while too fine i shouted my heart leaping into my throat as my balance wavered again fine just make sure you get me the potion you have twentyfour hours just make sure you catch it bob replied and then a flood of orangish light flowed out of both of the skulls eye sockets and into the room the lights swooped down in an elongated cloud over the potion bottle that lay on the floor at the far side of the lab gathered it up and hurled it through the air toward me i reached up with my spare hand and caught it bobbled it for a minute and then secured it again the orange lights that were bobs spiritform danced a little jig then whizzed up the ladder and out of the lab vanishing whats that susan murmured eyes dazed another drink i said drink this with me i think i can cover us both in the focus department get us out of here harry she said im not thirsty her eyes smoldered im hungry i hit upon an idea once we drink this ill be ready and we can go to bed she looked up at me hazily and smiled wicked and delighted oh harry bottoms up her hands made a sort of silent commentary on her words and i jumped almost dropping the bottle more shampoo from my hair trailed down my already burning eyes and i squeezed them closed i slugged away about half the potion trying to ignore the flatcola taste and quickly passed the rest to susan she smiled lazily and drank it down licking her lips it started in my gutsa sort of fluttery wobbly feeling that moved out up through my lungs and out along my shoulders down my arms it also went down over my hips and into my legs i began to shake and quiver uncontrollably and then i just flew apart into a cloud of a million billion tiny pieces of harry each one with its own perspective and view the room wasnt just a square cluttered basement to me but a pattern of energies grouped into specific shapes and uses even the demon was only a cloud of particles slow and dense i flowed around that cloud up through the opening in the ceiling pattern and outside of the apartment and into the raging nonpattern of the storm it took maybe five seconds and then the power of the potion faded i felt all the little pieces of me abruptly rush back together and slam into one another at unthinkable speed it hurt and made me nauseous a sort of heavyduty thump of impact that didnt come from any one direction but from every direction at once i staggered planted my staff on the ground and felt the rain wash down over me susan appeared next to me a heartbeat later and promptly sat down on her butt on the ground in the rain oh god i feel terrible inside the apartment the demon screamed a raging voiceless hiss i could hear it madly rampaging around inside come on i told her weve got to get out of here before it gets smart and starts looking outside for us im sick she said im not sure i can walk the mixed potions i said they can do that to you but we have to go now come on susan up and at em i bent down and got her up on her feet and moving away from my apartment where are we going she asked do you have your car keys she patted the dress as if looking for pockets and then shook her head dazedly they were in my coat pocket we walk then walk where over to reading road it always floods when theres this much rain itll be enough water to ground that thing if it tries to follow us it was only a couple of blocks away the cold rain came down in buckets i was shaking shivering and naked and more soap was getting into my eyes but hey at least i was clean wha she mumbled what will the rain do to it not rain running water it kills him if he tries to go over it after us i explained to her patiently i hoped the potions mixing together in her stomach hadnt done anything irreversible there had been accidents before we were moving at good speed all things considered and had covered maybe forty yards in the pouring rain not much farther to go oh oh thats good she said and then she convulsed and pitched to the ground i tried to hold her but i was just too tired my arms too weak i nearly went down with her she rolled to her side and lay that way retching horribly vomiting herself empty thunder and lightning raged around us again and i heard the sharp crack of the storms power touching a tree nearby i saw a bright flash of contact and then the subdued glow of burning branches i looked in the direction we had been heading the flooding reading road safety from the demon was still thirty yards away i didnt think youd last this long someone said i almost jumped out of my skin i picked my staff up in both hands and turned in a slow circle searching for the source of the voice whos there there to one side a spot of coldnot physical cold but something deeper and darker that my other senses detected a pooling of shadows an illusion in the darkness between lights gone when lightning flashed and back again when it had passed do you expect me to give you my name the shadows scorned suffice to say that i am the one who has killed you youre an underachiever i shot back still turning eyes searching the jobs not done in the darkness underneath a broken streetlight then maybe twenty feet away i could make out the shape of a person man or woman i couldnt tell nor could i distinguish from the voice soon the shape said you cant last much longer my demon will finish you before another ten minutes have passed the voice was supremely confident you called that demon here indeed the shadowy shape confirmed are you crazy i demanded stunned dont you know what could happen to you if that thing gets loose it wont the shape assured me it is mine to control i extended my senses toward the shape and found that what i had suspected was true it wasnt a real person or an illusion masking a real person it was only the seeming of one a phantasm of shape and sound a hologram that could see and hear and speak for its creator wherever he or she was what are you doing it demanded it must have sensed me feeling it out checking your credentials i said and sent some of my remaining will toward it the sorcerous equivalent of a slap in the face the image cried out in surprise and reeled back how did you do that it snarled i went to school the hologram growled then raised up its voice calling out in rolling syllables i tried to hear what had been said but another peal of thunder blocked out the middle half of what was undoubtedly the demons name from within my apartment the distant faint sound of the demons smashing ruckus came to an abrupt halt now the image said a sneer to its voice now you will pay why are you doing this i demanded youre in my way let the woman go sorry the image said shes seen too much shes in the way too now my demon will kill you both you bastard i snarled it laughed at me i looked over my shoulder back toward the apartment through the rain i heard a dry and raspy hiss underlaid with a sort of clicking growl blue frogeyes reflecting the storms lightning came up the stairs from my basement apartment it focused on me immediately and started forward the back fender of susans car which she had parked outside my apartment got in its way and with the padtipped fingers of one skinny softlooking hand it picked up the back end of the car and tossed it to one side where it landed with a heavy crunch i tried not to think about those fingers around my throat you see the image said mine to call time for you to die mr dresden another flash of lightning showed the demon falling to all fours and scrambling toward me like an overweight lizard scuttling across hot sand to shade in an exaggerated wagging motion that looked ridiculous but brought it closer and closer at deceptive speed deposit another quarter to continue your call asshole i said i thrust my staff toward the shadowy image this time focusing my will into a fullfledged attack stregallum finitas scarlet light abruptly flooded over it devouring its edges and moving inward the image snarled then gasped in pain dresden my demon will roll in your bones and then it broke off into a scream of anguish as my counterspell began to tear the imagesending apart i was better than whoever had made the image and they couldnt hold the spell in the face of my counter the image and the scream alike faded slowly into the distance until both were gone i allowed myself the smallest touch of satisfaction and then turned to the woman on the ground susan i said crouching by her keeping my eyes on the onrushing demon susan get up we have to go i cant she sobbed oh god and she threw up some more she tried to rise but collapsed back to the ground moaning piteously i looked back at the water gauging the things speed it was coming fast but not quite as fast as a man could run i could still escape it if i ran full out i could get across the water i could be safe but i couldnt carry susan there id never make it with her slowing me down but if i didnt go both of us would die wouldnt it be better for one of us at least to live i looked back at the demon i was exhausted and it had caught me unprepared the heavy rain would keep fire mans ancient weapon against the darkness and the things it hid from being effective in holding it back and i didnt have enough left in me to do anything else it would be as good as suicide to stand against it susan sobbed on the ground helpless in the rain sick from my potions unable to rise i leaned my head back and let the rain wash the last traces of shampoo from my eyes my hair then i turned took a step toward the oncoming demon i couldnt leave susan to that thing not even if it meant dying id never be able to live with myself afterward the demon squalled something at me in its hissing toady voice and raised both its hands toward me coming up onto its hind legs lightning flashed overhead blinding bright thunder came hard on its heels deep enough to shake the street beneath my bare feet thunder lightning the storm i looked up at the boiling clouds overhead lit by the dancing lightning moving among them deadly beautiful and luminous power seethed and danced in the storm mystic energies as old as time enough power to shatter stones superheat air boil water to steam burn anything it touched to ashes at this point i think it is safe to say i was desperate enough to try anything the demon howled and waddled forward clumsy and quick i raised my staff to the sky with one hand and with the other pointed a finger at the demon this was dangerous work tapping the storm there was no ritual to give it shape no circle to protect me not even words to shield my mind from the way the energies of magic would course through it i sent my senses coursing upward toward the storm taking hold of the formless powers and drawing them into patterns of raw energy that began to surge toward me toward the tip of my staff harry susan said what are you doing she huddled on the ground in her evening dress shuddering her voice was weak thready you ever form a line of people holding hands when you were a kid and scuff your feet across the carpeting together and then have the last person in the line touch someone on the ear to zap them yeah she said confused im doing that only bigger the demon squalled again and drove itself into the air with its powerful toadlegs hurtling toward me sailing through the air with a frightening and unnatural grace i focused what little i had left of my will on the staff and the clouds and raging power above ventas i shouted ventas fulmino at my will a spark leapt up from the tip of my staff toward the clouds above it touched the rolling restless belly of the storm hell roared down in response lightning whitehot fury with a torrent of wind and rain all fell upon me centered around the staff i felt the power hit the end of the soaking wet wood with a jolt like a sledgehammer it coursed down the staff and into my hand making my muscles convulse bowing my naked body with the strain it took everything i had to hold the image of what i wanted in my mind to keep my hand pointed at the demon as it came for me to keep the energy surging through me to wreak its havoc on flesh less tender than mine the demon was maybe six inches away when the storms fury boiled down my body and out through my arm out of my pointing finger and took it in the heart the force of it threw the thing back back and up into the air and held it there wreathed in a corona of blinding energy the demon struggled screamed toadhands flailing toadlegs kicking and then it exploded in a wash of blue flame the night was lit once more bright as day i had to shield my eyes against it susan cried out in fear and i think i must have been screaming along with her then the night grew quiet again flaming bits of something that i didnt want to think about were raining down around us landing with little wet plopping sounds upon the road the sidewalk the yards of the houses around me burning quickly to little briquettes of charcoal and then hissing into sputtering coolness the wind abruptly died down the rain slowed to a gentle patter the storms fury spent my legs gave out and i sat down shakily on the street stunned my hair was dry and standing on end there was smoke curling up from the blackened ends of my toenails i just sat there happy to be alive to be breathing in and out again i felt like i could crawl back in bed and go to sleep for a few days even though id gotten up not half an hour ago susan sat up blinking her face blank she stared at me what are you doing next saturday i asked her she just kept on staring for a minute and then quietly lay down again on her side i heard the footsteps approach from the darkness off to one side summoning demons the sour voice said disgusted in addition to the atrocities you have already committed i knew i smelled black magic on the winds tonight you are a blight dresden i sort of rolled my head over to one side to regard morgan my warden tall and massive in his black trench coat the rain had plastered his greying hair down to his head and coursed down the lines of his face like channels in a slab of stone i didnt call that thing i said my voice was slurred with fatigue but i damn well sent it back to where it belongs didnt you see i saw you defend yourself against it morgan said but i didnt see anyone else summon it you probably called it up yourself and lost control of it it couldnt have taken me anyway dresden it wouldnt have done you any good i laughed weakly youre flattering yourself i said i sure as hell wouldnt risk calling up a demon just to get to you morgan he narrowed his alreadynarrow eyes i have convened the council he said they will be here two dawns hence they will hear my testimony dresden and the evidence i have to present to them against you there was another more subdued flash of lightning and it gave his eyes a wild madmans gleam and then they will order you put to death i just stared at him for a moment dully the council i said theyre coming here to chicago morgan smiled at me the kind of smile sharks reserve for baby seals dawn on monday you will be brought before them i dont usually enjoy my position as executioner harry blackstone copperfield dresden but in your case i am proud to fulfill that role i shuddered when he pronounced my full name he did it almost exactly rightmaybe by accident and maybe not too there were those on the white council who knew my name knew how to say it to run from the council convened to avoid them would be to admit guilt and invite disaster and because they knew my name they could find me they could get to me anywhere susan moaned and stirred hhharry she mumbled what happened i turned to her to make sure she was all right when i glanced back over my shoulder morgan was gone susan sneezed and huddled against me i put an arm around her to share what little warmth i had monday morning monday morning morgan would bring his suspicions and level his accusations and it would likely be enough to get me voted dead whoever mister or miss shadows was i had to find him her it or them before monday morning or i was as good as dead i was reflecting on what a miserable date i was when the squad car pulled up turned its spotlights on us and the officer said over the loudspeaker set the stick down and put your hands up dont make any sudden moves perfectly natural i thought embracing a sort of exhausted stoicism for the officer to arrest a naked man and a woman dressed in an evening gown sitting on a sidewalk in the pouring rain like a couple of drunks fresh off a bender susan shielded her eyes and then looked at the spotlight all the throwing up shed done must have gotten rid of the potion in her ended its amorous effects this she said in a calm and dispassionate voice is the worst night of my life the officers got out of the car and started toward us i grunted thats what you get for trying to go out with a wizard she glanced aside at me and her eyes glittered darkly for a moment she almost smiled and there was a sort of vindictive satisfaction to her tone when she spoke but its going to make a fantastic story chapter fifteen as it turned out linda randall had a darn good reason for skipping out on our appointment saturday night linda randall was dead i sneezed as i ducked under the yellow police tape in the sweatpants and tshirt i had been allowed to pluck from the mess of my place before the police car had brought me across town to linda randalls apartment and cowboy boots mister had dragged one of my sneakers off and i hadnt had time to find it so i wore what i had freaking cat linda had died a bit earlier that evening after getting to the scene murphy had tried to phone me failed to get through and then sent a squad car down to pick me up and bring me in to do my consultant bit the dutiful patrolmen sent to collect me had stopped to check out the crazy naked guy a block away from my apartment and had been surprised and more than a little suspicious when i turned out to be the very same man they were supposed to pick up and bring to the crime scene dear susan had come to my rescue explaining away what had happened as just one of those things teehee and assuring the officers that she was all right and would be fine to drive home she got a little pale around the edges when she saw once more the ruins of my apartment and the enormous dent the demon had put in the side of her car but she made a bold face of it and eventually left the scene with that i have a story to write gleam in her eye she stopped and gave me a kiss on the cheek on her way out and whispered not bad harry in my ear then she patted my bare ass and got in her car i blushed i dont think the cops noticed it in the rain and the dark the patrolmen had looked at me askance but were more than happy to let me go put on some fresh clothes the only things i had clean were more sweats and another tshirt this one proclaiming in bold letters over a little cartoon graveyard easter has been canceledthey found the body i put those on and my duster which had somehow survived the demon attack and my utterly inappropriate cowboy boots and then i had gotten in the patrol car and been driven across town i clipped my little id card to my coats lapel and followed the uniforms in one of them led me to murphy on the way i took in little details there were a lot of people standing around gawking it was still fairly early after all the rain came down in a fine mist and softened the contours of the scene there were several police cars parked in the apartment buildings parking lots and one on the lawn by the door leading out to the little concrete patio from the apartment in question someone had left his bulbs on and blue lights flashed over the scene in alternating swaths of shadow and cold light there was a lot of yellow police tape around and right in the middle of it all was murphy she looked terrible like she hadnt eaten anything that didnt come out of a vending machine or drunk anything but stale coffee since i had seen her last her blue eyes were tired and bloodshot but still sharp dresden she said she peered up at me you planning on having king kong climb your hair i tried to smile at her we still need to cast our screaming damsel interested murphy snorted she snorts really well for someone with such a cute nose come on she spun on one heel and walked up to the apartment as though she wasnt exhausted and at the end of her rope the forensics team was already there so we got some nifty plastic booties to put over our shoes and loose plastic gloves for our hands from an officer standing beside the door i tried to call earlier murphy said but your phone was out of service again harry bad night for it i responded wobbling as i slipped the booties on whats the story another victim she said same mo as tommy tomm and the stanton woman jesus i said theyre using the storms what murphy turned and fixed her eyes on me the storm i repeated you can tap storms and other natural phenomena to get things done all natural fuel for the mojo you didnt say anything about that before murphy accused i hadnt thought of it until tonight i rubbed at my face it made sense hells bells that was how the shadowman had been able to do all of that in one night hed called the demon and been able to send it after me as well as appearing in the shadow hed projected and hed been able to kill again have you got an id on the victim i asked murphy turned to go inside as she answered linda randall chauffeur age twentynine it was a good thing murphy had turned away or the way my jaw dropped would have told her that i knew the deceased and she would have had all sorts of uncomfortable questions i stared after murphy for a second then hurriedly veiled my expression and followed her inside the apartment linda randalls oneroom apartment looked like the trailer of a rock band that did little besides play concerts host parties and fall into a stupor afterward dirty clothes were strewn on one side of a kingsize bed there was a disproportionate amount of clothing that looked as though it had been purchased from a fredericks of hollywood cataloglacy and silky and satiny colors all bright designed to attract the eye there were many candles around the bed on shelves and dressers and a night table most burned halfway down the drawer of the night table was partly open revealing a number of personal amusementslinda randall had apparently liked her toys the kitchenette off to one side looked largely unused except for the coffeepot the microwave and the trash can in which several pizza boxes were crammed maybe it was the pizza boxes that did it that gave me a sudden pang of understanding and empathy for linda my own kitchen looked the same a lot of the time minus the microwave here had lived someone else who knew that the only thing waiting at home was a sense of loneliness sometimes it is comforting most often it isnt ill bet linda would have understood that but id never have the chance to know the forensics team was gathered around the bed concealing whatever was there like a cluster of buzzards around the exposed head of the outlaws they used to bury up to their necks in the old west they spoke among themselves in low calm voices dispassionate as skilled dinner chatter calling little details to the attention of their companions complimenting one another on their observations harry murphy said quietly her tone of voice suggested that it wasnt the first time shed said it are you sure youre all right for this my mouth twitched of course i wasnt all right for this no one should ever be all right for this sort of thing but instead of saying that i told her my heads just aching sorry lets just get it over with she nodded and led me over toward the bed murphy was a lot shorter than most of the men and women working around the bed but i had almost a head of height on all of them so i didnt have to ask anyone to move just stepped up close to the bed and looked linda had been on the phone when she died she was naked even this early in the year she had tan lines around her hips she must have gone to a tanning booth during the winter her hair was still damp she lay on her back her eyes halfclosed her expression tranquil as it hadnt been any time id seen her her heart had been torn out it was lying on the kingsize bed about a foot and a half from her pulped and squashed and slippery sort of a scarlet and grey color there was a hole in her chest too showing where bone had been splintered outward by the force that had removed her heart i just stared for a few moments noting details in a sort of detached way again again someone had used magic to end a life i had to think of her as she sounded on the phone joking a quick wit a sort of sly sensuality in the way she said her words and phrased her sentences a little hint of insecurity around the edges vulnerability that magnified the other parts of her personality her hair was damp because shed been taking a bath before she came to see me whatever anyone said of her she had been passionately vitally alive had been eventually i realized how quiet the room was the men and women of the forensics team all five of them were looking up at me waiting as i looked around they all averted their gazes but you didnt have to be a wizard to see what was in their faces fear pure and simple they had been faced with something that science couldnt explain it rattled them shook them to their cores this sudden violent and bloody evidence that three hundred years of science and research was no match for the things that were still even after all this time lurking in the dark and i was the one who was supposed to have the answers i didnt have any for them and i felt like shit for remaining silent as i stepped back and turned away from lindas body then walked across the room to the small bathroom the tub was still full of water a bracelet and earrings were laid out on the counter in front of a mirror plus a little makeup a bottle of perfume murphy appeared beside me and stood with me looking at the bathroom she seemed a lot smaller than she usually does she called us murphy said nine one one has the call recorded thats how we knew to come out here she called and said that she knew who had killed jennifer stanton and tommy tomm and that now they were coming for her then she started screaming thats when the spell hit her the phone probably went out right after murphy frowned up at me and nodded yeah it did but it was working fine when we got here magic disrupts technology sometimes you know that i rubbed at one eye have you talked to any relatives anything like that murphy shook her head there arent any relatives in town were looking now but it might take some time we tried to reach her boss but he wasnt available a mr beckitt she studied my face waiting for me to say something you ever heard of him she asked after a moment i didnt look back at murphy i shrugged murphys jaw tensed little motions at the corners of her face then she said greg and helen beckitt three years ago their daughter amanda was killed in a cross fire johnny marcones thugs were shooting it out with some of the jamaican gang that was trying to muscle in on the territory back then one of them shot the little girl she lived for three weeks in intensive care and died when they took her off life support i didnt say anything but i thought of mrs beckitts numb face and dead eyes the beckitts attempted to lodge a wrongful death suit against johnny marcone but marcones lawyers were too good they got it thrown out before it even went to court and they never found the man who shot the little girl word has it that marcone offered to pay them blood money make reparation but they turned him down i didnt say anything behind us they were putting linda in a body bag sealing her in i heard men count to three and lift her put her onto a gurney of some kind and wheel her out one of the forensics guys told murphy they were going to take a break and would be back in ten minutes she nodded and sent them out the room got even more quiet well harry she said her voice was hushed like she didnt want to disturb the apartments new stillness what can you tell me there was a subtle weight to the question she might as well have asked me what i wasnt telling her thats what she meant she took her hand out of her jacket pocket and handed me a plastic bag i took it inside was my business card the one id given to linda it was still curled a little where id had to palm it it was also speckled with what i presumed was lindas blood i looked at the part of the bag where you write the case number and the identification of the piece of evidence it was blank it wasnt on the records it wasnt official yet murphy was waiting for my answer she wanted me to tell her something i just wasnt sure if she was waiting for me to tell her that a lot of people have my card and that i didnt know how it had gotten here or if she wanted me to say how i had known the victim how i had been involved with her then she would have to ask me questions the kinds of questions you ask suspects if i tell you i said that i was having a psychic premonition would you take me seriously what kind of premonition she said she didnt look up at me i sense i paused thinking of my words i wanted them to be very clear i sense that this woman will have a police record probably for possession of narcotics and solicitation i sense that she used to work at the velvet room for madame bianca i sense that she used to be close friends and lovers with jennifer stanton i sense that if she had been approached yesterday and asked about those deaths that she would have claimed to know nothing murphy mulled over my words for a moment you know dresden she said and her voice was tight cool furious if youd sensed these things yesterday or maybe even this morning its possible that we could have talked to her its possible that we could have found out something from her its even possible and she turned to me and slammed me against the doorway with one forearm and the weight of her body suddenly and shockingly hardits even possible she snarled that shed still be alive she stared up at my face and she didnt look at all like a cutesy cheerleader now she looked like a mother wolf standing over the body of one of her cubs and getting ready to make someone pay for it this time i was the one to look away a lot of people have my card i said i put them up all over the place i dont know how she got it godammit dresden she said she stepped back from me and walked away toward the bloodstained sheets youre holding out on me i know you are i can get a warrant for your arrest i can have you brought in for questioning she turned back to me someones killed three people already its my job to stop them its what i do i didnt say anything i could smell the soap and shampoo from linda randalls bath dont make me choose harry her voice softened if not her eyes or her face please i thought about it i could bring everything to her thats what she was askingnot half the story not part of the information she wanted it all she wanted all the pieces in front of her so she could puzzle them together and bring the bad guys in she didnt want to work the puzzle knowing that i was keeping some of the pieces in my pocket what could it hurt linda randall had called me earlier that evening she had planned on coming to me to talk to me she was going to give me some information and someone had shut her up before she could i saw two problems with telling murphy that one she would start thinking like a cop it would not be hard to find out that linda wasnt exactly a highfidelity piece of equipment that she had numerous lovers on both sides of the fence what if she and i were closer than i was admitting what if id used magic to kill her lovers in a fit of jealous rage and then waited for another storm to kill her too it sounded plausible workable a crime of passionmurphy had to know that the da would have a hell of a time proving magic as a murder weapon but if it had been a gun instead it would have flown the second problem and the one that worried me a lot more was that there were already three people dead and if i hadnt gotten lucky and creative there would have been two more dead people back at my apartment i still didnt know who the bad guy was telling murphy what little more i knew wouldnt give her any helpful information it would only make her ask more questions and she wanted answers if the voice in the shadows knew that murphy was heading the investigation to find him and was on the right track he would have no qualms about killing her too and there was nothing she could do to protect herself against it she might have been formidable to your average criminal but all the aikido in the world wouldnt do her any good against a demon then too there was the white council men like morgan and his superiors secure in their own power arrogant and considering themselves above the authority of any laws but their own wouldnt hesitate to remove one police lieutenant who had discovered the secret world of the white council i looked at the bloodstained sheets and thought of lindas corpse i thought of murphys office and what it would look like with her sprawled on the floor her heart torn from her chest or her throat torn out by some creeping thing from beyond sorry murph i said my voice came out in a rasping whisper i wish i could help you i dont know anything useful i didnt try to look up at her and i didnt try to hide that i was lying i sensed more than saw the hardening around her eyes the little lines of hurt and anger im not sure if a tear fell or if she really just raised a hand to brush back some of her hair then she turned to the front door and shouted carmichael get your ass in here carmichael looked equally as slobbish as he had a few days ago as though the passage of time hadnt changed himit certainly hadnt changed his jacket only the food stains on his tie and the particular pattern of rumplement to his hair there had to be something comforting i reflected in that kind of stability no matter how bad things got no matter how horrible or sickening the scene you could count on carmichael to look like the same quality of crap he glared at me as he came in yeah she tossed the plastic bag to him and he caught it mark that and log it she said hang around for a minute i want a witness carmichael looked down at the bag and saw my card his beady eyes widened he looked back up at me and i saw the shift in gears in his head reclassifying me from annoying ally to suspect mr dresden murphy said she kept her tone frosty polite there are some questions wed like to ask you do you think you could come down to the station and make a statement questions to be asked the white council would convene and execute me in a little more than thirty hours i didnt have time for questions im sorry lieutenant ive got to comb my hair tonight tomorrow morning then she said well see i said if you arent there in the morning murphy said im going to ask for a warrant well come and find you and by god harry ill get some answers to this suit yourself i told her and i started for the door carmichael took a step forward and stood in my way i stopped and looked at him and he kept his eyes focused on the center of my chest if im not under arrest i told her then i presume im free to go let him go ron murphy said her tone of voice was disgusted but i could hear the hurt underneath it ill talk to you again soon mr dresden she stepped closer and said in a perfectly even tone and if it turns out that youre the one behind all this rest assured whatever you can do and whatever you can pull i will find you and i will bring you down do you understand me i did understand really i understood the pressure she was under her frustration her anger and her determination to stop the killing from happening again if i was some kind of hero from a romance novel id have said something brief and eloquent and heartrending but im just me so i said i do understand karrin carmichael stepped out of my way and i walked away from murphy who i couldnt talk to and from linda who i couldnt protect my head aching weary to my bones and feeling like a total piece of shit chapter sixteen i walked down the block from linda randalls apartment building my thoughts and emotions a far more furious thunderstorm than the one now rolling away from the city out over the vastness of the lake i called a cab from the pay phone outside a gas station and stood about with my back resting against the wall of the building in the misting rain scowling and waiting i had lost murphys trust it didnt matter that i had done what i had to protect both her and myself noble intentions meant nothing it was the results that counted and the results of my actions had been telling a baldfaced lie to one of the only people i could come close to calling a friend and i wasnt sure that even if i found the person or persons responsible even if i worked out how to bring them down even if i did murphys job for her that what had happened between us could ever be smoothed over my thoughts were on that topic and similar issues of doom and gloom when a man with a hat pulled low over his face began to walk past me stopped halfway then turned and drove his fist into my belly i had time to think not again and then he struck me a second and third time each blow drove into my guts thrust me back against the unyielding wall made me sick my breath flew out of my mouth in a little strangling gasp and even if id had a spell already in mind i wouldnt have had the breath to speak it i sort of sagged when he stopped hitting me and he threw me to the ground we were at a welllit gas station just before midnight on a friday night and anything he did was in full view of any cars going by surely god he didnt plan on killing me though at the moment i was too tired and achy to care i lay there for a moment dazed i could smell my attackers sweat and cologne i could tell it was the same person who had jumped me the night before he grabbed my hair jerked my head up and with an audible snip of steel scissors cut off a big lock of my hair then let me go my blood went cold my hair the man had cut off my hair it could be used in almost any kind of magic any kind of deadly spell and there wouldnt be a damned thing i could do to stop it the man turned away walking quickly but not running in a flood of panic and desperation i leapt at his leg got him around the knee and yanked hard i heard a distinctive little pop and then the man screamed son of a bitch and fell heavily to earth one fist one very large and knobknuckled fist was clutched around my hair i tried to suck in a breath and leapt for that hand my attackers hat had fallen off and i recognized himone of johnny marcones men who had followed me from the hotel on thursday afternoon the one who had begun limping after jogging after me for several blocks apparently gimpy had a trick knee and i had just made it jump through its hoop i grabbed his wrist and held on with both hands im not a particularly strong man but im made out of wire and stubborn as hell i curled up around his wrist and hung on trying to pry at his thick fingers gimpy tried to jerk his arm away he was carrying a lot of muscle on that arm but it wasnt enough to move the weight of my whole body he shoved at me with his other arm trying to push me off of him then started pounding at me with one fist let go of me dammit gimpy shouted get off of me i hunched my head down my shoulders up and hung on if i could dig my thumbs into his tendons for long enough his hand would have to open no matter how strong he was i tried to imagine his wrist as playdoh and my thumbs as solid steel pushing into him and held on for everything i was worth i felt his fingers start to loosen i could see the dark thin strands of my hair jesus christ someone shouted hey mike come on there were running footsteps and then a couple of young guys dressed in jogging suits and sneakers came over and dragged me off gimpy i screamed incoherently as my hands slipped from gimpys wrist some of my hair spilled out onto the wet concrete but more stayed in his grip as his fingers closed over it again easy easy man one of the guys was saying as they dragged me off take it easy there wasnt any use struggling against the pair of them instead i dragged in a breath and managed to gasp wallet hes got my wallet considering the way i was dressed compared to gimpys suit and coat that was one lie that was never going to get off the ground or at least it wouldnt have if gimpy hadnt turned and started hurrying away the two men let me go confused then taking the cautious route they started away walking hurriedly back to their car i struggled to my feet and after gimpy wheezing like a leaky accordion gimpy headed across the street to a car and was already in it and leaving by the time i got there i shambled to a halt in a cloud of his exhaust and stared dully after his taillights as he drove off into the misting rain my heart pounded in my chest and didnt slow down even after i recovered my breath my hair johnny marcone now had a lock of my hair he could give it to someone who used magic and use it to do whatever they damn well pleased to me they could use my hair to tear my heart from my chest rip it right out like they had done to jennifer stanton tommy tomm and poor linda randall marcone had warned me to stop twice and now he was going to take me out once and for all my weariness fear and fatigue were abruptly burned away by anger like hell i snarled like hell you will all i had to do was to find them find johnny marcone find gimpy and find marcones wizard whoever he or she was find them get my hair back lay them out like ninepins and send in murphy to round them up by god i wasnt going to take this lying down these assholes were serious theyd already tried to kill me once and they were coming after me again marcone and his boys no i thought not marcone that didnt make any sense unless it had been marcones gang dealing the threeeye from the very beginning if marcone had a wizard in residence why would he have tried to bribe me away why not just swipe a lock of hair from me when hed sent the thug with the bat and then kill me when i didnt pay attention could it be marcone or could his thug be playing two sides of the street i decided that ultimately it didnt matter one thing was clear someone had a lock of my hair some wizard somewhere meant to kill me whoever this wizard was he wasnt much goodid seen that when id wiped out his shadowsending spell he couldnt stand up to me if i could force him into a direct confrontationhe might have a lot of moxie and a lot of raw power to harness the storms as he had and to slap a demon into servitude but he was like a big gawky teenager new to his strength i had more than just strength more than just moxie i had training experience and savvy on my side besides at the moment i was mad enough to chew up nails and spit out paper clips the shadowman couldnt take a shot at me yet he didnt have that kind of strength he needed to wait for the storms that came each spring and to use them to kill me i had time i had time to work if i could just find out where they were where gimpy had taken my hair i could go after him the answer came to me in a flash and it seemed simple if the hair could be used as a link to the rest of me i should be able to reverse itto create a link from me back to the hair hell maybe i could just set it on fire burn it all up from my apartment the formula for a spell like that would be screwy as hell though i needed bob bob could help me work out a spell figure out a formula like that in minutes instead of hours or days i grimaced bob was gone and would be for almost another twentyfour hours there was no way i could work out that formula in less than ten or twelve hours by myself and i didnt think my brain was coherent enough to come up with solid calculations at the moment anyway i could have called murphy murphy would have known where marcone was lurking and gimpy would probably be nearby she could have given me an idea at least of how to find gentleman johnny gimpy and the shadowman but she never would now and even if she did shed demand to know the whole story and after id told it to her shed try to take me into protective custody or something ridiculous like that i clenched my fists hard and my nails dug into my palms i should trim them sometime i looked down at my nails then hurriedly crossed the street to stand under the gas stations lights and stared at my hands there was blood under my fingernails where theyd bitten into gimpys wrists i threw back my head and laughed i had everything i needed i moved back out of the misting rain and squatted down on the concrete sidewalk i used a bit of chalk i keep in my duster pocket to sketch out a circle on the concrete surrounding me then i scraped the blood out from under my nails and put it onto the concrete between my feet it glistened in the fine misty fall of rain the next part took me a moment to figure out but i settled for using the tracking spell i already knew rather than trying to modify it to something a little more dignified i plucked out a couple of nose hairs and put them in the circle too on top of the bits of gimpys skin and blood then i touched a finger to the chalk circle and willed energy into it closing it off i gathered up my energy from my anger my renewed fear my aching head and queasy stomach and hurled it into the spell segui votro testatum there was a rush of energy that focused on my nostrils and made me sneeze several times in a row and then it came to me quite strongly the scent of gimpys cologne i stood up opened the circle again with a swipe of my foot and walked out of it i turned in a slow circle all the way around gimpys scent came to me strongly from the southwest out toward some of the richer suburbs of chicago i started laughing again i had the son of a bitch i could follow him back to marcone or whoever he was working for but i had to do it now i hadnt had enough blood to make it last long hey buddy the cabby leaned out the window and glared at me the engine running at an idle the end of his cheroot glowing orange i stared at him for a second what he scowled what are you deaf did someone call for a cab i grinned at him still angry still a little lightheaded still eager to go kick gimpy and the shadowmans teeth in i did why do i get all the nuts he said get in i did closing the door behind me he eyed me suspiciously in the mirror and said where to two stops i told him i gave him my apartments address and sat back in the seat my head automatically drawn toward the southwest toward where the men who wanted to kill me were thats one he said wheres number two i narrowed my eyes i needed a few things from my apartment my talismans my blasting rod my staff a fetish that should still be vital and after that i was going to have a serious talk with one of chicagos biggest gangsters ill tell you when we get there chapter seventeen we ended up at the varsity a club marcone owned in a chicago suburb it was a busy place catering to much of the collegeage crowd to be found on this side of the city and even at onethirty in the morning it was still fairly crowded for someplace so isolated alone in a strip mall the only business open at this time of the evening the only lit windows in sight loony the cabby muttered as he drove away and i had to pause for a moment and agree with him i had directed him about in a meandering line the spell id cast letting me literally follow my nose along gimpys trail the spell had begun fading almost the moment id cast iti didnt have enough blood to make a more lasting enchantmentbut it had held long enough for me to zero in on the varsity and to identify gimpys car in the parking lot i walked past the windows and sure enough in a large circular booth in the back i saw johnny marcone the bullnecked mr hendricks gimpy and spike sitting together and talking i ducked out of sight in a hurry before one of them noticed me then walked back into the parking lot to consider exactly what i had at my disposal a bracelet on each wrist a ring my blasting rod my staff i thought of all the subtle and devious means by which i might tilt the situation in my favorclever illusions convenient faltering of electricity or water a sudden invasion of rats or cockroaches i could have managed any of them not many people who use magic are that versatile but very few have the kind of experience and training it takes to put such spells together on the fly i shook my head irritated i didnt have time to bother with subtlety power into the talismans then power into the ring i reached for the power in both the staff and rod cool strength of wood and seething anger of fire and stepped up to the front door of the varsity then i blew it off its hinges i blew it out rather than in pieces flew toward me and bounced off the shield of air i held in front of me while others rained back behind me into the parking lot it wouldnt do to injure a bunch of innocent diners on the other side you only get one chance to make a first impression once the door was off i pointed my blasting rod inside and spoke a command the jukebox slammed back against the wall as though a cannonball had impacted it and then melted into a puddle of liquidplastic goo the music squealed out the speakers and stopped i stepped into the doorway and released a pentup wave of energy from my ring starting at the door and then circling throughout the room the lightbulbs began to explode with sharp little detonations and showers of powdered glass and glowing bits of filament people at the bar and at all the wooden tables scattered around the room reacted as people tend to do in this sort of situation they started screaming and shouting rising to their feet or ducking beneath their tables in confusion a few ducked out the fire door at the back of one side of the room then there was an abrupt and profound silence everyone stood stockstill and stared at the doorwaythey stared at me at the back table johnny marcone regarded the doorway with his passionless moneycolored eyes he was not smiling mr hendricks beside him was glaring at me his single eyebrow lowered far enough to threaten him with blinding spike was tightlipped and pale gimpy stared at me in pure horror none of them made any moves or any sound i guess seeing a wizard cut loose can do that to you little pig little pig let me in i said into the silence i planted my staff on the ground and narrowed my eyes at marcone id really like to talk to you for a minute john marcone stared at me for a moment then his lips twitched up at the corners you have a singular manner of persuasion mr dresden he stood up and spoke aloud to the room without ever taking his eyes off me he must have been angry but the icy exterior concealed it ladies and gentlemen the varsity is closing early it would seem please make an orderly exit through the door nearest you dont worry about your bills mr dresden if you would step out of the doorway and allow my customers to leave i stepped out of the doorway the place cleared out fast customers and staff alike leaving me alone in the room with marcone hendricks spike and gimpy none of them moved as they waited for the customers the witnesses to leave gimpy started sweating hendrickss expression never changed the big man was as patient as a mountain lion ready to leap out on the unsuspecting deer i want my hair back i said as soon as the last collegeage couple had hustled out the door beg pardon marcone said his head tilted to one side and he seemed genuinely puzzled you heard me i said this piece of trash of yours i swung my blasting rod up and pointed it at gimpyjust jumped me outside a gas station across town and cut off some of my hair i want it back im not going to go out like tommy tomm did marcones eyes abruptly shone with a terrible cold moneycolored anger he turned his head deliberately to gimpy gimpys broad face went a bit more pasty he blinked a trickle of sweat out of his eyes i dont know what hes talking about boss marcones gaze never wavered i presume mr dresden he said that you have some kind of proof look at his left wrist i said hes got several fingernail marks on his skin where i grabbed him marcone nodded those cold tigers eyes on gimpys and said almost gently well hes lying boss gimpy protested he licked at his lips hell i got some fingernail marks from my girl he knew that you know what you said hes for real he knows things the pieces of the puzzle fell into place whoever killed tommy tomm knows that im on his trail i said your rival whoever it is selling the threeeye gimpy here must have gotten a sweet deal from him to turn on you hes been providing your rival with information all along running errands for him gimpy couldnt have played a game of poker to save his life he stared at me in horror shook his head in protest theres an easy way to settle this marcone said his voice smooth and even lawrence show me your wrist hes lying boss gimpy lawrence said again but his voice was shaking hes just trying to mess with your head lawrence marcone said his tone the gentle reproof of parent to child gimpy lawrence knew it was over i saw the desperate decision in his face before he actually moved liar he howled at me he got up lifting his hand from underneath the table i had time to realize he held a revolver virtually a twin to my own in his fist before he started shooting several things happened at the same time i lifted my hand focusing my will on the bracelet of tiny medievalstyle shields around my left wrist and hardened the protective energies around me bullets hammered against it with whining noises striking sparks in the near dark of the restaurant spike leapt clear of the table staying low a small uzistyle automatic now in his hand hendricks was more ruthless and direct reacting with the mindlessly violent instincts of a savage with one hand the big bodyguard hauled marcone back putting his own bulk between the mob boss and gimpy lawrence with the other hand he produced a compact semiautomatic gimpy lawrence turned his head and saw hendricks and his gun he panicked turning his own weapon toward the larger man hendricks shot him with a ruthless efficiency three sharp claps of sound three flashes of muzzle light the first two shots hit gimpy in the middle of his chest driving him back a pair of steps the third hit him over the right eyebrow jerked his head back and toppled him to the ground gimpy lawrence had dark eyes like mine i could see them his head turned toward me as he lay there on the floor i saw him blink once then the lights went out of them and he was gone i stood there for a moment stunned grand entrance or not this wasnt what i had wanted to happen i didnt want to kill anyone hell i didnt want anyone to die not me and not them i felt sick it had been a sort of game a macho contest of showmanship i had been determined to win all of a sudden it wasnt a game anymore and i just wanted to walk away from it alive we all stood there no one moving then marcone said from beneath hendricks i wanted him alive he could have answered several questions first hendricks frowned and got up off of marcone sorry boss thats all right mr hendricks better to err on the side of caution i suppose marcone stood up straightened his tie then went and knelt by the body he felt the mans throat then wrist and shook his head lawrence lawrence i would have paid you twice what they offered you if youd come to me with it you never were very smart were you then his face showing no more emotion than it had the entire evening marcone peeled back gimpy lawrences left sleeve and studied the mans wrist he frowned and lowered the arm again his expression pensive it would seem mr dresden he said that we have a common enemy he turned to focus his gaze on me who is it i shook my head i dont know if i did i wouldnt be here i thought maybe it was you marcone lifted his eyebrows you should have known me better than that mr dresden it was my turn to frown youre right i should have the killings had been more vicious savage than marcone would have cared to use competitors might have to be removed but there would be no sense in making a production of it certainly there was no reason to murder bystanders like linda like jennifer stanton it was inefficient bad for business if he has something of yours you are welcome to take it mr dresden marcone said he looked around the room and sighed better hurry i think the varsity has seen its last crowd a shame it was hard but i walked over to gimpy lawrences body i had to set aside my staff my rod to rifle the corpses pockets i felt like a ghoul crouched over the body of a dead man picking what was valuable to me off of it out of his pockets i didnt find my hair anywhere i looked up at marcone and he regarded me my eyes without any readable emotion nothing i told him interesting he must have passed the material in question to someone else before he came here marcone said someone after he got here maybe marcone shook his head i am quite sure he did not do that i would have noticed i believe you i told him and i did but who our enemy marcone said obviously i closed my eyes suddenly sagging with weariness dammit marcone said nothing he stood up and issued a few quiet orders to hendricks and spike hendricks wiped down his gun with a napkin then left it lying on the floor spike went over behind the bar and started to do something involving a power cord and a bottle of whiskey i gathered up my staff and rod stood up and turned to marcone tell me what else you know i need everything you have if im going to catch this guy marcone considered that and nodded yes you do unfortunately you chose a public forum for this discussion you have set yourself up in the eyes of anyone who cared to watch as my enemy as understandable as your reasons might have been the fact that you have publicly defied me remains i cannot let that go without response regardless of my personal feelings without inviting more of the same i must maintain control it isnt personal mr dresden its business i tightened my jaw and my grip on my blasting rod and made sure my shield was still there ready to go so what are you going to do about it nothing he said i need do nothing either our enemy will kill you in which case i need not risk myself or my people in removing you or you will find him in time and bring him down if you do defeat him i will let it be understood to any who ask that you did so at my behest after which i will be inclined to forget this evening either way it profits me best to wait and see if he kills me i pointed out if im the next one to have my heart ripped out you still wont know where he is you wont be any closer to removing him and protecting your business true marcone said then he smiled an expression that lasted for only a fraction of a second but i think you will not be such easy prey i think that even if he kills you he will reveal himself in some way and since our encounter the other day i think i have a better feel for what sorts of things to look for i scowled at him and turned to go moving briskly toward the door harry he said i stopped and turned back around on a personal notei know nothing that would profit you in any case all of his people we managed to take revealed nothing they were that afraid of him no one seems to know just where the drug comes from from what it is made or where this person does business shadows they say that he is always in the shadows that is all that i have learned i regarded johnny marcone for a moment and then nodded once thank you he shrugged good luck i think it would be best if you and i did not encounter one another in the future i cannot tolerate any more interference in my affairs i think thats a good idea too i said excellent it is good to have someone who understands and then he turned back toward his remaining two men leaving the corpse of gimpy lawrence on the floor behind him i turned and trudged out of the place into the night and the cold and the misty rain i still felt sick could still see gimpy lawrences eyes as he died i could still hear linda randalls husky laughter in my head i still regretted lying to murphy and i still had no intentions of telling her any more than i already had i still didnt know who was trying to kill me i still had no defense to present to the white council lets face it harry i told myself youre still screwed chapter eighteen have you ever felt despair absolute hopelessness have you ever stood in the darkness and known deep in your heart in your spirit that it was never ever going to get better that something had been lost forever and that it wasnt coming back thats what it felt like walking out of the varsity walking out into the rain when im in turmoil when i cant think when im exhausted and afraid and feeling very very alone i go for walks its just one of those things i do i walk and i walk and sooner or later something comes to me something to make me feel less like jumping off a building so i walked it was pretty stupid in retrospect walking around chicago late on a saturday night i didnt look up very often i walked and let things roll around in my head my hands in the pockets of my duster which flapped around my long legs while the light rain gradually plastered my hair to my head i thought about my father i usually do when i get that low he was a good man a generous man a hopeless loser a stage magician at a time when technology was producing more magic than magic he had never had much to give his family he was on the road most of the time playing rundown houses trying to scratch out a living for my mother he wasnt there when i was born he wasnt there when she died he showed up more than a day after id been born he gave me the names of three magicians then took me with him on the road entertaining children and retirees performing in school gymnasiums and grocery stores he was always generous kindmore kind and more generous than we could afford really and he was always a little bit sad he would show me pictures of my mother and talk about her every night it got to where i almost felt that i knew her myself as i got older the feeling increased i saw my father i think as she must haveas a dear sweet gentle man a little naive but honest and kind someone who cared for others and who didnt value material gain over all else i can see why she would have loved him i never got to be old enough to be his assistant as he had promised me he died in his sleep one night an aneurism the doctors said i found him cold smiling maybe hed been dreaming of mother when he went and as i looked at him i suddenly felt for the very first time in my life utterly entirely alone that something was gone that would never return that a little hole had been hollowed out inside of me that wasnt ever going to be filled again and that was how i felt that rainy spring night in chicago walking along the streets my breath pluming into steam my right boot creaking with every step dead people occupying all of my thoughts i shouldnt have been surprised i suppose when after hours of walking my steps carried me back to linda randalls apartment the police were all gone now the lights all off all the gawking neighbors cozy in their beds it was quiet in the apartment complex dawn wasnt yet brushing the sky but somewhere on a window ledge or in a rooftop nest a bird was twittering i was at the end of my strength my resources i hadnt thought of anything hadnt come up with any brilliant ideas the killer was going to get a spell together to kill me the next time he had a storm to draw on and from the way the air felt that could be anytime if he didnt kill me morgan would certainly have the white council set to execute me at dawn on monday the bastard was probably out lobbying votes already if the matter came before the council i wouldnt stand a chance i leaned against the door to lindas apartment it was striped with police linedo not cross yellowandblack tape i didnt really realize what i was doing until i had already worked a spell that opened the door unfastened the lowest strip of yellow tape and walked into her apartment this is stupid harry i told myself i guess i wasnt in the mood to listen i walked around lindas apartment smelling her perfume and her blood they hadnt come to clean up the blood yet the apartment manager would probably have to handle that later they never really show you details like that at the movies i eventually found myself lying on the floor on the carpeting next to linda randalls large bed i was curled on my side my back to her bed my face toward the sliding glass doors that led out to her little concrete patio i didnt feel like moving like going anywhere like doing anything useless it had all been useless i was going to die in the next two days the worst part was that i wasnt sure that i cared i was just so tired exhausted from all the magic id had to use from the walking from the bruises and punches and lack of sleep it was dark everything was dark i think i must have fallen asleep i needed it after everything that had happened i dont remember anything else until the sun was too bright in my eyes i blinked and lifted a hand against the light keeping my eyes closed mornings had never been my best time and the sun had risen above the tops of the buildings across the street cheerful springtime sunshine that dashed down through linda randalls curtains through my eyelids and into my brain i grumbled something and rolled over face to the cool darkness under lindas bed back to the warm sunlight but i didnt go back to sleep instead i started to get disgusted with myself what the hell are you doing harry i demanded out loud lying down to die i told myself petulantly like hell my wiser part said get off the floor and get to work dont wanna tired go away youre not too tired to talk to yourself so youre not too tired to bail your ass out of the alligators either open your eyes i told myself firmly i hunched my shoulders not wanting to obey but against my better judgment i did open my eyes the sunlight had turned linda randalls apartment into an almost cheerful place overlaid with a patina of goldempty still to be sure but warm with a few good memories i saw a highschool yearbook lying nearby underneath the bed several photographs serving as bookmarks there was also a framed picture of a muchyounger linda randall smiling brightly none of the jaded weariness i had seen in her in evidence standing in her graduation robes between a kindlooking couple in their late fifties her parents i presumed she looked happy and lying just in the edge of a stray little beam of sunlight one that was already retreating as the sun rose above the edge of the buildings was a small red plastic cylinder with a grey cap my salvation i snatched it out from under the bed i was shaking i shook the canister and it rattled a roll of film was inside i opened up the canister and dumped the film into my hand the plastic leader had been retracted into the casethere were pictures on the film but they hadnt been developed yet i closed the film up again and reached into the pocket of my duster and drew out another canister the one id found at victor sellss lake house the two were a match my mind spun around taking off down a whole new track an entirely new realm of possibility had opened up to me and somewhere in it might be my opportunity my chance to get out of this alive to catch the killer to salvage everything that had started going to hell but it still wasnt clear i couldnt be sure what was going on but i had a possible link now a link between the murder investigation and monica sellss aborted inquiry into the disappearance of her husband victor i had another lead to follow but there wasnt much time to follow it i had to get up to get on my feet and get going fast you cant keep a good wizard down i stood up grabbed my staff and rod and started toward the door the last thing i needed was to get caught trespassing on a crime scene it could get me arrested and stuck in holding and id be dead before i could get bail my mind was already rolling ahead working out the next step trying to find this photographer who had been at victors beach house and getting these pictures developed and seeing if there was anything in them that was worth linda randalls death it was then that i heard a sound and stopped it came again a quiet scraping someone turned the key in the dead bolt of the apartments front door and swung it open chapter nineteen there was no time to flee beneath the bed or into the bathroom and i didnt want to be limited in mobility in any case i leapt forward and stood behind the door as it opened keeping very still a man enteredslim short harriedlooking his hair a listless shade of brown was drawn back into a ponytail he wore dark cotton pants a dark jacket and carried a pouch on a strap at his side he shut the door most of the way and looked around with great agitation but like most people who are too nervous to be thinking clearly he was seeing less than he should have been and though his head swept over where i would have been in his peripheral vision he didnt notice me he was a goodlooking man or so it seemed with strong lines to his jaw and cheekbones he crossed the room and stopped short when he saw the bloodstained bed i saw him clench his hands into fists he made a strange cawing little sound then hurried forward to throw himself down on the floor by the bed and start pawing underneath it after a few seconds his pawing grew more frantic and i heard him curse out loud i slid my fingers over the smooth surface of the film canister in my pocket so the mysterious photographer lurking outside of victor sellss lake house was here looking for the film i had a feeling in my stomach like i get when i finish a particularly difficult jigsaw puzzlea peculiar satisfaction mingled with a touch of smugness i settled my staff and rod silently into the corner by the door and nipped my official police consultants badge complete with my photograph on it out of my duster so that it showed against the black canvas i covered my ratty old tshirt with the coat and hoped that the man would be too rattled and nervous to notice that i was wearing sweatpants and cowboy boots beneath the duster i kept my hands in my pockets pushed the door shut with a little nudge of my boot and just as it closed said so returning to the scene of the crime i knew wed catch you if i just waited the mans reaction would have had me rolling in laughter on any other day he jerked slammed his head against the bottom of the bed yelped drew himself back from the bed turned to look at me and all but leapt back over the bed in surprise when he saw me i revised my opinion of his lookshis mouth was too pinched his eyes too small and too close together giving him the intent predatory look of a ferret i narrowed my eyes and stalked toward him one slow pace at a time just couldnt stay away could you no he said oh god you dont understand im a photographer see see he fumbled with the case at his side and produced a camera from it taking pictures for the papers thats what im doing here just trying to get a good look around save it i told him we both know you arent here to take pictures you were looking for this and i pulled the film canister out of my pocket held it up and showed it to him his babbling stopped and he stood stockstill staring at me then at the canister he licked his lips and started trying to say something who are you i asked i kept my voice gruff demanding i tried to think of what murphy would sound like if i was downtown with her right now waiting for her to ask me questions uh wise donny wise he swallowed staring at me am i in some kind of trouble i narrowed my eyes at him and sneered well see about that do you have identification sure yeah let me see it i speared him with a glance and added slowly he goggled at me and reached for his hip pocket with exaggerated slowness with one hand he drew out his wallet and flipped it open to his drivers license i stalked toward him snatched it and studied it his license and picture agreed with the name hed given me well mr wise i began this is an ongoing investigation so long as you give me your cooperation i dont think that we i looked up to see him peering at my name badge and my voice trailed off he jerked his wallet back and accused youre not a cop i tilted my head back at an arrogant angle okay maybe not but i work with the cops and ive got your film he cursed again and started stuffing his camera back into his bag clearly meaning to leave no you got nothing nothing that connects any of this to me im out of here i watched him start past me toward the door dont be so hasty mr wise i really think you and i have things to discuss like a dropped film canister underneath the deck of a house in lake providence last wednesday night he flicked a quick glance up at me i have nothing to say to you he mumbled whoever the hell you are he reached for the door and started to open it i gestured curtly to my staff in the corner and hissed in my best dramatic voice vento servitas jerking my hand at the doorway my staff driven by tightly controlled channels of air moving in response to my evocation leapt across the room and slammed the door shut in front of donny wises nose he went stiff as a board he turned to face me his eyes wide my god youre one of them dont kill me he said oh god youve got the pictures i dont know anything nothing im no danger to you he tried to keep his voice calm but it was shaking i saw him tilt his eyes at the glass sliding doors to the little patio as though calculating his chances of making it there before i could stop him relax mr wise i told him im not here to hurt you im after the man who killed linda help me tell me what you know ill take care of the rest he let out a harsh little laugh and eased a half step toward the glass windows and get myself killed like linda like those other people no way no mr wise tell me what you know ill put a stop to the killings ill bring lindas murderer to justice i tried to keep my voice soothing even fighting against the frustration i felt hell id wanted to rattle him but i hadnt meant to scare him so badly that he wanted to jump through a plateglass sliding door i want these people stopped just as badly as you do why he demanded i saw a little contempt in his eyes now what was she to you were you sleeping with her too i shook my head no no shes just one more dead person who shouldnt be youre not a cop why risk your ass to do this why go up against these people havent you seen what they can do i shrugged who else is going to he didnt answer me so i held up the film canister what are these pictures mr wise what is on this film that was worth killing linda randall for donny wise rubbed his palms over his thighs his ponytail twitched as he looked about the room ill make you a deal give me the film and ill tell you what i know i shook my head i might need whats on here whats there isnt any good to you if you dont know what youre looking at he pointed out i dont know you from adam i dont want any trouble all i want is to get my ass out of this alive and in one piece i stared at him for a moment if i traded him id lose the film and whatever was on it if i didnt and if he was telling me the truth the film wouldnt do me any good the trail had led me here to him if i didnt dig up a lead to somewhere else i was dead so i snapped my fingers letting my staff rattle to the floor then i tossed him the film underhand he dropped it and stooped to recover it studying me warily after i get out of here he said were quits ive never seen you before i nodded fine lets have it donny swallowed and ran a hand back over his hair giving his ponytail a nervous little tug at the end of the motion i knew linda from around id taken some pictures of her for a portfolio i do shoots for some of the girls around town they want to make it into magazines most of them adult magazines i asked no he snapped nervous still uncle abners magazine for children of course adult mags nothing really classy but you can make some good money even if youre not hugh hefners type so on wednesday linda comes to me she says shes got a deal for me i shoot some pictures for her and give her the film and i getand shes real nice to me all i have to do is show up where she says shoot a roll through the windows and go deliver to her the next day so i did it and now shes dead out in lake providence i said yeah what did you see there i asked donny wise shook his head his eyes drawn past me to the bed again linda some other people no one i knew they were having some kind of party all candles and stuff it was storming like hell a lot of thunder and lightning so i couldnt really hear them i worried for a while about someone looking up and seeing me in the lightning but i guess they were too busy they were having sex i said no he snapped they was playing canasta yeah sex the real thing not fake stuff on a set the real thing dont look as good linda some other woman three men i shot my roll and got out i grinned but he didnt seem to have noticed the double entendre you just dont get quality lowlife often enough anymore can you describe any of these other people he shook his head i wasnt looking but they wasnt being too particular if you take my meaning turned my stomach did you know what linda wanted with the pictures he looked at me and then snickered as though i were extremely simple jesus buddy what do you think someone wants with pictures like that she wanted to get leverage on somebody hell it wouldnt hurt her reputation any if pictures of her in the middle of an orgy got out but it might have some of the people with her what kind of simp wannabe cop are you i ignored the question what are you going to do with the film donny he shrugged trash it probably i saw his eyes flick from side to side and i knew that he was lying to me hed keep the film find out who was in the pictures and if he thought he could get away with it hed try to weasel whatever profit he could out of it he seemed the type and i trusted my instincts allow me i said and snapped my fingers fuego the canisters grey lid flew off in a little whoosh of flame and donny wise yelped drawing his hand back sharply the red canister burst into flame on its way to the ground and landed there in a crumpled smoking lump he stared at the film then up at me his mouth gaping i hope i dont find out youve lied to me donny i told him he went white as a sheet assured me that he hadnt then turned and fled out of the apartment knocking loose two bits of police tape on the way out he didnt close the door behind him i let him go i believed him he didnt seem bright enough to make up a story on the fly as rattled as hed been i felt a ferocious surge of triumph of anger and of the desire to find this person whoever it was who was taking the raw forces of life and creation and turning them to the ends of destruction and to put him in the trash with the rest of the garbage whoever he was murdering with magic and killing people by degrees with the threeeye drug he was someone i wanted to put down my brain lurched into gear now that there was something to work with some other possibility for tomorrow morning than me dying in a variety of gruesome ways linda randall had been planning on blackmailing someone i took a staggering mental leap and figured it was victor or someone out at his house during the party but why i didnt have any pictures now only the information id gotten from donny wise i couldnt afford to wait around i had to pursue the lead hed given me if i was to get to the bottom of this and find out who had killed linda how had i managed to get into all of this trouble in only a few days and how in the world had i managed to stumble across what appeared to be a complex and treacherous little plot by chance out at the house in lake providence on a separate investigation entirely simple answerit hadnt been an accident it had all been by design i had been directed there someone had wanted me out at the lake house had wanted me to get involved and to find out what was going on out there someone who was nervous as hell around wizards who refused to give out her name who had carefully dropped phrases that would make me believe her ignorance who had to rush out quickly from her appointment and who was willing to let five hundred dollars go just to get me off the phone a few seconds faster someone had drawn me out and forced me into the open where i had attracted all sorts of hostile attention that was the key i gathered up my staff and rod and stalked out the door it was time to talk to monica sells chapter twenty the cabby dropped me off a block away from monica sellss house in the suburbs i was running out of time out of murphys loan and out of patience so i didnt waste any daylight in walking down the street toward her place it was a cute little house two stories a couple of young trees in the front yard just now starting to rival the house for height there was a minivan in the driveway and a basketball goal well used the lawn was grown rather long but all the recent rains left a good excuse for that the street was a quiet one and it took me a moment to realize that most of the houses on it were not occupied for sale signs stood in many of the yards sparse curtains draped over empty gaping windows like cobwebs there wasnt a lot of birdsong for a street with so many trees and i couldnt hear any dogs barking as i walked along the sidewalk overhead clouds were thickening building up for another thunderstorm taken all together it had the feel of someplace blighted a place where a black wizard had set up shop i swung up through the sells yard and to the front door i rang the bell and waited there was no answer i knocked i leaned on the doorbell still no answer i tightened my jaw and looked around i didnt see anyone so i turned back to the door preparing to use a spell to open it instead the door swung open maybe six inches monica sells stood inside peering out at me with her green eyes she was dressed in jeans a plain flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up and her hair was covered by a bandana she wore no makeup she looked both older and more appealing that wayi think maybe because it was a more natural look for her something that was closer to the sort of person she really was rather than the nicer clothes and jewelry shed worn when she visited my office her face went pale her lips bloodless i dont have anything to say to you mr dresden she said go away i cant do that i said she started to swing the door shut but i jammed the end of my staff into the doorway keeping it from closing ill call the police she said voice strained she leaned against the door trying to keep me from coming in do it i growled and then i played a hunch and ill tell them about you and your husband i was taking a shot in the dark but what the hell she didnt know that i didnt know what the hell was going on my instincts paid off i heard her suck in a breath and felt her resistance on the door sag a little i put my shoulder to the door leaned into it hard and she stepped back from me in surprise i dont think shed expected me to physically force my way into her house hell i hadnt expected me to do that i hadnt realized how angry i was until i saw the look of panic on her face when she looked up at me i dont know what i looked like but it must not have been friendly i stopped i closed my eyes i took a deep breath and tried to get a handle on my anger it wouldnt profit me anything to lose control that was when she went for the stunner i heard her move opened my eyes in time to see her snatch a blackplastic case the size of a cellular phone from the piano and lunge toward me her face was pale frightened blue lightning danced between the two tines of the stunner as she shoved it at my stomach i swept my staff upright from right to left and the buzzing device went past me along with her lunge striking the doorframe behind me i slipped past her into the living room turning to face her as she recovered and turned around i wont let you hurt them she snarled not you not anyone ill kill you before i let you touch them wizard and then she was coming at me again fury replacing the terror in her eyes a grim determination to succeed that made me think of murphy for a second for the first time she was looking me in the face for the first time she forgot to keep her eyes averted from mine and in that second i saw inside of her things seemed to slow down for a moment i had time to see the color of her eyes the structure of her face to recognize where i had seen them before why she had looked familiar to me i had time to see behind her eyes the fear and the love that motivated every move she made every step she took i saw what had moved her to come to me why she was afraid i saw her grief and i saw her pain and the pieces all fell into place knowing the emotions that drove her the terrible love that she was showing even now it all seemed perfectly obvious and i felt stupid for not figuring it out days ago stop i said or tried to say before she thrust the stunner at my chest i dropped staff and rod alike in a clatter of falling wood and caught her wrist in both of my hands she pushed the stunner up at my face and i let her do it it got to within about three inches of me the light bright in my eyes then i drew in a breath and puffed it out onto the stunner along with an effort of will there was a spark a little puff of smoke and then it went dead in her hands like every other electronic gizmo seemed to do whenever i came around hell i was surprised it had taken as long as it did to stop working and even if it hadnt it wasnt any trouble for me to hex it into uselessness i continued holding her wrist but the driving tension behind her arm had eased away to nothing she was staring at my face her eyes wide with shock from the meeting of our gazes she started shaking and dropped the useless stunner from limp fingers it clattered to the floor i let go of her and she just stared at me i was shaking too a soulgaze is never something pleasant or simple god sometimes i hated that i had to live with that i hadnt wanted to know that she had been abused as a child that shed married a man who provided her with more of the same as an adult that the only hope or light that she saw in her life was in her two children there hadnt been time to see all of her reasons all of her logic i still didnt know why she had drawn me into this entire businessbut i knew that it was ultimately because she loved her two kids and that was all i really needed that and one other connection the nagging resemblance to someone that i had noticed in her at my office the rest fell into place from there it took monica sells a moment to recover herself she did it with remarkable speed as though she were a woman used to drawing on a mask again after having it knocked off i im sorry mr dresden she lifted her chin and regarded me with a fragile wounded pride what do you want here a couple of things i told her i stooped down to recover my staff my rod i want my lock of hair back i want to know why you came to me last thursday why you dragged me into this mess and i want to know who killed tommy tomm and jennifer stanton and linda randall monicas eyes grew even duller and her face paled lindas dead last night i told her and someones planning on taking me out the same way the next chance they get outside in the far distance thunder rumbled another storm was in the works slowly building when it got to town i was a dead man it was as simple as that i looked back to monica sells and it was all over her faceshe knew about the storm just as well as i did she knew about it and there was a sort of sad and weary frustration in her eyes you have to go mr dresden she said you cant be here when youve got to go before its too late i stepped toward her youre the only chance i have monica i asked you once before to trust me youve got to do it again youve got to know that im not here to hurt you or your a door opened in the hallway behind monica a girl on the gawky end of preadolescence with hair the color of her mothers leaned out into the hallway mom she said in a quavering voice mom are you okay do you want me to call the police a boy perhaps a year or two younger than his sister poked his head out too he was carrying a wellused basketball in his hands turning it in nervous little gestures i looked back to monica her eyes were closed there were tears coming trailing down her cheeks it took her a moment but she drew in a breath and spoke to the girl in a clear calm voice without turning around im fine she told them jenny billy get back into the room and lock the door i mean it but mom the boy began now monica said her voice was strained jenny put a hand on her brothers shoulder cmon billy she looked at me for just a moment her eyes were too old and too knowing for a child her age cmon the two vanished back into the room closed the door and locked it behind them monica waited until they were gone and then broke down into more tears please please mr dresden you have to go if youre here when the storm comes if he knows she buried her face in her hands and made a quiet croaking sound i stepped closer to her i had to have her help no matter how much pain she was in no matter what kind of agony she was going through i had to have her help and i thought i knew the names to invoke to get it i can be such a bastard sometimes monica please im up against a wall im out of options everything i have leads here to you and i dont have time to wait i need your help before i wind up just like jennifer and tommy and linda i sought her eyes and she looked up at me without turning her gaze away please help me i watched her eyes saw the fear and the grief and the weariness there i saw her look at me as i leaned on her and demanded more out of her than she could afford to give all right she whispered she turned away and walked toward the kitchen all right ill tell you what i know wizard but theres nothing i can do to help you she paused at the doorway and looked back at me her words fell with the weight of conviction simple truth theres nothing anyone can do now chapter twentyone monica sells had a cheerful brightly colored kitchen she collected painted cartoon cows and they ranged over the walls and cabinet doors of the room in a cheerful bovine sort of indolence the refrigerator was covered with crayon drawings and report cards there was a row of colored glass bottles on the windowsill i could hear wind chimes outside restlessly stirred by a cool rising wind a big friendly cow clock on the wall swung its tail back and forth tick tick tick monica sat down at the kitchen table she drew up her legs beneath her and seemed to relax by a few degrees her kitchen i sensed was her sanctuary the place where she retreated when she was upset it was lovingly maintained sparkling clean i let her relax for as long as i could which wasnt long i could almost feel the air building up to greater tension the storm brewing in the distance i couldnt afford to play with kid gloves i was just about to open my mouth to start pushing when she said ask questions wizard ill answer them i wouldnt even know where to start myself she didnt look at me she didnt look at anything all right i said i leaned against the kitchen counter you know jennifer stanton dont you youre related to her her expression didnt change we have our mothers eyes she confirmed my little sister was always the rebel she ran away to become an actress but became a whore instead it suited her in her own way i always wanted her to stop but i dont think she wanted to im not sure she knew how have the police contacted you yet about her death no they called my parents down in st louis they havent realized yet that i live in town someone will notice soon im sure i frowned why didnt you go to them why did you come to me she looked over at me the police cant help me mr dresden do you think they would believe me theyd look at me like i was some kind of lunatic if i went to them babbling about magic spells and rituals she grimaced maybe theyd be right sometimes i wonder if im going crazy so you came to me i said why didnt you just tell me the truth how could i she asked how could i walk into the office of someone i didnt even know and tell him she swallowed and squeezed her eyes shut over more tears and tell me what monica i asked i kept my voice soft who killed your sister wind chimes tinkled outside the friendly cow clock went tick tick tick monica sells drew in a long shuddering breath and closed her eyes i saw her gathering up the frayed threads of her courage knotting them up as tightly as she could i knew the answer already but i needed to hear it from her i needed to be sure i tried to tell myself that it would be good for her to face such a thing just to say it out loud i wasnt sure i bought thatlike i said im not a very good liar monica squeezed her hands into tight fists and said god help me god help me it was my husband mr dresden it was victor i thought she would dissolve into tears but instead she just hunched tighter into her little defensive ball as though she expected someone to start hitting her thats why you wanted me to find him i heard myself say thats why you sent me out to the lake house to look for him you knew he was there you knew that if you sent me out there he would see me my voice was quiet not quite angry but the words pounded around monica sells like sledgehammers throwing up chips of concrete she flinched from each of them i had to she moaned god mr dresden you dont know what it was like and he was getting worse he didnt start as a bad man really but he kept getting worse and worse and i was afraid for your kids i said she nodded and rested her forehead on her knees and then the words started spilling out of her slowly at first and then in a greater and greater rush as if she couldnt hold back the immense weight of them any longer i listened i owed it to her for walking all over her feelings for forcing her to talk to me he was never a bad man mr dresden you have to understand he worked hard he worked so hard for us to give us something better i think it was because he knew that my parents had been so wealthy he wanted to give me just as much as they could have and he couldnt it would make him so frustrated so angry sometimes he would lose his temper but it wasnt always so bad and he could be so kind sometimes too i thought that maybe the children would help him to stabilize it was when billy was about four that victor found the magic i dont know where but he started getting obsessed with it he brought home books and books strange things he put a lock on the door to the attic and after dinner hed vanish up there some nights he wouldnt come to bed some nights i thought i could hear things up there voices or things that werent voices she shuddered he started to get worse hed get angry and things would happen little things the drapes would catch on fire at one edge or things would fly off the walls and break she turned her haunted gaze toward her cute tacky cows for a moment as though assuring herself that they were still there hed scream at us for no reason or burst out laughing for no reason he he saw things things i couldnt see i thought he was going crazy but you never confronted him i said quietly she shook her head no god forgive me i couldnt i had gotten used to being quiet mr dresden to not making a fuss she took a deep breath and continued then one night he came to me and woke me up he made me drink something he told me that it would make me see make me understand him that if i drank i would see the things he saw that he wanted me to understand him that i was his wife this time she did start crying tears that coursed silently down her cheeks the corners of her mouth something else clicked solidly into place where id already thought it would go the threeeye i said she nodded and i saw things mr dresden i saw him her face screwed up and i thought she was going to vomit i could sympathize to have the third sight suddenly opened to you like that not knowing what it was what was happening to you to look on the man you had wed who had given you children and to see him for what he truly was obsessed with power consumed by greedit had to have been hell and it would remain with her always she would never find the memory fading never find the comfort and solace of years putting a comfortable padding between her and the image of her husband as a monster she continued speaking in a low hurried rush i wanted more even when it was over even though it was horrible i wanted more i tried not to let it show but he could tell he looked into my eyes and he knew mr dresden like you did just now and he started to laugh like hed just won the lottery he kissed me he was so happy and it made me sick he started making more of the drug but he could never make enough it drove him berserk furious and then he started to realize that when he was angry he could do more hed look for excuses to be angry hed drive himself into rages but it still wasnt enough she swallowed thats when when i thought of frightened pizza drivers and faerie commentary on human sporting thats when he realized that he could touch other peoples emotions too i said use them to help power his magic she nodded and curled tighter in on herself it was only me at first hed frighten me and afterward i would be so exhausted then he found out that for what he was doing lust worked better so he started looking around for backers investors he called them she looked up at me her eyes pleading please mr dresden you have to understand it wasnt always so bad there were moments that i could almost see him again that i thought he was going to come back to us i tried to look on her with compassion but i wasnt sure i felt anything but fury that someone anyone should treat his family that wayor anyone else for that matter my feelings must have showed on my face because monica quickly averted her eyes and huddled down in fear she spoke in a hurried voice as though to put off my rage in the voice of a woman who has put off rage with desperate words more than once he found the beckitts they had money and he told them that if they would help him he would help them get their vengeance on johnny marcone for their daughter they put their trust in him they gave him all the money he needed i thought of the beckitts and their lean hungry faces i thought of mrs beckitts dead eyes and he started the rituals the ceremony he said he needed our lust her eyes shifted left and right and the sickened look on her face grew deeper it wasnt so bad he would close the circle and all of a sudden nothing mattered nothing but flesh i could lose myself for a while it was almost like an escape she rubbed her hand on the leg of her jeans as if trying to wipe something foul off of it but it wasnt enough thats when he started talking to jennifer he knew what she did that she would know the right kind of people like her like linda linda introduced him to marcones man i dont know his name but victor promised him something that was enough to bring him into the circle i didnt have to go all the time then either jenny or i would stay with the children victor made the drug we started to make money things got better for a little while as long as i didnt think too much monica took a deep breath thats when victor started getting darker he called demons i saw them and he said he needed more power he was hungry for it it was horrible like watching a starving animal forever pacing and i saw him start start looking at the children mr dresden it made me afraid the way he looked at them sometimes i knew this time she buckled and doubled toward the floor with a groan she shuddered and wept out of control oh god my babies my babies i wanted to go over to her to offer her my hand to hold to put an arm over her shoulders and to tell her that it would be all right but i knew her now i had looked inside it would make her scream god harry i thought havent you tortured this poor woman enough i rummaged in cabinets until i found a glass i ran cold water from the sink poured it into the glass then went over and put it down by her she straightened in her chair and took the glass between shaking hands she took a sip and spilled a little onto her chin im sorry i said it was all i could think of to say if she heard me it didnt show she sipped water then continued as if desperate to finish to get the taste of the words out of her mouth i wanted to leave him i knew hed be furious but i couldnt let the children stay close to him i tried to talk to jenny about it and she took matters into her own hands my little sister trying to protect me she went to victor and told him that if he didnt let me leave shed go to the police and to johnny marcone shed tell them all about him and he he he killed her i said hell victor hadnt needed any of jennifer stantons hair to kill her any kind of sample of bodily fluids would have worked with the ceremonies of lust that hed been holding hed have had ample opportunity to collect from poor jennifer stanton maybe hed even had her bring him a sample from tommy tomm or maybe jennifer and tommy tomm had just been too close as they were making love for the spell to affect just one of them when he killed them he killed her monica confirmed her shoulders slumped with a sudden weariness thats when i came to you because i thought you might be able to see be able to do something before he hurt my babies before he killed someone else and now lindas dead too and soon you mr dresden you cant stop him no one can monica i said she shook her head and curled up in a miserable little ball go she said oh god please go mr dresden i dont want to see it when he kills you too my heart felt like a lump of cold wax in my chest i wanted so badly to tell her that everything would be all right i wanted to dry her tears and tell her that there was still joy in the world that there was still light and happiness but i didnt think she would hear me where she was there was nothing but an endless hopeless darkness full of fear pain and defeat so i did the only thing i could i withdrew in silence and left her to her weeping perhaps it would help her start to heal to me it only sounded like pieces of glass falling from a shattered window as i walked toward the front door a little motion to the left caught my eye jenny sells stood in the hallway a silent wraith she regarded me with luminous green eyes like her mothers like the dead aunt whose namesake she was i stopped and faced her im not sure why youre the wizard she said quietly youre harry dresden i saw your picture in the newspaper once the arcane i nodded she studied my face for a long minute are you going to help my mom it was a simple question but how do you tell a child that things just arent that simple that some questions dont have simple answersor any answer at all i looked back into her tooknowing eyes and then quickly away i didnt want her to see what sort of person i was the things i had done she didnt need that im going to do everything i can to help your mom she nodded do you promise i promised her she thought that over for a moment studying me then she nodded my daddy used to be one of the good guys mr dresden but i dont think that he is anymore her face looked sad it was a sweet unaffected expression are you going to kill him another simple question i dont want to i told her but hes trying to kill me i might not have any choice she swallowed and lifted her chin i loved my aunt jenny she said her eyes brightened with tears momma wont say and billys too little to figure it out but i know what happened she turned with more grace and dignity than i could have managed and started to leave then said quietly i hope youre one of the good guys mr dresden we really need a good guy i hope youll be all right then she vanished down the hall on bare silent feet i left the house in the suburbs as quickly as i could my legs drove me down the oddly silent sidewalk and back to the corner where the cabby was waiting meter ticking away i got in the cab and told the cabby to drive me to the nearest pay phone then i closed my eyes and struggled to think it was hard through all the pain i felt maybe im stupid or something but i hate to see people like monica like little jenny hurting like that there shouldnt be pain like that in the world and every time i run into it it makes me furious furious and sad i didnt know if i wanted to scream or to cry i wanted to pound victor sellss face in and i wanted to crawl into bed and hide under the covers i wanted to give jenny sells a hug and to tell her that everything would be all right and i was still afraid all tight and burning in my gut victor sells of the shadows and demons was going to kill me as soon as the storm rolled in think harry i told myself think dammit the cabby gave me an odd look in the rearview mirror i stuffed down all the feelings all the fear all the anger into a tight little ball i didnt have time to let those feelings blind me now i needed clarity focus purpose i needed a plan murphy murphy might be able to help me i could tip her off about the lake house and send in the cavalry they might find a stockpile of threeeye there they could then arrest victor like any other dealer but there were too many holes in that plan what if victor wasnt keeping his stores at the lake house what if he eluded the police monica and her children would be in danger if he did not only that what if murphy didnt listen to me hell the judge might not issue a warrant to search private property on the word of a man who probably had a warrant out for his own arrest now not only that but the bureaucracy involved in working with the authorities in lake providence on a sunday no less would slow things down it might not happen in time to save me from having my heart torn out no i couldnt rely on the police if this was any other time if i was held in less suspicion by the white council i would report victor sells to them and let them handle the whole thing theyre not exactly soft on people using magic like victor used it to call up demons to kill to produce drugs he had probably broken every law of magic the white council would waste no time in sending someone like morgan to wipe victor out but i couldnt do that either i was already under suspicion thanks to morgans narrowminded blindness the council was already meeting at sunrise on monday some of the other members of the council might listen to me but they would be traveling now i had no way of reaching any of those who were sympathetic to me no way of asking for help there wasnt time in fact to try to round up any of my usual allies so i concluded it was up to me alone it was a sobering thought i had to confront victor sells as strong a practitioner as i had ever gone up against in his own place of powerthe lake house not only that but i had to do it without breaking any of the laws of magic i couldnt kill him with sorcerybut somehow i had to stop him odds seemed really good that i was going to get killed whether i tried to face him or not to hell with it then if i was going to go out it wasnt going to be while i was lying around moaning and bitching about how useless it all was if victor sells wanted to take out harry blackstone copperfield dresden he was going to have to shove his magic right down my throat this decision cheered me somewhat at least i knew what i was doing now where i was going what i needed was an edge i decided something to pull on victor something he wouldnt expect now that i knew who he was i understood the magic i had run into outside of my apartment a little bit better it had been potent deadly but not sophisticated not well controlled victor was powerful strong a natural magebut he wasnt practiced he didnt have any training if only i had something of his something like his own hair that i could use against him maybe i should have checked the bathroom at monicas but i had the feeling that he wouldnt have been that careless anyone who spends time thinking about how to use that sort of thing against people is going to be doubly paranoid that no one have the opportunity to use it against him and then it struck mei did have something of victors i had his scorpion talisman back in the drawer of my desk at the office it was one of his own devices something close and familiar i could use it to create a bond to him to sort of judo his own power back against him and beat him with it hands down no questions asked i might have a chance yet i wasnt finished not by a long shot the cabby pulled into a gas station and parked next to the pay phone i told him to wait for me a minute and got out fumbling a quarter from my pocket to make the call if it did turn out that i wouldnt live to see tomorrow i wanted to make damn sure that the hounds of hell would be growling at victor sellss heels i dialed murphys number down at the station it rang several times and finally someone answered the line was scratchy noisy and i could barely make out who it was murphys desk this is carmichael carmichael i said loudly into the phone its harry dresden i need to talk to murphy what carmichael said there was a squeal of static dammit the phones go to hell on me at the worst times i cant hear you murphy you want murphy who is this anderson is that you its harry dresden i shouted i need to talk to murphy eh carmichael grunted i cant hear you andy look murphys out she took that warrant down to harry dresdens office to take a look around she what i said harry dresdens office carmichael said she said shed be back soon look this connection is awful try to call back he hung up on me i fumbled for another quarter my hands shaking and dialed my own office number the last thing i needed was for murphy to go poking around in my office maybe impounding things if she stuck the scorpion in evidence i was done for id never be able to explain it to her in time and if she saw me facetoface she might be furious enough with me to just have me slapped into holding and left there overnight if that happened id be dead by morning my phone rang a couple of times then murphy answered the line was blissfully clear harry dresdens office murph i said thank god look i need to talk to you i could practically feel her anger too late for that now harry you should have come to talk to me this morning i heard her moving around she started opening drawers dammit murph i said frustrated i know who the killer is look youve got to keep out of that desk it could be dangerous i thought i had been going to tell her a lie but i realized as i said it that i was telling the truth i remembered seeing or thinking i had seen movement from the talisman when i had examined it before maybe i hadnt been imagining things dangerous murphy growled i heard her scattering pens out of the top drawer of my desk moving things around the talisman was in the drawer beneath ill tell you whats dangerous fucking with me is dangerous dresden im not playing some kind of game here and i cant trust what you say anymore murphy i said trying to keep my voice even youve got to trust me one more time stay out of my desk please there was silence for a moment i heard her draw in a breath and let it out through her mouth then murphy said her voice hard professional why dresden what are you hiding i heard her open the middle drawer there was a clicking sound and a startled oath from murphy the receiver clattered to the floor i heard gunshots shockingly loud whining ricochets and then a scream dammit i shouted at the phone murphy i slammed the phone down and sprinted back to the cab the cabby blinked at me hey buddy wheres the fire i slammed the door shut and gave him the address to my office then i thrust all of my remaining cash at him and said get me there five minutes ago the cabby blinked at the money shrugged and said crazies cabbies get all the crazies then he tore out into the street leaving a cloud of smoke behind us chapter twentytwo the building was locked on sunday i jammed my key in the lock twisted it hard to open it and jerked the keys out again i didnt bother with the elevator just hurtled up the stairs as quickly as i could five stories worth of stairs it took me less than a minute but i begrudged every second of it my lungs were burning and my mouth was dry as sand as i reached the fifth floor and sprinted down the hallway to my office the halls were quiet empty dim the only light came from the exit signs and from the overcast day outside shadows stretched and settled in the closed doorways the door to my office was ajar i could hear my ceiling fan squeaking on its mounting underneath the labored wheezing of my own breath the overhead light wasnt on but the reading light on my desk must have been because yellow light outlined the doorway and laid a swath of gold across the floor of the hall i stopped at the threshold my hands were shaking so much i could hardly hold my staff and rod murphy i called out murphy can you hear me my voice was hoarse breathless i closed my eyes and listened i thought i heard two things the first was a labored breath with a faint moan on the exhale murphy the second was a dry scuttling sound i could smell gunpowder on the air i clenched my jaw in sudden anger victor sellss little beastie whatever it was had hurt my friend like hell i was going to stand out here and give it the run of my office i shoved the door open with my staff and stalked into the office my blasting rod extended before me and words of power upon my lips directly in front of my office door is a table arranged with a series of pamphlets with titles like real witches dont float so good and magic in the twentyfirst century i had written some of them myself they were meant for the curious for people who just wanted to know about witches and magic i squatted for a moment blasting rod aimed beneath the table but saw nothing i rose again looking back and forth rod still ready to the right of the door is a wall lined with filing cabinets and a couple of easy chairs the cabinets were shut but something could have been hiding beneath one of the chairs i slid to my left checked behind the door to the office and pressed my shoulders to the wall keeping my eyes on the room my desk is in the back corner to the right as you come in the door diagonal from it its a corner office there are windows on either of the outside walls my shades were as usual drawn the overhead fan in the center of the room spun around with a tired little groan on every rotation i kept my eyes moving my senses alert i choked down my anger ferociously and made myself remain cautious whatever had happened to murphy i wouldnt do her any good by letting it happen to me too i moved slowly carefully my blasting rod held ready i could see murphys tennis shoes behind my desk she looked like she was curled on her side from the way her feet were angled but i couldnt see the rest of her i pushed forward striding to the center of the back wall keeping my blasting rod leveled like a gun at the floor behind the desk as it became visible murphy lay there curled on her side her golden hair in an artless sprawl about her head her eyes open and staring blindly she was dressed in jeans a buttondown shirt and a cubs satin jacket her left shoulder was stained with a blot of blood her gun lay next to her a couple of feet away my heart stepped up into my throat i heard her take a little breath and groan when she let it out murphy i said then louder murphy i saw her stir a fitful little motion that was in response to my voice easy easy i told her relax dont try to move im going to try to help you i knelt next to her very slowly watching the room all around i didnt see anything i set my staff aside and felt her throat her pulse was racing thready there was not enough blood for it to be a serious injury but i touched her shoulder even through the jacket i could feel the swelling harry murphy rasped is that you its me murph i told her setting my blasting rod aside and slowly reaching for the phone the middle drawer of my desk where the scorpion talisman had been was open and empty just hang on im going to call an ambulance to help you cant believe it you bastard murphy wheezed i felt her stir around a little you set me up i drew the phone down and dialed hush murph youve been poisoned you need help fast the operator came on and took my name and address i told her to send an ambulance prepared to treat someone for poisoning and she told me to stay on the line i didnt have time to stay on the line whatever had done this to murphy it was still around somewhere i had to get her out of there and then i had to recover victors talisman to be able to use it against him when i went out to the lake house murphy stirred again and then i felt something hard and cool flick around my wrist and clickerclack shut i blinked and looked down at her murphys jaw was set in a stubborn line as she clicked the other end of the handcuffs shut around her own wrist youre under arrest she wheezed you son of a bitch wait till i get you in an interrogation room you arent going anywhere i stared at her stunned murph i stammered my god you dont know what youre doing like hell she said her lip lifting in a ghost of its usual snarl she twisted her head around grimacing in pain and squinted at me you should have talked to me this morning got you now dresden she broke off in a panting gasp and added you jerk you stubborn bitch from hell i felt at a loss for a second then shook my head ive got to get you out of here before it comes back i said and i stooped forward to try to gather her up that was when the scorpion exploded toward me from the shadows beneath my desk a harsh burst of dry scuttling motion it wasnt a bug i could squash with my fingers anymore it was the size of a large terrier all brown and glinting and it was almost too fast to see coming i convulsed away from it and saw the flash of its tail saw its stinger whip forward and miss my eye by a hair breadth something cool and wet speckled my cheek and my skin started to burn venom my startled motion made my leg jerk and kicked my staff and rod away from me i rolled after the latter desperately murphys handcuffs brought me up short and both of us made sounds of discomfort as the steel bands cut at the base of our hands i stretched for the rod felt the smooth roundness of it on my fingertips and then there was another scuttling sound and the scorpion came at my back the rod squirted out from beneath my grasping fingers and rolled away out of reach i didnt have time for a spell but i grabbed at the middle drawer of my desk jerked it all the way out of its frame and barely managed to shove it between the scorpion and myself there was a hiss of air and a smacking sound of breaking wood the scorpions stinger plunged through the bottom of the desk drawer and stuck fast a crabclaw pincer gouged a hole through my sweatpants and into my leg i screamed and hurled the drawer away the scorpion its tail still stuck went with it and they both landed in a heap a few feet away wont do you any good dresden murphy moaned incoherently she must have been too far gone from the poison to understand what was going on ive got you stop fighting it get some answers from you now sometimes murph i panted you make things just a little harder than they need to be anyone ever tell you that i bent down to her and slipped my cuffed wrist beneath her arm and around her back drawing her own arm back with me my right arm and her left bound by the handcuff my exhusbands she moaned i strained and lifted us both up off the ground then started hobbling toward the door i could feel the blood on my leg the pain where the scorpion had ripped it hot and hateful whats happening confusion and fear trembled in murphys voice harry i cant see shit the poison was getting to her the poison of the common brown scorpion found all over most of the united states isnt much more venomous than the sting of a bumblebee of course most bumblebees arent the size of the family dog either and murphy wasnt a big person if a lot of poison had been introduced into her system the odds were against her she needed medical attention and she needed it immediately if my hands had been free i would have taken up my staff and rod and done battle but i didnt like my odds tied to murphyeven if i could keep the thing off of me it might land on her sting her again and put an end to her i was at a bad angle to search for her keys and i didnt have time to go down the ring trying them on the handcuffs one by one any magic that i could work fast enough to shatter the cuffs in time would probably kill me with flying shrapnel and there wasnt time to work out a gentler escape spell dammit dad i thought i wish youd lived long enough to show me how to slip out of a pair of handcuffs harry murphy repeated her voice thready whats happening i cant see i saved my breath and lugged murphy toward the door without answering her behind me there was a furious scraping and clicking i looked back over my shoulder the scorpions stinger was stuck fast in the drawer but the thing was rapidly ripping the wood to shreds with its pincers and legs i gulped turned and hobbled out of my office and down the hall with murphy i managed to swing the door to my office shut with one foot murphys legs did little to support her and the difference in our heights made the trip awkward as hell i was straining to keep her upright and moving i reached the end of the hall the door to the stairway on my right the elevator on my left i stopped for a moment panting trying not to let the sounds of splintering wood down the hall rattle my judgment murphy sagged against me speechless now and if she was breathing i couldnt tell there was no way i was going to be able to carry her down the stairs neither one of us had enough left to manage that the ambulance would be arriving in minutes and if i didnt have murphy down there when it arrived i might as well just leave her on the floor to die i grimaced i hated elevators but i pushed the button and waited round lights over the elevator doors began counting up to five down the hall from me the splintering sounds stopped and something crashed into my office door rattling it on its frame hells bells harry i said aloud i looked up at the lights two a pause approximately ten centuries long three hurry up i snarled and jabbed the button a hundred more times then i remembered the bracelet of shields around my left wrist i tried to focus on it but couldnt with it twisted awkwardly beneath murphy supporting her so i laid her down as gently and quickly as i could then lifted my left hand and focused on the bracelet the lower third of my office door exploded outward and the brown gleaming form of the scorpion bounded across the hallway and into the wall it was bigger now the damn thing was growing it bounced off of the wall with a scrabbling horrible agility oriented on me and hurtled down the hall toward me as fast as a man can run its legs clicking and scuttling furiously over the floor it leapt at me claws extended stinger flashing i focused my will on the defensive shield the bracelet helped me form and maintain struggling to get it together before the scorpion hit me i did it barely the invisible shield of air met the scorpion a handsbreadth from my body and sent it rebounding back onto its back there it struggled for a second awkward and flailing behind me the elevator dinged and the doors swooped graciously open without time to be delicate i grabbed murphys wrist and hauled her into the elevator with me jabbing at the button for the lobby in the hall the scorpion thrashed its tail and righted itself oriented on me again with an uncanny intelligence and flew toward me there wasnt time to get my shield together again i screamed the elevator doors swooped shut there was a sharp thud and the car rattled as the scorpion smashed into them the car started down and i tried to regain my breath what the hell was that thing it wasnt just an insect it was too fast too damn smart for that it had ambushed me waiting until i had set my weapons aside to come after me it had to be something else some kind of power construct built small but designed to draw in energy to get bigger and stronger an arthropod version of frankensteins monster it wasnt really alive just a golem a robot a programmed thing with a mission victor must have figured out where his talisman had gotten to and set a spell on it to attack anyone it came in contact with the crazy bastard murphy had stumbled right into it it was still growing getting faster and stronger and more vicious getting murphy out of danger wasnt enough i had to find a way to deal with the scorpion i didnt want to but i was the only one on the block who could there was too much potential danger involved what if it didnt stop growing i had to kill it before it got out of control the lights on the elevator panel kept counting down four to three to two and then the elevator shuddered and ground to a stop the lights flickered and went out oh crap i said not now not now elevators hate me i jabbed at the buttons but nothing happened and a second later there was a cough of smoke and the lights behind the buttons went out too leaving me in darkness the emergency lighting came on for just a second but then there was the pop of a burning filament and it went away too murphy and i were left huddling in the darkness on the floor overhead outside in the elevator shaft there was the sound of shrieking metal i looked up at the invisible roof of the elevator car in the darkness you have got to be kidding me i muttered then there was a rattling bang and something the weight of a small gorilla landed on the roof of the elevator there was a seconds silence and then something started a deafening tearing at the roof you have got to be kidding me i shouted but the scorpion wasnt it was wrenching back the roof of the elevator rattling the bolts and supports making it groan dust rattled down in the darkness unseen grit for my unseeing eyes we were sardines in a can waiting to be torn up and eaten i got the feeling that if the thing stung me now the poison would be redundanti would bleed to death before it became an issue think harry i shouted at myself think think think i was stuck in a frozen elevator handcuffed to my unconscious friend who was dying of poison while a magical scorpion the size of some french cars tried to tear its way into me and rip me apart i didnt have my blasting rod or my staff the other gizmos id brought with me to the varsity were drained and useless and my shield bracelet would only prolong the inevitable a long strip of metal ripped away in the roof letting in a strip of dim light and i looked up at the scorpions underbelly saw it wedge a claw into the breach and start to tear it open wider i should have smashed it when it was just a bug i should have taken off my shoe and smashed it right there on my desk my heart leapt into my throat as the thing tilted up drove an exploratory pincer down into the upper third of the elevator then started tearing the hole even larger i gritted my teeth and started drawing in every ounce of power that i had i knew it was useless i could direct a firestorm up at the thing but it would slag the metal it was on and that would come raining back down on us and kill us make the elevator shaft too hot for us to survive but i wasnt just going to let the thing have me either by god maybe if i did it just right i could catch it as it leapt minimize the damage that i did to the surrounding scenery that was the problem with not being too great at evocation plenty of speed plenty of power not much refinement thats what the staff did and the blasting rodthey were designed to help me focus my power give me pinpoint control without them i might as well have been a suicide soldier carrying a dozen grenades strapped to his belt and ready to jerk out the pin and then it occurred to me i was thinking in the wrong direction i swung my eyes down from the ceiling to the elevators floor pressed my palms against it bits of something rained down on my head and shoulders and the clicking and scuttling of the scorpion got louder i took all the power id drawn in and focused it beneath my palms there was airspace beneath the elevator in the elevator shaft and that was what i reached forair instead of fire this was a simple spell one id done hundreds of times i told myself it wasnt any different from calling my staff to my hand just a little bigger vento servitas i shouted pouring every bit of strength every ounce of anger every shred of fear i had into the spell and beneath the elevator the winds rose up at my call a solid column of air that caught the bottom of the elevator like a giants palm and hurled it upward through the darkness of the elevator shaft the brakes squealed threw off sparks and fell to pieces that dropped through the hole the scorpion had torn to land next to me the force of it pressed me down to the floor with a groan there was a long and rising whine as the car accelerated up the elevator shaft i hadnt meant for there to be quite that much wind i thought and prayed that i hadnt just killed me and murphy both the elevator hurtled up and up and up and i could feel my face sagging down with the speed of it my office building is twelve stories high wed started at the second floor so assuming an average of nine feet per story it was almost a hundred feet to the buildings roof the car shot up it in less than a half dozen of my frantic heartbeats slammed past the blocks at the top of the line and hammered into the roof of the shaft like the bell on the strongmans sledgehammer game at the amusement park the impact crushed the scorpion into the concrete with a series of sharp popping sounds as chitinous plates cracked and splintered flattening it into a shapeless brown splotch colorless goo the ectoplasm of magically created mass spattered out between the crushed plates and hide and down into the car at the same time murphy and i were hurled up meeting the goo halfway i kept murphy in the shelter of my body trying to stay between her and the roof and my back hit it hard enough to make me see stars we tumbled loosely back down to the elevators floor in a sprawl of limbs and murphy groaned beneath me when i landed on her i lay still for a moment stunned the scorpion was dead id killed it crushed it between the elevator and the roof of the shaft and drenched myself and murphy in ichor doing it id saved our lives from the murderous device against the odds but i just couldnt shake the nagging impression that i was forgetting something there was a little groan from the elevator and then it shuddered and started sliding back down the shaft no longer supported by the powerful but shortlived pillar of wind that had driven it up there we were falling back down the way we had come and i had the feeling that we werent going to have a much better time of it at the bottom than the scorpion had at the top now was the time for the bracelet and i didnt waste a heartbeat grabbing murphy close to me and bringing the shield into being around us i only had a couple of seconds to focus to thinki couldnt make the globe around us too brittle too strong or wed just smash ourselves against the inside of it in the same way we would if we just rode the elevator down there had to be some give to it some flexibility to distribute the tremendous force of the abrupt stop at the first floor it was dark and there wasnt much time murphy and i rose up to the center of the space of the elevator while i pushed the shield out all around us filled up the space with layer after layer of flexible shielding semicohesive molecules of air patterns of force meant to spread the impact around there was a sense of pressure all around me as though i had been abruptly stuffed in styrofoam packing peanuts we fell faster and faster i sensed the bottom of the shaft coming there was an enormous sound and i held on to the shield with all of my might when i opened my eyes again i was sitting on the floor of the shattered devastated elevator holding a sagging unconscious murphy the elevator doors gave a warped gasping little ding then shuddered open a pair of emts with emergency kits in hand stood staring at the elevator at murphy and me their jaws hanging open to their knees dust billowed everywhere i was alive i blinked at that somewhat stunned i was alive i looked down at myself at my arms and legs and they were all there then i let my head fall back and howled out a defiant laugh a great gawping whoop of primal joy take that victor shadowman i shouted hah hah give me your best shot you murderous bastard im going to take my staff and shove it down your throat i was still laughing when the emts gathered me up and helped me and murphy toward the ambulance too stunned to ask any questions i saw them both give me wary looks though and then trade a glance with one another that said they were going to sedate me with something as soon as they got the chance the champion i howled still on an adrenaline rush the size of the colorado river as they helped me out toward the ambulance i thrust my fist into the air scarcely noting or caring that my bracelet of silver shields had turned into a blackened ring of curled and wilted links burned to uselessness by the energies i had forced through it i am the man shadowman youd better put your head between your legs and kiss your the emts helped me outside into the rain the wet slaps of raindrops on my face shut me up made me cold sober faster than anything else in the world could have done i was suddenly acutely aware of the handcuffs around my wrist still of the fact that i did not have victors talisman to use to turn his own power against him victor was still out there out at his lake house he still had a hank of my hair and he was still planning on ripping my heart out as soon as he possibly could when the storm gave him the strength he needed i was alive and murphy was alive but my elation was premature i didnt have anything to be celebrating yet i lifted my face to the sky thunder growled near at hand lightning danced overhead somewhere in the clouds casting odd light and spectral shadows through the roiling overcast the storm had arrived chapter twentythree raindrops pelted down around me the big splashy kind you only really see in the spring the air grew thicker hotter even with the rain falling i had to think fast use my head be calm hurry up murphys handcuffs still held me fastened to her wrist both of us were coated in dust that was stuck to the stinking colorless goo the ectoplasm that magic called from somewhere else whenever generic mass was called for in a spell the goo wouldnt last longwithin a few more minutes it would simply dissipate vanish into thin air return to wherever it had come from in the first place for the moment it was just a rather disgusting slimy annoyance but maybe one that i could put to use my own hands were too broad but murphy had delicate little ladys hands except where practice with her gun and her martial arts staff routines had left calluses if she had heard me thinking that and had been conscious she would have punched me in the mouth for being a chauvinist pig one of the emts was babbling into a handset while the other was on murphys other side supporting her along with me it was the only chance i was going to get i hunched over beside murphys diminutive form and tried to shroud what i was doing with the dark folds of my black duster i worked at her hand squeezing her limp slimy fingers together and trying to slip the steel loop of the handcuffs over her hand i took some skin off of her and she groaned a lot but i managed to get the cuffs off of her wrist just as the emt and i sat her down on the curb next to the ambulance the other emt ran to the back of the ambulance and swung it open rummaging around inside of it i could hear sirens both police cars and fire engines approaching from all directions nothings ever simple when im around shes been poisoned i told the emt the wound site is on her right upper arm or shoulder check for a massive dose of brown scorpion venom there should be some antivenin available somewhere shell need a tourniquet and buddy the emt said annoyed i know my job what the hell happened in there dont ask i said glancing back at the building the rain came down more heavily by slow degrees was i too late would i be dead before i could get to the lake house youre bleeding the emt told me without looking up from murphy i looked down at my leg but it didnt start hurting until i actually saw the injury and remembered i had it the scorpions claw had ripped me pretty good opening a sixinch tear in the leg of my sweats and a comparable gash in the leg beneath ragged and painful sit down the emt said ill take care of it in a second he wrinkled up his face what the hell is this stinking shit all over you i wiped rain from my hair slicking it back the other emt came running with a bottle of oxygen and a stretcher and they both bent over their work with murphy her face had discolored pale in parts too brightly red in others she was as limp as a wet dollar except for the occasional shudder or flinch quivers of her muscles that came from nowhere pained her for a moment and then apparently vanished it was my fault murphy was there it had been my decision to hold information away from her that had compelled her to take direct action to search my office if id just been more open more honest maybe she wouldnt be lying there right now dying i didnt want to walk away from her i didnt want to turn my back on her again and leave her behind me alone but i did before the support units arrived before police started asking questions before the emts began looking around for me and giving my description to police officers i turned on my heel and walked away i hated myself every step i hated leaving before i knew if murphy would survive the scorpions venomous sting i hated that my apartment and my office building had been trashed torn to pieces by demons and giant insects and my own clumsy power i hated to close my eyes and see the twisted mangled bodies of jennifer stanton and tommy tomm and linda randall i hated the sick twisting of fear in my guts when i imagined my own spare frame torn asunder by the same forces and most of all i hated the one responsible for all of it victor sells victor who was going to kill me as soon as this storm grew i could be dead in another five minutes no i couldnt i got a little more excited as i thought about the problem and looked up at the clouds the storm had come in from the west and was only now going over the city it wasnt moving fast it was a ponderous roller of a thunderstorm that would hammer at the area for hours the sellss lake house was to the east around the shore of lake michigan maybe thirty or forty miles away as the crow flies i could beat the storm to the lake house if i was fast enough if i could get a car i could get out to the lake house and challenge victor directly my rod and staff were gone dropped when the scorpion attacked i might have been able to call them down from my office with winds but as worked up as i was i might accidentally blow out the wall if i tried i didnt care to be crushed by hundreds of pounds of flying brick called to my outstretched hand by the strength of my magic and my fury my shield bracelet was gone too burned out by countering the tremendous force of the impact of the falling elevator i still had my mothers pentacle talisman at my throat the symbol of order of the controlled patterns of power that were at the heart of white magic i still had the advantage of years of formal training i still had the edge in experience in sorcerous confrontations i still had my faith but that was about all i was weary battered tired hurt and i had already pulled more magic out of the hat in one day than most wizards could in a week i was pushing the edge already in both mystic and physical terms but that just didnt matter to me the pain in my leg didnt make me weaker didnt discourage me didnt distract me as i walked it was like a fire in my thoughts my concentration burning ever more brightly more pure refining my anger my hate into something steelhard steelsharp i could feel it burning and reached for it eagerly shoving the pain inside to fuel my incandescent anger victor shadowman was going to pay for what hed done to all those people to me and to my friends dammit all i was not going out before id caught up to that man and shown him what a real wizard could do it didnt take me long to walk to mcanallys i came through the door in a storm of long legs rain wind flapping duster and angry eyes the place was packed people sitting at every one of the thirteen stools at the bar at every one of the thirteen tables leaning against most of the thirteen columns pipe smoke drifted through the air in a haze stirred by the languidly spinning blades of the ceiling fans the light was dim candles burning at the tables and in sconces on the walls plus a little grey storm light sliding in through the windows the light made the carvings on the columns vague and mysterious the shadows changing them in a subtle fashion all of macs chessboards were out on the tables but my sense of it was that those playing and watching the games were trying to keep their minds off of something that was disturbing them they all turned to stare at me as i came in the door and down the steps dripping rainwater and a little blood onto the floor the room got really quiet they were the havenots of the magical community hedge magi without enough innate talent motivation or strength to be true wizards innately gifted people who knew what they were and tried to make as little of it as possible dabblers herbalists holistic healers kitchen witches troubled youngsters just touching their abilities and wondering what to do about it older men and women younger people faces impassive or concerned or fearful they were all there i knew them all by sight if not by name i swept my gaze around the room every one of the people i looked at dropped their eyes but i didnt need to look deep to see what was happening word has a way of getting around between practitioners of magic and the arcane party line was working as it usually did word was out there was a mark on my head and they all knew it trouble was brewing between two wizards white and black and they had all come here to the shelter offered by mcanallys winding spaces and disruptive configurations of tables and columns theyd come here to shelter until it was over it didnt offer any shelter to me though mcanallys couldnt protect me against a sharply directed spell it was an umbrella not a bomb shelter i couldnt get away from what victor would do to me unless i cared to flee to the nevernever itself and for me that was more dangerous in some ways than staying at macs i stood there in the silence for a moment but said nothing these people were associates friends of a casual sort but i couldnt ask them to stand beside me whatever victor thought he was he had the power of a real wizard and he could crush any of these people like a boot could a cockroach they werent prepared to deal with this sort of thing mac i said finally my voice fell on the silence like a hammer on glass i need to borrow your car mac hadnt quit polishing the bar with a clean white cloth when i entered his spare frame gaunt in a white shirt and dark breeches he hadnt stopped when the room had grown still and he didnt stop when he pulled the keys out of his pocket and tossed them to me with one hand i caught them and said thanks mac ungh mac said he glanced up at me and then behind me i took the gesture for the warning it was and turned lightning flashed outside morgan stood silhouetted in the doorway at the top of the little flight of stairs his broad frame black against the grey sky he came down the stairs toward me and the thunder came in on his heels rain had made little difference in the lay of his dull brown and grey hair except for changing the texture of curl in his warriors ponytail i could see the hilt of the sword he wore beneath his black overcoat he had a muscular scarred hand on it harry dresden he said i finally figured it out using the storms to kill those people is insanely dangerous but you are just the sort of ambitious fool who would do it he set his jaw in a hard line have a seat he said gesturing at a table the people sitting at it cleared away fast were going to stay here both of us and im going to make sure that you dont have the chance to use this storm to hurt anyone else im going to make sure you dont get to try your cowardly tricks until the council decides your fate his grey eyes glittered with grim determination and certainty i stared at him i swallowed my anger the words i wanted to throw back at him the spell i wanted to use to blast him out of my way and spoke gently morgan i know who the killer is and hes after me next if i dont get to him and stop him im as good as dead his eyes hardened a fanatics gleam he spoke in two sharp little explosions of single syllables sit down he drew the sword out from its scabbard by a couple of inches i let my shoulders sag i turned toward the table i leaned against the back of one of the chairs for a moment taking a little weight off of my injured leg and drew the chair out from the table then i picked it up spun in a half circle with it to gather momentum and smashed it into the wardens stomach morgan tried to recoil but id caught him off guard and the blow struck home hard and heavy with the weight of macs handmade wooden chair in real life the chair doesnt break when you slug somebody with it the way it does in the movies the person you hit is the one who breaks morgan doubled forward dropping to one hand and one knee i didnt wait for him to recover instead as the chair bounced off his ribs i used the momentum of it to spin all the way around in a complete circle in the other direction lifting the chair high and brought it smiting down over the other mans back the blow drove him hard into the floor where he lay unmoving i sat the chair back at the table and looked around the room everyone was staring pale they knew who morgan was what his relationship to me was they knew about the council and my precarious stance with it they knew that i had just assaulted a duly appointed representative of the council in pursuit of the execution of his duty id rolled the stone over my own grave there wasnt a prayer that i could convince the council that i wasnt a rogue wizard fleeing justice now hell with him i said aloud to no one in particular i havent got time for this mac came out from behind the bar not moving in a hurry but not with his usual laconic lack of concern either he knelt by morgan and felt at his throat then peeled back an eyelid and peered at the man mac squinted up at me and said expressionless alive i nodded feeling some slight relief however much of an ass morgan was he had good intentions he and i wanted the same thing really he just didnt realize that i didnt want to kill him but i had to admit in some gleeful little corner of my soul that the look of shocked surprise on his arrogant face as i hit him with the chair was a sight worth remembering mac stooped and picked up the keys where id dropped them on the floor as i swung the chair i hadnt noticed that i had mac handed them back to me and said council will be pissed let me worry about that he nodded luck harry mac offered me his hand and i took it the room was still silent fearful worried eyes watched me i took the keys and walked up out of the light and shelter of mcanallys and into the storm my bridges burning behind me chapter twentyfour i drove for my life macs car was an transam pure white with a big eightcylinder engine the speedometer goes to miles an hour in places i went past that the falling rain made the roads dangerous at the speed i was driving but i had plenty of incentive to keep the car moving as quickly as possible i was still riding the steelhard edge of anger that had carried me away from the ruins of my office and through morgan the sky grew darker a combination of building banks of storm clouds and the approaching dusk the lighting was strange greenish the leaves of the trees as i left the city standing out too sharply too harshly the yellows of the lines in the road too dim most of the cars i saw had their headlights on and streetlights were clicking alight as i barreled down the highway fortunately sunday evening isnt a busy one as far as traffic goes id have been dead any other night i must also have been driving during the watch rotation for the highway patrol because not one of them tried to pull me over i tried to tune in the weather station on the radio but gave it up the storm plus my own agitation was creating a cloud of squealing feedback on the radios speakers but nothing intelligible about the storm i could only pray that i was going to get over to lake providence before it did i won the curtains of rain parted for me as i whipped past the citylimits sign for lake providence i hit the brakes to slow for the turn onto the lakefront road that led to the sells house started hydroplaning turned into the slide with more composure and ability than i really should have had and got the vehicle back under control in time to slide onto the correct road i pulled into the sells gravel drive on the swampy little peninsula that stretched out into lake michigan the transam slid to a halt in a shower of gravel and a roar of mighty engine then sputtered and gasped into silence i felt for a giddy second and a half like magnum pi blue beetle aside i could get into this sportscar thing at least it had lasted long enough for me to get to the sells place thanks mac i grunted and got out of the car the gravel driveway leading back to the lake house was halfsunk in water from the recent storms my leg hurt me too much to run very fast but i set off down the drive at a longlegged lope rapidly eating the distance to the house the storm loomed before me rolling across the lake toward the shorei could see columns of rain dimly lit by the fading light falling into its waters i raced the storm to the house and as i did i drew in every bit of power and alertness that i could keyed myself to a tighter level tuned my senses to their sharpest pitch i came to a halt twenty yards shy of the house and closed my eyes panting there could be magical traps or alarms strewn about or spiritual or shrouded guardians invisible to the naked eye there could be spells waiting illusions meant to hide victor sells from anyone who came looking i needed to be able to see past all that i needed to have every scrap of knowledge i could get so i opened my third eye how can i explain what a wizard sees it isnt something that lends itself readily to description describing something helps to define it to give it limits to set guardrails of understanding around it wizards have had the sight since time began and they still dont understand how it works why it does what it does the only thing i can say is that i felt as though a veil of thick cloth had been lifted away from me as i opened my eyes againand not only from my eyes but from all of my senses i could abruptly smell the mud and fish odor of the lake the trees around the house the fresh scent of the coming rain preceding the storm on the smokestained wind i looked at the trees saw them not just in the first green coat of spring but in the full bloom of summer the splendor of the fall and the barren desolation of winter all at the same time i saw the house and each separate part of it as its own component the timbers as parts of spectral trees the windows as pieces of distant sandy shores i could feel the heat of summer and the cold of winter in the wind coming off the lake i saw the house wreathed in ghostly flames and knew that those were part of its possible future that fire lay down several of the many paths of possibility that lay ahead in the next hour the house itself was a place of power dark emotionsgreed lust hatredall hung over it as visible things molds and slimes that were strewn over it like spanish moss with malevolent eyes ghostly things restless spirits moved around the place drawn to the sense of fear despair and anger that hung over it mindless shades that were always to be found in such places like rats in granaries the other thing that i saw over the house was a grinning empty skull skulls were everywhere wherever i looked just at the edge of my vision silent and still and bleach white as solid and real as though a fetishist had scattered them around in anticipation of some bizarre holiday death death lay in the houses future tangible solid unavoidable maybe mine i shuddered and shoved the feeling away no matter how strong the vision how powerful the image gained with the sight the future was always mutable always something that could be changed no one had to die tonight it didnt have to come to that not for them and not for me but a sick feeling had settled into me as i looked on this darkling house with all of its stinking lust and fear all of its horrid hate worn openly upon it to my sight like a mantle of flayed human skin on the shoulders of a pretty girl with gorgeous hair luscious lips sunken eyes and rotting teeth it repulsed me and it made me afraid and something about it intangible something i couldnt name called to me beckoned here was power power i had thrust aside once before in the past i had thrown away the only family i had ever known to turn away power exactly like this this was the sort of strength that could reach out and change the world to my will bend it and shape it to my desiring could cut through all the petty trivialities of law and civilization and impose order where there was none guarantee my security my position my future and what had been my reward for turning that power aside thus far suspicion and contempt from the very wizards i had acted to support and protect condemnation from the white council whose law i had clung to when all the world had been laid at my feet i could kill the shadowman now before he knew i was here i could call down fury and flame on the house and kill everyone in it not leave one stone upon another i could reach out and embrace the dark energy he had gathered in this place draw it in and use it for whatever i wanted and the consequences be damned why not kill him now violet light visible to my sight throbbed and pulsed inside the windows power being gathered and prepared and shaped the shadowman was inside and he was gathering his might preparing to unleash the spell that would kill me what reason had i to let him go on breathing i clenched my fists in fury and i could feel the air crackle with tension as i prepared to destroy the lake house the shadowman and any of the pathetic underlings he had with him with such power i could cast my defiance at the council itself the gathering of whitebearded old fools without foresight without imagination without vision the council and that pathetic watchdog morgan had no idea of the true depths of my strength the energy was all there gleeful within my anger ready to reach out and reduce to ashes all that i hated and feared the silver pentacle that had been my mothers burned cold on my chest a sudden weight that made me gasp i sagged forward a little and lifted a hand my fingers were so tightly crushed into fists that it hurt to try to open them my hand shook wavered and began to fall again then something strange happened another hand took mine the hand was slim the fingers long and delicate feminine the hand gently covered mine and lifted it like a small childs until i held my mothers pentacle in my grasp i held it in my hand felt its cool strength its ordered and rational geometry the fivepointed star within the circle was the ancient sign of white wizardry the only remembrance of my mother the cold strength of the pentacle gave me a chance a moment to think again to clear my head i took deep breaths struggling to see clear of the anger the hate the deep lust that burned within me for vengeance and retribution that wasnt what magic was for that wasnt what magic did magic came from life itself from the interaction of nature and the elements from the energy of all living beings and especially of people a mans magic demonstrates what sort of person he is what is held most deeply inside of him there is no truer gauge of a mans character than the way in which he employs his strength his power i was not a murderer i was not like victor sells i was harry blackstone copperfield dresden i was a wizard wizards control their power they dont let it control them and wizards dont use magic to kill people they use it to discover to protect to mend to help not to destroy the anger abruptly evaporated the burning hate subsided leaving my head clear enough to think again the pain in my leg settled into a dull ache and i shivered in the wind and the first droplets of rain i didnt have my staff and i didnt have my rod the trinkets i did have with me were either expended or burned to uselessness all i had was what was inside me i looked up suddenly feeling smaller and very alone there was no one near me no hand was touching mine no one stood close by for just a moment i thought i smelled a whiff of perfume familiar and haunting then it was gone and the only one i had to help me was myself i blew out a breath well harry i told myself thats just going to have to be enough and so i walked through a spectral landscape littered with skulls into the teeth of the coming storm to a house covered in malevolent power throbbing with savage and feral mystic strength i walked forward to face a murderous opponent who had all the advantages and who stood prepared and willing to kill me from where he stood within the heart of his own destructive power while i was armed with nothing more than my own skill and wit and experience do i have a great job or what chapter twentyfive the sight of victors lake house will always be with me it was an abomination it looked innocuous enough physically but on a deeper level it was foul rotten it seethed with negative energy anger and pride and lust especially lust lust for wealth lust for power more than physical desire shadowy spiritbeings that werent wholly real only manifestations of the negative energy of the place clung to the walls the rain gutters the porch the windowsills glutting themselves on the negative energy left over from victors spellcasting i was guessing that there was a lot of it he didnt strike me as someone who would be able to make sure that his spells were energyefficient i limped up the front steps my sight revealed no alarms no sorcerous trip wires i might be giving victor shadowman too much credit he was as powerful as a fullblown wizard but he didnt have the education muscle not brains that was victor shadowman i had to keep that in mind i tried the front door just for the hell of it it opened i blinked but i didnt question the good fortune or the overconfidence that had seen to it that victor left his front door standing unlocked instead i took a breath gathered up what will i had and pressed inside i forget how the house was furnished or decorated all i remember is what the sight showed me more of the same as the outside but more concentrated more noxious things clung everywhere things with silent glittering eyes and hungry expressions some reptilian some more like rats some insectoid all of them were unpleasant hostile and shied away from me as i came in as the aura of energy i held in readiness around me touched them they made quiet noises things i would never have heard with my earsbut the sight encompasses all of that there was a long dark hallway coated with the things i advanced slowly quietly and they oozed and crept and slithered from my path the dark purple light of magic that i had seen from the outside was ahead of me and growing brighter i could hear music playing and recognized it as the same piece that had been playing on the cd player at the madison in tommy tomms suite when murphy had asked me there on thursday slow sensuous music steady rhythm i closed my eyes for a moment listening i heard sounds a quiet whisper being repeated over and over a mans voice repeating an incantation holding a spell in readiness for release that would be victor i heard soft sighs of pleasure from a woman the beckitts i could only assume so and in a rumble that i could feel through the soles of my boots i heard thunder over the lake the low chanting voice took on an edge of vicious spiteful satisfaction and continued the incantation i gathered up what energy i had and stepped around the corner out of the hallway into a spacious room that stretched up to the full height of the house without interruption yards of open air the room below was a living room a spiral staircase wound its way up to what looked like a kitchen and dining room on a sort of platform or balcony above the rest of the room the elevated deck on the back of the house must be accessible from the platform there was no one in the main room the chanting and the occasional sigh came from the platform above the cd player was down in the room beneath music flowing from speakers that were covered with an image of fire and dozens of bloated disgusting creature forms feeding on the music as it came out i could see the influence of the music as a faint violet mist in tune with the light coming from the platform above this was a complex ritual spell then involving many base elements coordinated by the central wizard victor tricky no wonder it was so effective it must have taken victor a lot of trial and error to figure it out i glanced up at the platform then crossed the room keeping as far away as i could from the cd player i slipped under the platform without making any noise and dozens upon dozens of slimy notphysical spirit things oozed from my path rain increased to a dull steady rhythm outside on the roof and on the wooden deck and against the windows there were boxes stacked all around me plastic cases and cartons and cardboard boxes and wooden crates i opened the nearest one and saw inside at least a hundred slender vials like the ones i had seen before full of the liquid threeeye beneath the vision of my sight it looked different thick and cloudy with possibility potential disaster lurking in every vial faces twisted in horror and torment swam through the liquid ghostly images of what might be i looked at the other boxes in one ancient liquor bottles full of an almost luminescent green liquid absinthe i leaned closer sniffing and could almost taste the madness that swam latent in the liquid i leaned back from the boxes stomach churning i checked the other boxes quickly ammonia reminiscent of hospitals and mental wards peyote mushrooms in plastic tupperwarei was familiar with them alum white and powdery antifreeze glitter in a hundred metallic shades in a huge plastic bag other things deeper in the shadows that i didnt take the time to look at i had already figured out what all the articles were for potions ingredients for potions this was how victor was making the threeeye he was doing the same thing i did when i made my little potions but on a grander scale using energy he stole from other places other people he used absinthe as the base and moved out from there victor was massproducing what amounted to a magical poison one that probably remained inert until it was inside someone interacting with their emotions and desires that would explain why i hadnt noticed anything about it before it wouldnt have been obvious to a cursory examination or to anything short of fully opening up my sight and that wasnt something i did very often i closed my eyes shaking the sight was showing me too much that was always the problem with it i could look at these ingredients the cases of the finished drug and catch flash images of exactly how much suffering could be caused there was too much i was starting to get disoriented thunder came again more sharply and above me victors voice rose in pitch to something audible he was chanting in an ancient language egyptian babylonian it didnt really matter i could understand the sense of the words clearly enough they were words of hate malevolence they were words that were meant to kill my shaking was becoming more pronounced was it only the effects of the sight the presence of so much negative energy reacting with me no i was simply afraid terrified to come out of my hiding place under the platform and to meet the master of the slithering horde that was draped over everything in sight i could feel his strength from here his confidence the force of his will infusing the very air with a sort of hateful certainty i was afraid with the same fear that a child feels when confronted with a large angry dog or with the neighborhood bully the kind of fear that paralyzes makes you want to make excuses and hide but there was no time for hiding no time for excuses i had to act so i forced my sight closed and gathered my courage as best i could thunder roared outside and there was a flash of lightning the two happening close together the lights flickered and the music skipped a track victor screamed out the incantation in a kind of ecstasy above me the womans voice presumably mrs beckitts rose to a fevered pitch you pays your money you takes your chances i muttered to myself i focused my will extended my right arm and open palm to the stereo system and shouted fuego a rush of heat from my hand exploded into flame on the far side of the room and engulfed the stereo which began to emit a sound more like a long tortured scream than music murphys handcuffs still dangled from my wrist one loop swinging free then i turned extended my arms and roared veni che wind swept up beneath me making my duster billow like batmans cloak lifting me directly up to the platform above and over its low railing into the suspended room even expecting the sight it rattled me victor was dressed in black slacks a black shirt black shoesvery stylish especially compared to my sweatpants and cowboy boots his shaggy eyebrows and lean features were highlighted eerily by the dark light flowing up from the circle around him where the implements of his ritual spell were ready to complete the ceremony that would kill me he had what looked like a spoon its edges sharpened to razor keenness a pair of candles black and white and a white rabbit its feet bound with red cord one of its legs was bleeding from a small tear staining the white fur and tied against its head with a cord was the lock of my own dark straight hair over to one side was another circle laid out in chalk upon the carpeting maybe fifteen feet across the beckitts were inside writhing together in mindless sweating desire generating energy for victors spell victor stared at me in shock as i landed upon the balcony wind whipping around me roaring inside the small room like a miniature cyclone knocking over potted plants and knickknacks you he shouted me i confirmed theres something ive been meaning to talk to you about vic his shock transformed into snarling anger in a heartbeat he snatched up the sharpened spoon raised it in his right hand and screamed out words of the incantation he dragged the rabbit in front of him the ceremonial representation of me and prepared to gouge out its and therefore my heart i didnt give him the chance to finish i reached into a pocket and hurled the empty plastic film canister at victor shadowman as a weapon it wasnt much but it was real and it had been hurled by a real person a mortal it could shatter the integrity of a magic circle the canister went through the air above victors circle and broke it just as he completed the incantation and drove the spoons blade down at the poor rabbit the energy of the storm came whipping down the cylinder of focus created by victors nowflawed circle power shattered out into the room wild undirected and unfocused naked color and raw sound spewing everywhere with hurricane force it sent objects flying including victor and me and shattered the secondary circle the beckitts were in sending them rolling and bumping across the floor and into one wall i braced myself against the guardrail and held on as the power raged around me charging the air with raw dangerous magic surging about like water under pressure seeking an outlet you bastard victor screamed into the gale why dont you just die he lifted a hand and screamed something at me and fire washed across the space between us instant and hot i tapped some of the ample power now available in the room and formed a hard high wall in front of me squeezing my eyes shut in concentration it was a dozen times harder to shield without my bracelet but i blocked the flame sent it swirling high and over me huddling under a little quarter dome of hardened air that would not let victors magic past it i opened my eyes in time to see the flames touch the ceiling beams and set them alight the air still thrummed with energy as the wash of flame passed victor snarled when he saw me rise lifted a hand to one side and snarled out words of summoning a crooked stick that looked like it might be some kind of bone soared through the air toward him and he caught it in one hand turning to me with the attitude of a man holding a gun the problem with most wizards is that they get too used to thinking in terms of one venue magic i dont think victor expected me to rise lurch across the trembling floor toward him and drive my shoulder into his chest slamming him back into the wall with a satisfying thud i leaned back a little and drove a knee toward his gut missed and got him square between the legs instead the breath went out of him in a rush and he doubled over to the ground by this time i was screaming at him senseless and incoherent i started kicking at his head i heard a metallic ratcheting sound behind me and spun my head in time to see beckitt naked point an automatic weapon at me i threw myself to one side and heard a brief explosion of gunfire something hot tore at my hip spinning me into a roll and i kept going into the kitchen i heard beckitt snarl a curse there were a number of sharp clicking sounds the automatic had jammed hell with this much magic flying around the room we were all lucky the thing hadnt just exploded victor meanwhile shook the end of the bone tube he held and a half dozen dried brown scorpion husks fell out onto the carpeting his whiterthanwhite teeth flashed in his boater brown face and he snarled scorpis scorpis scorpis his eyes gleamed with lust and fury one of my legs wasnt answering my calls to action so i crabwalked backward into the kitchen on the heels of my hands and one leg out on the dining section of the balcony the scorpions shuddered to life and started to grow first one and then the others oriented on the kitchen and started toward me in scuttling bursts of speed getting larger as they came victor howled his glee the beckitts rose both naked lean and savagelooking both sporting guns their eyes empty of everything but a wild sort of bloodlust i felt my shoulders press against a counter there was a rattle and then a broom fell down against me its handle bouncing off of my head and landing on the tile floor beside me i grabbed at it my heart pounding somewhere around my throat a roomful of deadly drug one evil sorcerer on his home turf two crazies with guns one storm of wild magic looking for something to set it into explosive motion and half a dozen scorpions like the one i had barely survived earlier rapidly growing to moviemonster size less than a minute on the clock and no timeouts remaining for the quarterback all in all it was looking like a bad evening for the home team chapter twentysix i was so dead there was no way out of the kitchen no time to use an explosive evocation in close quarters and the deadly scorpions would rip me to pieces well before victor could blow me up with explosive magic or one of the bloodmaddened beckitts could get their guns working long enough to put a few more bullets in me my hip was beginning to scream with pain which i supposed was better than the deadly dull numbness of more serious injuries and shock but at the moment it was the least of my worries i clutched the broom to me my only pitiful weapon i didnt even have the mobility to use it and then something occurred to me something so childish that i almost laughed i plucked a straw from the broomstick and began a low and steady chant a bobbing about in the air with the fingers that held the straw i reached out and took hold of the immense amounts of untapped energy running rampant in the air and drew them into the spell pulitas i shouted bringing the chant to a crescendo pulitas pulitas the broom twitched it quivered it jerked upright in my hands and then it took off across the kitchen floor its brush waving menacingly to meet the scorpions advance the last thing i had expected to use that cleaning spell for when i had laboriously been forced to learn it was a tide of poisonous scorpion monsters but any port in a storm the broom swept into them with ferocious energy and started flicking them across the kitchen toward the rest of the balcony with tidy efficient motions each time one of the scorpions would try to dodge around it the broom would tilt out and catch the beastie before it could flick it neatly onto its back and continue about its job im pretty sure it got all the dirt on the way too when i do a spell i do it right victor screeched in anger when he saw his pets still too small to carry much mass being so neatly corralled and ushered off the balcony the beckitts lifted their guns and opened fire on the broom while i hunkered down behind the counter they must have been using revolvers now because they fired smoothly and in an ordered rhythm bullets smacked into the walls and the counters at the back of the kitchen but none of them came through the counter that sheltered me i caught my breath pressing my hand against the blood on my hip it hurt like bloody hell i thought the bullet was stuck somewhere by the bone i couldnt move my leg there was a lot of blood but not so much that i was sitting in a puddle out on the balcony the fire was beginning to catch spreading over the roof the entire place was going to come crashing down before much longer stop shooting stop shooting damn you victor screamed as the gunfire came to a halt i risked a peek over the counter my broom had swept the scorpions off the edge of the balcony and to the floor of the room below as i watched victor caught the broom by its handle and broke it over the balcony railing with a snarl the straw i still held in my fingers broke with a sharp little twang and i felt the energy fade from the spell victor shadowman snarled a cute trick dresden he said but pathetic theres no way you can survive this give up ill be willing to let you walk away the beckitts were reloading i ducked my head back down before they got any funny ideas and hoped that they didnt have heavier rounds that could penetrate the counters i hid behind and whatever contents they contained to kill me sure vic i replied keeping my voice as calm as i could youre known for your mercy and sense of fair play right all i have to do is keep you in there until the fire spreads enough to kill you victor said sure lets all die together vic too bad about all your inventory down there though eh victor snarled and pitched another burst of flame into the kitchen this time it was much easier to cover myself halfshielded as i already was by the counters oh cute i said my voice dripping scorn fires the simplest thing you can do all the real wizards learn that in the first couple of weeks and move on up from there i looked around the kitchen there had to be something i could use some way i could escape but nothing presented itself shut up victor snarled whos the real wizard here huh whos the one with all the cards and whos the one bleeding on the kitchen floor youre nothing dresden nothing youre a loser and do you know why gee i said let me think he laughed harshly because youre an idiot youre an idealist open your eyes man youre in the jungle now its survival of the fittest and youve proved yourself unfit the strong do as they wish and the weak get trampled when this is over im going to wipe you off my shoe and keep going like you never existed too late for that i told him i was in the mood to tell a white lie the police know all about you vic i told them myself and i told the white council too youve never even heard of them have you vic theyre like the superfriends and the inquisition all rolled up into one youll love them theyll take you out like yesterdays garbage god you really are an ignorant bastard there was a moments silence then no he said youre lying youre lying to me dresden if im lying im dying i told him hell as far as i knew i was oh and johnny marcone too i made sure that he knew who and where you were son of a bitch victor said you stupid son of a bitch who put you up to this huh marcone is that why he pulled you off the street i had to laugh weakly a bit of flaming cabinet fell off an upper shelf onto the tiles next to me it was getting hot in there the fire was spreading you never figured it out did you vic who victor screamed at me who was it damn you that whore linda her whore friend jennifer strike two strike three the other side gets a chance to steal i said back hell at least if i could keep him talking i might keep him in the house long enough to go down with me and if i could make him mad enough he might make a mistake stop talking to him beckitt said hes not armed lets kill him and get out of here before we all die go ahead i said in a cheerful tone hell ive got nothing to lose ill send this whole house up in a fireball thatll make hiroshima look like a hibachi make my day shut up victor shouted who was it dresden who damn you if i gave him monica he might still be able to get to her if he got away there was no sense in risking that so all i said was go to hell vic get the car started victor snarled go out through the deck doors the scorpions will kill anything on the first floor i heard motion in the room someone moving out the doors onto the elevated deck at the back of the house the fire continued to spread smoke rode the air in a thick haze ive got to go dresden victor told me his voice was gentle almost a purr but theres someone i want you to meet first i got a sick twisty little feeling in the pit of my stomach kalshazzak victor whispered power thrummed the air shimmered and shone began to twist and spiral kalshazzak victor whispered again louder more demanding i heard something a warbling hiss that seemed to come from a great distance rushing closer the black wizard called the name for the third and final time his voice rising to a screech kalshazzak there was a thundercrack in the house a dull and sulfurous stench and i craned my neck to see over the counter risking a glance victor stood by the sliding glass doors that led out onto the wooden deck redorange flames wreathed the ceiling on that side of the house and smoke was filling the room below casting the whole place in a hellish glow crouched down on the floor in front of victor was the toaddemon i had banished the night before i had known that i hadnt killed it you cant kill demons as such only destroy the physical vessels they create for themselves when they come to the mortal world if called again they can create a new vessel without difficulty i watched in fascination stunned i had seen only one person call a demon beforeand i had killed my old master shortly after the thing crouched in front of victor its lightning blue eyes whirling with shades of scarlet hate staring up at the blackclad wizard trembling with the need to tear into him to rend and destroy the mortal being who had dared summon it forth victors eyes grew wider and more mad glittering with fevered intensity sweat ran down his face and he tilted his head slowly to one side as though his vision were skewing along the horizontal and by the motion he would compensate for it i gave silent thanks that i had closed my third eye when i did i did not want to see what that thing really looked likeand i didnt want to get a good look at the real victor sells either the demon finally gave a hiss of frustration and turned toward me with a croaking growl victor dropped his head back and laughed his will triumphant over that of the being he had called from beyond there dresden do you see the strong survive and the weak are torn to little pieces he flapped his hand at me and said to the demon kill him i struggled to my feet supporting my weight on the counter to face the demon as it rose and began its slow stalk toward me my god victor i said i cant get over how clumsy you are victors smile immediately became a snarling sneer once again i saw fear touch the corners of his eyes uncertainty even though he was on top and i felt a little smile quirk my lips i moved my gaze to the demons you really shouldnt just hand someone else a demons name i told him then i drew in a breath and shouted out in a voice of command kalshazzak the demon stopped in its tracks and gave a whistling howl of agony and rage as i called its name and drew my will up to hurl against it kalshazzak i snarled again the demons presence was suddenly there in my head raging slippery and slimy and wriggling like a venomous tadpole it was a pressure a horrible pressure on my temples that made me see stars and threatened to steal enough of my balance to send me falling to the floor i tried to speak again and the words stuck in my throat the demon hissed in anticipation and the pressure on my head redoubled trying to force me down to make me give up the struggle at which point the demon would be free to act the lightning blue of its eyes became glaringly bright painful to look upon i thought of little jenny sells oddly enough and of murphy lying pale and unconscious on a stretcher in the rain of susan crouched next to me sick and unable to run i had beaten this frog once i could do it again i cried out the demons name for the third and final time my throat burning and raw the word came out garbled and imperfect and for a sinking moment i feared the worst but kalshazzak howled again and hurled itself furiously to the floor thrashing its limbs about like a poisoned bug raging and tearing great swaths out of the carpet i sagged the weariness that came over me threatening to make me black out what are you doing victor said his voice rising to a highpitched shriek what are you doing he was staring at the demon in horror kill him i am your master kill him kill him the demon howled in rage turned its burning glare to me and then victor as though trying to decide who to devour first its eyes settled on victor who went pale and ran for the doors oh no you dont i muttered and i uttered the last spell i could manage one final time on the last gasps of my power the winds rose and lifted me from the earth i hurtled into victor like an ungainly cannonball driving him away from the doors past the demon as it made an awkward lunge at us and toward the railing of the balcony we fell in a confused heap at the edge of the balcony that overlooked the room beneath full of dark smoke and the red glow of flame the air had grown almost too hot to breathe pain jolted through my hip more bright and blinding than anything i had ever imagined and i sucked in a breath the smoky air burned made me choke and gasp i looked up fire was spreading everywhere the demon was crouched between us and the only way out over the edge of the balcony was only chaos and flame and smokestrange dark smoke that should have been rising but instead was mostly settled along the floor like london fog the pain was too great i simply couldnt move i couldnt even take in enough breath to scream damn you victor screamed he regained his feet and hauled me up toward his face with berserk strength damn you he repeated what happened what did you do the fourth law of magic forbids the binding of any being against its will i grated out pain was tight around my throat making me fight to speak the words so i stepped in and cut your control over it and didnt establish any of my own victors eyes widened you mean its free i confirmed i glanced at the demon looks hungry what do we do victor said his voice was shaking and he started shaking me too what do we do we die i said hell i was going to do that anyway but at least this way i take you out with me i saw him glance at the demon then back to me eyes terrified and calculating work with me he said you stopped it before you can stop it again we can beat it together and leave i studied him for a moment i couldnt kill him with magic i didnt want to and it would only have brought a death sentence on my head in any case but i could stand by and do nothing and thats exactly what i did i smiled at him closed my eyes and did nothing fuck you then dresden victor snarled it can only eat one of us at a time and im not going to be the one to get eaten today and he picked me up to hurl me toward the demon i objected with fragile tenacity we grappled fire raged smoke billowed the demon came closer lightning eyes gleaming through the helllit gloom victor was shorter than me stockier better at wrestling and he hadnt been shot in the hip he levered me up and almost threw me but i moved quicker whipping my right arm at his head and catching him with the flailing free end of murphys handcuffs breaking his motion he tried to break away but i held on to him dragged him in a circle to slam against the guardrail of the balcony and we both toppled over desperation gives a man extraordinary resources i flailed at the balcony railing and caught it at the base keeping myself from going over into the roiling smoke below i shot a glance below and saw the glistening brown hide of one of the scorpions its stinging tail held up like the mast of a ship cutting through smoke at least four feet deep the room was filled with angry clicking scuttling sounds even in a single desperate glance i saw a couch torn to pieces by a pair of scorpions in less time than it took to take a breath they loomed over it their tails waving in the air like flags from the back of golf carts hells bells victor had grabbed on to the railing a little above me and to the left and he stared at the oncoming demon with a face twisted with hatred i saw him draw in a breath and try to plant a foot firmly enough to free one hand to point at the oncoming demon in some sort of magical attack or defense i couldnt allow victor to get out of this he was still whole if he could knock the demon down he might still slip out so i had to tell him something that would make him mad enough to try to take my head off hey vic i shouted it was your wife it was monica that ratted on you the words hit him like a physical blow and his head whipped around toward me his face contorting in fury he started to say something to me the words of a spell meant to blow me to bits maybe but the toaddemon interrupted him by rearing up with an angry hiss and snapping its jaws down over victors collarbone and throat bone broke with audible snaps and victor squealed in pain his arms and legs shuddering he tried to push his way down away from the demon and the creatures balance wobbled i gritted my teeth and tried to hold on a scorpion leapt at me brown and gleaming and i drew my legs up out of reach of its pincers just barely bastard victor cried struggling uselessly in the demons jaws there was blood running down his body fast and hot the demon had hit an artery and it was simply holding on wavering at the edge of the balcony as victor struggled and started kicking at my near hand he hit me once twice and my balance wavered my grip slipping a quick glance below me showed me another scorpion getting ready to jump at me this one closer murphy i thought i should have listened to you if the scorpions didnt kill me the demon would and if the demon didnt the fire was going to kill me i was going to die there was a certain peace in thinking that in knowing that it was all about to be over i was going to die it was as simple as that i had fought as hard as i could done everything i could think of and it was over i found myself in my final seconds idly wishing that i could have had time to apologize to murphy that i could apologize to jenny sells for killing her daddy that i could apologize to linda randall for not figuring things out fast enough and saving her life murphys handcuffs lay tight and cold against my forearm as monsters and demons and black wizards and smoke closed in all around me i closed my eyes murphys handcuffs my eyes snapped open murphys handcuffs victor swung his foot at my left hand again i kicked with my legs and hauled with my shoulders to give me a second of lift and grabbed victor sellss pant leg in my left hand with my right i flicked the free end of the handcuffs around one of the bars of the guardrail the ring of metal cycled around on its hinge and locked into place then as i started to fall back down i hauled hard on victors leg he screamed a horrible highpitched squeal as he started to fall kalshazzak finally overbalanced by the additional weight and leverage i had added to victors struggles pitched over the balcony guardrail and into the smoke below crashing down to the floor carrying victor with him there was a rush of scuttling clicking sounds a piercing whistlehiss from the demon victors screams rose to something highpitched and horrible until he sounded more like an animal a pig squealing at slaughter than a man i swung from the balcony my feet several feet above the fray held suspended in an acutely painful fashion by murphys handcuffs one loop around my wrist the other locked around the balcony railing i looked down as my vision started to fade i saw a sea of brown gleaming plates of segmented chitinous armor i saw the scorpions stinging tails flashing down over and over again i saw the lightning eyes of kalshazzaks physical vessel and i saw one of them pierced and put out by the flashing sting of one of the scorpions and i saw victor sells struck over and over again by stingers the size of ice picks the wounds foaming with poison the demon ignored the pincers and the stingers of the scorpions to begin tearing him apart his face contorted in the final agony of rage and fear the strong survive and the weak get eaten i guess victor had invested in the wrong kind of strength i didnt want to watch what was happening below me the fires consuming the ceiling above were rather beautiful actually rolling waves of flame cherry red sunset orange i was too weak to try to get out of this mess and the entire thing had become far too annoying and painful to even consider anymore i just watched the flames and waited and noticed oddly that i was simply starving and no wonder i hadnt eaten a decent meal since friday friday you notice odd things in those final moments they say and then you start seeing things for instance i saw morgan come through the sliding glass doors leading in from the outside deck the silver sword of the white councils justice in his hands i saw one of the scorpions now the size of a german shepherd figure out the stairs scuttle up them and hurtle at morgan i saw morgans silver sword slash snickersnack and leave the scorpion in writhing pieces on the floor then i saw morgan his expression grim his weight making the firechewed balcony shudder come for me his eyes narrowed when he saw me and he lifted the sword leaning far over the balcony railing the blade flashed bright silver in the firelight as it started to come down typical was my last thought how perfectly typical to survive everything the bad guys could do and get taken down by the people for whose cause i had been fighting chapter twentyseven i awoke somewhere cool and dark in tremendous pain coughing my lungs out rain was falling on my face and it was the greatest feeling id ever known morgans face was over mine and i realized hed been giving me cpr eww i coughed and spluttered and sat up wheezing for breath morgan watched me for a moment then scowled and stood up eyes flickering around i managed to get enough wind to speak and said numbly you saved me he grimaced yes but why he looked at me again then stooped to pick up his sword and slip it into the scabbard at his side because i saw what happened in there i saw you risk your life to stop the shadowman without breaking any of the laws you werent the killer i coughed some more and said that doesnt mean you had to save me he turned and blinked at me as though puzzled what do you mean you could have let me die his hard expression never changed but he said you werent guilty youre a part of the white council his mouth twisted as though the words were fresh lemons technically i had an obligation to preserve your life it was my duty i wasnt the killer i said no so i wheezed that would make me right and then that would make you morgan scowled more than ready to carry out the doom if you cross the line dresden dont think this has gotten you off the hook as far as im concerned so if i remember correctly as a warden it is your duty to report on my conduct to the council isnt it his scowl darkened so youre going to have to go to them on monday and tell them all about what really happened the whole truth and nothing but the truth yes he snarled it is even possible they will lift the doom i started laughing weakly you havent won dresden there are many on the council who know full well that you have consorted with the powers of darkness we at least will not relax our vigil on you we will watch you day and night we will prove that you are a danger who must be stopped i kept laughing i fell over on my side i laughed so much morgan arched an eyebrow and simply stared at me are you all right give me about a gallon of listerine i choked and ill be just fine morgan just stared at me and i laughed harder he rolled his eyes and growled something about the police being here any moment to provide medical care then he turned and stomped off into the woods muttering to himself the whole way the police arrived in time to catch the beckitts trying to leave and arrested them for of all things being naked later they were implicated in the threeeye drug ring and prosecuted on distribution charges just as well for them that theyre in the michigan justice system they wouldnt have come out of a cell alive if theyd been in chicago it wouldnt have been good for johnny marcones business the varsity suffered a mysterious fire the night of my visit i hear marcone didnt have any trouble collecting the insurance money in spite of all the odd rumors going around word hit the street that marcone had hired harry dresden to take out the head of the threeeye gang one of those rumors that you cant trace back to any one person i didnt try to deny it it was a cheap enough price to not have to worry about anyone bombing my car i was too hospitalized to show up at the meeting of the white council but it turned out that they decided to lift the doom of damocles which i had always thought a rather pretentious name in any case from me due to valorous action above and beyond the call of duty i dont think morgan ever forgave me for being a good guy he had to eat crow in front of the whole council relentlessly driven by his analretentive sense of duty and honor theres no love lost between us but the guy was honest ill give him credit for that and hell at least i dont have to look forward to him popping out from nowhere every time i cast a spell i hope murphy was in critical condition for nearly seventytwo hours but she pulled through they gave her a room right down the hall from me in fact i sent flowers to her hospital room along with the surviving ring of her handcuffs i told her in a note not to ask how the chain between the rings had been so neatly severed i didnt think shed buy that someone cut it with a magic sword the flowers must have helped the first time she got out of bed was to totter down the hall to my room throw them in my face and leave without saying a word she professed to have no memory of what had happened at my office and maybe she didnt but in any case she got the warrant for my arrest rescinded and a couple weeks later when she went back to work she called me in for advice the next day and she sent a big check to cover my expenses in the murder investigations i guess that means were friends again in a professional sense but we dont joke anymore some wounds dont heal very quickly the police found the remains of the huge threeeye stash in what was left of the lake house and victor sells eventually came up as the bad guy monica sells and her children vanished into witness protection i hope theyve got a better life now than they had before i suppose it couldnt be much worse bob eventually came home again more or less within the twentyfourhour time limit i suppose i turned a deaf ear to rumors of a particularly wild party at the university of chicago which lasted from saturday night to sunday night and bob wisely never mentioned it date with a demon was a headliner for the arcane when it came out the following monday and susan came by my hospital room to bring me a copy and to talk to me about it she seemed greatly amused by the cast that held my hips immobilized until the docs could be sure that there wasnt too much fracturing the xray machine kept fouling whenever they tried to use it on me for some reason and commented that it was a pity i wasnt more mobile i used the sympathy factor to badger another date out of her and she didnt seem to mind too much that time we were not interrupted by a demon and i didnt need any of bobs love potions or advice thank you very much mac got his transam back i got the blue beetle back that didnt seem exactly equitable but at least the beetle still runs most of the time i made sure to send pizza out to toottoot and his faerie buddies every night for a week and once a week ever since im pretty sure the kid from pizza spress thought i was a loony having him drop off pizza by the roadside heck with him i make good on my promises mister got a little shortchanged on the whole deal but it is well beneath his dignity to notice such things and me what did i get out of it im not really sure i escaped from something that had been following me for a long time im just not sure what im not sure who was more certain that i was a walking antichrist waiting to happenthe conservative branch of the white council the men like morgan or me for them at least the question has been partly laid to rest for myself though im not so sure the power is there the temptation is there thats just the way its going to be i can live with that the world is getting weirder darker every single day things are spinning around faster and faster and threatening to go completely awry falcons and falconers the center cannot hold but in my corner of the country im trying to nail things down i dont want to live in victors jungle even if it did eventually devour him i dont want to live in a world where the strong rule and the weak cower id rather make a place where things are a little quieter where trolls stay the hell under their bridges and where elves dont come swooping out to snatch children from their cradles where vampires respect the limits and where the faeries mind their ps and qs my name is harry blackstone copperfield dresden conjure by it at your own risk when things get strange when what goes bump in the night flicks on the lights when no one else can help you give me a call im in the book
