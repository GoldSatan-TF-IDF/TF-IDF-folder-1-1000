paul b thompson tonya c cook sanctuary prologue a flock of blackbirds took flight screeching wildly they were not used to strangers the sight of so many figures moving toward them incited panic in moments the birds were lost against the unbending glare of the sun but the emptiness was soon filled by a long column of cavalry dusty horses heads low trudged over coarse sand and loose stones their riders dozing in the saddle stragglers limped along the columns flanks shields hanging from spears borne on weary bony shoulders none lacked a woundthese ranged from stray cuts and bruises to missing limbs more than a few were grayfaced bearing the unmistakable mark of impending death all were elves many of the kagonesti strain but fully half belonged either to the western qualinesti line or the silvanesti eldest among the ancient race at the head of this mournful procession walked kerianseray general of all the elven armies years in the desert had deepened her natural brown skin tone and given her eyes a penetrating squint just now her eyes were fixed on her trudging feet willing them to make one more step and another and another she was leading her griffon eagle eye had come to her as a gift from silvanesti lords grateful to have escaped their homeland ahead of the invading minotaur host kagonesti she might be but the protocolsensitive nobles insisted that kerianseray should have the finest mount in the army not only as the leader of the remaining elven host but as wife to gilthas the speaker of the sun and stars in skirmish after skirmish eagle eye had proven his mettle taking the measure of many a fierce minotaur and ushering numerous foes into the hereafter but even under the guidance of his ferocious rider he could not reverse the inevitable kerianseray known to friend and foe alike as the lioness had led ten thousand elves south through the desert of khur seeking some means of entering the despoiled kingdom of silvanesti from the north her warrior band was united by an unquenchable desire to expel the invaders from the sacred sylvan fastness of that most ancient elven homeland half a thousand perished even before the border of silvanesti was reached lost to heat tainted water and poisonous reptiles where fine sand finally gave way to loamy soil and stunted pines and twisted junipers to leafbearing trees the minotaurs were waiting using their dreaded dragontooth tactics they shredded the lionesss force long before it reached silvanesti land her grand plan to raise the common folk in revolt against their brutal overlords died before it could be born repulsed at the border the elves had shifted eastward hoping to get around the wall of minotaurs everywhere they tried to enter silvanesti they were met by the swords and axes of the brawny bullmen food and water dwindling the lioness was forced to retreat failure in battle was one thing she had known defeat before failure here with nothing at their backs but three hundred miles of desert was much worse annihilation stared every elf in the face all they could do was return the way they had come back across the scorching desert hoping they would reach their temporary homethe tent settlement near khurikhanbefore they perished a rider was cantering through the slowmoving column streams of dust rising behind him kerianseray heard the hoofbeats and halted tugging on eagle eyes braided halter the griffon unhappy to have his raptors claws on the broiling sand arched his neck and clawed at the offending ground the lioness spoke briefly to him and be quieted the rider slewed to a halt general i bring urgent word from the rear guard she squinted up at him wracking her sunbroil memory for a name hytanthas it was hytanthas ambrodel two centuries ago his forefathers dwelled in the marbled halls of qualinost advisors to the speaker of the sun centuries before that in silvanost his ancestors would have owned kagonesti slaves this dirty disheveled young soldier was now among the last of his line his lips were so parched that he could hardly push the words out after swallowing several times he managed to rasp the enemy presses upon us lord taranath says a regiment at least a regiment two thousand minotaurs exhaustion weighed on kerian like a thick heavy cloak she still commanded almost eight thousand elves but the enemy was wellsupplied and fresh her elves were all but spent her officers collected around her she questioned hytanthas openly for everyone to hear this was how the lioness led not from some lofty position but as a comrade among equals for this and other reasons she was respected by her warriors almost to the point of adulation according to young ambrodel the horned enemy was coming straight on in battle array an elf his sword arm in a sling exclaimed afoot perhaps we could just ride away from them ride where said another injured officer the only thing in front of us is wasteland thats what they want the lioness said absently she stroked eagle eyes feathered neck to drive us out and let the desert kill us lets stand and fight then said the first elf others despite their hurts loudly seconded this declaration kerian shook her head even if they managed to wipe out the attackers theyd lose half their strength in the battle each and every warrior was precious these days expelled from their homelands the elves had only the resources theyd been able to carry with them horses and trained fighters were more valuable than any amount of steel or precious jewels she scratched her head dislodging a cascade of sand from her hair the thick curls resisted her efforts to confine them in a braid so she tied them back with a leather thong her battered army was watching her waiting for orders no matter how gravely wounded their heads were unbowed if she ordered it each and every one would fightand most would die such an order was unthinkable the preservation of the army was far more important than a fleeting gesture against the minotaurs she put a foot in the stirrup of eagle eyes slim saddle and swung onto the griffons back as she settled herself the sea of expectant faces continued to regard her in silence the army will march east to the sea she announced some were openly stunned while the coastline was less harsh than the deep desert it was also subject to the watchful eyes of the minotaur fleet escaping detection would be impossible the enemy could cruise along and land troops ahead of the retreating elves at any point those who had served with the lioness in her long campaign against the knights of neraka were not shocked however they knew she wasnt desperate or reckless knew she must have some bold device in mind quietly she added i need volunteers although she didnt specify a duty all present suddenly realized what she was about to say the officers straightened to attention volunteering one and all i need a covering force to delay the minotaurs to make a stand she gestured to a slight rise among the gnarled junipers there on that knoll hytanthas ambrodel opened his mouth but before he could speak she waved a hand no not you captain i need you for something else he didnt recognize this for the kindly falsehood it was the lionesss weary face gave nothing away but she wanted to spare the too young too ardent captain this particular task she had lost too many like him on this campaign a silvanesti named baranthalonus a veteran saluted general allow me the honor she asked him why his sunburned face turned south hazel eyes growing distant as if seeing the green land that still lay beyond the horizon i should like to die at least close to silvanesti land he said simply very well pick a band of five hundred all good archers fix the enemy here for at least a day a tall order but baranthalonus nodded the five hundred should be silvanesti none objected to the implicit gibe silvanesti were known for considering themselves superior to all races including other elves ordinarily the lioness would not have tolerated such a provocative statement but these circumstances were hardly ordinary and this elf had volunteered for death with a shrug she said i wish you had kithkanan himself he was qualinesti general the jest elicited hoarse chuckles from the others well youll have at least one in your company whos not of the starborn she indicated herself her officers protested as commander of the army she must not place herself in such peril ill do what i think is best for the army she snapped cutting off the protests hytanthas was sent to bring taranath forward as the lionesss secondincommand he would lead in her absence four other silvanesti officers asked to join baranthalonus so he sent them through the ranks to pick five hundred warriors in short order the covering force was assembled on the gravelly knoll all of the armys remaining arrows were turned over to them the archers chose their places with care each surrounding himself with a hedge of arrows points thrust into the coarse sand one of the archers the lioness never knew which yielded his food and waterskin to a comrade who was continuing the march in rapid order every elfin the covering force willingly surrendered his precious rations then knelt to await the enemys arrival lord taranath arrived formerly a commander in the royal guard of qualinost he was an unusually tall elf this together with his somewhat rounded ears had always encouraged speculation about a mixed parentage taranath was renowned for coolness in battle and such insults were the only things that stirred him to rage given his prowess with a sword he was not often insulted lady he said saluting the lioness she didnt care for the honorific but this was hardly the time to reprove her valiant friend she delivered her orders with characteristic brevity take the army to the sea taran head north to khurikhan and present the army with my compliments to the speaker taranath raised an eyebrow the minotaur fleethow will we avoid it spring is nearly over the khurish nomads will be leaving the deep desert before the summer heat sets in kerian grimaced crazy to imagine this as spring yet summer would indeed be much worse therell be hundreds thousands of them on the coastal route mix with them join their caravans the bullmen wont molest you while you ride amidst a pack of nomads the king of the khurish humans sahimkhan was known to be on friendly terms with the minotaurs is it honorable to skulk home taranath spoke quietly cloaked by hordes of ragged nomads war is not about honor its about survivaland victory since the latter had eluded them the former was now paramount flat horn blasts echoed across the sand kerianseray shaded her eyes a thick rising column of dust marked the oncoming enemy go she said tell the speaker she stopped a rare blush mantling her sunbrowned cheeks as she failed to find the right words taranath was deeply moved but respected her privacy i know what to tell the speaker lady fare you well like the tide retreating from jetsam on the shore the elven army flowed away leaving the small silvanesti force alone on the stony knoll seventyfive hundred warriors mounted and on foot vanished among the pines and junipers despite weariness and heavy hearts they made no more sound than the soughing of the wind the volunteers watched them go the lioness twisted around in eagle eyes saddle from a long leathercovered tube tied across the animals hips she withdrew three lengths of polished steel each about four feet long screwing the threaded ends together she s oon had a formidable lance a griffonriders deadliest weapon the archers lifted their heads they heard a single voice far deeper than any elfs deeper even than a humans roaring from across the distance the minotaur commander was challenging his troops everyone looked to baranthalonus he in turn looked to the lioness ill not rise yet she said tugging on mail gauntlets even though they were sewn of lightcolored cloth to reflect the sun donning them was like putting her hands into a hot frying pan no sense giving our position away the dust clouds grew thicker spreading out in a semicircle from south to north fully encompassing the small hillock clanking and clattering the great armored host of minotaurs drew nearer loose stones danced as the desert trembled under the tread of two thousand bullmen eagle eye no longer shifted his clawed forefeet on the hot sand the griffon stood unmoving his goldeneyed gaze fixed upon the approaching enemy alert for his riders slightest command kerianseray tightened the straps of her helmet beneath her chin it wasnt a fighting helm made of steel or iron but a soft leather cap designed chiefly to keep her thick golden hair out of her face while she was airborne she shifted the steel lance off her knees and couched it under her arm thoughts crossed her mind what a long way shed come from the woods of qualinesti there shed first fought the nerakans with a simple leather sling now she commanded silvanesti lords from griffonback with a knightly weapon in her hand a strange fate had led her here fateand her husband once despised as the puppet king a tool of the knights of neraka gilthas had left a soft comfortable life to lead the remnants of the elven nations across mountains and desert to find refuge in khur no one called him puppet now the coalition of qualinesti silvanesti and kagonesti who had abandoned their woodlands was six years old and still as fragile as a hummingbirds egg holding them together was gilthas speaker of the sun and stars the din of the minotaurs approach was deafening they marched in a series of tight triangular formations apex forward shaping their famed dragontooth attack an enemy facing this battle line found itself squeezed into close combat on two sides these minotaur dragonteeth chewed up and destroyed entire armies but kerianseray didnt intend to play the game their way today she looked to baranthalonus and nodded he gave the order as one five hundred silvanesti archersthe best remaining in all the worldrose to their feet flocked arrows and loosed them into the air kerianseray closed her eyes for an instant and whispered one word gilthas chapter for centuries khur was thought of as an empty land devoid of life or livelihood containing only sand stone and sun in truth the desert was home to many living things each adapted to the stark environment beneath the sand dwelt creatures tenacious and frequently venomous above ground grew grass like wire thorny vines and waxen shrubs by night the desert rose bloomed source of the rarest perfume in the world the scent was sweet but the petals of the plant were deadly poison such was the life of the land of khur the people of khur were likewise shaped by their desert home most were nomads of hard mien and severe law devoted to clan tribe and gods living on their own in a harsh land they knew no master but the desert each tribe was its own nation and every nomad his own lord ungovernable they nonetheless had a king the khan of khur who dwelt in the city of khurikhan the city had grown up in the east where sea and sand met looted and sacked many times in the past the last time by followers of the dread wyrm malystryx khurikhan was rising again newly restored the squat round towers and square dwellings once more thrust up from the endless sand scaffolds enfolded the shattered facade of the khuri yl northe palace of the setting sunand the citys outer wall was checkered with newly cut stone blocks repairing the destruction wrought by the recent war city dwellers had picked up the bricks and shattered timbers of their homes and set them in place noble and commoner alike had planted thousands of date palm seedlings throughout the city alongside the towering ancients that still survived trade resumed and life went on in the noisy contentious khurish fashion new construction was not the only change in khur outside the walls of khurikhan sprawled a vast camp of multicolored tents miles across the conglomeration of shelters clustered under the city wall like fungus clinging to a fallen log crowded into this makeshift metropolis were a hundred thousand elves former residents of qualinesti and silvanesti the camp of exiled elves was known to its inhabitants not without irony as khurinost and to the people of khurikhan as laddadihar the elves anthill laddad was an old word whose literal meaningthose who walk on airwas a reference to the griffon riders of ancient times now it meant simply elves encompassing qualinesti silvanesti and kagonesti since the khurs made no distinction among the groups in the center of this great patchwork camp of tents was the home of the speaker of the sun and stars gilthas son of tanis halfelven and lauralanthalasa was last of the line of speakers great and ill which stretched back to the founder of the qualinesti nation kithkanan and through him to the august silvanos goldeneye on gilthas had fallen the daunting task of leading his people out of their ruined homeland abandoning it to the knights of neraka mobs of wild goblins and the bandit horde of captain samuval the qualinesti had fought their way across half a continent and come to rest here in this desolate desert thousands perished on the journey felled by arrow and sword as well as the less material but no less deadly menaces of heat disease exhaustion and heartbreak the sands of western khur were littered with bones broken carts and abandoned possessions and watered by the tears of an entire race when gilthas first beheld the city of khurikhan a scant one thousand elves stood at his back after the horrors of exile and the agonizing trek across the desert the sunbaked capital of khur seemed a dream of paradise but the elves ballad of woe wasnt done as months passed more refugees arrived in groups of five or ten as well as columns numbering in the thousands from the far south came silvanesti driven out of their forest glades and crystal halls by hordes of rampaging minotaurs fewer silvanesti than qualinesti abandoned their homeland for no matter how wretched their existence most could not bear to leave their sacred ancestral lands instead they faded into the forest there to dwell among the trees like their primeval ancestors those who had joined gilthas were for the most part high officials warriors and nobles of the silvanesti court when gilthas was proclaimed speaker of the stars by the abdicating alhana starbreeze the exiled courtiers of silvanost swallowed their outrage at having a qualinesti and one tainted with human blood as their ruler if the race of elves was to survive it needed a leader the oncescorned puppet king had proven himself capable elves of greater reputation had succumbed to death or despairing had given in to the enemy not gilthas the test of exile showed his true mettle so the silvanesti notables gathered around him forming a tightly knit circle of advisors to the throne of the united elven nations gone were the embroidered silk robes and soft finery worn in qualinost and silvanost living in the desert demanded more practical dress the speaker had taken to wearing khurish attire a sleeveless robe of white linen called a geb cinched in at the waist by the leather cord known as the ghuffran where once he had cultivated the distant air and pale complexion of a palacedwelling poet now gilthas was lean brown and serious the weight of the elven nation rested directly on his shoulders and although he refused to let the strain break him it occasionally bore him down the speaker rose early worked all day and lived as frugally now as once he had dwelt in aimless luxury this day began as most did with gilthas in his audience room standing with hands clasped behind his back in the center of a round carpet winered with ocher curlicues radiating out from a central sun motif the carpet had come from sahimkhan monarch but not master of khur a gift the khan had said to make the speaker more comfortable but gilthas knew its true purpose to serve as a mocking reminder of his lost throne what word from lady kerianseray the speakers question caused the assortment of courtiers and vassals to break off their various conversations they were an oddlooking group most in khurish attire but a stubborn few still persisting in the fashions of their homeland a few feet from the speaker alertly watching stood planchet gilthass longtime valet and bodyguard like his liege he was dressed in the local style but the sword at his waist was of pure qualinesti design the crowd of onlookers parted to reveal a young elf thin and hardened by sun wind and privation who stiffened in salute he doffed his khurishstyle cloth hat and said lord taranath sends his greetings great speaker the room grew silent if taranath and not the lioness had dispatched this courier it could only mean the speakers wife was no longer with the army the army has returned from the southern expedition and is currently at wadi talaft the messenger continued naming a dry lake south of the city which was normally used by the nomads as a natural corral for their herds of horses and goats lady kerianseraythe young courier swallowedis not with them sire before his assembled court gilthas would not parade his anxiety as calmly as possible he inquired what happened captain the courier reported the failure of kerianserays gamble in the south at every turn the armys entrance into silvanesti was barred by minotaurs and the bullmens strength proved overwhelming pursued into the borderland between forest and desert the lioness and a handpicked band of archers had remained behind making a stand so the rest of the beleaguered army could escape all eyes were on the speaker as be digested this news his perennial sunburn did not hide the sudden pallor of his face planchet took an involuntary step toward him then halted as much friend and trusted advisor as bodyguard still planchet could not allow his concern to breach the speakers dignity the courier reported that six thousand eight hundred eightynine elves had made it to wadi talaft this out of ten thousand murmurs swept the room while the speakers subjects whispered about the heavy losses planchet spoke privately to his master gilthas nodded once and the valet slipped quietly from the room the speaker raised a hand in the ensuing silence he declared our adventure in the south is at an end we cannot waste any more of our slender resources on such a hopeless cause he then charged the courier to bid lord taranath return to khurinost his words set the assemblage stirring anew captain ambrodel saluted but did not depart great speaker he said pardon my boldness but more can be done in the south we can send small bands of fighters secretly across the thonthalas into the interior of silvanesti to what purpose bands of twenty or thirty partisans can hardly prevail against the bullmen this came from a tall elegant figure with shoulderength jetblack hair he wore a heavy gold bracelet on each wrist and a silk robe the same color as his blue eyes lord morillon is correct gilthas agreed evenly it is beyond our power to liberate our ancient homeland more important now is finding a place we can put down roots and become a nation again the young captain glared at the haughty noble both were ambrodels hytanthas was of the younger line that had followed kithkanan out of silvanost more than twentyfive centuries earlier when he founded the qualinesti nation he had grown up in the lionesss service slightly rounded ears and a thickening of his eyebrows betrayed the human blood in his ancestry and his black hair was confined in a short neat braid as befit a soldier nevertheless he bore a distinct resemblance to his distant silvanesti cousin elegant lord morillon ambrodel the captain turned away from morillon pointedly addressing gilthas great speaker we were able to do much against the knights back home and they were greater in numbers than the minotaurs morillon said back home you were on familiar ground with a friendly population to help you nothing in khur is friendlynot the people not the terrain not the climate he inclined his head to the speaker great gilthas decides wisely captain ambrodel said no more but his eyes blazed with frustration other soldiers in the assembly took up his notion of raiding silvanesti and a brisk discussion ensued lord morillon his attention on the speaker saw the fleeting expression of pain that crossed his monarchs face it was plain the speakers thoughts were on the fate of his dashing dangerous wife sunrise was only an hour past but the speaker looked to have slept poorly he was known sometimes to walk the narrow lanes of khurinost late at night his responsibilities weighing heavily on him the debate was becoming increasingly loud but morillons cultured voice cut across it with practiced ease the speaker is weary he announced let us withdraw hytanthas would have lingered but morillon ushered him to the door chiding the younger elf for taxing the speakers patience the captains frustration flared were not in silvanost any longer my lord our speaker has ears for all his subjects not just the rich and titled cousin faced cousin morillon composed indoorpale hytanthas an inch taller his suntanned visage red with anger yet the eyes were the same the hard unflinching blue of the sky arching over their tent city hytanthas finally stalked away to carry the speakers orders to lord taranath lord morillon watched his cousin until he was lost from sight in the maze of narrow passages that ran between the adjacent tents morillon was a longtime courtier having begun in service to queen mother alhana and he had long ago mastered the art of keeping his expression bland even when irritated upstart youngsters with no manners vexed him greatly cousin or no he marked hytanthas as one of the lionesss hotheads and vowed to keep an eye on him dismissing the young elf from his thoughts for now morillon approached the speaker again his coterie of silvanesti lords followed closely sire i have an audience with sahimkhan this afternoon are there any special messages you wish me to convey he asked tell him his climate is appalling seeing no change in the silvanestis expression gilthas added gently a joke my lord morillon inclined his head yes great speaker gilthas sighed assure the khan of my goodwill and good wishes as for the tributedo what you think the situation supports for the privilege of remaining in the khans domain the elves were required to pay sahimkhan a thousand steel pieces a day this staggering sum came due every twenty days lord morillon had been attempting to negotiate a lower price the noble acknowledged the speakers vague command with a bow and departed the gaggle of silent silvanesti trailing in his wake alone gilthas seated himself in the canvas crossframed chair that now served as his throne giving in to exhaustion and melancholy as he rubbed his eyes planchet returned entering through an opening in the far canvas wall the valet paused at an imposing sideboard like most of the speakers furnishings it was a vagabonds design made of thin strips of wood and painted cloth the skill of the painters had given it the look of polished wood and marble emptied of its contents the cupboard could be collapsed in moments put on a packhorse and carried to the next nights camp gilthas found it a fitting metaphor for his entire life for the life of every elf in the miserable tentcity planchet filled a clay cup with white nectar and handed it to his master gilthas accepted the cup but his attention was not on the drink well he asked ive spoken to the seers six of our people and two khurs they will try to ascertain lady kerianserays whereabouts and wellbeing assuming shes alive gilthas whispered then flinched as though saying the words would draw doom down upon his wife sire you know as well as i the lady in question is very difficult to kill have faith if anyone can pull the minotaurs tails and escape to boast about it its kerianseray he said it lightly trying to coax a smile from gilthas planchet handed the speaker a small bowl of dates figs and nuts urging him to break his fast gilthas waved a hand telling his valet not to fuss that he would eat later you say that every time i offer you food planchet complained you cannot rule a nation on an empty stomach his calm insistenceexactly the tone one might use with a recalcitrant childcoupled with a paternal demeanor had the desired effect gilthas plucked a fig from the bowl and put it in his mouth happy he said smiling slightly around a mouthful of fruit very happy great speaker with that the longtime valet and sometime general of the royal guard withdrew a cheery rest well sire floating over his shoulder as he disappeared before the battle of sanction when hed put planchet in charge of the qualinesti troops gilthas had told him just how important he considered him to be friend advisor fatherfigure bodyguard planchet was all of that and more kerianseray was gilthass heart his love his life planchet hed come to realize was his strength the firm center in the swirling chaos of their lives gilthas lifted the cup to his lips again his hand trembled nettled by the sight he drank quickly draining the cup the nectar was young and raw inclining to sourness no one could make good wine while in headlong flight nectar like a nation needed stability to reach its full potential he poured another measure one had to make do with what one had he drained the cup again leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes the world was turned on its head filthy goblins prowled qualinost despoiling the forested lanes of kithkanans city great blustering minotaurs inhabited the crystal halls of silvanost the bulky monsters could scarcely fit through a typical elven doorwaywhat use would they have for an entire city to think such uncouth hands held the twin epitomes of grace culture and civilization the images in his mindor perhaps the raw winemade sickness rise in gilthass throat coughing he fought it down he chided himself for falling into that trap thinking that places made a nation cities and towers gardens and temples were only chattel what really mattered was life and the things that ensured life food water simple shelter those essentials must be secured if the elven race was to survive and his people would survive gilthas was determined on that point all else was mere vanity gilthas had brought his people out of the conflagration that engulfed qualinesti across the plains of dust to the supposed sanctuary of khur fate had delivered the throne of silvanesti into his hands when his cousin porthios speaker of the stars vanished porthioss son and successor silvanoshei was slain at the end of the war queen mother alhana grieving the death of her son had gone on a desperate search for porthios before leaving shed given into gilthass hands the crown of silvanesti out of the catastrophe of exile had come one of the greatest events in gilthass life in any elfs life the unification of two kingdoms sundered since the kinslayer war alhana a silvanesti and porthios a qualinesti had hoped their own marriage would bring the two nations together instead it had driven them further apart now against all odds the two nations were one again united in the person of gilthas himself once sneered at as the puppet king he was now known as gilthas pathfinder it was up to him to find the path to a permanent homewherever that might be temporarily pride could be sacrificed honor dispensed with treasure spent to hold the ancient race of the firstborn together he would treat with whomever he must even a rogue like sahimkhan one of the most conniving grasping humans hed ever met in a royal line known for black hearts sahims naked ambition and glowing greed stood out as exceptional with half his capital in ruins he dreamed of elven wealth flowing in to repair it but if it took treasure to buy sanctuary no matter how makeshift and uncomfortable for his exiled people then gilthas would use every scrap of steel and gold his subjects could raise treasure like buildings and land was expendable life was not once he had measured his life by the fleeting moments spent with kerian like a tempered blade she was bright sharp and deadly and must be handled with care not for her and gilthas were quiet comfort and gently murmured vows of love theirs was a marriage of opposites planchet had said onceafter a particularly rough day and too much potent nectarthat it was as if the gods had cleaved apart a single hero creating strong hotheaded kerianseray and thoughtful feeling gilthas their marriage had joined the two halves together again creating one person one soul she lived as certainly as he felt his own heartbeat gilthas knew kerian was not dead he hadnt realized he had fallen asleep until a noise suddenly jolted him awake the empty nectar bottle lay next to his chair the clay cup had fallen from his hand as he sat wondering how long hed dozed and what had awakened him the tent roof shook sending motes of dust down onto his head shouts arose outside a sirocco must have swept over the tent complex upsetting some of the less stable dwellings the sound of ripping cloth put the lie to that notion and brought the elf to his feet sunlight poured through the roof into his face as a sword sawed through the ceiling panel head fuzzy from wine and sleep gilthas stared at the bright sword point wondering how anyone could stand on the billowing roof the tent poles and stays surely could not bear the weight more shouting louder now came to his ears and the sword withdrew a masked figure garbed in dirty white robes dropped through the hole landing heavily but adroitly on fingers and toes beneath the figures khurish scarf a steel helmet gleamed at the same moment planchet burst through the tent flap sword at the ready behind him came a swarm of the speakers householders armed with everything from pikes to roasting spits gilthas held up a hand halting his bodyguard on the threshold he directed a wry look at the intruder lady youve holed my roof kerianseray caked with dust and dried blood straightened she yanked the dust mask from the lower half of her face and shoved her sword back in its scabbard heedless of the astonished planchet and the gaping looks of the others she leaned forward and kissed her consort warmly drawing back she exclaimed those damned silvanesti wouldnt let me in lord morillon and his cohorts steeped in the court protocol of silvanost did their best to control access to the speakereven barring the lioness when they could how did you get past them gilthas asked amused with one hand he cupped her smooth brown cheek hollowed by travail eagle eye he glanced up at the hole in the roof the griffon flashed past as he circled overhead theirs was a remarkable relationship with the lioness the fierce creature was tame as a kitten obeying her every word griffons usually bonded with a single rider from an early age and should that rider be lost never took kindly to another eagle eyes original rider had perished fighting the minotaurs against all odds the spirited beast had taken a liking to the lionessmost probably because they were two of a kind gilthas thought the speakers wouldbe rescuers dispersed and planchet went to fetch more nectar in the meantime kerian helped herself to an orange a fruit common to khurs seaside gardens she pulled off hood and helmet and raked a hand through her matted hair lord taranaths messenger just left heregilthas noted the angle of the sunlightless than an hour ago after hearing his report i feared for your safety his words seemed somehow to take away her joy at their reunion coughing the dust of khur from her throat she rasped yet i am safe and here i am when she said no more he asked about the rear guard hytanthas had mentioned the five hundred archers with whom she had made a stand against the minotaurs she answered they gave their lives for the rest of the army no others survived only you asked gilthas mystified she crushed the orange slice she held juice ran between her fingers it was not my choice before she could explain this strange statement planchet returned she filled a cup and moved away from her husband lapsing into sullen silence sensing the tension in the room planchet did not linger gilthas went to stand behind his wife close but not touching he could almost feel the angry emotion radiating from her like heat from the khurish sun i rejoice to see you my love he said softly im not happy to be here gil i should have fallen with my warriors on the last word her voice broke and he would have held her then but she made no move toward him did not turn only drank deeply from her cup he asked what had happened and still she was silent for a longtime at last with an abrupt shake of her head she said i dont want to talk about it its done we must honor our dead by resuming the campaign the bullmen will pay she gripped her cup so tightly her knuckles showed white gilthas gave up the attempt to comfort her and returned to his chair frowning somehow it was a little easier to say what he must while sitting in the royal throne raising his voice slightly he forbade his wife to return south the plan to invade silvanesti gilthas declared was over she whirled a wild look in her eyes youre quitting the fight why gilthas kept his own voice even again and again its proven a waste of lives battling the minotaurs i have a more important task for you what more important task is there than fighting our enemies finding a home for our people her laugh was sharp and dismissive this was an old argument one they were having more often these days kerianseray her warriors and many silvanesti nobles among the exiles wanted to win back the lands lost to the invaders gilthas believed this a pointless dream his peoples only hope was to find a new homeland one free of minotaurs bandits goblins and greedy humans he stood and beckoned her to follow to one side of the wide circular room was an assortment of chests and cupboards containing official documents theyd saved from qualinost he unlocked a metalstrapped box and drew out a long rolled parchment one of my scribes found this in the grand souks he paid eight steel for it a high price unrolled the parchment proved to be a map a drawing of khur from the beaches of balifor bay to the wall of mountains stretching from kern in the north to blode in the south kerians disappointment was acute her husband possessed innumerable maps and charts his scribes visited the souks every day spending precious steel and asking about maps initially she had been encouraged by his efforts assuming he was seeking information that would aid them in their quest to retake their homelands but after months when nothing useful had turned up she lost interest as he spread the curling parchment with both hands gilthas told her eagerly that the scribe whod found it had haggled the price down from fifteen steel such negotiation was the norm in khurish souks there would be loud discussion much shaking of heads and gesticulating the buyer pretending to walk away two or three times before at last a price was settled a deal struck this isnt just any map he assured her its almost two hundred years old she considered the curled parchment more carefully the detail on it was indeed amazing with dry wadis and oases marked in the lower right corner where the cartographer would usually sign his work was a peculiar sigil a stylized bird with drooping wings drawn in black ink kerian leaned in to study the map and as she did so gilthas felt the power barely leashed radiating from her like body heat or the smell of her sweat they were so often apart he tended to forget how her presence overwhelmed him kerianseray was the most exciting woman he had ever known their eyes met and gilthas saw again the brilliant captivating warrior shed been before defeat exile and privation had hollowed her face hardened her views and etched bitterness in her eyes despite their arguments he loved her still he regretted their growing estrangement they disagreed constantly as the years went byon policy on strategy seemingly on everything as his silent regard continued kerian opened her mouth to speak but her words were interrupted planchet returned just then to inquire whether they needed anything more gilthas waved the valet inside and had him hold the right edge of the scroll with his freed hand gilthas tapped a spot in the northern reaches of khur a place where the khalkist mountains split enclosing a horseshoeshaped valley although it was not distinguished in any way on the map gilthas smiled as his finger brushed this spot this is the valley of the blue sands he said lowering his voice as though wary of eavesdroppers called by khurish nomads the breath of the gods planchets surprise was wordless not so the lionesss ive heard you talk of this place i thought it only a legend where did you get this map i believe it came from a temple archive when khurikhan was sacked many libraries were looted and their contents ended up in the souks he tapped the spot again i am convinced the valley is real and this is its true location the valley of the blue sands was reputed to have a mild balmy climate quite unlike the rest of khur annals from the libraries of qualinost mentioned it calling it inathwakenti vale of silence shielded by mountains it was said to be one of the few spots in the world unchanged since the first cataclysm elven chronicles even mentioned it as a place where the gods once dwelled scholars disagreed on what this meant some took it as literal truth others contended it was metaphorical the people of khur were just as divided in their opinions in khurikhan the valley of the blue sands was regarded as nothing more than a myth a strange place where the normal conditions they knewheat blazing sun eternal droughtwere turned upside down cityfolk used it as a setting for absurd bedtime stories for their children in the valley according to the stories clouds clung to the ground instead of the sky stones grew like plants animals talked liked men khurs nomads on the other hand did not doubt the valleys existence none had ever been there but they believed the ancient tales fervently with great secrecy gilthas had been assembling information about the inathwakenti for over a year he believed it could be the future home of the elven nation kerian asked what makes you think the valley is there ive collected six other maps of the regionkhurish nerakan even some old solamnic maps from the libraries of qualinost none of them shows this particular horseshoeshaped configuration of the mountains i think i know why he paused as planchet poured them both another measure of nectar kerian despite her skepticism found herself caught by his evident conviction she waved off planchets offer of drink and urged her husband to continue the other maps are all copies of copies of copies gilthas said this map is an original the human who drew it knew of inathwakenti because hed been there himself he could give no plausible explanation for why later copyists would omit the valley saying only everyone in khurikhan speaks of the place lightly even the city priests dismiss it as a legendall but one i dont know whether the spot is cursed or blessed but i intend to find out kerianseray suddenly realized what was coming you want me to go there she said he nodded the smile returning to his face her next words chased it away again gil she said this valley is nothing more than a romantic fable even if it were real it isnt our homeland and never can be the lands of our ancestors are lost we do not have the strength to regain themnot yet that time will come my love but for now for the near future we must dwell in a land of our own and not live by the grace of the khurs this forgotten valley could be our best hope its a pretty dream i admit but nonetheless a complete waste of time give me twenty thousand warriors and i will set the frontiers of our true homelands aflame we can take back what is ours his demeanor hardened and it was the speaker of the sun and stars not her husband who said firmly preparations for an expedition have begun i expect you to lead it general i see as you command great speaker the mocking words fell like lead weights at his feet she would have continued arguing but he cut her off ive chosen favaronas one of the foremost historians in my servicehed almost said in qualinostto accompany you you will lead an escort of five hundred warriors she frowned questioning the wisdom of sending so small a party gilthas reminded her that the mission was exploration not conquest exploration she repeated this is a wildgoose chase we should return to the thonthalas and raise the people of silvanesti against the minotaurs i have made my decision the matter is closed planchet devoutly wishing he were elsewhere glanced from monarch to general husband to wife the burden of recent days was taking its toll never had he heard so open and bitter a breach between them you are speaker of the sun and stars twill do my duty the lioness said at last there was no sarcasm in her voice but her tone was icy she made as if to go but gilthas relaxing in the face of her agreement forestalled her you need not begin the journey just yet i have another task i wish you to undertake right away one for which you are uniquely qualified she brightened and in her expression he saw visions of daring raids on griffonback the clash of steel on steel the speaker smiled benignly at his bold general i need you to visit a priestess the bed trembled composed of rope netting stretched between four posts and topped by a thin cottonstuffed mattress it tended to shake with little provocation gilthas ever cautious opened his eyes and silently took in the situation his private quarters were lit by the soft light of a blue bullseye lamp which hung from the tent post by the door the simple canvas stools and chairs around the bed were empty kerianseray lay by his side face down rigid as a statue her hands balled into hard fists gripped the mattress every few seconds her whole body shook he touched her shoulder lightly trying to ease her out of the dream her skin was dry and fever hot she did not wake he murmured her name several times but still she did not rouse when he laid his hand on her cheek she sprang to life rolling over so hard and fast she knocked him from the bed he rolled out of the way as his wife fought unseen enemies he heard the bedsheet tear in her hands kerian he yelled wake up she sat bolt upright breathing hard gil youre here she said hoarsely peering at him through the tangled curtain of her hair youre in khurinost my love in our bedchamber you were dreaming at the head of the bed on gilthass side was a cupboard on which sat a jug of tepid water and a tin basin kerian sloshed water into the basin and bathed her face gilthas came up behind her hesitated a second then wrapped her in his arms she leaned back pressing her head into the hollow of his neck were you battling minotaurs he asked she nodded but didnt explain further he suggested a burden shared is a burden lightened it took time but eventually she gave in telling a dreadful tale her pain was palpable in the darkened room and gilthas had to force himself to remain quiet so as not to interrupt the flow of her story it took the bullmen less than an hour to overrun us we killed some but it was like trying to halt an avalanche with arrows she began what came after took much longer the elves who survived grievously wounded or not were bound hand and foot holes were dug one for each captive and the elves dropped in then the minotaurs fell to arguing amongst themselves some wanted to bury the elves facing their lost homeland others thought it would be better to have them looking out into the wider desert their backs perpetually turned to silvanesti the latter faction won out the minotaurs filled in the holes leaving only the elves heads exposed twentynine silvanesti were left to dieof heat and thirst if they were lucky if predators found them their fate would be much more terrible gilthas lowered his chin to her shoulder and you he murmured they knew i commanded but didnt know i was the lioness of qualinesti wife of the speaker of the sun and stars because i was the commander they tied my hands and feet and threw me onto eagle eyes back the minotaur warlord told kerian to carry word to her people that silvanesti was theirs no longer and that should the elves come again they would find nothing but graves with that they whipped the griffons flanks sending him catapulting into the sky wisely the bullmen had hobbled eagle eyes foreclaws and muzzled his beak with leather straps all he could do was fly away with kerian draped ingloriously over his back the griffon flew some distance before kerian could work her gag free and convince him to alight she tumbled off rolling across the trackless sand loyal eagle eye clawed at her bonds until she could break free in turn she tore off his restraints they had little choice but to fly on after midnight they came to an oasis near the coast four of taranaths warriors lay in the sand a hundred paces from the well wounded theyd died of thirst within sight of water kerian replenished her arms and armor from the fallen rested eagle eye briefly at the oasis and took wing once more by the time day broke she and her mount were within sight of khurinost gilthass eyes closed in pain yet the litany of horror was not quite done for a moment i considered flying on she said past this stinking pile of tents away from khur our pitiful people and even you i thought i would fly to the homeland of the minotaurs find the palace of their king and challenge him to single combat you couldnt do that he meant she would never leave him or her people but she misunderstood no his guards would cut me down long before i reached the king burying his face in her hair gilthas said im glad you came back wife she surprised him then breaking free of his loving embrace she whirled to face him i should have died with my warriors she declared voice trembling the bullmen shamed me i wasnt even worth killing they let me live just to spread their message of fear he reminded her that while dead heroes were inspiring only living leaders could save the elven race could lead them to a new home he tried to soothe her whispering that inathwakenti would be their sanctuary a place where they could heal and grow strong against the day when they would again make their presence known in the world once more his words had an unintended effect kerian made a sound of disgust and stomped away that damned valley again better to water the forests of silvanesti in minotaur blood than chase your myth better to die as my brave archers did than flee yet again from our enemies battering your head against a stone wall is foolish he snapped then stopped consciously mastering his anger seating himself on the edge of the bed he said if fate is kind our people will return to silvanost and qualinost one day but not today and not tomorrow gilthas had spies among sahimkhans retainers men with contacts in delphon and other smaller towns along the coast their reports told him that a day did not pass without minotaur ships rounding habbakuks necklace bound for the silvanesti coast their holds groaned under the weight of armored troops sent to reinforce the army already occupying the elves homeland fl a grip of steel the speaker could not hope to vanquish such foes not now he told kerian all these things adding to all things there is an appointed time the time to liberate our lost lands is not yet she circled the end of the bed and sank onto the other side of the mattress instead i go to the high priestess of the temple of elirsafla and ask for her help in finding your mythical valley dont you ever tire of asking humans for favors give us land give us food give us water is elven honor extinct seated back to back their bed so narrow they were nearly touching husband and wife stared in opposite directions they might as well have been miles apart the lioness was flushed with fury her hands clenched into fists gilthass face blurred by tiredness was pale his jaw stiff with tension he finally said no lady elven honor is not dead merely stored like the great archive of qualinost against the day when we can afford to display it again both of them lay down after a moment gilthas reached a hand out but she edged away curling up on the side of the bed as far away as possible that was how they fell asleepkerian curled in on herself facing away from her husband and gilthas face up one hand outstretched toward her stiff back chapter hard edges thats where things is clearest where land and sky come together cleanly with nothing in between a man can see whats what and whos who good and evil are obvious they say the sea is like that the desert is too the guide the very opposite of the usual taciturn nomad folded his hands across his horses neck and continued to expound his philosophy his audience of one riding a few steps behind made no reply prince shobbat of khur was only half listening sunrise was an hour past and already the heat was intense shobbat adjusted the brim of his broad felt hat and told himself for the hundredth time that his goal was worth this suffering as far as shobbat could see in all directions was sand broken rock and scattered boulders bleached to a uniform shade of tan by the unflinching sun no color at all relieved the trail northwest from khurikhan into the trackless wastes that made up most of the realm of khur no shade either only hard light by day and perfect starry blackness at night surveying the desolation around him shobbat wondered if there wasnt something to the windbag nomads notions after all devoid of trees and buildings the vista certainly was pristine in green lands theres trees grass and the like sprouting out of the dirt to tie air and land together his guide was saying clouds in the sky are the breath of growing things fogging the air underfoot theres nothing but corruption worms beetles and rot spreading over the land like a mantle of decay shobbat grunted eyes squinted nearly closed against the glare youre a poet no my lord a nomad ive known the hard edges all my life the guides name was wapah so dry and leatherlike was his face that he might have been any age from thirty to sixty his beard was long and the same flat brown color as the sand plaited into the hair on his head were thin reed staves that supported the light cloth shade protecting his head and neck spiders were embroidered around the hem of the dirty linen cloth the blackandorange leaping sand spider was the symbol of wapahs clan a single bite from the creature could kill a man in minutes or rot the leg off a healthy horse in a day under brows so thick they were plaited into tiny braids wapahs eyes were pale gray this was an unusual hue among khurs but not unknown in wapahs clan grayeyed nomads did not wear the perpetual squint of other desertdwellers wideeyed in a land of killing glare the people of the leaping spider clan seemed more intensely aware of their surroundings many were seers and given to visions and for this reason nomads like wapah were called mirroreyed prince shobbat eldest son of sahim khan of khur was not nearly so prepossessing past thirty he was as a court wit once said bearded and bland he wore a loose linen tunic tucked into riding trousers of the same material and tall dark leather boots the yellow and red sash at his middle did not as he intended hide his princely paunch but merely accentuated it in the same vein the beginnings of jowls were poorly concealed by his short black beard when his father was shobbats age hed already been khan for ten years all the prince had accomplished thus far was to eat a great deal drink a great deal and pursue a great many comely women this journey represented his first significant foray beyond the walls of khurikhan it had been prompted by a broken wall and a cryptic stone tablet after the vanishing of the moons the dragon malystryx claimed and occupied khur repeated attacks by the red overlord had left the khuri yl nor heavily damaged after malys was overthrown sahimkhan gave his eldest son the task of overseeing repairs on the palace it was a dull thankless job until one day the laborers demolishing a cracked wall in the south wing had come upon a stone tablet hidden in a niche inside the blocks shobbat immediately set a team of scholars to translating the tablet it wasnt easy the text was written in hieratic istarian a difficult priestly script reserved for the theocratic elite of that lost land but working in three teams of two the six scholars completed the translation in a dozen days shobbat collected the translations found they agreed then had the scholars slain he regretted having to order their deaths as he respected learning but he could not risk anyone finding out what they had discovered hed seen to it their deaths were quick and painless scholars were always thirsty to celebrate the completion of their work he sent each of them a special vintage doctored with arsenic it slaked their thirsts permanently the deaths were attributed to cultists and soon forgotten in secrecy the prince made plans he sent trusted men to the grand souks to find a desert guide wapah was the result mirroreyed nomads had a reputation as peerless navigators of the sands the nomad did not question why a pampered prince wished to travel to an obscure point more than two days ride northwest of the city for ten fine steel swords and a like number of stallions handpicked from the khans own herd wapah would have guided prince shobbat to the bottom of the blood sea hard edges the guide repeated they make men strong and straight allow them to see clear and to know what dwellers in green lands never know shobbat obligingly asked what that might be the will of those on high shobbat hid a smile not wanting to antagonize a man on whom his life depended alone among all the peoples of the world the desert nomads had never stopped worshiping their old gods sahimkhan always said this was because the unfettered sun boiled away their few wits shobbats father sneered at the nomads because he feared them nine times in the violent history of khur the reigning khan had been slain in battles against his own desertdwelling subjects sahimkhan had no intention of being the tenth the laddad came here from the green lands shobbat said it is written they drew forth the first life from the land and their mages can make stone itself blossom they do not make this land green wapahs phrasing was ambiguous but shobbat did not ask him to explain their horses had topped a long high dune sculpted by wind into the shape of a great curling wave and a blast of southwesterly air flung grit in their faces the prince coughed and spat but his saliva never reached the ground the dry air swallowed it wapah cautioned him not to waste precious water the nomad kicked the flanks of his shortlegged pony and started down the windward face of the dune shobbat glared after him he reached back and gave a reassuring pat to the skins of water lashed to the saddle under his gauzy cloak the old nomad was just trying to frighten him if they reached their destination in the time promised they had plenty of water wind rapidly erased wapahs tracks in the soft sand shobbat urged his mount on if he lost his guide he was doomed the desert would swallow him as completely as it had his spit they had entered an area of sand dunes broken at intervals by intrusions of ancient rock the rock was layered horizontally in shades of brown and tan shobbat grimaced what a harsh ugly land he missed the teeming streets of khurikhan thick with the scents of cinnamon and cardamom of sandalwood and yes of unwashed humanity the emptiness of the desert made him feel small and unimportant he was unaccustomed to such thoughts and they frightened him fear made him angry wapah had drawn a loosely woven scrap of cloth across his face to keep out the blowing dust he returned to his earlier theme explaining how the hard edges of the desert taught his people about truth and made them spiritually superior to outsiders it was unclear whether he meant only those from outside khur or citydwellers like the prince as well we did not fear when the vanishing came the nomad declared our gods were not points of light in the sky but beings immortal and unchanging they never left us they guard us still blown sand stung the exposed flesh of shobbats cheeks like a thousand shards of glass he turned his face away was everyone else in the world wrong when they thought the gods departed he asked testily wapah shrugged one shoulder who knows what godless barbarians think on they rode the nomad talking the prince of khur riding in uncomfortable silence in spite of wapahs talk of the deserts hard edges the land had begun to look molten and soft to shobbat the terrific heat smelted the air itself causing everything to shimmer and blur both horses grunted deep in their chests resenting the task they were obliged to perform every two hundred steps the duo paused for water two swallows for each beast and one for each man as wapah prescribed once the sun climbed to its zenith even the nomad fell silent the air was too dry for speech shobbats narrow dark lips so like his mothers cracked smears of blood stained the gauze scarf covering his nose and mouth just after midday they reached the first landmark on wapahs itinerary a shelf of stone rising out of the sand to a height greater than the mounted men pointed at one end and rounded at the other the prominence was known as the tear of elirsana named for the divine healer unlike the monotonous sand or the unvarying hues of other rocks the tear of elirsana presented a bold colorful sight it was composed of multicolored layers of rock some were as orange as a sunset others ash gray blueblack or creamy yellow the eastern face was deeply grooved by generations of windborne sand from tip to rounded end the perfect teardrop was thirty feet in length a spring bubbled from a cleft on the west side of the tear according to legend the spring had been born from the tears of the goddess elirsana when she had collapsed here halfdead from exhaustion wapah announced they would refill their waterskins here the water was said to have healing powers although it certainly slaked shobbats thirst he found the taste nothing out of the ordinary after filling his two empty skins the prince struggled back to his horse through the fine drifted sand his booted toe caught on something hidden just beneath the surface and he fell forward the full skins slung around his neck dragged him down cursing he sat up and glared at the object that had tripped him it was a skull clean dry and yellowed it was not human what unholy thing is this wapah leaned down from his saddle and peered at the find dragonman a draconian skull shobbats annoyance vanished as he studied it more closely the cranium was wide and triangular fangs as long as shobbats thumb sprouted from the upper jaw and there was a horny beak like that of a monstrous bird the skull was half again as big as a human head and on its rear were several parallel gougescuts from a blade most likely a warrior the prince said standing and dusting sand from his long coat a scout in search of water he found it but never left the desert takes no prisoners shobbat did not point out this draconian appeared to have died by the sword not from exposure mounted once more shobbat spotted something imbedded in a stratum of the tear he drew the dagger from his sash and jabbed at the rock fragments cascaded around his horses hooves wapah frowned at this wanton destruction but kept silent the prince had uncovered a yellow stone protruding from a layer of similarly colored sandstone is this a shell he exclaimed the object looked very like the top half of a clam wapah shook his head only a stone shaped by chance a jest of the gods the prince disagreed he speculated the sea might once have covered this part of khur wapah immediately dismissed this notion it is told in the song the land of khur is the oldest of the world the first solid ground created by the gods the nomad said flatly it has never been under water the song was sacred to the nomads a collection of legends from the distant past it contained thousands of verses too many for anyone to memorize entirely so it was divided into eight cantos each named for one of the great gods of the nomads kargath the warrior rakaris the hunter torghan the avenger elirsana the healer anthor the hermit habrar the messenger soro the firemaker and ayyan the deceiver wapah was a singer of the anthor canto the two men rode on progress became more difficult as the horses had to plow through bellydeep sand wapahs shortlegged gray animal more accustomed to such terrain kept a steady pace shobbats elegant chestnut its long legs meant for speed floundered as a result sundown had come and gone by the time they reached their destination like the tear of elirsana shobbats goal was an island of stone in an ocean of moving sand rather than a single formation it comprised a thick column of gray stone forty feet in height ringed close around by four black granite towers only half as tall the four angled inward their tops touching the central column pale starlight gave the formation an eerie feel like an ancient and forgotten temple the tablet found in the ruins of the khuri yl nor had spoken of this strange formation as an ancient oracle it was said there were passages and a cave in the central spire the cave was the princes destination the wind died with the sunset the air quickly lost the heat of day and grew cold but warmth still radiated from the broiled sand shobbat dismounted and rummaged through his saddlebags knowing there would be no wood for torches hed brought a small brass lamp he knelt and placed the lamp on the sand then struck flint on steel to light the wick wapah asked his intentions when shobbat said he planned to enter the formation the nomad put heels to his horses flanks and moved quickly to the crouching prince nothing was said of entering he said you must not do not disturb the spirits of this place i didnt come here just to view the sights what i seek is within a cascade of sparks fell from his flint and shobbat concentrated on coaxing the flame to life as he adjusted the wick he heard a scrape of metal wapah had drawn his weapon a narrow sword bare of crossguard the style preferred by most nomads you dare draw on me i am your prince wapah was a motionless silhouette the feeble lamplight did not reach his face and his expression was hidden by the night if i rode away what would you do youd never make it back to your city he murmured for the first time shobbat felt a flicker of uncertainty he quickly quashed it falling back on all the arrogance and assurance of his privileged upbringing my whereabouts are known fool he snapped if i do not return for whatever reason your entire clan will be hunted down and destroyed this was a lie no one in khurikhan knew where shobbat was the prince didnt trust anyone enough for that for a long moment they gazed at each other the pampered prince and the talkative nomad then wapah sheathed his sword and bowed his head let those on high judge you i shall not shobbat picked up his lamp his brief fear forgotten sentimentalists thats what these nomads were theyd ride to their deaths shouting for joy but threaten their families and they crumbled exploiting that weakness allowed shobbats father to rule them sahimkhan was the least sentimental man in the world the prince labored through the deep sand to the base of the formation the central column seemed enormously high rising towerlike against the starry sky around its base lay shards of black granite shivered off the surrounding spires shobbat was grateful for the firmer footing they provided the flickering light of his lamp showed no inscriptions carvings or any indication of intelligent handiwork only rough windworn granite twothirds of the way around from his starting point he found an opening at ground level in the third black column his heartbeat quickened the roughly square entrance was partially blocked by drifted sand and the prince had to drop to his knees to enter a passage rose into the column of stone steps had been cut in the dense granite spiraling around the wall at last evidence of an intelligent hand the information on the tablet was again proven correct shobbat drew a jeweled dagger from his sash and started up the steps the dark air seemed to absorb the weak glow of his lamp with his eyes adjusted to the dim light the darkness beyond seemed even more intense the dry clean air of the desert outside had given way to a rank fetid aroma that grew stronger as he climbed the amber light showed gray splotches on the wall bat droppings and dried guano crunched beneath his boots the presence of living creatures so deep in the desert was curious what did they live on as he drew closer to the top shobbat saw that the ceiling of the hollow spire seemed to writhe thousands of bats were clustered tightly together across the roughhewn surface he could almost feel their tiny black eyes on him glaring at the intruder who dared penetrate their abode a few of the creatures dropped from their inverted perches and fluttered by his head shobbat pressed his back against the wall and covered his eyes with one arm waiting for the bats to pass the irregular steps on which he trod had become narrower as he ascended here near the top they were deep enough only to accommodate the front half of his foot a misstep and hed go crashing to the floor below he had encountered no landings or side chambers along the way just a continuing inward spiral of rutted steps watching the bats circle away and vanish through a black crevice at the top of the steps shobbat had to smile so there was an upper chamber continuing upward he reached an arched opening low enough that he had to stoop to pass through outside a breeze whistled around the tops of the spires the air was remarkably cold and it refreshed him like a draft of new wine after the rank odor of the interior from ground level it had appeared the tops of the four shorter spires touched the central column in fact there was a gap of some six feet between shobbats perch and the central column bridging the gap was a slab of black granite it was barely wider than shobbats two feet but he wobbled across both arms held out to maintain his balance he had not come so far to be stopped by his dislike of high places on the other side a round opening penetrated the central pinnacle he halted at the opening and brought the lamp in close two lines of writing were chiseled into the gray rock curving around the top edge of the entrance although the spelling was archaic the words were in the common tongue the roots of the tree are deep i shall live again it made little sense to shobbat but echoed what the scholars in khurikhan had translated from the tablet he stepped through the opening and found himself in a large cave the floor was paved with a polished black stone the walls and distant ceiling were gray granite as far as he could tell the chamber was empty he shouted a few times without visible result wind gusted against his back sending his hat winging away and extinguishing his lamp he wavered offbalance in the sudden blackness enter visitor shobbat pivoted in a full circle but could not find the source of the low voice whos there he called the one you came to find said the voice then added a lilting phrase in a language shobbat did not understand brilliant light flooded the cave blinding the prince with a cry he dropped both knife and lamp and covered his aching eyes a sound no desertdweller could mistake came to his ears the beguiling splash of water he lowered his hands blinking squinting he beheld an impossible scene the cavern was lit as brightly as noonday in the desert but the air was cool and fresh even more astonishing a fine tree towered over shobbat its branches spreading to the high roof of the cave knowing only the palms and succulents of khur the prince could not identify it its trunk was at least three feet in diameter the bark graygreen and rough its dark green leaves were shaped like the shields carried by nomad warriorslong and narrow rounded on one end and pointed on the other shobbat stood staring dumbly upward he had never seen such a tree before and it was plainly impossible for its like to grow inside a closed cavern shut off from the sun no one has sought me out in an age your question must be grave shobbats gaze dropped from the magnificent tree to the old man sitting crosslegged at its base he was thin draped in linen rags the color of old parchment white hair fine as floss hung to his shoulders his skin was lined and darkened by time and the elements he was obviously blind his closed eyelids shriveled and sunken are you the oracle of the tree asked the prince long bony fingers gestured to the empty air there is no other a breeze set the trees leaves to shivering in the periphery of the cave shobbat saw movement but when he turned to look in that direction there was no one to be seen alarmed he retrieved the dagger he had dropped and demanded to know who else was present the ancient turned his head slightly left and right then shrugged we are alone shobbat insisted hed seen movement those are images of the past and future not living beings the dismissive tone infuriated shobbat the haughty prince drew himself up announcing his name and rank the old man was not impressed makes no difference who you are in any event ive been expecting you expecting me how i am not fixed in time like mortal men i live equally in past present and future thus i know you seek the throne of your father sahimkhan of khur shobbat snorted what prince doesnt is that the extent of your augury you need do nothing to achieve your goal prince of khur outlive your father and the throne is yours bah he intends to live forever shobbats petulant expression became harder more resolute and he added he treats with nerakans ogres and minotaurs seeking to enlarge his realm and he allows foreigners to enter our country all he sees is the gold and steel they bring but his dalliances will destroy khur he does not deserve the throne the prince again saw movement out of the corner of his eye again when he looked directly at it it vanished he shifted from one foot to the other gripping the hilt of his dagger nervously my father has granted asylum to the exiled elves he said he intends to use them as pawns to limit the influence of the knights of neraka i need to knowwill he succeed the knights will not rule in khur shobbat blinked in surprise he had expected a more cryptic response but this was welcome clarity yet your house will not rule long son of sahim if the children of kithkanan are permitted to remain in khur that too was plainspeaking yet not so welcome heedless of his audiences reaction the oracle continued the elder race can win this land not with sword and fire but by greening the desert he opened his left hand revealing a green shoot sprouting from his palm it is their peculiar gift to bring life to lifelessness shobbats dark eyes narrowed a flush of fury mantling his face above his beard i will not allow it khur does not belong to the laddad the throne will be mine so it will be noble prince for nine and ninety days that will be the length of your reign shobbat stalked forward determined to wring a different fate from the scrawny old prophet he reached out for the oracles neck then froze in horror before his eyes the sages skin became translucent muscle bone and vein stood out clearly and the face was no longer human the jaw had narrowed grown pointed the cheeks were hollow the eye sockets high and arched the prince recoiled from the ghastly sight his anger freezing into fear what are you old seer he whispered the oracle ignored the question empty eye sockets turning to stare directly at the prince he said life has branches like the great tree and each choice represents a fork you have one chance prince of khur it is vital that you keep the children of kithkanan out of the valley of the blue sands if you do their seed will wither in the wasteland shobbat shook his head wondering whether he had heard properly the valley of the blue sands was nothing more than a childs fable what could such a myth have to do with the laddad or with his success as khan the burning need to know overcame his fear and he lifted his dagger demanding an explanation the word has been given twill say no more the oracle told him go the final command echoed through the cavern as the sage vanished in a pulse of white light when the glare subsided to a bearable level the halfseen figures in the far edges of the cave solidified and shobbat could finally see them for what they were horrified backing hastily away he stabbed at them with his dagger it was no use they crowded in upon him hands outstretched claws gleaming mouths agape shobbat screamed outside seated on the sand wapah heard the cry a cloud of bats poured from one of the black granite towers the horses snorted and pawed the ground as the bats chittered overhead weaving and dodging debris fell around the nomad landing lightly on the sand wapah picked up one of the fragments it was a leaf dark and supple such leaves did not come from any tree wapah had ever seen growing in khur yet the sand below the flying bats was littered with them and more continued to flutter down like green rain wapah pressed the leaf between his palms and begged anthor the hermit to protect him from the fell magic that obviously inhabited this place a somber and solitary deity anthor nonetheless favored his desert children they lived on the hard edges where men and gods could see eye to eye the task gilthas had given kerian was straightforward enough pay a call on saida high priestess of the temple of elirsana in khurikhan however his insistence that she leave eagle eye behind precipitated another argument he didnt wish his wife to draw unnecessary attention to herself by arriving at the temple door astride a royal silvanesti griffon for her part kerian believed that the awe eagle eye inspired in humans prevented a lot of needless wrangling with guards and petty officials the bickering continued until gilthas flatly ordered her to ride a horse he seemed to be doing that a lot latelyending their disagreements by issuing peremptory royal commands tightlipped the lioness obeyed she took as her sole companion captain hytanthas ambrodel gilthas viewed this as yet another sign of her contrariness he certainly did not expect her to go without an appropriate escort lord taranath and the balance of the army had not yet returned to khurinost but a suitable complement could have been found the lioness refused citing gilthass own stricture about not alarming the khurs and he could hardly argue against his own logic elves were generally accepted in khurikhan as was any cash customer lone elves sometimes earned glares especially outside the broadminded venues of the city markets but nothing beyond that gilthas had matters of state to attend to but delayed long enough to watch his wife depart with young ambrodel at her side clad in fresh tunic and trews kerian had disdained khurish attire preferring her own wilder garb over the more comfortable local fashion captain ambrodel was more practical he wore a white geb over fawncolored qualinesti trousers carefully arranging the folds of the desert garment to conceal the hilt of his sword the midafternoon sun bathed kerians blonde head in a nimbus of white fire as always gilthas could not help but be struck by her beauty yet her grim expression was strikingly at odds with her loveliness her mood had grown worse since her return it wasnt only their clashes that accounted for this the loss of her command and her humiliation at the hands of the bullmen still gnawed at her shed not told anyone else what had happened and rumors had begun to circulate in camp the lionesss courage was well known but it could only be seen as odd that she had returned apparently unscathed from a battle in which all of her command had been lost perhaps she was deep in thought pondering the mission hed given her or perhaps she was concentrating on guiding her mount through the perils of the crowded tent city whatever the reason although gilthas waited kerian never glanced back at him when at last she was lost to sight around a bend in the lane he returned to his tent scouts from taranaths command had arrived in advance of the main body of the army and they had much news to impart as kerian and her aide passed through the tumult of the tent city each noticed very different things hytanthas saw couragecommon people struggling to live in a hostile foreign place and beginning to succeed the lioness saw only injusticethe most ancient race in the world forced from their rightful homes and made to suffer ignominiously in this terrible wilderness like the roots of a tree the environs of khurinost were tangled having grown haphazardly according to the lay of the land and the whims of its builders sahimkhan had given the elves permission to set up a camp outside his capital he had given them little else exhausted sick sunburned and parched the elves cobbled together whatever shelter they could making tents out of everything from silken cloth to horse blankets to canvas sails formerly used by ships plying the bay of balifor desert winds and errant embers from cookfires had taken a steady toll on the makeshift habitations but as days became months and months grew into years the elves learned to do better the flimsy tents acquired wooden doorways brass fireboxes and chimneys and carpets to cover the sand wide central streets were left open to the broiling sun to allow carts and mounted elves to pass and to bring in fresh air but the rest the miles of narrow twisting passages between tents great and small were roofed with rush mats woven from the knifeedged grass that grew along the seaside below the city the result was a warren no stranger could hope to navigate the very antithesis of the elven love of order and beauty but the confusing maze of streets and passages also served as an effective defense against interlopers ahead some forty yards beyond the edge of khurinost the wall of khurikhan rose its western face washed by the afternoon sun kerian lifted her gaze from the tentcity and studied the wall sahimkhans first priority after the fall of malystryx was to rebuild his citys defenses until these were complete his capital was vulnerable the northern and western sectors had been repaired first in those directions lay the greatest threats the knights of neraka and the ogres of kern the elves lived under sahims watchful eye penned in by the city wall on one side and the pitiless desert on the other the lioness recognized sahimkhans sanctuary as both a gift and a trap if the elves enemies moved against them now there would be no escape for the firstborn trapped she muttered general hytanthas asked but she only shook her head a sextet of heavily armed humans guarded the west gate they wore broadbrimmed helmets styled after the sun hats worn by nomads but wrought in iron their cuirasses cuisses and greaves were of nerakan pattern for many years khurish soldiers had hired themselves out as mercenaries to the knights the soldiers also wore a coiled dragon device on their breastplates marking them as members of the khur tribe although the khurs had given their name to the country they were only one of the seven tribes of the desert named for the seven sons of keja who had first united the desertdwellers into a single nation centered on the natural fortress of khurikhan the khur tribe had come to dominate the others both in war and trade all the khans of khur had begun as princes of the khur tribe the guards had no trouble recognizing the elf general dressed in kagonesti leathers golden head bare to the brilliant sun kerianseray was hard to miss the tallest khur sketched an awkward salute it was a nerakan habit they had not fully mastered kerian acknowledged the gesture with a slight nod and kept moving plunging into the heavy shadow of the gate the gate was enormously thick a full sixteen feet of stone compared to the blazing desert outside the tunnel was black as a dragons heart and the lioness blinked rapidly her eyes adjusting to the sudden loss of light the khurs had nothing with which to build but crumbly sandstone and soft limestone from the cliffs overlooking the bay of balifor to protect this weak stone they applied a veneer of large glazed tiles to the inner and outer surfaces of their walls when maintained this coating strengthened the stone and made it impervious to wind and rain many buildings were covered by tiles glazed in creamy or golden tones but some were quite colorful in bold primary hues or multicolored hues like patchwork quilts at the other end of the tunnel the two elves were greeted by a riotous mix of colors sounds and smells that was utterly foreign this was the fabazz or lesser souk the citys market for spices incense and foodstuffs streams of smoke from charcoal grills mingled with the odors of freshly butchered meat sizzling fat and drying herbs the aromas were not unpleasant but to an elf with senses far keener than any humans the sensations of the fabazz could be torturous the soukats or merchants converged on the newcomers waving samples of their wares the soukats of khur had welcomed the elves even more than their khan to them the world was divided into buyers and sellers whether the buyer was elf or human concerned them not at all all steel was equal and equally sought had they been on foot kerian and hytanthas might easily have been overwhelmed khurish traders were not noted for their reticence and in the fabazz their approach was practically an attack most of the merchandise here was perishable what wasnt sold today would have to be marked down for sale tomorrow or worse cast off great lady a soukat shoved a small bundle toward the lioness its smell so sharp that her horse sidestepped quickly buy these spices the burning they bring to the tongue will be matched by the burning they incite in the heart of the one you love ignore him lady boomed another soukat mushra sells only street sweepings kandar has the best spices oils and resins in khur buy from kandar who weighs his goods honestly kandar is an infamous liar noble lady only teffik weighs truly and handpicks his spices each morning from the delphon caravans when kerian showed no sign of stopping the soukats redoubled their efforts soon her horse was rendered immobile by the gesticulating merchants hytanthas could make no headway either a live chicken squawking loudly and wings flapping was suddenly thrust in kerians face recoiling she planted a foot against the poulterers chest and shoved with all her strength the unlucky man was flung back against his fellows all of them crashed into their carts and went down in a clatter of tin pans and a flurry of squawking chickens wails of protest rose up from the soukats this was not how things were done in the fabazz a little shoving was commonplace but nothing this rough a number of soukats hefted pieces of the broken carts waving the staves at the elves the lioness ostentatiously drew her sword reluctant but loyal the captain did the same the khurs parted ranks and allowed the armed elves to pass by the time they emerged on the other side of the market ascending the stepped street there the lionesss face wore a fierce grimace and not for the altercation with the poulterer that she had found rather invigorating no her distaste was for the stench that now saturated her clothing the reek of the fabazz seemed to permeate her very skin she longed for a fountain so she might wash her hands and face but this was a vain hope khurikhan did not waste water on such displays the closely packed houses rebuilt after the depredations of malys and her minions looked bizarre to elven eyes some squat and square others taller and round they boasted a variety of tile patterns in the wealthier districts the more subdued shades of cream and gold predominated here alternating stripes of blue and white were common but poorer householders used whatever leftover tiles they could scrounge their homes might be speckled with any color in the rainboworange green red bright blue in addition since the people of khurikhan were taxed according to the length and breadth of their homes foundation most dwellings were wider at the top than at ground level when the lioness and hytanthas reached the top of the narrow winding street only a thin strip of blue sky was visible between the overhanging eaves at this hour most folks were at the souks aside from a bony gray cat the only sign of life was a faint chiming sound kerian led the way across to the lower end of the avenue called temple walk all of the major shrines of the city were located along this street which ran eastwest the khurs were mad with religion worshiping gods and demigods only vaguely familiar to outsiders all through the vanishing of the gods the great war and the fall of the dragons the khurs had clung to their faith halfway down its length the temple walk doglegged to the north skirting the immovable center of khurikhan the great artesian well known as naksafal the name was difficult to translate bottomless pool was the simplest rendering kerian had heard their trip did not take them that far only a short way down temple walk was their destination and the source of the chiming the temple of elirsana a stone wall surrounded the sacred enclosure only five feet high it was more decorative than defensive along its top was set a line of curved brass rods from each hung thin disks of the same metal when the air stirred the disks clattered against the rods creating a bright chorus of sound it was meant to mimic the gurgle of falling water but to kerian and hytanthas born and raised in the green land of qualinesti there was little resemblance still the sound was pretty and mysterious when the wall was out of sight the chiming seemed to emanate from the very air the wall enclosed a large courtyard paved with creamy limestone at the center of the courtyard sat the temple of elirsana it wasnt large but kerian thought it easily the most beautiful building in khurikhan it didnt compare to the great sanctuaries of qualinost of course but it had a certain panache built of purewhite marble the temple like the courtyard was partly in shadow flow when the sun was higher the pale stone of temple and courtyard reflected the light with neatly unbearable brilliance the perfectly square temple was surrounded by a colonnade the smooth white columns were narrower at the base than at the top echoing the odd construction of the citys houses capping the temple was a dome carved of a single block of palest blue marble a rare color for such stone at least thirtyfive feet in diameter the dome had been polished until it was no thicker than a fingernail how the khurs of old had made such a marvel much less raised it atop the temple was a question no one living could answer the metal gate was open and the two elves rode into the courtyard and dismounted kerian gave her reins over to hytanthas telling him hed have to wait for her outside males are not allowed inside this temple she said neither are weapons unfortunately she looped her sword belt over the pommel of her saddle and left her dagger still sheathed as well hytanthas reminded her that they must be out of the city by sunset she nodded that deadline was still hours away sahimkhan had decreed ostensibly for the elves own safety that no laddad could remain within the city from sunset to sunrise the lioness had strong opinions about sahim and his edicts but before she could give voice to them the scrape of iron caused her to whirl instantly on the alert four men in khurish attire had darted into the courtyard through the only opening in the wall over their linen gebs each wore an affrethe hooded anklelength robe favored by nomads of the high desert scarves concealed their faces leaving only their eyes visible each man held the nomads favorite weapon along narrowbladed sword with no cross guard the lioness had swiftly drawn her sword keep off she warned them weve business with the holy priestess and no quarrel with you weve a quarrel with you laddad today your lives end said one of the men his voice muffled by the scarf immediately all four attacked unlike the city guards at the gate these humans seemed unfamiliar with their foes three of them went for hytanthas thinking him the greater threat only one was left to engage the lioness her sword flashed up thrusting at the mans throat with unexpected agility the fellow parried her thrust and riposted she turned aside his attack but the slick surface of the limestone betrayed her she slidnot far but enough to throw off her balance she felt the mans blade nick her left ear he chuckled she distinctly heard him quickly he attacked again repeating the very same moves as before the lionesss lip curled he thought he was toying with her a smart warrior would have taken advantage of her stumble to drive home a killing thrust instead the nomad was content to repeat his previously successful attack cutting her right ear this time he obviously saw her as no real threat fury engulfed her not just for this stupid humans lucky hits but for all the indignities and humiliations she and her people had suffered for six terrible years in a blur of motion she lunged beyond the man reversed her grip on her sword and thrust it into his back steel punched easily through his desert garb through skin and flesh grating on bone as he gave a shocked gasp kerian drove her blade in even further burying it to its hilt meanwhile hytanthas had been forced to backpedal frantically gaining time to draw his own sword he was surrounded by flickering points and keen edges all seeking his flesh one foe landed a hit on his left arm but the mail hytanthas wore under his geb turned the blade the elf made a wide whirling slash at the mens faceseven the bravest fighter feared for his eyesand his attackers drew back all but one this man was too slow and the elfs point scored a bloody line across his forehead with a hoarse cry the human clapped a hand to the wound blood coursed down soaking the scarf over his face the other two men shoved their injured comrade aside and came on again hytanthas gave ground then gave more and still more working hard to keep their blades at bay until he found his back against the temple wall and could retreat no further while one masked man attacked keeping hytanthas busy his comrade stooped gathered a handful of fine sand and flung it at the elfs face hytanthas had no warning suddenly he found himself painfully blinded he thrust out his sword in a desperate parry and waited for the feel of iron plunging into his body retrieving her sword from her dead foes back the lioness rushed to her aides defense by the time hytanthas cleared his eyes one of his attackers was dead and the other had fled hytanthas would have given chase but a sharp command brought him up short we have a prisoner the lioness pointed to the man hytanthas had cut on the forehead face awash in gore the human was groveling on the bloody ground trying to crawl away unnoticed kerian ordered him to his feet and when he whined about his injury growled stand up you coward or ill hamstring you he made as if to rise then rolled over abruptly his hand shooting out to fling a short dagger kerian whipped her sword in a halfarc deflecting the missile the dagger flew back the way it had come plunging into its owners neck the assassin gave a gurgling shriek and clamped a hand to the wound blood pouring over his fingers glaring up at the lioness his black eyes overflowing with hate he groaned for torghan bloody froth bubbled from his lips and his straining body went slack hytanthas exclaimed over her amazing parry but the lioness looking down at the dead nomad denied any prowess she rested her sword on her shoulder and said i didnt want him dead he could have told us who sent him at her direction hytanthas rifled the dead mens clothes he found nothing no coins no personal belonwus not even the fly whisk most city dwellers found essential one odd fact each man bore a scarlet tattoo on his left breast of a crouching bird with wings folded and head curiously lowered it seemed a bit familiar to kerian but she couldnt think where she might have seen it what is that an eagle hytanthas asked condor the elves around a woman stood in the shadows of the temple colonnade stepping into the sunlight she approached slowly her voluminous robes were dazzlingly white her long hair was likewise white braided and woven through with azure ribbons and tiny brass bells a wide flat bat shaded her face which was brown and smooth as polished wood her hands were folded into the sleeves of her robe the lioness bowed her head something few had seen her do and sheathed her sword with unusual care sliding the blade home silently holy mistress saida she asked the woman nodded and the lioness gestured at the two dead attackers are these men known to you no man is known to me but i recognize the mark they bear it is the sign of torghan the avenger torghan lord of the wastes was the khurish god of vengeance often represented as a giant vulture or condor the elves knew him as kinis a malign deity not worshiped by their race to his most devoted followers the minotaurs he was the great god sargas kerian wondered if there might be a link between the khurish cult of torghan and the minotaurs who had invaded silvanesti it was not an alliance she liked to contemplate in any event she could not fathom why torghanists of any stripe would attack her in broad daylight in the supposedly safe confines of a holy temple the whiterobed priestess regarded the dead man closest to her in thoughtful silence then remarked you stabbed him in the back kerians eyes narrowed but the priestesss tone wasnt accusatory she seemed merely to be stating a fact the elf lifted a hand to one of her bloody ears causing hytanthas to exclaim at the injuries he only now noticed she brushed aside his concern reliving again the rush of fury shed felt when the torghanist cut her so casually let us retire within the priestess said to her i will tend your injury hytanthas could not enter the sacred precincts but the priestess gave him leave to remain in the shaded colonnade one of the temple acolytes she said would bring him refreshment he went to tie their horses out of the sun before settling down to await his commander kerian followed the high priestess inside after the searing light of day the stonelined passages of the temple of elirsana were cool and dark only the scuff of the priestesss feet ahead gave kerian any hint she was not alone she had a general idea of the temples layout and assumed the holy mistress was taking her to private chambers located at the rear however halfway along a dark corridor saida turned and parted a cloth doorflap on her right in the small dimly lit chamber beyond obviously waiting for them stood an elder acolyte dressed in a womans geb of white linen her hair covered by a matching turban she held a small silver tray on which rested various medicaments and a small roll of gauze kerian wondered how the high priestess had called for the medicines saida had not been out of her sight since the battle with the torghanists the acolyte cleaned the elfs wounds but when the woman started to bandage her cuts the high priestess stopped her saying the injuries would heal more quickly if left open to the goddesss gaze although not especially pious kerian certainly had no desire to walk around with her ears wrapped in white gauze so she agreed saida lifted another doorflap silhouetted against the light beyond she turned and said to kerian come seeker we shall commune under the eyes of the goddess kerian soon found herself in the temples heart the domed sanctuary the pale blue stone of the high ceiling softened the harsh rays of the sun bathing the great room in gentle light unlike the close incenseladen interiors of most shrines the air in the temple of elirsana was clean and fresh centered under the skycolored dome the sacred image of the goddess rested on a high pedestal on the floor of the chamber radiating out from the sacred image like the spokes of a wheel were six lanes filled with sifted white sand carefully raked to eliminate footprints the paved floor between the wide lanes was dotted with stylized sculptures of trees each six to eight feet tall slender tubes of copper or brass served as trunks and branches ovals of silver hammered thin formed the leaves twinkling as they moved gently in the air here and there in the white sand lanes priestesses and acolytes performed their sacred rituals choosing an empty path saida led the lioness toward the image of the goddess as she took in the sight kerians steps slowed then ceased the goddess was shown as a stout broadshouldered woman her arms crossed over an ample bosom her hands fingers spread lay flat against her shoulders her hair gathered into a single heavy hank was pulled forward over her left shoulder her chin was down her eyes closed depicted in a typical khurish gown the great goddess elirsana resembled nothing so much as a wellfed matron of khurikhanalbeit one filled with a private melancholy unlike the temple itself the image wasnt marble in fact it wasnt stone at all but goldenyellow wood lovingly oiled over many years of devotion the surface had a soft burnished sheen the statue was the single largest piece of wood that kerian had seen in khur in this barren land fine wood was more esteemed than gold she is a quiet god saida said her low voice sounding loud in the stillness a suffering god she afflicts and heals and laments both to the lioness the khurish deity sounded like quen the qualinesti goddess of healing she almost mentioned this but decided not to it might provoke a sermon why is she so stout she asked she is the bringer of plenty how could she be lean several low wide stools ringed the statues pedestal saida sat on one of these spreading her manylayered gown like a fan until the stool vanished beneath it as the priestess settled herself kerians attention was caught by the metal tree next to her its dangling silver foliage had been shaped to resemble aspen leaves a memory flashed in kerians mind the first light of sunrise catching on aspen leaves the pinkishorange blush tinting the trees pale trunks it was a sight she used to take for granted rising every morning in the greenwood now such memories brought only bitterness reminding her how far she was from the leafy embrace of home the high priestess was regarding her curiously kerian realized she was still caressing the metal leaf she let it go quickly as if burned seeker why have you come to obtain the comfort and wisdom of the goddess saida asked no holy mistress i do not seek the goddess but her priestess why the lioness met bluntness with bluntness it is said you know of the valley of the blue sands an emotion passed over saidas face brief but intense like a thunderstorm in the desert her lips flexed downward and a furrow appeared between her eyes as quickly as it had come the expression was gone replaced by her usual serene mask i know the legend yes but why does it interest you it doesnt kerian said flatly but it does interest my husband the speaker of the sun and stars he has acquired a map he believes shows the location of the fabled valley he desires to know what you know about this place the priestess was silent for so long that kerian thought she would not answer when she finally did the words came slowly it is said to be a place untouched by the world for more than two and a half thousand years what does gilthas pathfinder want there out of habit kerians hand moved to rest where her sword hilt should be but was not feeling offbalance she blurted he seeks a home for our people if kerian had said gilthas intended to move bag and baggage into the femaleonly precincts of the temple saida could not have looked more shocked you enjoy the favor of sahimkhan the priestess sputtered would you trade that for a perilous journey to a land that may not even exist this sentiment echoed the lionesss own feelings on the subject but she was ever practical the speaker of the sun and stars believes our people cannot remain in khur forever even with sahimkhans protection this is not our country nor our climate everyone knows the khan covets the wealth we brought and it may be that he hopes to harvest elven wisdom for his own ends the speaker is willing to trade treasure and knowledge for a little land and a little peace kerian shook her head i however see a darker future saida said nothing nettled the lioness spoke more candidly still i believe sahim will sell us out to neraka to the minotaur to anyone who meets his price its only a matter of time her raised voice echoed through the chamber ringing off the high polished dome acolytes and priestesses glanced her way before resuming their prayers saida lowered her eyes her posture echoing the goddess above her the seeker may be wise the elf general ground her teeth in frustration may be do you have definite knowledge of sahimkhans treachery a tiny shrug rippled across the priestesss shoulders the deserts of khur are broad no one can hope to hold every grain of sand even in the bestrun homes scorpions and spiders are found first bluntness now maddening ambiguity what in chaos was the woman trying to say that sahimkhan didnt rule unchallenged in khur that was hardly a revelation everyone knew the nomads beyond the city were an independent lot still with the backing of his welltrained troops sahim kept peace among the tribes but what if the trouble wasnt outside the city in the larger desertwhat if it was much closer kerian thought of the torghanist assassins in the courtyard even in the bestrun homes are you saying it isnt the khan i should be worrying about but someone else in the city the high priestess seemed to feel shed already said too much abruptly she tucked her hands into her sleeves and bowed her head kerian tried to persuade the priestess to reveal her thoughts she strove to keep her voice level but passion throbbed in every syllable help us holy mistress help me i want to lead my people out of khur back to our ancestral lands as soon as possible were defenseless here i have tried to make the speaker see this but he will not yes convince your king to leave khur that is the best course he will not listen kerian kicked the sand sending a spray of white grains into the air hes tired of fighting and dreams of a new elven homeland in khur in that mythical valley the priestess lifted her head abruptly the tiny bells braided into her hair jangling discordantly the valley of the blue sands does exist she said quietly the analects of the goddess speak of it quite clearly she calls it the refuge of the damned kerian snorted maybe gilthas was onto something who was more damned these days than elves she pushed these thoughts aside and concentrated on fulfilling her mission the speaker respectfully requests any documents you might have with information on the valley will you lend them holy mistress the priestess raised a hand and a young acolyte appeared silently in answer saida murmured to the girl who bowed and left i gladly dispense the wisdom of the great goddess saida said i hope it will persuade your king to abandon this impossible notion kerian nodded holy mistress i agree with you my peoples future does not lie in khur in moments the acolyte returned accompanied by three others each of the four bore a leather case about three feet long saida checked the clay tags on the four cases and gave her permission for them to be turned over to the lioness as kerian took one the priestess reached out resting a hand on hers i entrust these sacred texts to you kerianseray she said gravely by your word they must be safeguarded equally grave the lioness accepted the charge she asked whether the priestess would land in trouble with sahimkhan or the torghanists for helping the elves why should i a humble servant of the great goddess fear the enmity of men asked the priestess humble servant the lioness was amused the old woman before her exerted enormous influence in khurikhan not only at court but among the people as well in a fiercely patriarchal society the healerpniestesses of elirsana were accorded a respect and reverence given to no other women this socalled humble servant was vital to the rule of sahimkhan if the healers of elirsana ever chose to withhold their skills from sahimkhan his city would be in dire straits indeed before leaving kerian offered a contribution to the temples coffers the high priestess gave her a severe look alms are always welcome but one cannot buy the favors of the goddess i dont want the goddesss favor just yours saida rose to her feet face flushing you offend forgive me holy mistress the cowardly attack on myself and my young aide distressed me please forget my unfortunate words mention of the tattooed assassins had the desired effect saida was plainly upset by the incident in many ways torghan and elirsana were polar opposites even enemies the god of the unforgiving desert of revenge and rage had little common ground with the goddess of healing humility and plenty kerian bowed and turned to go the three acolytes carrying the other leather cases trailing in her wake however saida called her back stepping away from the lioness and turning to face the statue of elirsana the high priestess spread her hands and sank to her knees she began to chant a rhythmic unintelligible sentence the three acolytes standing near kerian bowed their heads immediately but the elf general watched in wideeyed fascination as the priestess reached out toward the statues base her hand passed into the marble pedestal without hindrance the lioness blinked rapidly suspecting a trick of the light on her feet again saida held out a closed fist for your bravery and to ease your suffering the goddess presents you with a gift she said this proved to be a smooth heavy object about the size of a goose egg it resembled a giant opal its white surface veined with pink green and gold pretty but the lioness couldnt begin to fathom its purpose she asked and saida gave a suitably cryptic answer it will stop the killingat least for a time keep it close by seeker their meeting was at an end with saida in the lead and the three acolytes trailing behind kerian departed the sanctuary the high priestess did not speak again until they reached the final portal the double doors that would take kerian outside saida sent the three acolytes out leaving her alone briefly with the lioness you and your people should depart khur as soon as possible no man in khur is your friendand only sorrow can come of your remaining here with that the high priestess of elirsana turned and walked back into her temples shaded depths chapter the khuri yl nor was a conglomeration of halls corridors and antechambers all grouped around a central citadel the great keep known as the norkhan as much a defensive position as the residence of the khan the norkhan boasted thick walls of stone and brick a massive roof and absolutely no windows the interior was always dark and cool no matter the time of day the low light couldnt hide the magnificence of the sapphire throne of khur torchlight only seemed to enhance its beauty the sixfoottall chair rested on a wide dais at one end of the throne room constructed of wood and covered with hammered gold the throne was one of the few treasures successfully hidden from malys and her minions its fanshaped backrest contained two perfect star sapphires the socalled eyes of kargath the khurish god of war the flames of torches reflecting in the gems imparted an eerie appearance of life to them the khan of all the khurs sahim zaccakhur was sitting in his impressive throne he was richly attired in a trailing robe of seagreen silk slashed at the cuffs and hem with stripes of darker jade although he was past middle age his black beard carried no hint of gray in its thick curls both chin and nose were proudly outthrust like the prow of a ship heavy gold rings hung from his earlobes on his head he wore the crown of khura teninchtall conical hat of stiff red leather its lower edge decorated by a band of hammered gold the khan was staring pensively at the eleven men arrayed before him the men were his geelkhana khurikhan was divided into eleven precincts known as geel each had a commander of the guard a geelkhana despite the moderate temperature of the room they were sweating heavily after allowing the silence to lengthen sufficiently sahimkhan finally spoke his tone was calmly conversational the expression in his dark eyes was anything but each day you report the streets of my city are calm yet the laddad queen was attacked by assassins at the doorway of one of our holiest temples who were the attackers the eldest guard captain like the khan a member of the khur tribe replied mighty one they were followers of torghan from here in the city sahims voice rose no great khan the two who were slain were nomads the khan grunted at least the assassins whod dared test his sovereignty were not locals nomads were another matter none could say what desert wanderers might do the laddad have my permission to be here and they have the privilege of my protection why were they attacked mighty one we have been toldthe captain laid heavy emphasis on the last word so his lord would know this opinion was not his ownthat the sons of the crimson vulture were driven to madness by the sight of so many foreigners in our city it is i who decides who is welcome in khurikhan only i sahim declared coldly he stood and began pacing slowly across the dais even through the thick carpet and with his heavy scarlet slippers he could feel the ruts in the stone claw marks left by the great dragon rather than upsetting sahim found the sensation comforting the formidable beast malys was gone and he sahim zaccakhur stood in the monsters place torchlight sent his distorted shadow rippling across the tapestries decorating the thick walls of the keep the light also glittered on the design embroidered on his robe two rampant golden dragons the emblem of his line faced each other across sahimkhans broad chest the design rose and fell as he halted breathing deeply pondering in silence this worried his underlings a shouting khan was expending his bile a silent khan was hoarding it for a future explosion at last he spoke his voice so low they could barely hear it even though they were straining to catch every nuance i shall have to apologize to the speaker of the sun and stars can any of you imagine how likely jam to enjoy that faces blanched but no one spoke and he bellowed can you i see no need for you to apologize to anyone all eyes including the khans turned to the man who had spoken below the dais on sahims left was a tall powerfully built man in foreign dress he sat in a highbacked westernstyle chair the only person in the room other than sahim himself allowed to sit his face was clean shaven his skin dark his voice resembled the bellow of a bull even in calm discourse lord hengriff speaks truly the eldest guardsman said quickly the mighty khan need not stoop to apologize to the laddad thats not what i meant hengriff stood letting his imposing bulk impress itself on the more numerous but shorter khurs his obsidian gaze briefly swept the assembly before fixing on sahim tell the elves their protection is an increasingly heavy drain on the royal coffers instead of apologizing raise the fee you charge them for the right to remain here turn this misfortune into a fortune mighty one for the first time that day sahimkhan smiled a slow grin of delight youre a crafty rogue my lord are you sure you arent some part khurish no answering smile came to hengriffs face he merely sat down again the heavy chair creaking under his weight sahim ordered the high priest of the temple of torghan brought before him soldiers had already collected him and soon he stood before his khan a sharpfaced former nomad named minok the priest like most khurish clergy was beardless and kept his hair cropped close to his scalp ritual tattoos were visible at the wrists and neck of his plain cotton geb alone among all the khurs in the room minok showed no fear of sahimkhan he made proper obeisance to his liege but looked sahim in the eye when he spoke and did not waver when the than denounced the devotees of the god for their attack on the elf queen men of the desert have noble souls great khan minok said proudly it is too much to expect them to look the other way while foreigners multiply and flourish in our land give the word great khan and the sons of the crimson vulture will sweep the laddad contagion from all of khur sahimkhan appeared to weigh this proposal with due care intimates of the palace knew better the priesthoods commanded the loyalty of thousands but minoks followers had embarrassed the khan whether or not he extorted a greater fee from the speaker sahim did not take kindly to any challenge to his authority servants and guards in the throne room began quietly to wager on how long the priest of torghan would live your patriotism and piety do you credit holy one sahim said at last i will consider what you have said in the meantime it is the will of your khan that the laddad not be molested restrain your devotees priest or i will is that clear all minok could do was agree to the order he was surrounded by the khans partisans sahim dismissed him and the proud priest backed out of the room bowing as he went once he disappeared through the double doors sahim nodded to soldiers waiting by the exit they slipped out coins surreptitiously changed hands throughout the room the priest of torghan had even less time than most had thought sahim sent the geelkhana on their way too as they departed he realized the usual crowd at court was short by onehis eldest son shobbat was not present curiously this pleased sahim the heir to the throne of khur was not known for offering sage counsel to his father not that his father would have accepted any so sahim had placed him in charge of the repair work on the palace he must be busy elsewhere in the sprawling halfruined complex this new diligence was refreshing sahim would make a khan out of his wastrel son yet when most of the audience had gone sahim addressed hengriff what do your people make of this new agitation my lord you said it yourself mighty khan patriotism and piety the people of khur tire of the elven pestilence sahim shrugged a few fanatics they will obey my decrees or suffer the consequences hatred of the elves will spread great one mark my words sahim had no doubt of that he knew the nerakan greased palms all over khurikhan buying goodwill for his order and ill will for the elves slyly he asked should i loose holy minok and his followers then hengriff cleared his throat the sound like a panthers snarl the zealous once unleashed are difficult to rein in his meaning was abundantly clear if the torghanists were allowed to rid khur of the elves they might not stop there the khan himself might not meet their standards of purity better you should expel them yourself great one the knight added the land would resound with your name for having rid it of their haughty presence sahim thanked the nerakan emissary for his insight hengriff bowed low and departed taking with him the trio of drably dressed men at his back no amount of broadcloth or linen could disguise the breadth of their shoulders or the watchfulness in their eyes playing the game as he did hengriff never went anywhere without bodyguards weary of the demands of court the khan withdrew to a small side chamber the milling crowd of supplicants lackeys and sycophants bowed as he left the room he entered was lit by a single oil lamp otherwise it was dark as a crypt sahim shrugged off his heavy court robes letting them fall to the floor and scratched his sides his ribs had been itching for an hour but he could hardly sit on the throne of khur and scratch like a mongrel dog with more care he removed the crown of khur and set it on a table then applied his fingernails to his itching head as he poured himself a libation from an urn something stirred in the rooms darkest corner sahim didnt bother to look up that distinctive vaguely unpleasant odor could belong to only one person come forward dont skulk in the corner like a rat he said and drained his goblet a hunched figure limped toward the light the figure was wrapped in a bulky brown robe whose deep hood hid its features completely long white fingers the knuckles prominent showed briefly before they vanished into the copious sleeves sahim eyed the ragged robes and shook his head dont you feel stifled in that garb faeterus on the contrary mighty one i find it chilly here the voice was dry hoarse and whispery with extreme age i first came to khur for its climate you know and when was that snowforblood long before your time great khan long before sahim snorted even he born and bred to the climate thought it oppressive this shuffling mage had been his hireling for a year and sahim still found it absurd that anyone could bear to go about so heavily dressed he poured another draft of wine you heard the audience the ancient nodded a rustling movement of the layered hood so what say you to lord hengriffs notion pretty justice dont you think faeterus shifted from side to side as though his crippled legs pained him justice and money cannot exist together great khan better to let the sons of the crimson vulture wash their hands in elven blood when all the laddad are dead you can claim their treasure without further ado the golden goblet halted an inch from sahims lips his black brows lifted what you propose i exterminate your own people the most ancient race in the world a rasping sound either laugh or cough issued from the depths of the hood they are not my people i am a race of one well whatever you are for now youre mine bought and paid for and i have a task for you find out who attacked the elf queen and why whether its minok and his torghanists or hengriff and nerakan steel i want to know he set down his empty cup is that clear perfectly mighty one the wine had warmed sahims blood even in his sleeveless shift he found the chamber too hot too close the smell emanating from his hired sorcerer was stronger now musty and sour like the odor of the citys vast underground cistern where he lived sahim fought down a quick wave of nausea a living body shouldnt smell like that faeterus stank not of flesh but of old bones slowly disintegrating there was a knock on the chamber door the muffled voice of a court lackey called for permission to enter even as sahim replied faeterus faded into the shadows again the lackey delivered his news and departed quickly knowing the word he brought would not be welcome minok had managed to evade the guards sahim stepped into the elaborate puddle of his court robes as he began to dress he realized faeterus had gone the room had another door opposite the one sahim and the lackey had used but it was always kept locked of course such impediments meant nothing to faeterus locked doors thick walls deep chasmsnothing hindered him he went where he willed perhaps he should give faeterus the task of silencing minok sahim reflected as he settled the crown upon his head again they both seemed to possess a talent for disappearing into thin air a blare of brass comets heralded the arrival of the army of the elven nations although small advance parties had been in camp for a day lord taranath and the main body now had been sighted they were mustering at khurinosts western edge where the speaker waited to welcome them home a mere shadow of the hosts that once defended qualinost and guarded the glades of the speaker of the stars the entire army comprised thirty thousand warriors all mounted they did not always fight on horseback but the survival of this slender force depended on mobility there was no place for slower infantry the soldiers came from every branch of elven society from lifelong warriors of silvanestis house protector to cunning wilder elves from the forests of qualinesti dustcaked from their long heartbreaking journey the column of mounted elves slowed to a halt when the lead riders spotted the delegation arrayed to greet them the speaker flanked by the lioness on his right and lord morillon ambrodel on his left stood at the head of a mixed band of qualinesti and silvanesti behind them were the eight buglers who contributed the fanfare everyone squinted against the terrific glare despite the sunshade planchet had erected over the group the army had adopted desert wear over armor the rays of the sun could cook flesh inside metal in a few hours foremost of the warriors was an unusually tail elf wearing a khurish sun hat reining up he pulled off his gauntlets and hailed the speaker greetings to you lord taranath gilthas extended a hand after clasping hands with his liege the warrior looked beyond the speaker to the lioness general i present the army of the elven nations you are once more in command he said well done taran she said warmly how was the journey up the coast damned hot and not only from the sun casualties twentynine killed fortyfour wounded so many gilthas asked to what cause the usual ones sire heat thirst dysentery poisonous bites and madness all of which the desert provides in abundance and one other travail taranath looked grave from the cape of kenderseen we were dogged for two days by nomads who sniped at us from the dunes they were armed with crossbows desert tribesmen usually carried short recurved bows lacking the materials and skill to make crossbows taranaths news caused the speakers entourage to shift and mutter among themselves where would nomads get crossbows asked lord morillon you know where the lioness hissed neraka theres no proof give me three days and ill bring you the proofnomads and their bows she snapped interrupting the noble none doubted that any nomads the lioness brought would be dead upon arrival although several councilors including morillon were made uncomfortable by her martial fervor others obviously were not still the blazing sands were no place to debate policy gilthas ended the discussion by saying general taranath your speaker and your people welcome you home lady kerianseray will see you later with new orders maintain your normal patrols the rest of your warriors may stand down food and drink await all taranath saluted and signaled the column forward with flankers and scouts on either side the column extended a mile it took some time for all the tired discouraged warriors to file past him but gilthas remained where he was welcoming every rider home his gesture touched the warriors deeply though sweat began to stain his skyblue robe and the heavy circlet on his brow bore down hard on his matted hair gilthas never faltered even when some around him swayed on their feet dizzy from the heat each approaching warrior sat a little straighter and held his head a little higher when he saw the speaker of the sun and stars standing with great dignity to greet them his advisors chafed at the delay even the lioness proud though she was of her army felt he was wasting precious time with this display but not until the last blistered scout had entered the tent city did gilthas depart he turned and walked into the dust cloud raised by the passing riders kerian spoke again of the need to capture nomads to obtain proof that their attacks were sponsored by neraka this rekindled the argument among gilthass entourage the situation is most delicate morillon insisted we have the khans permission to be here but if we go about abusing his subjects we could lose our last safe haven youre the one whos delicate the lioness coughed against the spreading plume of grit look what happened yesterdaymy captain and i set upon in broad daylight you call this place safe a few firebrands regrettable certainly but kerian whirled on him regrettable zealots lust for our blood and you call it regrettable calm yourselves the speaker said he did not raise his voice but it was a command nonetheless the best path lies somewhere between the two extremes we must take care to keep sahimkhan friendly or at least neutral toward us but we cannot allow our people to be sniped at and murdered piecemeal he halted at the edge of the hodgepodge of tents adding we need alternatives to this place and to the khans sufferance his glance at his wife was significant reminding her of her upcoming mission to conduct the archivist favaronas and a small party of scholars to the valley of the blue sands kerian was not altogether unhappy with the task she still felt it nothing more than a kenders errand pointless and timewasting but at least she would be out doing something court life wore on her nerves added to this now were the convoluted intrigues gilthas found necessary to deal with the human khan better to broil in the desert wastes than languish in khurinost strangled by protocol and hamstrung by tortuous diplomacy the journey at least would provide an opportunity for information gathering as the royal party moved through the narrow lanes they passed tents with their flaps pinned back to admit any slight breezes the wiregrass ceiling that covered the passage kept the suns broiling light at bay yet the very closeness of the area served to stifle breath despite this discomfort gilthass steps slowed awed anew by the ingenuity of his people tents here had been turned over to workshops where artisans used ageold skills to fashion metal and stone into objects not only useful but beautiful lacking large furnaces and forges the elves were forced to buy raw materials in the citys souks ingots of crude brass were hammered thin as parchment to be formed into everything from graceful urns to tiny delicate earrings in one shop bales of silver wire were tightly wound into the bracelets and torques of which khurs were so fond one emaciated elf seated with legs splayed wide on a coarse jute rug polished a basket of semiprecious stones with a grinding wheel it was the lapidarys ingenuity that caught the speakers attention his tents dim interior was brightened by sunlight brought in by angled mirrors and his wheel was attached to a small palm frond fan as the elf toiled the wheels energy also served to cool his brow when the speaker halted he and his party interrupted the light that fell upon the lapidarys busy hands the thin elf looked up and when he saw his visitor his lined face went slack in shock he wouldve hurried to his feet but the speakers raised hand and gentle voice kept him seated gilthas moved closer reaching into the basket of stones and lifting a particularly beautiful amethyst the deep purple gem was an inch square and faceted with undeniable skill despite the crude tools the lapidary was forced to use he made to return the stone to the basket the lapidary begged him to keep it gilthas wouldve declined not wishing to decrease the fellows income but kerian whispered take it gil youll disappoint him otherwise the old elfs eyes shone with pride as his speaker thanked him most kindly for the gift gilthass own eyes were suspiciously bright as he took his leave whenever he despaired of the task he faced he would think of this poor kind lapidary what king dared fail such a people as these from outside the lapidarys rude shelter lord morillons prosaic voice ended the poignant interlude before we came the khurs did not know how to facet a gem now squarecut stones are popular in all the souks he said well that makes the journey here worthwhile was kerians acid reply gilthas said nothing fingers clenched around the amethyst gem he moved on the winding route took him past scores of tents some were scarcely larger than the bedroll of their single occupant others encompassed corridors and antechambers laid out in considerable complexity everyone was hard at work there was no place for sloth in khurinost every scrap of food and clothing every mouthful of water must be purchased from wily traders again where one elfgilthas this timesaw triumph over adversity and courage in the face of privation another saw only heartbreak the lioness could hardly bear this slow progression through the tent city the pain that welled within her heart as she looked upon her peoples plight was almost unendurable increasingly she had been dealing with these strong emotions by growing angry and of late much of her anger was directed not only at her husband for not doing enough or at the invaders that had driven her people to these straits but at herself at her failure to best the bullmen and to convince her husband to support another foray against them what about the documents i brought back from the city she asked her whisper was harsh louder than gilthas wouldve liked with a lowering of his eyes he directed her to speak more discreetly favaronas has had them all day we dine with him tonight to hear what he has made of them gilthas saw that lord morillon who did not know the reason behind the lionesss visit to the temple of elirsana was watching them closely the noble had tried to pry the truth of that errand from gilthas earlier but without success it wasnt that gilthas didnt trust morillon he simply knew that in matters such as this where lives hung in the balance the fewer who knew his plans the better the sun was low nearly touching the western dunes by the time the group arrived at the royal tent complex in the center of camp the fiery sphere had changed from whitehot to bloodred tinting the sky the color of polished copper a rare breeze rolled in from the sea it swept away the cloud of sand that had been raised by the returning army as well as the perpetual fog of smoke which hung over khurinost gilthas paused to inhale the refreshing sea air if that wind would blow this time every day i could happily stay here alarm showed on every face and gilthas couldnt help but smile dont worry we all know how rarely that wind rises the councilors chuckled at their speakers humor the lioness did not politely she asked leave to depart citing her need to go to her warriors gilthas assented telling her he looked forward to their dinner together this evening soon the lioness was back among her exhausted soldiers they lived communally in large tents clustered around the big stonewalled corrals that dotted the elven camp kerian busied herself choosing the five hundred who would make the journey north with her she took hardy scouts and skillful riders rather than the best fighters she told them little about the mission the need for circumspection as strongly ingrained in her as in her husband it wasnt only fear of khurish treachery that prompted the lionesss caution word of what gilthas hoped to find could easily cause a stampede of desperate elves determined to escape khurinost for the supposed haven of the fabled valley of mist and fog taranath and her other officers were naturally curious they speculated that the lioness planned to cause trouble for the knights of neraka whose homeland lay just on the other side of the mountains to which they were headed she only wished that were the case much as she hated the minotaurs kerian reserved a special dark place in her heart for the knights and their hirelings they were the enemies of her blood and she knew how to fight them the attempt to invade silvanesti had been a grave mistake she knew that now each day that passed with elven lands in the foul grip of their oppressors was pure torment to her and her impatience had caused the debacle in the south wars she was learning were not won by dash and fury the lioness was practicing patience even so gilthass fantasies about inathwakenti were futile even if the valley existed and was habitable it wasnt their home she thought the sacred lands of silvanos and kithkanan were where the elven race belonged and nowhere else the lioness felt that a better use of her fighting strength would be to mount small raids into the elven homeland ambushing minotaur patrols burning their depots demolishing their bridges and assassinating their leaders by such methods she had all but retaken the qualinesti countryside from the knights of neraka although she was never strong enough to challenge their control of qualinost nor to attempt conclusions with the dragon beryl to her curious officers she said the speaker has a special purpose in sending us north fighting is not part of the plan well be escortingshe groped for the proper wordlibrarians from the royal archives the warriors were uniformly startled why send you general any competent troop leader could handle such a simple mission asked taranath i go because my speaker commands it they nodded acknowledging their obedience to their king kerian asked taranath to tell her of the nomad attacks hed suffered on the way back to khurikhan he and the rest of the army had reached the coast without any problems he said thanks to the delaying action staged by the lioness and her archers the qualinesti warrior had hoped his commander would explain how she survived but she did not he was too loyal and welltrained to question her about what had happened as the column moved up the coast they encountered groups of nomads gathering dates and pine nuts from coastal groves the nomads were driving their rangy cattle and goats to watering holes along the ancient seaside trail used by such herders for centuries they gave the armed elves a wide berth and there were no confrontations on the elves second day riding up the coast they noticed mounted humans observing them taranath hadnt paid them much attention at first because they were only a few and they were in front of the column not behind he logically assumed any pursuit from the silvanesti border would appear from behind the first attack came when night fell heavy crossbow bolts flickered out of the high dunes on the elves right a few riders and horses were hit taranath sent out a patrol they found no one but there were plain signs in the sand that half a dozen men with horses had hidden in the dunes this pattern continued through the night and into the following days angered by the sniping taranath sent more and more flankers to rout out the crossbowmen all to no avail it was like chasing smoke the snipers repeatedly fell back loosing quarrels at the flankers if their aim had been better they could have emptied many saddles taranath said grimly as it is their aim was too high the lioness nodded it was common for novice crossbow men to overshoot a target a crossbow lofted its missiles in an arc unlike the flat flight of an arrow loosed from a bow obviously the nomads werent accustomed to the weapon the attacks ended only when the elves came in sight of khurikhan the elves never got close to the snipers and their own archers never sighted a target long enough to draw a bead one last thing general taranath said our foes seemed to be nomads by the way they knew and used the desert but i believe they came from khurikhan the tracks from the ambush sites led north always north the last sets came directly to the city that made sense to kerian the men who had jumped her and hytanthas on the temple walk were nomads too perhaps of the same band whod harassed taranaths column they obviously were operating out of khurikhan but why nomads regarded cities and their diverse inhabitants with the same suspicion they felt for foreigners like the elves and khurikhan as the largest khurish city was considered particularly viceridden the dinner hour was approaching kerian left her loyal officers to return to the speakers tent and to attend her dinner with gilthas and his archivist departing the officers tent she made a slight detour to visit eagle eye in his pen the griffon had to be confined away from the horses his presence unnerved them eagle eye stood like a statue by his feeding post his head was hooded like a hunting falcons covered by green felt this was the best way to keep him peaceful when agitated eagle eye uttered his shrill gargling cry and animals for miles around went into a panic speaking softly to the creature kerian loosened the drawstrings and removed his hood the griffons golden eyes each as big as a kings goblet studied her intently how are you my friend she said hungry of course you are she went to the far side of the pen to a darkly stained wooden cask it smelled strongly of old blood she pulled out a sheep haunch none too fresh just the way the griffon liked it the scent of blood reached eagle eye and he parted his beak allowing his rodlike tongue to taste the air his leonine tail twitched back and forth he chuckled impatiently coming coming she said amused she skewered the haunch on the hook hanging from the top of the feeding post eagle eye waited until shed stepped clear then shuffled forward a few steps he sank his hooked beak into the meat ripping out a fistsized bite which he bolted down without swallowing many of her comrades couldnt bear to watch the griffon eat kerian found the process edifying in short order the metal hook had been thoroughly cleaned the griffon flared his wings bobbing his head in appreciation she gave his feathered neck an affectionate pat and he allowed her to hood him again she bid him good night twilight had fallen the great vault of sky over khurinost and the khurish capital was purple streaked on the western horizon with scarlet and rose pink here in the armys camp there were few sunshades to block the view kerianseray lingered a moment savoring the great expanse of sky and the cooling air that came with sunset something flickered overhead birds were scarce in the desert and she watched the movement curiously its shape and flight pattern seemed odd after a moment she recognized the darting flight of a bat strange she hadnt seen one of the creatures since leaving the woodlands of qualinesti it fluttered by maybe twenty feet above her head the flapping of its soft wings was faint but distinct as was the chittering sound it made like the squeak of leather rubbing against glass then it was gone darting away among the low canvas roofs and rising smoke plumes of the tent city kerian looked down and discovered she was gripping the hilt of her sword she didnt know why but the bat had alarmed her her heart was racing lowering her gaze further she saw something dark littering the sand beneath her feet she knelt the path was strewn with green leaves ash leaves yet no such trees grew within three hundred miles of khurikhan more bizarre still the leaves were green and supple dinner with the speaker of the sun and stars was an austere affair at least as far as the menu went consigned to the magnificent past were banquets of twelve courses gone were dishes such as crystallized dew collected from the royal rose gardens airy pastries and delicate seasonings not only were such things out of reach but the monarch of the elven nations did not condone pretentious luxuries seated at a low round table were the speaker kerianseray the senior surviving archivist of qualinost favaronas millanandor and a silvanesti cartographer named sithelbathan formerly personal mapmaker to queen mother alhana starbreeze attending the diners was planchet an amphora of wine in his hand and a slender dagger tucked into his sash dinner consisted of fish rice roasted pine nuts and an oily paste popular in khur known as feza it was a puree of seven vegetables mixed with nut oil and garlic on the table were clay pots containing khurish stick bread stiff rods of dough baked by sunlight until they were dark brown and nearly as hard as wood next to the speakers plate rested a white pottery pot and a tiny matching cup the pot contained kefre the strong black beverage so beloved by khurs gilthas was one of the few elves who had acquired a taste for it and the only one who drank the bitter brew without the addition of sugar cinnamon or other flavorings ah for some decent fruit said sithelbathan eyeing his halfeaten fish khurish waters yielded many kinds of fish all bony and strongly flavored gilthas had finished his own small servings and was pouring himself a cup of kefre there are dates and figs for dessert he said ill have them brought in if you like the cartographer politely declined hed eaten enough of both to last a lifetime small talk persisted a while until the lioness broached the subject that had brought them all together so master cartographer what of this valley sithelbathan pushed his plate away there is undoubtedly a valley at the location on the speakers map lady he said gilthas asked favaronas the temple annals brought back by lady kerianseraydo they offer useful information the archivist leaned back clasping his hands across his belly it was a rather prominent belly for an elf testimony to his habit of drinking the local beer and to his lavish eating habits unlike his choosy colleague favaronas had cleaned his plate and now munched on stick bread dipped in feza perhaps great speaker the archivist said after swallowing they relate a tangled tale full of allegory and legend as a modern scholar i hesitate to pass along such fables making his rounds planchet leaned in refilling the archivists cup yet again favaronas thanked him and lifted the cup to drink tartly kerian said youre not here for the hospitality tell us what if anything youve learned gilthas reproached her with a look and she subsided taking a stick of bread and biting into it with a snap the speaker regarded the archivist expectantly favaronas said according to the temple chronicles inathwakenti was the first place on krynn where the gods set foot in corporeal form it became a kind of neutral retreat where they could stand on solid soil and enjoy the world they had created to keep their haven free of internecine strife they agreed none were allowed to speak within its confines hence the vale of silence whether that is true he finished the last bite of his bread and shrugged but i can confirm that the area in question was part of the silvanesti realm prior to the first cataclysm sithelbathan said the territory was part of a large grant of land given by silvanos goldeneye first speaker of the stars to his general and comrade balif it was mostly desert in those days too the plain south of the desert was infested with fierce nomadic human tribes who were gradually driven out by balifs legions the furthest outpost of the elven kingdom was in or near the vale of silence at a place called tethbalifbalifs gate fascinating the lioness drawled yes indeed her husband agreed overlooking her ironic tone it may be that we have a legal claim on the inathwakenti if we could find remnants of balifs stronghold that would bolster our case this was all five thousand years ago she said if anything remains it would be rubble i doubt sahimkhan will cede us land on the basis of a few ancient stones the diners debated the issue as the plates were cleared and the dessert course was served favaronas helped himself to slices of fresh fig licking the sticky juice from his fingers sithelbathan regarded his colleague with fastidious disapproval there is one cautionary tale about the vale favaronas said now taking a handful of dates according to the priestesses of elirsana a powerful wizard was exiled there early in speaker sithass reign the temple records call him wethdika sithelbathan shook his head barbarous name doesnt sound like any language ive ever heard favaronas spat a date seed into his hand i am certain it is a corruption of vedvedsica the speaker planchet and sithelbathan looked at the archivist with new respect kerian lacking their formal education didnt recognize the name favaronas explained its significance vedvedsica was one of the earliest great mages of silvanesti in the beginning he was an ally of the speaker and a vassal of balif but he committed a crime and was banished from the realm balif was a name kerian knew he had been a great warrior and a celebrated general what crime she asked gilthas said no one knows it was so awful speaker sithas proscribed any mention of it in the annals of his reign it fell to balif to arrest the mage and consign him to a prison on the remote frontier and in return the vile sorcerer contrived his lords ruin sithelbathan said grimly balif a fine brave elf was transformed into a twisted shrunken hideous creature he vanished soon after unable to dwell in silvanesti ever again silence fell the longago fate of the elf general had a painful relevance for those around the table were they not also banished from their homelands perhaps they too might never be able to dwell there again the hour was late the tent city quiet the night wind set the roof of the speakers tent to shivering and the sound suddenly seemed an extra presence at the table unconsciously kerian edged closer to gilthas ignoring protocol he slipped an arm around her waist even the bones of wizards turn to dust favaronas muttered the quote from the bard sevastithanas broke the gloomy moment planchet moved to refill their cups and favaronas recounted the later history of the inathwakenti a kingpriest of istar had received a prophecy warning of a coming disaster the only place on the entire continent that would not be changed by the catastrophe was the valley of the blue sands since where the gods once walked nature held no sway the kingpriest sent an expedition to the valley it was never heard from again later dwarf prospectors from thoradin found the valley and set up a mining operation the project yielded rich placer deposits of silver but was so bedeviled by accidents and serious injuries that the miners abandoned it after less than a year during the bakali breeding migration in the days of the old ergoth empire a band of human tribesmen stumbled on the valley and escaped marauding lizardmen by hiding there for a time the humans flourished sending trading parties to istar and silvanesti but after a few years the trade diminished then died out altogether the last mention of the valley in the temple archives was from a knight of solamnia who wandered through after the cataclysm he reported the valley untouched by the upheaval and the lioness prompted when favaronas paused to take a drink and nothing lady he replied shrugging one shoulder thats the only information contained in that entry since that time he told them the rise of the desert nomads had choked off contact with the vale of silence nomads who lived in the region regarded it as a forbidden place while the rest of the tribes gradually forgot about it or like the city dwelling khurs relegated it to the realm of fable the oil lamps on the low table sputtered as their fuel ran low favaronas had finished his story but added a final warning the temple annals are couched in the most vague and circuitous terms great speaker and required much interpolation and extrapolation on my part gilthas was nodding thoughtfully kerian leaned close and nudged his cheek with her nose well she said do i go or no he smiled in his gentle slightly sad way of course master favaronas too our people must have a sanctuary the inathwakenti maybe the place the archivist already had agreed to the journey but when the speaker asked sithelbathan if he would like to go as well the silvanesti mapmaker quickly declined afraid of ghosts the lioness teased the spare neatly dressed elf drew his robe close around his neck yes lady he said i am chapter water in a stone jug stays cool even in the heat of day if the jug is carved properly of finegrained soapstone with thick walls at the top and thinner walls near the bottom water inside will stay as cool as the moment it was drawn from the well cool water is the first requirement for good bread not an easy requirement to meet in a desert the east wind which rolled in from the distant sea hit the pillars of heaven known to foreigners as the khalkist mountains and dumped its snow on the peaks and its rain on the lower slopes purged of moisture the wind then spread across the western desert taking its dry heat to every corner of the land between the heat blown sand and flies finding cool water and making bread for the family was no chore for the faint of heart adala fahim lifted the heavy soapstone jug and poured its contents into a brass bowl quickly she stirred the water into the dry mixture of flour salt and soda she never measured except by eye twelve circuits of the wide flat bowl with a wooden paddle and the dough was done a shallow groove had been worn into the metal where her spoon circled for thirtytwo years shed made bread in exactly the same way for thirtytwo years it had come out right despite wind weather or war she spat on the iron griddle to test its temperature at the right heat a water drop danced in circles growing smaller with every circuit until it vanished when the griddle was ready she poured a dollop of oil onto it the oil ran to the edges sheening the black surface in the bowl the dough was puffed up and bubbling from the soda she tore off a piece rolled it into a ball between her smooth brown palms and laid it on the griddle sizzling it flattened into a small round loaf black shadows fell over adala cutting off the distant view of the gray mountains but she didnt look up the first loaf was the most important how it baked told her whether the fire needed to be hotter or cooler the three men standing over her were nomads in the prime of life men of the weyalu tribe although none had gray eyes they were of the leaping spider clan and wapahs cousins wapah is back said the one in the middle ill make an extra portion adala said her attention still f on the cooking loaf she gave it a quick flip with her fingers f other women used knives to turn their bread not adala one wrong stab and the frying dough would deflate the loaf would be flat and tough as sandal leather he has important news weyadan her title meant mother of the weyalu do you know who he was hired to guide from the city to the desert and back she shrugged one shoulder busy rolling a new ball of dough shobbat son of sahim zaccakhur in quick succession four new balls of dough hit the griddle replacing the first now done so the prince of khur finally left the shaded halls of the city to visit the land of his ancestors what is that to us she said he went to the oracle the hidden one the men were certain this news would bring adala to her feet dusting the flour from her hands it did not she removed the four freshly baked loaves from the griddle and put down four more weyadan please entreated the nomad you should hear what wapah has to say and so i will when the bread is done it took some time to cook forty loaves although the men shifted their feet impatiently once or twice none complained when at last the baking was done adala left her fifth daughter chisi to clean the bowl and griddle hitching u her black robes the leader of the weyalu left the shade of her tent and made for wapahs dwelling across the stony ravine it was just past noon the hottest part of the day and few nomads were moving about even the desert hounds the weyalu were so adept at breeding were still sleeping in whatever spots of shade they could find adala entered wapahs family tent and gave the customary greeting those on high stand by us wapah returned it and by you mother of the weyalu he was seated facing the door other men of the clan formed a ring their backs against the walls of the tent several of them had the gray eyes that stood out so boldly against swarthy faces and dark or tawny beards adala was the only woman present i rejoice to see you she said i hear you have a tale to tell as grave as a plague as loud as thunder take your ease she sat in the center of the male circle as wife of the clan chief adala could not be touched by any man save her husband since kasamir di kyre had perished years before while fighting in the pay of the knights of neraka she had become weyadan literally mother to everyone in the weya l tribe she was just past her fortieth year younger than some of her ostensible children wapah began his tale with the same patience shed learned listening to her sons when they were toddlers adala let the colorful torrent of words wash over her and focused on the important bits of information scattered throughout prince shobbats men had come to the grand souks looking for someone to guide their master on a journey through the desert wapah was selected because the gods knew him to be a humble man a generous man a man in whom the blood of endless generations of weyalu flowed in a mighty endless circle adala frowned closing her eyes to concentrate harder with no escort at all wapah and the prince of khur rode out of khurikhan before dawn they reached the tear of elirsana without incident although of no more use in the desert than a mewling babe shobbat insisted they press on without rest to reach his goal the oracle of the high desert wapah paused to sip buttered tea and bilath adalas brother by marriage and war chief of the weyalu asked the hidden one the keeper of bats wapah nodded solemnly on his left his cousin etosh poured more tea into his crater they reached the oracle at night no one in wapahs memory had gone there and he didnt know if the diviner still lived but the ancient stone spires still stood and the legendary bats flooded out when disturbed wapah a righteous man warned the prince he would not enter the sanctuary so shobbat went alone and stayed inside until nearly dawn wapah was asleep between the horses when he heard a terrible scream rising valiantly sword in hand he braced himself to do battle against evil spirits none appeared instead prince shobbat stumbled out of the sanctuary raving like a madman tell about his face etosh urged him the breath of the gods had fallen upon the prince wapah declaimed spreading his arms wide stealing the manly color from his beard brow and hair the stain was white as the scarves of the khans dancers adala looked down her long nose at him white is the color of light of eldin the judge this was the remote high god of the nomads seldom spoken of and rarely invoked what evil can come from eldin a murmur went through the group and bilath said then you believe it was a judgment not a curse wapah did not wish to lose his audience in a theological discussion so he continued quickly the tormented prince was not only ranting like one benighted he was blind as well he flailed his arms crashing into the horses and wapah all the while he raved about trees growing in the desert the coming of the elves and how they would turn everything green unless stopped i would like to see more green in this land adala commented and the assembled men stared at her but not under the rule of foreigners wapah had been forced to club shobbat unconscious after tying him onto his horse the nomad started back to khurikhan when the prince awoke on the return journey he was still crazed wapah questioned him and shobbat answered without guile revealing everything why he had come what hed hoped to gain and what the oracle had said but always his talk returned to the elves and the danger they posed to khur he sought to depose his father said etosh with a sage nod his madness is the judgment of the gods punishment for plotting such blood betrayal there was little love for sahimkhan among the weyalu but when sons conspired to murder their fathers evil was truly loose in the world wapah said it was not the princes designs on the throne of khur that consumed his disordered mind on the journey back to the city but the oracles revelation that the laddad might transform khur into a green land and rule over it wapahs audience agreed with the maddened prince on that score if that happened the tribes of khur would be lost everything they valuedfamilies traditions loyalty to the godswould be forfeit to foreign ways even the clean beautiful emptiness of the land would be choked out by the vines and trees of the elves if the elves find the valley of the blue sands wapah said quoting the prince then the people of khur are lost draining his crater of tea wapah was silent at last his audience was thunderstruck even adala had no comeback to this final revelation elves looking for the valley of the blue sands why would they go there no one went there it was haunted by troubled unholy spirits you should have slit the khurs throat said etosh breaking the somber silence left him in the desert to feed the vultures several loud voices took issue with this statement such a betrayal of his charge would have brought ill hick down upon wapah and his tribe a weyalus word was a bond not only to the men to whom it had been given but to those on high as well for a time they argued the merit of wapahs decision to ferry the stricken prince back to khur as nothing useful emerged from their dispute adala finally cut them off we must meet this storm and see if it is a true tempest or only the ravings of a sunmaddened prince she said she stood extending her arm she swept the circle pointing to each man in turn we will go to the city by the sea we will see what the laddad are about if they are quiet and cleave to the will of the khan we will leave them in peace but if they intend to invade the valley we must stop them the oracle said the laddad would not rule if they were kept from the valley of the blue sands by our blood it is our duty to keep them out the sacred land of khur will endure she completed the circle adding your oaths on it as men of weyalu readily they swore the burden of the oath light just now no man present knew how heavy it might prove messengers were sent out right away other tribes in the region would be told of this threat if the elves moved toward the valley it would mean war some southern tribes freely raided elven caravans picked off stray laddad riders even attacked small camps as a warrior people they treated all strangers in their land thus over the years the elves had grown in number as more arrived in exile and they showed no signs of leaving adala had even heard reports of elves in the weyalus ancestral city delphon the city was a sinkhole of iniquity and vice as all cities were but it was the font of the weyalu tribe for foreigners not even human onesto be there contaminating the tombs and temples of the tribes great ancestors was a bitter draught to swallow but as long as the laddad remained at khurikhan and other cities the nomads could ignore them however if sahimkhan allowed them to spread across the vastness of the open desert then the people of the desert would rise up and proclaim a new khan and not the spoiled shobbat he was as wicked and godless as his father a new dynasty must be established a house of virtue and strength such were adalas thoughts as she crossed the blinding expanse of sand to her tent ducking under the flap she flipped the sun veil back over her head and left such worldly concerns outside with the sun chisi had scoured the griddle and hung it from a tent pole to cool the brass mixing bowl was rinsed clean with no more distracting thoughts of elves or cities or immoral monarchs adala dipped a hand in a basket of dried lentils one two three handfuls clattered into the bowl more water from the jug to soak the stonehard brown seeds lentils went well with bread she only hoped she had enough salt to season them properly without fanfare the lioness led her small force out of khurinost before sunrise if the speakers expensive map could be trusted the inathwakenti was more than two hundred miles away the trip would take them across the high plateau some of the worst desert in khur with no wells no oases and no hospitable life for most of the way according to khurish records rain had not fallen on the high plateau in a hundred years so every elf carried water water and more water spare arms and most armor were left behind to allow the horses to bear a heavier burden of liquid in consultation with sithelbathan kerian had sketched out a route north by east skirting the caravan trail to kortal which was rife with nerakan spies each member of the expedition was provided with a copy of the map so if he became separated from the main body he would know where to go an experienced professional kerian completed her own preparations for the journey fairly quickly this left her a few precious hours to spend as gilthass wife and not as the commander of his army she puzzled anew over the seeming contradiction of her husband and king he was both the gentlest person shed ever known and the toughest gilthas could give his last crust of bread to a hungry person in the street then in the next breath sentence a malefactor to death he did not posture or preen as speaker of the sun and stars but honestly cared for every soul under his rule and for the longrange welfare of his realm neither of them spoke of the task kerian faced or her lack of faith in its purpose clad only in candlelight they sat on their bed facing each other heads bowed her forehead resting on her husbands shoulder gilthas breathed deeply inhaling the scent of her striving to lock the memory firmly in his heart her unbound hair cascaded over them both the feel of it curling against his shoulders was one of the sweetest sensations he had ever known will you take eagle eye he asked quietly she shook her head the motion caused her hair to sweep slowly across his upper back gilthas shivered no you know he frightens the horses they will be nervous enough and he drinks more water than a dragon kerian felt her husband smile against her shoulder i have a salve for you he said the apothecary redinivis brought it he said it will keep you from getting sunburned and how many gallons of this salve are we supposed to carry with us the smile became a low chuckle the stone jar he gave me is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand she snorted and gilthas added his voice pitched higher to mimic the apothecary however to be efficacious the balm must be applied quite liberally husband and wife laughed together amusement grew into something deeper this was their last night together for some time and they made the most of it before dawn kerian rose and dressed without disturbing her husband it wasnt until she was in the outer room ready to depart that gilthas appeared werent you going to say goodbye he asked the sight of him thus clad in a threadbare gown long hair awry brought an unexpected rush of tenderness but she couldnt allow herself to give in to her feelings she was departing on a risky mission her life and more importantly the lives of those she led required all the skill and cunning of the lioness not the wifely sentiments of kerianseray striving for lightness she said think of your dignity gil should the speaker of the sun and stars stand around outside mooning like a lovesick maiden bidding goodbye to her swain matching her teasing tone he replied i am speaker im only coddled like a maiden she grinned they embraced but too soon for gilthas she released him and stepped back a flash of a smile and in the next heartbeat she was gone out into the predawn stillness for a long time gilthas remained where he was standing staring after her the west wind picked up as the column of riders left the tenttown robed and scarved against the flying sand the elves rode in silence unaccompanied by flying banners or flourishing pipers not like the old days when the warriors of silvanesti never stirred out of their capital city without a band of pipers one thousand of their lands noblest youths or the army of qualinesti who marched and rode to the beat of massed drums the golden sun standard of kithkanan borne before them no the contingent of the exiles army departed quietly their horses hooves making little noise in the soft yielding sand despite the discretion their departure did not escape notice in the saddle between two high dunes a solitary figure lay prone covered from nose to toes in a hooded robe the same color as the sea of sand his eyesight was sharp as a falcons neither distance nor the low light hampered him he counted the double line of elven riders and noted their course due north the spy slid backward through the sand until he was hidden from the elves by the intervening dune rising he raced down the windshaped hill at the bottom two mounted men waited one of them holding the reins of his horse he vaulted onto his pony snatching the reins he hissed the laddad are going north five hundred with sword and bow the youngest of the three pulled his horse around in a halfcircle until it faced west i ride to my chief he said the tondoon will know of this the watcher spoke to the third older man i will take word to the mikku tribe tell the weyadan the warning was true the foreigners are on the move the grayeyed nomad nodded grimly by nightfall every tribe from the mountains to the sea will know the laddad are loose they galloped away each taking his own direction before they were out of sight of each other the constant wind had erased their tracks from the sand the army of elves rode on dawn broke and the sun quickly purged the chill of night an hour after dawn the temperature was already hotter than ever was felt in silvanesti it would only increase nomads did not travel by day unless sorely pressed like the serpents lizards and spiders of the desert they preferred to lie still during the day and go out by night elves accustomed to working by day continued this habit even when the desert sun bore down full strength this led to a new saying among nomads only fools vultures and laddad go abroad by day the lioness rode at the head of the column feeling the sweat run down inside her breastplate and pool in the small of her back her face remained dry as soon as a bead of sweat formed on her forehead or neck the insatiably thirsty air sucked it away she looked back over the elves following her and was struck by how unfamiliar they werenot just gilthass scholars favaronas and his two assistantsbut the warriors too so many of her old comrades had fallen during the last days of qualinost the march into exile and the brutal crossing of the plains of dust not all the losses were hard to take senator palthainon a slippery politician who made his name undermining gilthass policies had vanished during the flight from qualinesti whether dead or captured by samuvals bandits no one knew but the lioness felt either a suitable end for the troublesome rogue someone in the columna kagonesti by his accent started to sing other riders took up the tune a chorus of hoarse male voices it was an old wilder song about being chased through the forest by unnamed enemies where i go i leave no trail no trail but hang upon the sparrows tail and fly as lightly as the wind the wind for i was horn of wilder kin the words rang strange in this lifeless landscape and after four verses the song died out the air was too dry for singing anyway flankers patrolled diligently ahead and behind the column as well as a hundred yards on either side an hour before noon the scouts circled back to the main body for replacement one rider did not appear the lioness halted the column and sent a pair of elves to find the missing rider the pair did not return either she ordered the entire force to search for the missing spread out in a long double line the elves descended the side of a northfacing dune the tracks of the pair the lioness had sent were still visible at the foot of the dune halfway up the next one elves on the left side of the formation raised an alarm someone was moving atop the dune swords sprouted from the line climbing through the heavy sand was hard work and they labored uphill with horses gasping from the heat and effort within twenty yards of the crest a dozen darkly wrapped figures popped up bows in hand the lioness shouted a warning as arrows daubed with red paint hissed toward her startled troops one struck low on her breastplate and glanced off she barked a command and her own archers loosed into the line of snipers one fell the rest responded with more arrows this time aimed low at the elves horses get those snakes the lioness cried on the right two score riders swept forward swords held high the concealed bowmen couldnt rise up high enough to aim at them without exposing themselves to the elf archers with elven arrows arcing over their heads the lioness and the bulk of the elves spurred hard up the hill just as they cleared the top those on the right reached the flat ridge at the dunes crest and charged the enemy there were only eleven nine bowarmed nomads and two others minding their horses at the base of the dune faced on two sides by the foe the nomads quit racing for their ponies several were ridden down and sabered before the lioness called for prisoners the killing ceased but not a single nomad escaped four prisoners were herded to the lioness three others wounded and unable to walk were carried forward and dumped at her feet who are you men what tribe what clan she asked she had expected nomad interference but not so soon not such a pointless ambush with a shiver she recalled a similar attack at the priestesss temple the nomads were silent one of them knelt by a wounded comrade and began to chant a muted prayer again more calmly the lioness posed her questions promising to spare all if they would answer not one of the captured humans said a word why do you fight us the lioness demanded her exhausted horse picked up her anger and snorted prancing in a tight circle were not your enemies were nomads now too driven from our homes and forced to wander this desert tell me are you bandits or have you been paid to fight us nothing two of the humans sat on the sand and hugged their knees eyes still fixed on the ground the third continued to pray under his breath the fourth trembling from exhaustion and a wound on his upper thigh remained on his feet staring defiantly at her the lioness glared back frustrated by their silence she had no time for this she allowed herself only a moment of indecision before snapping captain a kagonesti veteran saluted his commander search them she said anything unusual bring to me take their swords and break their bows and arrows leave them food and water for two days their horses go with us the standing nomad opened his mouth to protest without horses they were doomed they would never reach a water source before their own supply gave out you have something to say she asked sternly yet her eyes were hopeful the bearded man firmed his lips and said nothing hope vanished very well carry out my orders captain all the nomads living and dead were searched the only thing of interest the searchers found was the small leather bag that each man wore on a string around his neck one pouch was brought to kerian it was very light containing a fetish no doubt she loosened the neck and upended the bag a black and orange creature fell out landing on the neck of her horse spider yelled the elf warrior whod brought the bag he swatted at it with his gauntlet with astonishing power for so small a creature it sprang from the horse and landed legs spread on the soldiers cheek the elf screamed one of his comrades yanked the palm sized spider from his face and flung it to the ground he stamped it with his ironshod boot tragically the evil already had been done two fang marks showed clearly on the elfs cheek from the holes red streaks were spreading even as the lioness watched the stricken elf went rigid his eyes and mouth wide in agony the lioness shouted for a healer the elf began to tremble then convulse despite his comrades strong arms he went down dragging them with him what can we do the lioness yelled at the nomad he shrugged his face hard irons the only cure for him now he drew a finger across his throat she turned away from him in disgust and dismounted the elfs face was dreadful his mouth stretched wide in a scream he could not vent and his face mottled by the red streaks that mapped the lightningfast flow of poison through his blood kerian knelt beside him with a tenderness few could imagine she touched his cheek his skin was cold what had been living flesh now felt like marble his eyes blue irises lost in a bloody sea shifted toward her slightly in the heat of pursuit with knights of neraka or worse baying at her heels shed had to use the iron cure before she loathed it it was all they could do for the dying elf now to spare him needless suffering but she hated it nonetheless her free hand still resting on his face she ended the elfs torment his gaze remained fixed on her grew unfocused then empty kerian closed his eyelids his name was nafarallun said one of the elves holding him born a qualinesti the remaining leather pouches were pounded flat unopened stonefaced the nomads awaited the same fate go home men of the leaping spider clan the lioness said tersely looking down at them from horseback we have not come to harm you but if you make war on us we will show you no mercy the elves formed up and rode away soon the marooned nomads were only dark smudges against the blond sand then they were lost from sight around khurikhan the desert was stony with hills of sand piled up by contending winds from the mountains in the north and the sea in the east the khurish capital was set in a shallow depressions like a dry lakebed all day the elves climbed out of this lowlying area stones became scarce and the sand grew finer there was no shade in sight anywhere each elf had donned eyeshades of the style worn by nomads which looked very like bandages wrapping the head stiff strips of hide held in place by thongs looped around the ears the bandage had very thin horizontal openings which admitted just enough light to see without the eyeshades most of the elves would have gone blind in a day or two elves and horses were draped in white cloth another nomad trick the light color deflected the killing rays of the sun the column paused every few miles for water horses drank first riders second a warrior could persevere even when thirsty but a horse would balk unless watered as the distance from khurikhan increased they found less and less evidence of intelligent life they were too far east to encounter travelers on the caravan route to alekkhan and kortal and too far west to meet traders using the only paved road in khur the khans way which led to delphon here at its harsh edge it was easy to see why even the hardiest nomads shunned the high plateau the wind died this spared them the stinging dust but allowed the heat to grow the entire column looked like a procession of phantoms whitedraped wraiths plodding slowly ahead through the calfdeep sand under her stifling shroud the lioness fought against the lethargy that had her nodding in the saddle she slipped a hand into one of the smaller saddlebags draped across the pommel of her saddle within next t the smooth coolness of saidas enigmatic gift she felt dry flakes these were the leaves that had fallen on her during her last night in khurinost they had quickly dried in the desert air she hadnt mentioned the odd occurrence to anyone not even gilthas what could she say a bat flew over and dropped ash leaves on me her husband would think shed been sampling the khurish homebrew yet she was sure that the fallen leaves meant something swaying in the saddle the lioness had plenty of time to consider what she knew about ash trees the wood was hard and durable and made good tool handles pike and lance shafts and arrows eastern silvanesti had a great many ash trees so did the woodlands of wayreth in qualinesti had the leaves come from one of those places was the strange rain an omen a sign that one day she was destined to return to one of the elven homelands if circumstance permitted she would ask favaronas about ash trees doubtless the scholar knew all sorts of trivial lore about them perhaps she would find a clue in his knowledge thinking of the archivist she twisted in the saddle and looked for him in the line of draped riders one of favaronass assistants had been killed by a stray nomad arrow during the setto at the dune the remaining two scholars were shorter than her warriors and favaronas especially was not an accomplished rider making them easy to pick out the archivist rode with knees stiff and feet pointed outward from the bobbing motion of his head she decided he was half asleep just as well if she could afford the lapse in alertness shed doze too it would make the miles pass more swiftly when the horizon ahead lost all relief and became a monotonous line the elves knew they had reached the high desert at last although flat it did present strange features the shallow sand beneath their horses hooves was marked with swirls squiggles and converging lines as if way markers had been drawn these were the handiwork of the only living creatures sharing the landscape with the elves serpents sand crawlers spiders and lizards the sky took on a silver color like polished iron and mirages shimmered over the sand to the elves at the rear of the column the lead riders took on a fantastic aspect as the broiling air magnified them and their horses making them look ten feet tall the lead riders also seemed to be treading through water their reflections perfect in the tantalizing phantom lakes the sun reached its zenith breathing was labor not only forcing kerians heavy chest to rise and fall but having to take in the blistering air she put a hand outside her white drapery even through her glove it felt as though shed plunged her hand into a campfire knotting her hand into a fist she kept her arm aloft signaling a halt water was sipped sparingly favaronas asked for extra for his assistant and kerian allowed the elfa qualinesti named armenteroan extra swallow although younger than his master armentero did not look at all well but he waved aside favaronass concern with a few brusque words favaronas face pink despite his sunshade leaned close to kerian and spoke his mouth was too dry to manage more than a whisper the speaker must be mad bring a hundred thousand elves through this inferno and most on foot thousands would perish on the way she gave a noncommittal shrug and took her turn with the water gourd in truth she didnt think gilthas realized the enormity of the difficulties involved in shifting their people from khurikhan to inathwakenti even if they found the valley of legend such a migration would make the journey to khur across the plains of dust seem a pleasant parade the plains were larger than the khurish desert but the part the elves had crossed was not nearly so hot or dry as this to reach the vale of silence the speaker could bypass some of the high plateau by following the caravan trail northwest to kortal but that presented a different set of dangers kortal lay on the border with neraka once the dark knights learned of gilthass scheme to save the elven race they would stop at nothing to thwart it kerian had agreed to undertake this expedition but she believed that resettling the entire elven nation in the vale of silence was a preposterous idea favaronas was wrong it wouldnt be thousands but tens of thousands who would perish on the journey half of their people would die surely you disagree favaronas said seeing her shake her head what i said perhaps we could rest here awhile till the sun declines yes well rest here a few hours the order was passed down the column and the warriors dismounted moving slowly in the breathstealing heat groups of warriors joined their sunshades together into a larger canopy sheltering themselves and their horses beneath these they cleared away the topmost hottest layer of sand spread canvas sheets on the ground and took their ease there was a little excitement when a nest of adders was uncovered but the snakes were rapidly dispatched and everyone settled down soon only the sentries were awake feeling drunk with heat and weariness kerian muttered i hope the blasted valley is there after all this effort favaronas lay facing her his head resting on the bundle of manuscripts hed brought along equally drowsy he replied its there general the ancient chroniclers seldom lie she snorted seldom lying was not exactly the same as telling the truth when they arose two hours later they could not wake favaronass assistant armentero was dead his body rigid skin blistering hot to the touch heat stroke or sun death as the nomads called it the inferno of the high plateau had claimed its first elven victim chapter the sun was not yet up when planchet entered the speakers private chamber to wake him from a deep slumber as he reached to rouse him the loyal retainer noted how the hardships of ruling a people in exile had left their mark on the speaker he was a young elf not yet touching middle years but faint lines tracked the skin between his eyes and bracketed his mouth his hair was lighter due not only to the effects of the harsh khurish sun but to the silvergray strands visible here and there despite this in the dim light the sleeping ruler of the elven nations resembled a youth again curled up in the bed linens one arm outstretched over the emptiness where kerianseray had been planchet whispered sire wake up captain ambrodel has returned gilthas opened one eye so soon his valet nodded and held up a clean gown gilthas rose and slipped his arms in tying the sash with a single brisk jerk two days past the evening of the day the lioness had left khurinost gilthas had sent hytanthas ambrodel into the nomad city disguised as a human the captains task was to glean information about who was responsible for the attack outside the temple of elirsana the khurs were attributing the assault to a robbery gone wrong the story told by kerian and hytanthas made that simplistic explanation unlikely gilthas had requested an audience with sahimkhan to make a formal appeal for an investigation but he didnt intend to leave the matter entirely in khurish hands as they left his quarters gilthas asked did hytanthas discover who was behind the attack no sire said planchet but he says he has gleaned much information the speakers audience chamber was full of its usual inhabitantslord morillon and his silvanesti various court functionaries and hamaramis commander of the speakers private guard they stood to one side eyeing a disheveled hytanthas ambrodel planchet had ordered refreshment for him and the young elf was making the most of it he had a lamb chop in one hand and a slender silver urn of nectar in the other he wore a thick black wig cut in the style of a citydwelling khur which concealed his upswept ears his skin had been darkened with walnut juice if gilthas hadnt known better he would have taken the captain for a scruffy denizen of khurikhan hastily lowering the urn from which he was drinking hytanthas bowed to the speaker gilthas looked him up and down and wrinkled his nose you smell like a chamber pot hytanthas ruefully agreed the places ive been were no garden sire although eager to know what the young elf might have learned gilthas first asked that the room be cleared of all but his closest advisors as the courtiers departed he seated himself on his throne and accepted a tiny cup of kefre from planchet at last hytanthas was free to relate his story he began with the hostels hed visited looking for nomads with the vulture tattoo desert dwellers came and went from khurikhan all the time alone or in small groups to trade to work and to sample the comparative luxuries of settled life hytanthas had found no torghanists in the nicer hostels and so worked his way down the ladder to the lowest flophouses the khurish hed learned was flavored with the accent of the capital so he pretended to be a city dweller dodging the khans justice in the cellars and hovels where very poor travelers could rent a scrap of blanket for a few coppers he let it be known he was available for rough work this generated little response he soon found out why the supply of thugs was already dominated by nomads who toiled for next to nothing among the khurs revenge was seen not as a crime but as a matter of honor and it was considered only natural that devotees of the god of vengeance would make themselves available to assist others weaker or fainter of heart in obtaining the revenge they required for torghanists this was a sacred duty hytanthass attempts to find an assignment as an assassin offended them when he continued his efforts bragging on his skill with a blade he was cornered by three hardeyed nomads who warned him against trespassing in their domain the three were devotees of torghan hytanthas had heard rumors of a benefactor to the temple of torghan someone was making rich gifts to the godsomeone who expressed a strong dislike of elves this was not lost on the torghanists harassment and assaults on elves in khurikhan were on the rise so the attack on kerianseray and yourself was part of a wider campaign of hatred gilthas asked no great speaker according to a conversation i overheard in a khurish tavern this benefactor actually paid to have general kerianseray murdered and hethe khurs used the male pronounhe was unhappy the attempt had been bungled the identity of the benefactor remained a mystery to hytanthas but he had made another discovery he considered of such importance that he had prematurely aborted his mission and returned to khurinost the discovery concerned one of sahimkhans hired sorcerers the khan had a variety of mages willing to do his bidding one in particular rumored to be a rogue wizard was a secretive fellow about whom little was known the very few whove seen him in the streets say hes rather nondescript he wears ragged heavy brown robes and walks with a limp his name is faeterus hytanthas said i believe he is an elf this statement left the speaker and his advisors speechless for several seconds lord morillon recovered first what is the basis for this wild speculation he demanded the haughty tone annoyed the captain it isnt speculation well not entirely hytanthas admitted there were a great many stories about faeterus gossip was rife about his antecedents and the experiments he was said to conduct in his secret abode and it was never said aloud that he was anything other than a human however one citydweller ancient by khurish standards as he was more than eighty years old had confided to hytanthas his theory that the sorcerer was laddad according to this human faeterus has been in the city since before he himself was born lord morillon opened his mouth to protest and hytanthas rushed on the mind of this old human is still sharp and clear the other khurs are dismissive of him but i found him extremely persuasive the name faeterus was unknown to any in the room hamaramis noted it could be an assumed name perhaps a corruption of the mages true identity the closest silvanesti equivalent would be faetheralas and in qualinesti fanterus could this sorcerer be the benefactor of the torghanists asked the speaker hytanthas did not know but all agreed that an elf who had so turned his back on his own kind that he could hire his services out to a tyrant like sahimkhan certainly was capable of anything make inquiries the speaker ordered someone somewhere knows this faeterus planchet brought up the nerakan emissary who had been seen skulking about the khuri yl nor he asked lord morillon who had been to the palace more often than anyone else to describe the human in detail as a lifelong courtier the silvanesti didnt miss much in his own milieu when morillon finished planchet stood frowning gnawing his lower lip in thought gilthas prompted him to speak there was a man a nerakan a vassal of that wretch redlance planchet finally said he was dark as you say and had a very rough voice its been years since i thought of him but i believe his name may have been hengriff during the fight for qualinesti liberty a special group of nerakan knights was formed to track down the lioness their leader lord liveskill stood high in the councils of morham targonne master of the order liveskill left the dirty work of hunting the lioness to a hardened warrior named vytrad redlance who led a band of ninetynine knights their paths crossed kerianserays three times the last time vytrad perished fighting her in single combat only a dozen or so knights of this special band had survived and they never returned to hunt the lioness again given targonnes lack of patience with failure the remnants of liveskills band might easily have been dispatched on the least pleasant duties the order could arrangesuch as emissary to the desert wastes of khur vytrads secondincommand at the time of his death was a brawny bullvoiced fellow who chose to preserve his men rather than let them die trying to save the fanatical red lance fighting his way out of the trap that cost vytrad his life hengriff singlehandedly killed four of the lionesss best warriors when he rode away with the survivors of vytrads command kerian was only too willing to let them go so who is directing the torghanists neraka or the renegade wizard morillon wondered the speaker shrugged in either case we cant allow treachery to undermine our place here peace and goodwill are vital for our survival sahimkhan is no friend of the sect of torghanworshipers sire if they challenge his authority he will stamp them out most ruthlessly morillon said unless their efforts are part of some deeper intrigue between the khan and the knights planchet said he may be using them against the knightsor perhaps the knights are using the torghanists against the khan hytanthas shook his bead what murky times we live in every time is murky when youre in the midst of it said gilthas smiling faintly in any event the benefactor of the torghanists must be identified so must the khans rogue mage what they would do with this knowledge once they had it was something the speaker preferred not to worry about just now for the moment they would concentrate on uncovering their enemies a reward was considered the khurs were fond of elven steel and the right price might buy more information but the speaker said such an offer would also raise a host of dubious opportunists hytanthas proclaimed his readiness to return to the city and this gilthas readily approved the captains persona as a human desperado might yet yield additional important leads find this benefactor captain ambrodel and bring him before me whether he wants to come or not hytanthas saluted when he departed planchet followed taking him aside planchet said dont risk yourself with this blackguard captain if possible bring him in alive but if circumstances require it dont hesitate to kill him better this agitator should die than escape or kill you hytanthas nodded for all his youth he was a veteran having fought the knights in the woods of qualinesti in his very first skirmish the knights had surrounded a nearby village and threatened to destroy it unless the lioness and her companions surrendered she would not so the knights slaughtered everyone in the village from elders down to babes in arms two hundred thirty souls hytanthas never forgot his brutal initiation to war as fought by the knights of neraka standing in the open square outside the speakers great tent valet and warrior were about to part when a commotion came to their ears the byways of khurinost were busy at this hour and both elves strained fruitlessly to see beyond those thronging the paths but it was obvious that the roar of voices was coming from the direction of khurikhan sounds like a battle hytanthas exclaimed its trouble all right but not warfare planchet borrowed a halberd from a guard standing watch outside the speakers tent then bade hytanthas accompany him come captain lets see who makes such a noise on a hot morning maybe your mysterious sorcerer or the fell emissary of the dark order to the ignorant hytanthass companion might have seemed a weak comrade to take into danger but planchet was no ordinary servant he had commanded qualinesti forces in the final battle to escape the collapsing kingdom and his inspired leadership enabled thousands of elves to escape the net closing around qualinost given a choice when confronting danger hytanthas would take planchet over anyone else in the speakers entouragesave the lioness herself of course the paths through camp quickly clogged up with frightened elves clutching bundles of goods and struggling to put distance between themselves and the city planchet and hytanthas made repeated attempts to ask what was happening but no one stopped long enough to answer at last planchet turned his halberd sideways blocking the footpath from tent to tent like water caught behind a dam elves filled the passage seeking other ways out whats going on planchet shouted as he struggled against the growing mob pushing against the shaft of his weapon we were attacked in the grand souks an elf woman replied they attacked everyone or only elves asked hytanthas only elves planchet moved out of the way lifting the halberd refugees surged past when the mob had thinned planchet and hytanthas hurried on to the city the gate into khurikhan was unguarded the usual oddments of gear surrounding itcloth sunshades for the soldiers stools and skins of wine and water hanging from postsall had been knocked down and trampled the gate itself stood open a few steps inside they found a dead man a khurish guard hed been stabbed in the back the lesser souk had been sacked dozens of soukats with their heads broken or worse lay in the wreckage of their booths here and there women and children tugged at the broken structures of cloth and lath trying to find a lost husband or father or to salvage the family inventory many of the beleaguered merchants stared with open hostility at planchet as the two elves walked past hytanthas was still in his scruffy human disguise whatever had happened was over in the fabazz sounds of conflict echoed down the winding streets growing fainter and farther away the two elves had just decided to give up their search and return to khurinost when a troop of the khans soldiers burst from a side street their articulated coats of plate armor and spiked helmets gave them the look of exotic insects swarming from a hidden nest one of the khurs spoke pointing a finger at the ostensible human and his elf companion the rest of the foot soldiers turned as one to stare at them not good planchet muttered edging away i think i hear the speaker calling hytanthas agreed they backed away never taking their eyes off the soldiers the khurish officer recognizable by the bronze sunburst on his helmet shouted at them to stop what language is that planchet said still sidling away cant understand a word hes saying the officer cut the air with his hand plates jangling his soldiers ran at the elves they trampled the already broken stalls drawing protesting wails from the soukats and their kin how many are there do you reckon hytanthas asked forty fifty no shame running from odds like that none at all planchet said and dropped his borrowed halberd the two belted back the way theyd come the shortest route to khurinost it would have been easy enough for two elves to outdistance a pack of burdened humans but when planchet and hytanthas reached the street above the city gate they found that the portal was no longer abandoned worse the iron portcullises were down and the timber gates shut and barred the sounds of martial pursuit were growing closer there was no time to bluff their way past the guards planchet who knew khurikhan best because of his frequent trips to buy supplies for the speakers household led hytanthas away from the gate to harkufti street the paved lane that encircled the city just inside the wall where are we going asked hytanthas planchet panted temple walk we might find sanctuary in the temple of elirsana the captain had no better idea so they turned off harkufti onto a narrow lane that led to the center of the city they might have evaded the soldiers laboring under the twin handicaps of desert heat and bulky armor but street urchins and doorway idlers obligingly shouted directions to the troops hytanthas cursed them in broken but effective khurish the street suddenly ended on a square lined with ruined houses destruction wrought by malystryx and still not repaired it wasnt the holy sanctuary but at least it offered possibilities for concealment hytanthas tore the boards off an open doorway and they squeezed inside flattened against the wall they tried to calm their labored breathing the ruined house bore no roof all the palm wood beams had fallen in and half the upper floors tiles and bricks had tumbled to ground level the place stank of fire and the peculiarly rank odor of the red marauders breath the khurish troops entered the square at a walking pace they must have known the street was a dead end and their quarry was trapped quietly they fanned out checking every ruin it was only a matter of time before they reached the one in which planchet and hytanthas were hiding the speakers valet searched the rubble and drew out a reasonably stout length of timber a crude weapon to supplement the sword he wore when he straightened he realized he was alone hytanthas was gone a tap on his shoulder caused him to look up hytanthas was climbing the pyramid of charred rafters toward the nonexistent roof he gestured urgently for planchet to follow him the searching soldiers were only yards away there was no way of knowing how much the beams had been weakened by fire but they had no other options frowning mightily feeling much too old for this sport planchet began to climb he was little more than six feet off the floor when a khurish soldier shoved his head in the empty window opening below excellency he yelled some of the boards are off the door here but i dont see anyone from a distance came the reply look twice fool our orders are to bring any laddad before the khan i have no desire to explain your failure in that duty the khur poked his head in again looking left and right and cursing his commander with whispered eloquence the two elves hardly dared breathe so close was he at last he withdrew no excellency no one here planchets legs shook with the release of tension his foot had been a scant six inches above the soldiers helmet spike the valet hauled himself up beside hytanthas at the top of the crumbling wall a forest of rooftops and brass flues greeted their eyes spreading uphill to the center of the city the khuri yl nor was clearly visible to their right the palace rising beyond the heights of temple walk gleaming in the morning sun like a pale blue beacon was the dome of the temple of elirsana do you see it hytanthas demanded we can reach the temple over the rooftops planchet grunted to him it looked like a very long way to go the terrain more than a little uncertain still as with the climb itself they had no choice the jump to the intact roof of the house next door was easy enough two more jumps and they were out of the ruined district hytanthas wouldve discarded his thick black wig then but planchet cautioned against it the captains human guise might come in handy wherever possible they kept to the roof edges creeping alongside the low parapets that rose up from the brick outer walls khurish roofs were made of palm fronds plastered with mud and wouldnt taken much weight although lighter than humans the elves didnt want to risk breaking through after traversing six houses beyond the ruined district the fleeing pair reached the more solid roof of a fourstory building they rested in the latticework leanto that shaded one corner it enclosed a rooftop garden filled with kefre shrubs cardamom plants and foliage neither elf recognized did you hear what the soldier said theyre arresting all elves in the city hytanthas exclaimed what couldve happened perhaps neraka or the minotaurs at last offered a price the khan could not refuse the speaker must be told planchet looked at his sooty scratched hands if we sur vive he will be told eight streets away from the pair of elves the priest minok also was hiding huddled below a darkened stairway gulping hot dry air for two days the khans men had been hunting him he had escaped them originally outside the palace by the grace of his great god a short distance from the khuri yl norfar enough so his screams couldnt be heard at the palacefour soldiers ran at him with swords drawn a nomad by birth and no coward minok could hardly stand his ground without a weapon arms were forbidden to priests and he strictly adhered to the precepts of his order so he fled unfortunately the wily guards split up with two circling wide through back alleys to cut him off minok had no chance to gain the safety of his temple his heart sank when he saw the glint of naked iron blades coming up on either side he ducked down a familiar side street and ran for the front door of a large house at the rear of the square then torghan interceded before minok reached the house a powerful hand grabbed him by the back of his robe lifting him completely from his feet it hauled him into a darkened outbuilding he found himself thrust under a dusty brick staircase with nary a word spoken he waited sweating and shaking with fear while soldiers tramped up and down the street outside searching for him a skylight opened the light that streamed down revealed minoks hiding place to be larger than hed realized and it illuminated a polished table at which sat lord hengriff the servant who had opened the skylight retreated to the shadows come out said hengriff in the stillness his voice boomed like a drum and minok flinched minok emerged stood stiffly and tried to brush the dust of the streets from his priestly robe thank you he said gravely i was sure i was done for out there youre not done until im through with you ive too much invested in you to let the khan kill you out of pique hengriff did not ask the priest to sit down papers and open scrolls covered the tabletop a fresh sheet of foolscap lay under hengriffs hand with lines of black script neatly printed down half the page unlike most nomads minok could read but hengriffs writing made little sense to him it was some sort of cipher written for his superiors no doubt the attack today went well minok opined hengriffs black eyes narrowed it did not i told you to seek out elves not the soukats of the fabazz no one in khurikhan will blame the elves for what happened today they know your nomads are responsible minok spread his hands my people are poor wanderers of the desert when they saw the riches of the lesser souk spread before them they lost their heads youll lose yours if you bungle again minok promised he would not fail a second time too late for that hengriff reminded him dryly your assassins also failed to slay the lioness outside the temple of elirsana cautiously minok said permit me to ask excellency why you dont kill these laddad yourself why do you need the sons of the crimson vulture to shed blood for you im trying to school a nation minoks look indicated he did not understand so hengriff added all your people not just the followers of torghan need to learn how to deal with elves if i kill them its foreign intervention if khurs kill them its a patriotic act minok bowed you are most wise excellency a sly expression crossed his narrow face it also discomfits the khan does it not hengriff made a fist there are lessons he must learn too he rang a small brass bell summoning the servant who waited just outside the shaft of sunlight a few words to the servant and the fellow scurried away returning moments later with two large men hengriff gave orders that the men two of his personal bodyguards escort minok back to the temple of torghan he warned the priest not to show his face for a while to give sahimkhan time to forget hed sought minoks death minok did not thank him only turned head high and started out he and his protectors had gone only a few steps when be staggered suddenly and clapped his hands over his ears that ringing he cried mercy do you hear a great bell the only bell in sight was the small brass instrument on hengriffs table but it sat silent neither hengriff nor his bodyguards heard anything as they stared in surprise at the priest of torghan minok was in obvious pain something is being summoned something great and terrible minoks eyes rolled back in his head his knees folded and he dropped to the floor unconscious a thin stream of blood trickled from each ear hengriff gestured at his men the priest was not dead but could not be revived they covered him with a cloth to conceal him and departed carrying him back to his temple the knight stared after them with a frown on his face although hed heard and felt nothing he could not dismiss the sensations of an initiated priest he made careful note of what minok said and when he said it appending this to his next dispatch to the order the report would soon be on its way to jelek before the war of souls the orders leader morham targonne had moved the knighthoods headquarters from neraka to jelek some thirty miles northwest hengriff himself from neraka had thought the move a singularly stupid one jelek was nothing more than a squalid little backwater and the only reason targonne had chosen it was because it carried the dubious to hengriffs mind distinction of having birthed him lord of the night targonne had been dead five years now and the order had been weakened by the events of the war of souls a great defeat at the battle of sanction and the disappearance of targonnes successor mina the selfproclaimed prophet of the one god the orders current leader lord baltasar rennold was determined to restore its honor and sense of holy purpose rennold was nothing like targonne who had been a distinctly dishonorable man with the soul of a bookkeeper yet hengriff was uncertain what rennold would make of this latest news rennold did not much care for him holding against hengriff the excesses and failures of his superiors lord liveskill and vytrad redlance the lord of the night had set hengriff three goalsthe annexation of khur the final destruction of elven power and the seizure of any remaining elven treasure if he wanted these goals accomplished hed best heed every word in hengriffs report the flat desert below the pillars of heaven rang with the clashing of swords and the pounding of many hooves dust swirled around maneuvering companies of riders over all the sun shone down from a perfectly cloudless sky the enemy had fallen upon the elves just after dawn before all the lionesss warriors were in the saddle a hundred nomads appeared out of the south shouting tribal war cries and brandishing swords the elves who were mounted rode straight at the oncoming horde holding them off while their comrades readied themselves for battle the lioness led that first small force against fearful odds the nomads certainly were brave and bloodthirsty but they had no formal training in arms once their initial surprise rush was spent they found themselves at a severe disadvantage they lacked any protective armor and most bore only a single weapon a straight sword without a crossguard nomad archers used a short bow of cow horn and wicker laminated together deadly at short range its effectiveness fell off sharply with distance at two hundred yardswhere elf bows were commonly usednomad arrows merely bounced off elven armor the ironheaded silvanesti arrows went right through a nomads chest at that range the lioness organized her band into three sections two hundred two hundred and one hundred riders one of the companies of two hundred armed with swords held off fierce rushes by the nomads while the group of one hundred emptied khurish saddles with precisely aimed arrows the remaining two hundred riders circled northward trying to surround the enemy but the nomads would not be caught they regrouped and charged at any vulnerable point that they saw the desert around the tribesmen was littered with the fallen many were elves but mixed in with them were the bodies of desert dwellers and their ponies after an hour of fruitless slaughter the nomads began to lose heart they had expected to stampede the elves and when the lionesss troops stood firm nomad ardor waned without the discipline to carry on fighting all day as the desert heat rose to its most incandescent the tribesmen rode away the dustcaked elves gladly let them go kerian had no wish to pursue the foe she didnt have the resources for a long chase across the desert and more hostile nomads might be lurking beyond the horizon fewer than twenty of her warriors had been killed half that many more had notable injuries the desert was dotted with a dozen slain nomads as elves moved among the fallen scavenging food and precious water they noticed many of the humans bore the mark of the leaping spider clan the dominant clan in the weyalu tribe why did they fight us favaronas wondered weve done nothing to them were foreigners in their land kerian replied grimly it was a philosophy she understood if armed khurs had ridden through qualinesti her instinct would have been exactly the same drive them out the scholar did not share her outlook shaking his head he mumbled something about live and let live she had no patience with such feeble notions but held her tongue since finding his assistant lying dead beside him favaronas had been somewhat shaken he took to keeping as close to kerian as possible still he did not complain and did not hamper her or her warriors they buried the dead elf and human to discourage scavengers with the lioness urging speed and taking a turn at the digging herself their second day on the high plateau was waning and she wanted to put as much distance between her people and the scene of battle as possible the khalkist range bulked larger on the horizon the gray peaks resembled lowlying clouds at this distance the terrain began to change the thick layer of sand gave way to sand and rocks then broken gravel animal life was seen even if they were only small creatures easily frightened lizards sunning themselves on the rocks their emerald green and burnished gold hides sparkling in the bright light foliage reappeared stunted cedars creosote bushes thorny creepers and a type of grass so wiry that even their hungry horses wouldnt eat it still the presence of plant life was a welcome change from the unrelieved sand of the high plateau they had passed out of the deep desert into the only slightly less hostile lowlands of the mountains kerian sent an advance party forward to reconnoiter the way to the valley mouth according to gilthass map the lone entrance to the inathwakenti was a nondescript pass that gave no hint of its importance they had to find the right one the exact one or their journey would be in vain the troop topped a small rise carpeted with shards of gray slate a startlingly cool breeze struck their faces the wind coming down the mountains hadnt yet acquired the deserts desiccating heat the lioness gave word to halt water was dispensed kerian removed the bowllike bottom from the gourd poured water into it and let her horse drink then she squatted in the shade cast by her mount and drank from the leatherwrapped gourd herself the water inside was so warm that she could have brewed tea with it a distant loud cracking sound rent the air everyone paused and looked to the mountains the apparent source of the sound thunder it had been a long time since any of them had seen rain favaronas resting like the lioness in the shadow of his horse asked will we get a shower do you think it seemed wishful thinking there wasnt a cloud in the sky probably just a rockfall she muttered another boom echoed down from the gray peaks hearing it more clearly this time the lioness stood quickly facing the desert the sound actually was coming from the direction of the desert and echoing off the mountains yet all any of them could see was a stony landscape dotted with twisted cedars and spiky brown grass and beyond that a shimmering expanse of sand and mirage water when a third peal of thunder broke over the slate hill kerian ordered everyone to horse the cooling wind had died away and to the south a plume of dust rose straight into the air the cloud was sizable and compact indicating a tightly knit group of riders the nomads were following them the lioness sent favaronas out of harms way over the crest of the hill then distributed her weary warriors in a wide crescent formation with the tips facing the approaching dust cloud from her place in the center of the formation she shaded her eyes with one hand and stared south the column of dust dispersed in the wind as it rose higher into the air the elves glimpsed movement at the bottom of the hill something burnished and bright flashed between the bushes the lioness squinted it was a single object larger than a man on horseback and not a group of hardriding nomads she wondered what it could be the answer appeared the next second in a blur of preternatural motion the approaching creature leaped from the foot of the hill and landed in front of the elves barely a dozen yards away its rapid motion generated a sound like thunder horses reared neighing shrilly in fright elves throughout the formation shouted with shock and dismay standing before them was a terrifying apparition it had four short powerful legs a long tail studded with ivory barbs a compact body four times larger than a bull and a thick upright neck the creatures head caught every elfs attention long angular and covered with burnished greengold scales it was the head of a monstrous reptile dragon someone cried but kerian didnt think so squat and wingless this was an earthbound creature a crown of vertical horns encircled the monsters head from one earhole to the other and a single thick horn erupted from its nose except for its unnatural size it could have been a desert lizard archers the lioness called aim for its head a hundred bowstrings twanged and a hundred arrows arced through the air the beasts eyelids slid over its slanting green eyes with an audible click and the missiles bounced off its metallic hide eyes opening the monster launched itself into the center of the elf formation its speed was terrifying with great sideways swings of its head it mowed down horses and elves right and left ripping them apart with its horns when a horse fell directly in front of it the creature opened its jaws and snapped the living animal in two break break formation the lioness cried like quicksilver under the blows of a hammer the elves flew apart the monster dashed after the slowest riders knocking them off their mounts with its horned snout several dismounted elves ran upon the creatures blind side and attacked it with swords their blows rang ineffectually against its hard scales at the lionesss command the bugler sounded retreat she tried to restore some order to her ranks but every time a sizable body of elves formed the creature dashed at them ripping them apart and trampling them under its clawed feet in a quarter of an hour it slew more elves than the nomads had in a mornings combat archers sniped at its eyes and one succeeded in lodging a clothyard shaft in the right one grunting the beast stuck out its bloodred tongue snaked it around the offending arrow and yanked this procedure diverted the beast long enough to allow the elves to reform and gallop for the crest of the slate hill the monster caught up with them in two bounds the lioness didnt see the beast coming one moment she was astride her horse the next she lay sprawled on her back sliding over the rough stony ground her horse decapitated by the creatures horns was flung aside by one powerful clawed foot the beast advanced until it was standing over her dazed she saw its wide pale green belly blotting out the sky she drew her dagger with both hands she rammed it into the creatures underside it felt as if she was stabbing an anvil her point skidded off and the dagger twisted out of her grasp the monsters right hind leg came forward caught hold of kerians leg and threw her several yards she rolled over and over coming to a halt against the carcass of her dead horse her hands and forearms sang with pain and her head pounded around her shouts and screams resounded but sounded faint and far away even the searing light of the sun seemed dim is this any way to fight the calm voice echoed in her headher conscience she supposedsounding very like gilthas why not in most ways he was her conscience she could see his face before her his eyes full of disappointment get up he told her dont just lie in the dirt beside your dead horse laboriously she pushed herself up on her hands uttering an obscenity her leg ached where the creature had grabbed her and she was certain shed broken a rib the annoying voice in her head went on telling her how stupid it was to fight such a beast with sword and bow what else did they have it will stop the killingat least for a time keep it close by seeker this time the voice in kerians head belonged to saida high priestess of elirsana her words rang clear as mountain ice cutting through the pain and the fog of exhaustion she realized she had indeed been tossed back onto the body of her own horse she tore open the small saddlebag thanking the gods who live that the poor animal had fallen on its right side groping through the dried leaves she drew out the odd stone saidas mysterious gift the beautiful opal egg lay heavy in her hand now what the priestess had given her no instructions no explanation of how the gemstone was supposed to help her should she touch the monster with it daunting prospect perhaps if she tied it to an arrow and loosed it at the beast the elves had scattered trying to keep out of the monsters reach it made sudden blindingly fast rushes at the small groups her face scratched and bleeding hair standing wildly around her head the lioness stalked the creature it saw her its eyelids clicked together and the soulless reptilian visage never changed as it advanced no dizzying rush this time instead it came on slowly raising one foot at a time like a prowling cat preparing to pounce when it was ten yards away the lioness held up saidas gift heres a present for you monster she shouted so saying she leaned back and hurled the opal her aim was true the orb hit the beast in the center of its chest stuck there briefly then fell to the ground the creatures forward motion halted abruptly it froze one foreleg lifted off the ground for the space of two seconds then its legs unaccountably collapsed it struck the ground so hard that the shock knocked the lioness off her feet on horseback or on foot the elves slowly converged on the fallen beast it did not move kerian kept her sword in hand ready to fight but the monster was like a statue is it dead general one of her warriors called its breath washed over her feet no seems to be sleeping eight officers galloped up swinging out of their saddles they ringed the monsters head they struck the beast with their swords but neither points nor blade edges would penetrate it the swords merely bounced off the beast doing no harm to its armored hide merciful quen an elf exclaimed cant we kill it kerian squatted by the beast one eye as big as her head was half open the bright green orb was as malign as ever and moved slightly to track her as she shifted position she realized the creature could see her but must be compelled by the power of the priestesss gift to lie quiescent the question was for how long the officers speculated what to do as the discussion continued the lioness went and retrieved the opal egg its color had changed once glowingly white it was now a dull ivory color the pink and gold streaks on its surface faded she slipped it in her belt pouch she owed saida a very large debt favaronas come trotting over the crest of the hill the archivist made his way to them both hands clutching the pommel of his saddle his attention fixed on the creature lying before them merciful gods and goddesses he exclaimed its a sand beast you recognize this abomination after a fashion general sand beasts dwell in the deepest most desolate tracts of the desert sahimkhan has the head of one preserved in his palace theyre very rare not rare enough she said dryly raising her voice she ordered her elves to saddle a horse was brought to replace her slain mount the wounded who could ride would double up with healthy riders they would take their dead with them as well the monster might revive and the lioness wouldnt risk leaving honorable warriors to its savage attentions the sand beast had slain fiftytwo elves and wounded as many more if saidas magic hadnt stopped it the entire company likely would have perished they rode due north favaronas kept looking back over his shoulder afraid the paralyzed creature might revive and be upon them again kerian had a different worry why had the sand beast attacked them in the first place this mission was fraught with unexpected dangers as though the desert was uniting against them to stop the speakers search for the valley of legend the archivist couldnt help with her questions about the sand beast from all hed read sand beasts were wild animals who despite their ferocity avoided contact with humans or elves kerians horse stumbled jarring her she coughed as new pain lanced through her side favaronas offered a handkerchief theres blood on your face general she wiped her chin dismissing his concern i took a few whacks ive had worse days end was magnificent the sinking sun gilded the forward range of the mountains changing them from slate gray to bronze and copper dust was much less a problem here as the ground was more stone than sand and they could see for miles in every direction drained from their battles the elves slumped in the saddle their horses walked slowly with heads hanging talk around the lioness had turned to finding a campsite for the night when a scout came cantering back with news she reined up and waited for the excited young qualinesti to reach her the scout a recent recruit almost fell from his horse when he jerked the reins too sharply and his foam flecked animal skidded to a halt on its haunches calm yourself lad the lioness said what is it a nomad camp not a mile east of where we sit right now her officers crowded closer the lionesss fingers flexed around her reins how many big more than a hundred tents maybe two hundred too vague he shouldve brought an exact number no one saw you she asked the young scout shook his head decisively we should take the initiativeattack said a wilder elf named avalyn one of the lionesss longtime followers we dont know these people favaronas protested they may be one of the harmless tribes what difference does it make what tribe they are avalyn retorted nomads are all the same thats ridiculous the lioness interceded were not here to make war on every wandering desert clan if theyre hostile we cant just pass them by general another officer put in theyll be behind us between us and khurinost this was true enough kerian decided to detour from their mission long enough to inspect the nomad camp if the tribe seemed a peaceful one the elves would pass on but if the nomads were recognizable enemies the lioness would strike weariness dragged at every warrior but no one complained as the lioness led them away it would be dark soononly the highest peaks of the mountains ahead were still touched by sunlightand this aided their cause humans were hampered by darkness whereas elves could see almost as well at night as in full daylight the qualinesti scout led them over a series of alluvial hills formed of soil and gravel washed down from the mountains over the eons the sky darkened from sapphire to indigo and the first stars appeared a distinctly chilly wind teased the riders every time they climbed out of a hollow and topped a hill the breeze brought the smell of smoke cookfires holding up her hand the lioness halted the column in a shallow ravine wordlessly she indicated favaronas and avalyn should follow her the rest of the company would remain here the three followed the dry streambed through the ravine halting where it emptied onto open ground there spread out in a ring pattern typical of khurish nomads lay several hundred conical tents the lioness halted her horse behind a screen of cedars silently she and her two companions studied the scene in the center of the ring of tents figures moved about silhouetted against a dozen campfires there were no men to be seen only nomad women in their sandcolored gebs making supper and children darting among the tents or helping with the cooking avalyn shifted in his saddle this must be the base camp of the band that attacked us all the warriorage men are missing he whispered loudly even so we dont make war on unarmed women and children general they would slaughter our loved ones if they had the chance you dont know that favaronas said it was done in qualinesti she silenced them both this is not qualinesti and we are not dark knights they returned to the waiting army the lioness gave the order to ride and the elves faded into the night theirs werent the only eyes watching in the darkness on the south side of the nomad camp two yellow eyes stared at the ring of tents the sand beast recovered from the spell put on it by the opal of elirsana lay concealed by loose dirt and rocks its tongue flicked out tasting the night air smoke smell was strong as was human but beneath that the beast detected traces of elf the movement inside the ring of tents slowed and stopped the humans settled into their shelters the beasts tongue flicked out again the human smell was enticing though the elf tang was definitely present the impetus in its blood burned like a fever find elves kill them the drive could not be denied if humans were intermingled with its intended prey they would die too the beast rose from its hiding place shaking off dirt and rocks in four bounds it reached the outer line of tents it bore straight into the first tent rending the goatskin walls to tatters with a single swipe of its horns within slept three humans the first two died without waking the third had time to shriek once before she perished the tents did not impede the sand beasts progress it raced through the camp tattered canvas and leather caught in its horns trailed through the banked cookfires catching fire one tent was set alight then another and another against the heightened glare humans raced about yelling methodically the creature slew them all in case they might be elves in disguise barely twenty minutes after the beasts entrance into the camp silence reigned the only sound was the crackle and pop of the fires burning unchecked in three different places nothing remained alive and the smell of blood was strong too strong the beast left the silent camp and circled upwind a tantalizing whiff of elf came to it borne on the cool night wind from the mountains with uncharacteristic deliberation the sand beast set out again and resumed trailing the pack of elves near dawn the first riders of adalas band reached a hilltop overlooking their camp horrified by what they saw they sent for the weyadan and her warmasters the nomad war party had passed the night in the saddle trying to swing wide around the elves path and outflank them unfortunately they didnt know the foothills as well as they did their usual terrain and too many of them became lost in the gullies and ravines theyd finally assembled as the sky began to lighten and adala was taking them back to camp when word came of the terrible disaster whitefaced the weyadan rode through the savaged camp no one was alive all those left behindwives children old folkhad been ruthlessly slain the tents and supplies that werent burned had been shredded and trampled who could have done this asked wapah riding at adalas elbow the tears flowing unchecked down his face this question was repeated over and over by the stricken menand punctuated by harsh screams as one after another they found their butchered burned families outside her tent adala made her own dreadful discovery her two youngest children the last remaining at home lay dead on the blooddrenched ground brave forthright chisi lay atop amalia as though shed tried to shield her gentle sister from the horror that had found them on her knees beside them adala wept swaying from side to side as anguish buffeted her the laddad did this she finally said wapah frowned no weyadan however barbarous we find them they are not such fiends it is some fateful occurrence perhaps fool cant you see with your own eyes he stared at herher own eyes were great bottomless holes of pain the laddad did this she said fiercely raising her voice to repeat her words for all the others the laddad did this bilath reported no broken elf weapons no dead elves and no dead elf horses but adala insisted the laddad had gleaned every item after the massacre to hide their guilt nothing wapah or bilath could say would dissuade her from this conviction then one of bilaths men brought shocking news that stopped all speculation in a nearby ravine were the prints of three horses the prints bore the unmistakable mark of laddad smithery more they led down the ravine away from this camp and joined a mass of similar hoofprints an army of laddad had indeed passed by for these murders adala vowed they will pay wapah though unconvinced said nothing the others shouted and wailed their anger no longer was this a war only to preserve the sacred land of khur from foreigners now cradling her daughters torn bodies her robe stiff with their blood adala of the weyalu dedicated herself to torghan god of vengeance no prisoners would be taken no quarter would be given this was a war to the death chapter planchet and hytanthas remained in the rooftop leanto for hours watching as patrols tramped up and down the streets hammered on doors and bellowed at each other across the empty squares whatever the original disturbance sahimkhans soldiery had quelled itno doubt with a heavy hand the need to remain under cover when they wished to be back with their speaker tested their patience the sun reached its zenith then passed it in the unbroken blue vault of the sky the scents of cardamom pods and kefre bark in the little garden were as oppressive as the heat hytanthas gave up on his human disguise pulling the black wig from his head and stuffing it behind a row of pots when a long period went by without sight of the patrols hytanthas slapped the older elf on the back saying lets go with a terse remark about respect due to elders planchet followed the khurish habit of building houses wider at the top than at the base made the elves trek much less difficult than it would have been elsewhere and crossing khurikhan by rooftop proved an edifying process as the elves clambered over dwellings they heard babies crying laughter shouted arguments and lovemaking a hundred different food smells vied with smoke incense and the stink of privies the lives of the ordinary people of the city were open to view as hytanthas and planchet passed above their heads out of sight khurikhan was indubitably foreign yet it was also vigorously robustly alive near the temple walk the buildings grew higher and larger these were no longer private homes but government storehouses granaries and colleges for the priesthoods of the various temples sunset was well past when they finally found themselves overlooking the great promenade lined with holy shrines the entrance to each temple was illuminated by torches thrust into iron ringframes by the wavering light planchet and hytanthas watched small bands of khurish troops with halberds on their shoulders march back and forth other than these patrols the broad lane was empty theres the temple of elirsana hytanthas whispered pointing to their right the temples dome was lit from within and gave off a faint blue glow in the darkness no acolytes or priestesses were visible in the courtyard the chimes lining the low wall jingled in the night breeze the question now was how to get down they were thirty feet above the road atop a threestory flatroofed building its walls dropped smooth and straight to the pavement offering no likely footholds for a safe descent a careful search of the roof revealed the solution a trapdoor secured from the inside hytanthas was able to slip his slender fingers under its edges and free it slowly silently they eased the cover up no one cried out below so hytanthas lay flat on the roof and looked through the opening while planchet gripped his legs its a hall hytanthas whispered headdown in the opening lined with doors planchet murmured a curse no nice empty storehouse for themthey were trying to enter a priestly dormitory he started to haul hytanthas back so they could try another building but the wiry young elf lifted his feet gripped the edge of the doorframe and somersaulted through the opening catlike he landed noiselessly lifting his hands he urged planchet to use him as a ladder to climb down insolent whelp muttered the speakers valet although less agile than hytanthas who was a quarter his age planchet was no graybeard he lowered himself through the opening hung for a second and let go unfortunately hytanthas in his zeal to help managed to trip him the two elves went down in a tangle hitting the wooden floor with a loud thump they froze expecting sleepy priests to emerge from the rooms none did no light showed beneath the doors the holy ones slept on undisturbed the elves hastened down the hall toward a stair landing as planchet rounded the top of the steps he ran headlong into a woman she was clad in a pale gray gown and turban and carried no lamp the two intruders looming up suddenly in front of her stole her breath and planchets hand clamped over her mouth before she regained it he pressed her against the wall hoping to forestall any magic she might try to use against them curse it weve entered a college of priestesses he hissed this isnt saida by chance hytanthas shook his head and whispered be silent lady we intend no harm we are unjustly pursued by the khans soldiers and seek refuge in the temple of elirsana do you understand she nodded and he smiled well let you go but you mustnt raise an alarm yes again a nod the elves exchanged a look after a moments hesitation planchet took his hand away immediately the priestess hissed no men are allowed here ever begging your pardon holy lady but were not men planchet said reasonably touching the tip of one pointed ear males this is sacrilege her voice was rising the khan will hear of this violation that was enough for planchet he snatched the scarf from her head loosing a fall of gray hair and gagged her with the cloth she tried to yell but only a thin gurgle emerged around the gag he took her by one arm hytanthas grabbed the other and they propelled the priestess down the stairs at the bottom they found a small cupboard under the steps planchet pressed her inside whipping out his silk kerchief he tied her ankles together when he asked hytanthas to surrender his own kerchief the younger elf shrugged he had none what kind of uncouth stripling goes out without a kerchief planchet snapped a poor one with no more possessions than he stands in planchet spun hytanthas around and pulled off his geb leaving him standing in leggings and low boots the priestesss eyes grew wider still at the sight of the barechested elf planchet had to admit he was an oddlooking sight the dye hed used for his disguise had been applied only to arms neck and face his torso was several shades lighter planchet tore a strip from the gebs hem and used it to bind the womans wrists then tore another to bind her wrists to her ankles hoping to delay her escape he tossed the ruined garment back to hytanthas and what am i to do with this hytanthas asked sarcastically make yourself some kerchiefs planchet rejoined the womans eyes incandescent with fury above the gag followed them as they closed the cupboard door they exited the building through a side door which put them in an alley the gate in the wall surrounding the temple of elirsana was directly ahead across the promenade the iron portal stood open the patrol had already passed by and all was quiet they stepped out of the alleys concealment and strode toward the temple gate as hytanthas reached the gate a deep voice rumbled behind them stand where you are planchet hissed a soft curse both elves pivoted to face this new menace hard leather heels thudded a broadshouldered dark skinned man strode forward he was clad in leather trews and a short tunic much like the attire worn by huntsmen in qualinesti the strangers togs were not the green or brown of the forest however they were an unsettling shade of purplish red his wide face was clean shaven with brows thick and black he was head and shoulders taller than the two elves his identity was obvious to both of them it was the nerakan emissary hengriff thats hardly proper attire for where youre going he said gesturing at hytanthass torn geb his other hand rested on the pommel of a sheathed sword a slender court blade your own garb is out of place too planchet said wryly dont you stifle in all that leather im accustomed to it besides i prefer it to the local style too much like a womans dress males are not allowed within this temple you know while he talked the elves desperately searched the darkness behind him hengriff seemed alone although a formidablelooking fighter the knight could hardly hope to best two agile swordarmed elves still he seemed supremely confident hytanthas said we have business with the high priestess were known to her business what business could elves have with a fusty old priestess our own planchet said then shoved hytanthas through the open gate shouting go unfortunately the captain taken by surprise stumbled the knight shouted a command suddenly the night air was filled with a strange whirring sound four lengths of rope blackened by soot hit the pavement in an arc behind hengriff down each rope slid a brawny human dressed all in blackshort black tunics closefitting trousers and suede boots in seconds the men had landed silently and drawn swords they sprinted toward the elves planchet jerked hytanthas to his feet and the pair scrambled through the gate the pursuing nerakans did not try to crowd through the narrow opening but vaulted the chesthigh wall it delayed them hardly at all hengriff approached with more deliberation entering by the gate i have questions and i want answers he said firmly youll come with us not today nerakan hengriff laughed at hytanthass defiant statement echoing like a bulls bellow the sound filled the courtyard it died abruptly when light flooded the scene the double doors to the temple had opened silhouetted there her long shadow reaching out from the colonnade was a woman begone men of war you cannot remain on sacred ground hengriff shouted across the distance you dont command me saida nor my men the high priestess followed by a handful of acolytes appeared out of the light she looked even more commanding than hengriff stern and regal she kept her eyes fixed on the knight and spread her arms wide as she approached her white robe seemed to gather the light surrounding her with a bright flowing aura without looking away from her hengriff ordered his men to take the elves the four warriors advanced but when they were just five yards away the swords suddenly flew from their hands the nerakans tried to keep coming but a powerful force pushed against them they bent forward at the waist like men bucking a high wind though the air was still hengriff put a hand on the hilt of his own sword but did not draw his weapon in grim silence he watched his men shoved relentlessly backward across the courtyard and through the opening in the wall once in the street however they straightened the unseen pressure no longer affecting them youll regret this healer hengriff rumbled youve made an enemy death was always our enemy go the knight spared a glance at the elves this is not finished he told them he and his men departed submerging into the darkness beyond the sacred enclosure for a moment no one spoke then saida sent two acolytes to close the temple gates the clang of iron broke through the elves dazed immobility planchet got to his feet and straightened his clothing brushing dust from his knees he performed introductions in his most diplomatic manner saida pursed her lips frowning i know who you are this oneshe nodded at hytanthashas been here before but you cannot remain it is forbidden yes lady i know but we hoped you could provide sanctuary planchet replied the khans soldiers are in the streets hunting elves its not the khan you need fear but the followers of torghan she gestured at her followers two grayhaired acolytes approached received quiet instructions and departed hytanthas still dazed by events found he had to clear his throat before he could speak those men he finally asked how did you repel them holy lady potent protective spells are woven around our sacred shrine no one may bear weapons of war into the goddesss sanctuary the two elves glanced down at the swords they wore do not draw them she warned if you do you will be driven out even as they were the grayhaired acolytes returned each carrying a bundle of clothing khurish robes mostly old and dingy were laid at the elves feet hengriff is intimate with the khan when word reaches him that you are here soldiers will come i am sorry but i cannot offer you any hospitality you must disguise yourselves and go saida said hytanthas started to object but planchet cut him off the valet thanked the priestess politely and began sorting through the clothing reluctantly his companion did the same discarding the torn garment he still wore they decked themselves in sleeveless gebs and trailing outer robes a scarf wrapped around the head concealed their telltale ears thus swathed from head to foot and with the added cloak of night their disguises looked authentic planchet tugged the sash tight around his waist bowed slightly and walked toward the iron gate hytanthas hovered briefly torn between the need to go with his comrade and the desire to try and learn more about the nerakan knight saida ended his conflict by turning and leading her followers into the temple the doors closed the bright light was cut off and hytanthas was left in darkness come lad planchet called weve a long way to go the journey across the dark city was a nervous one but they reached khurinost without serious incident dawn was breaking as they approached their greatest challenge the city gatehouse but luck was with them a horde of soukats milled outside eager to get back to their stalls in the markets the mayhem of the day before had not discouraged them indeed some spoke about how good business ought to be today as curious crowds came out to see where so much blood had been shed beset by the noisy pushy tradesmen the guards on the gate didnt give the disguised elves a second glance planchet headed straight for the speakers tent hytanthas followed but more than once the valet had to double back and retrieve the wayward warrior finding him standing idle his gaze distant and him lost in thought planchet himself was boneweary and ravenous neither he nor hytanthas had eaten since yesterday morning before this whole adventure began he could only imagine how much worse the captain must feel these events having come directly on the heels of the two tense days hed spent disguised in the capital but there could be neither rest nor food and drink until theyd reported to the speaker a small group of court officials occupied the audience chamber but the speaker was not present in his place morillon ambrodel held court at the center of the disturbed crowd as a result of the violence of yesterday morning they quickly learned a flood of qualinesti and silvanesti had returned from khurikhan with stab wounds broken heads and worse fortyfour elves were still missing planchet heard cries of what are we to do and the speaker must protect us his strong hands and penetrating voice parted the crowd pushing aside qualinesti silvanesti and kagonesti alike planchet made his way to morillon and asked where the speaker could be found still abed for aught i know rousing him is your job i believe the haughty noble eyed planchets scruffy human attire with distaste where have you been anyway the valet folded his arms and surveyed the assembly some of the elves were former senators of the thalasenthia others were commoners elevated by circumstance or the vote of their neighbors to become their representatives to the speaker every face bore an expression of grave concern i passed the night in the city my lord running and hiding from humans intent on cutting my throat he said gasps circled the chamber is the khan turning against us asked a frightened senator the valet held up placating hands dont panic the riot appears to have been started by followers of the khurish god torghan when the khans troops arrived to put down the fighting they were told elves started it calm has been restored in the city but i must report these events to the speaker he and the khan need to meet to clarify what happened i must go to sahimkhan all heads turned gilthas stood in the passage leading to his private rooms lord morillon swept up to him great speaker you should not wait upon a barbarian lord like sahim let him come to you you have precedence as ruler of the most ancient race its his country morillon i will go to sahimkhan as soon as he will receive me everyone spoke at once some supporting morillons attitude others the speakers woven through the discussion was frightened speculation about the possibility of war with the khans army hytanthas found his mind drifting the debate raging around him sounded like the hum of bees disturbed in their hive he was wrung out he felt disconnected distant then unexpectedly his gaze fell on a stranger across the chamber a stooped figure stood motionless amidst the milling elves covered in heavy layers of ragged brown robes he was comically out of place yet no one seemed to notice him senators moved around hytanthas bumping him occasionally but they gave no sign of seeing the robed stranger hytanthas stared hard but could get no impression of a face only a cowled darkness he called a warning but the noise of the discussion had risen to such a level he couldnt even hear his own shouted words nor did any of the others seem to hear him he began shouldering his way through the crowd intent on reaching the cowled intruder was he a spy in the pay of sahimkhan or another tool of neraka whatever he was he should not be here listening to the elves intimate councils as he reached the stranger hytanthas grabbed the dagger worn by a ruggedlooking kagonesti the chosen representative of his tribe normally keenly aware the wilder elf didnt react at all to hytanthass theft of his weapon closer now he noted the strangers face was hidden in the depths of his hood his hands tucked into his sleeves hytanthas seized him by the wrist or he tried his hand passed through the intruders arm as though he was a ghost at last the stranger took notice of him the cowl turned toward hytanthas and from it came a faint startled query you see me how is that possible hytanthas tried shouting again great speaker a spy he found his own wrist gripped the strangers hand was solid enough now with long fingers and prominent joints his hold was like the snap of a bear trap swift and hard hytanthas protested and jerked his arm repeatedly but couldnt free himself you had better come with me hissed the stranger hytanthas finally caught a glimpse of the intruders face it was dark like polished wood with a beak of a nose thin lips and eyes like none the elf had ever seen before his eyes were dark brownnearly blackfrom corner to corner hytanthas cried out in horror and the cry rose in pitch as he noticed something even worse hanging down behind the hooded figure was a tail bushy brown and fully three feet long at that moment gilthas glanced away from his wrangling advisors and his eye fell upon captain ambrodel hytanthass head was tilted back his mouth slack he held his left arm rigidly across his chest concerned gilthas called attention to the captains distorted posture the kagonesti senator standing in front of hytanthas turned and spoke to the young elf as gilthas made his way across the room but hytanthas did not respond his eyes remained closed the speaker arrived laying a hand on hytanthass rigid arm instantly the bizarre trance was broken hytanthas opened his eyes staggered back and fell unconscious to the floor planchet knelt by him fainted he said attributing the incident to a lack of food and the rigors of the past few days at the speakers direction planchet carried the unconscious elf to a spare room off of gilthass own bedchamber excusing himself telling his subjects to continue their discussion during his brief absence gilthas followed planchet had placed the captain on a cot and was removing his boots he looked up as the speaker entered i dont think this was caused by simple weakness gilthas said quietly his expression grave he gently lifted hytanthass left arm the one the young elf had held so rigidly the wrist bore red marks as though strong fingers had held it in a crushing grip by strenuous riding through the night the weyalu band circled wide of the elves and got between them and the pass leading into the valley of the blue sands the normally empty foothills were alive with skulking scouts and reconnaissance parties from both sides all feeling their way through unfamiliar territory with every nerve strained to detect the enemy adala had hoped to pick up reinforcements before meeting the lioness again but her messages to other tribes had gone unanswered when the elven army was seen to be heading north from khurikhan the tondoon and mikku scouts had assured adalas scout of their tribes support unfortunately those assurances had not yet generated anything of substance no tondoon or mikku riders had arrived to bolster the weyadans force adala disregarded advice from both etosh and bilath that they wait a while longer to give other tribesmen time to join them the laddad must be punished for their foul deeds they must be stopped and prevented from entering the hidden valley the prophecy of the oracle clearly warned of grave upheavals if the elves claimed the spot the leader of the weyalu carried several titles one of the lesserknown being protector of the blue sands until flow this had seemed only an ancient ceremonial distinction with the incursion of the laddad the title was gaining new significance and overlaying everything else was the weyadans unswerving whitehot need for vengeance the murderous foreigners had to be brought to account for their massacre of the nomad camp most of the weyalu accepted their leaders judgment that the elves were responsible for the atrocity a few like wapah and bilath were troubled by the lack of evidence linking the slaughter to the laddad but even they had to admit there seemed no other explanation sahimkhan certainly was ruthless enough but he stood to gain nothing from the killing besides his army was bottled up in the capital watching the elven host and guarding against any sudden coup knights of neraka or wayward bands of ogres or minotaurs might be responsible but none were known to be in the area the only foreigners in khur were the elves and elven cavalry had certainly been close by a council of war was called for late in the afternoon the land hereabouts was not the best for battle bad for horses the ground was uneven covered by shelves of rock tumbled from the pillars of heaven long ago clumps of thorny creeper made the footing even more hazardous still it would have to do the council gathered on a great shelf of slate settling into its traditional ranks the outermost ring was composed of elder warriors the middle ring of war chiefs and the inner ring of clan chiefs etosh wanted to divide the nomad force in two and hide one band on either side of the pass when the laddad were firmly committed to the single track into the valley the furious nomads would have them in a vise adala listened silently to the plan she was darning a rip in a horsehair poncho belonging to a weyalu man who no longer had wife or sisters to do the task for him all had died in the massacre turning the garment over she tested the stitches with her thumbnail and found them strong when etosh finished speaking she announced your plan is wrong the weyalu wont follow it he took her judgment in silence but the clan chiefs asked why shed vetoed the scheme it had their approval never divide your forces in the face of the enemy she said even if you are greater in number leaning forward she used a darning needle to draw a pair of lines in the sand the lines were at right angles to each other this is how well take them this part of the warbandshe indicated the northsouth linewill attack the laddad first from the side while the othersthe eastwest linewill swing in behind them cutting off their retreat like the jaws of a panther said wapah seeing the deadliness of adalas plan her strategy had the advantage of never separating the nomads while still striking the elves on two sides gwarali an elder fighter disagreed adalas battle plan left two routes for the elves to escape westward through the foothills and north into the valley if they go in either direction their doom is certain adala said west takes them farther away from their people at khurikhan and we can drive them into the burning sands of the south there they perish she folded the mended garment neatly laying it over her lap if they go north well have them in a bottle yes but theyll be in the valley said gwarali and i will ask the gods to punish them for their blasphemy at this some men not of the leaping spider clan openly snickered adalas dark eyes flashed you dare mock them those on high have placed me here to do their will and do it i shall unto death gwarali a great bearlike man with a reddish beard and broad belly said soothingly now sister how can you say that have the high ones appeared to you not directly but their will is plain my husband was taken by death placing me the weyadan at the head of my people my husbands blood cousin wapah was chosen by the prince of khur to lead him to the oracle thereby warning us of the laddads intent to steal our land and usurp the gods why else would these things have happened except to place the defense of our sacred land in my hands maita the word murmured by wapah meant fate but with the connotation of an outcome predestined by the gods something no mortal could escape a few clan elders were still skeptical but they took care to be polite about it gwarali tried to steer the discussion back to etoshs plan to ambush the elves but the weyadan would not bend she stood abruptly this usually signaled the end of a council and the men around her were startled by her breech of manners stay where you are she commanded i will show you my maita she picked her way through the rings of chiefs and warriors standing on the rim of the gray slab of slate she pointed northward three mountain peaks known by the nomads as torghans teeth were aligned in a perfectly spaced row half a days ride straight toward them led to the only pass into the valley of the blue sands so tall were the three that their tops were dusted with snow that never melted the sky above the mountains streaked by feathery clouds seemed boundless as the sea the sun was nearly gone behind the western range the setting sun left the three mountains in shadow but touched the high clouds and the snowy tips of the teeth with orange and crimson hear me high ones adala cried the time has come for justice if i am to be your instrument make it known to all i care nothing for fame or glory mighty gods only for your will and the rights of my people she flung her arms wide show me my maita show the world her last words rang over the harsh landscape echoing against the faraway slopes of the teeth for several long minutes there was silence broken only by the muttered comments of several of the men behind her then out of the clear breadth of sky thunder rolled the men stirred they hadnt expected to hear or see anything from his place behind adalas seat wapah bowed his head the weyadan was the weyadan he would never doubt her again a second louder clap of thunder boomed caroming off the pillars of heaven for an endless time by the time the echoes died the entire council was on its feet bilath shouted those on high have spoken adala maita adala maita the others took up the cry turning it into a chant adala lowered her hands crossing her arms and bringing her hands to rest on her chest she was breathing heavily with tears filling her eyes she had believed in her fate but this display of divine favor was overwhelming that the gods would condescend to give so obvious a sign before the doubters of her own peoplethis was the greatest moment of her life gwarali approached halting respectfully three paces away weyadan we will follow you he said simply six miles away the sand beast was scrambling over the rocky ledges when it caught the scent of the nomad army poised between two spires of stone it slowly turned its angular head tasting the breeze humans many humans but no hint of elves the intervening foothills confused it limiting its usual range of sight and smell the beast had been paralleling the elves for two days but must have gotten ahead of them during the night it would have to double back legs like coiled steel sent the monster vaulting from its perch and it began to run so rapidly did the beast move it rent the air asunder sending cracks of thunder ringing in its wake some miles away the lioness leading her depleted troop heard the thunder as well she held up a hand to halt the column favaronas plodding along a dozen yards back trotted to her did you hear it he demanded did you hear that thunder they knew well what such a sound from a clear sky meant she told her officers to send flankers out a hundred yards but make sure they keep in sight of the column she cautioned she wet a kerchief with a few drops of water then offered the gourd to favaronas while she dabbed her face with the damp cloth what can we do if the thing attacks again will the magical orb work a second time favaronas asked she shrugged tying her hair back with the damp kerchief her knowledge of magical artifacts was limited she changed the subject have you any idea why this creature should be following us so doggedly she asked the scholar didnt he knew only what hed told her earlier that sand beasts were wild animals of the deep desert and rare obviously the creature was a predator but what sort of predator would follow armed and mounted warriors over several days and many miles only the twolegged kind kerian said dryly and thats who i think set this monster on our trail a twolegged predator when the flanking riders were in place watching for attack or ambush she waved the column forward they would reach the inathwakenti in two days more and more she felt the foolishness of gilthass idea to send their people there even if the valley proved to have a temperate climate it wasnt their natural home and never would be witless nomads and bloodthirsty beasts were the only creatures suited to this harsh terrible land elves needed the cool green woods of the lands that had given them birth and sustenance through the ages without them would they not soon cease to be elves as always thoughts of home made kerians blood burn it required all her discipline to keep from reining about and galloping madly to qualinesti to try to free the land of its oppressors or die in the trying they should not be in khur whether desert or city or fabled valley none of it was theirs none of it they should be attacking the enemies whod dared invade their ancestral lands gilthas believed life mattered more than land of course gilthas worried more about life than landhe had been born into royalty no matter where he dwelt he was the speaker of the sun and stars he was a kingno matter where he was forced to locate his kingdom in all her life kerianseray had known no such luxury she was a fighter for her country and her people without her country or her people what was left what was she then favaronas watched curiously as the lioness prodded her mount to a trot her back was straight and her chin outthrust in the time hed been with her the archivist had come to know that posture that look she was controlling her anger only two things in the world could make her so furious could reduce her lips to that tight white line the gnawing loss of qualinesti to their enemies and disagreement with the speaker he wondered which was consuming her now paul b thompson tonya c cook elven exiles bk sanctuary chapter the afternoon repose of khurikhan was first broken by the jangle of sistrums and the clash of cymbals housewives lifted the shades covering their window openings and peered outside to see what the noise was about soukats taking a respite from the mornings trading pushed back their hats or came out from under their awnings anticipating an event wine merchants in the grand souks reopened their stands the street dogs of khurikhan always alert began barking the deep thump of a drum sounded two slow beats followed by two quick a quintet of guards appeared their helmets were askew armor straps flapping for they had been sleeping too they made a ragged line and ported arms standing as much at attention as the khans soldiers ever did someone was comingsomeone important the curious khurs first saw a double line of elf maidens twenty strong each wore a white kneelength silk gown and as a concession to the punishing sun a matching scarf tied around her head golden girdles draping their slim hips sparkled as did the garland of golden leaves twining their necks they carried white baskets strewing the contents on the street before them at home this would have been flower petals here in khurikhan it was white sand washed and polished until it glittered like silver behind the twenty maidens came thirty young elf males also clad in white hands feet and faces were browned by years of desert life but arms and legs were still pale as the forest shade had made them each elf wore abroad belt made of jointed golden plates in the center of each plate flashed an enormous flat jewel peridot or aquamarine each of the thirty elves held aloft a pole laminated with gold ten poles were topped with the golden sun symbol and ten with a stylized silver star atop the poles of the final ten was a flat plaque of lapis lazuli on which appeared a gold sun and silver star of equal size the khurs couldnt know it but the precious metal on these standards was only thin plating over common brass or copper still they made an impressive display by now khurs of all ages were spilling out of their houses to see this wondrous parade for years theyd sold meat meal cloth and soap to the laddad and nothing dispels mystery like such humble practical transactions the elves theyd met were nothing like the tales said they were a somber people of few words with reddened faces and dirty nails not so the glorious apparitions promenading down the street today these were the elves of legend trailing the elf maidens and standard bearers were musicians four pairs of tympani strode down the center of the road flanked on either side by a dozen whiterobed youths either shaking sistrums or clanging cymbals the rhythm was insistent two slow beats followed by two fast again and again on the heels of the drummers were twelve older brownskinned elves dressed in green they were kagonesti pipers carrying twinned flutes of silver and brass not yet playing they walked with proud precision dark hair hanging loose below their shoulders their heads covered by leather skullcaps the parade penetrated the wide street of salahkhan which ran along the western end of the grand souks and the pipers raised their instruments a trill of notes floated over the desert city elf voices answered crying esh eshthe ancient greeting elves made to the sun each morning the thirty standards of sun of stars and of the two conjoined were lifted skyward after the pipers hamaramis and fifty warriors of the speakers guard marched into view they were arrayed in their best armor with plumed helmets and brilliant green mantles boors might have noted the scuffs and dents in the armor and how some plumes were broken but such imperfections did not detract from the spectacle each warriors short sword was sheathed and slung over his back a traditional method of indicating peaceful intent each soldier held a brass and iron buckler to his chest with his left hand and in his right gripped a ceremonial mace made of ivory the heads were shaped like a sun or a star in the last rank of these warriors marched a watchful hytanthas hed been attached to the speakers guard so he could point out the phantom hed seen in the speakers tent should the creature make an appearance in the soldiers wake came a delegation of silvanesti led by lord morillon ambrodel they were dressed as silvanesti lords had been for centuries in deeply pleated robes of sky blue sun yellow or star white disdaining to mar their ensembles with practical headgear the silvanesti went bareheaded they would pay for their pride later with bouts of sunburn and prickly heat last of all came the speaker himself on foot he could have ridden but with every horse precious to his army he chose not to the way wasnt long from khurinost to the palace not nearly as long as from qualinost to khur he did not wear his best robesthe clothofgold and fireknap in which hed been crownedbut a simple white gown with elbowlength sleeves which brushed his ankles a rope of woven gold strands was tied around his waist a collar of lapis bars encircled his throat and gold bracelets decorated each wrist he also had chosen not to wear a crown neither the sun diadem of qualinesti nor the star circlet of silvanesti he was a speaker in exile wearing crowns while homeless seemed to gilthas the height of hubris four favored senators walked around him carrying poles supporting a light linen canopy this spare shade was his only protection from the sun planchet walked at his left elbow where his consort should have walked gilthas deliberately left an open spot honoring kerianseray the end of the parade was composed of dignitaries of all kinds each elf carried some sign of his or her office a senators baton a courtiers medallion a scholars scroll a healers vial and so forth not all the khurs watching the procession were charmed or dazzled some glowered and a few shook fists at the elves who marched solemnly ahead only once as they were passing through the grand souks was anything thrown a few overripe fruits pelted the ceremonial guard they never broke step and the khans soldiers charged into the crowd they found the young offenders and dragged them away beating them with olivewood staves the most direct route from the elves camp to the khuri yl nor was all narrow winding alleys and shadedarkened lanes gilthass grand parade deliberately took a different way following the widest streets in the city to give scope to his faded grandeur in the great days of sithel or kithkanan a speakers royal procession would have numbered many thousands today it contained fewer than three hundred only one other notable incident occurred during the elves passage near the great naksafal artesian well the street of salahkhan crossed the temple walk by the well in a very real sense this was the true center of khurikhan more sacred than any temple more vital than palace or granary never in the harsh history of khur had the well gone dry when malystryx scourged the city it was to the naksafal that the poor and destitute ran knowing that whatever else befell them they would not lack for lifegiving water vexed by this display of faith the red dragon tore a boulder from the city wall and flung it into the well the great rock had been swallowed up by the white sand at the bottom of the well and only a single corner showed above the waters surface the naksafal overflowed for five days gently washing the cobblestones of the square still imbedded in the sand the boulder was known among city folk as malshmekkek malyss tooth as the speakers parade wound past the well hytanthas ambrodel saw a hooded ragdraped figure standing at its edge the hood turned toward him and the elf suddenly felt dizzy framed by moldering cloth was the face of the strange apparition hed glimpsed in the speakers tent the night before the bizarre solidly brown eyes locked onto hytanthass own his step faltered drums pipes and cymbals sounded far away he felt a strange twisting sensation in his stomach as though the ground had unexpectedly fallen away from his feet and all at once he seemed to be standing outside his own body watching himself walk shoulder to shoulder with the honor guard the effect of seeing himself walking was utterly disorienting hytanthas began to fall a strong hand caught him by the back of the neck steady lad planchet said holding him upright remember where you are hes here hytanthas gasped the ghostly spy i saw in the speakers tent hes by the well in the ragged brown robe planchet squinted against the glare but thats no ghost i can see him myself are you certain thats him as hytanthas fixed his gaze on the ground seeking to regain his balance planchet looked again at the scruffy figure in brown he was still there facing away from the valet then seemingly from one heartbeat to the next he vanished planchet blinked and stared but the hunched fellow was gone the valet shook his head it took little imagination to think the fellow most likely a sorcerer or a mage perhaps even the mysterious faeterus himself do you think so hytanthas asked looking more himself and planchet realized hed voiced his speculation aloud its possible the valet said pushing hytanthas back toward his place in the procession the parade of elves reached the square before the khuri yl nor and found sahimkhans household guard awaiting them turned out in full regalia while they lacked the grace and style of the elves the khans elite possessed a barbarous splendor of their own handpicked for height and physique the guardsmen made an imposing show in their tall spiked helmets articulated breastplates and pantherskin mantles arrayed outside the main gate of the citadel in two blocks the guards struck the ground with their halberds and shouted sahimkhan the elves halted between the blocks of khurish soldiers the maidens and standard bearers stood aside allowing the remainder of the procession to advance soon gilthas was being greeted at the palace gate by sahims vizier zunda a relic from the days of the dragon zunda had retained his place as vizier by being the oiliest most obsequious courtier in khurikhan the tightly curled hair which fell past his shoulders was an obvious wig and the flat black color of his elaborately curled beard was just as obviously due to dye greetings o light of the elven nations zunda intoned loudly bowing as low as his belly allowed the great khan of all the khurs lion of the desert vanquisher of dragons sahim son of salah welcomes you gilthas lowered his eyes briefly in acknowledgment at his gesture lord morillon stepped forward and answered the vizier the noble speaker of the sun and stars gilthas of favored name earnestly desires an audience with the great khan the silvanesti would not be outdone by a mere khur when it came to flowery speech the glorious sahim father of khur and fount of all justice has heard of your coming he bids me his most unworthy vizier to convey you to his awesome presence all eyes but the speakers switched back to morillon the silvanesti pressed a hand to his chest and bowed his head smiling with magnificent condescension gracious vizier we are awed by the generosity of your great khan i morillon ambrodel son of kenthalantas ambrodel and councilor to the speaker of the sun and stars beg you to lead on and we shall enter with gratitude into the presence of your mighty lord everyone looked back to zunda this was obviously a battle to the death my heart overflows noble morillon should i perish at this moment i would die in blissful content to have known the celebrated personages of my great khan sahim son of salah the speaker of the sun and stars and your most noble self you have but to follow and this auspicious audience shall commence immediately zunda backed away bowing three times as he went hamaramis gave the command and the honor guard started after him as he passed the redfaced morillon gilthas murmured think he won the khuri yl nor was still in poor shape though repairs continued day and night the inner yard had been swept clean of debris but the restored facades of the norkhan and the khanate sahims private residence still were marked by large sections of unglazed brick and raw timber the banner of khur with its pair of rampant golden dragons hung from the battlement of the great keep flapping slowly in the hot breeze it had been rent by malyss claws giving it the look of a pennon straining guards opened the heavy bronze doors within the keep the air was pleasantly cool on the seaward side of the palace enormous canvas funnels channeled sea breezes inside this cooled the palace and filled it with the scent of the ocean the norkhan was a maze of broad highceilinged halls and long lowroofed corridors in part this was intentional to confuse intruders but it also reflected the varied history of khur khans with money built lavishly those who were poor did not the result was a hodgepodge palace which only experienced lackeys and courtiers like zunda could navigate successfully during their journey through the hallways planchet realized they were passing beneath the same area of cracked ceiling plaster for a second time he murmured sire theyre leading us in circles gilthas smiled sahimkhan needs time to prepare his welcome when at last zunda conducted the elf delegation into the audience hall sahim was seated on the sapphire throne waiting he wore a splendid gown of dark blue silk along its hem were embroidered dragons in red and gold the red crown of khur sat upon his head and his beard had been combed and arranged in neat curls he smiled broadly when zunda announced the speaker of the sun and stars my brother he proclaimed rising to his feet to what do i owe this inestimable honor gilthas halted at the foot of the throne dais he did not bow as heir to two of the oldest monarchies in the known world he took precedence over an upstart like sahim however protocol was not as important as diplomacy so he found a way to pay homage to his host with an outward sweep of his arm gilthas managed to convey the spirit of a bow without actually performing one great khan i have come to confer with you about the troublesome situation growing in your city he said as you know my consort lady kerianseray was set upon in the temple walk two days after that a mob of khurs rioted in the markets seeking out elves to beat and kill ah yes sahim sat back down the perpetrators are known to me and are being rounded up for punishment even now most of the elven delegation silently fumed at seeing their speaker forced to stand before the khan like an ordinary supplicant for his part gilthas adopted the bland mask hed worn for so long during marshal medans occupation of qualinost who are these people criminals they are now sahim said and laughed unpleasantly theyre fanatics religious fanatics how have my people offended them only by your existence great speaker worshipers of torghan love their country but the presence ofhe almost said laddadelves in khur is seen by them as an affront to the nation and their god the exchange between rulers polite on its surface went on with the speaker seeking assurances that no further attacks would be made on his people while sahim eluded any promises planchet used the time to study the inhabitants of the throne room those he could see without turning his head the most glaring absence was that of sahims heir prince shobbat had not been glimpsed in public for some time it was rumored he was quite ill the walls of the room were lined with a motley collection of khurs city folk and nomads nobles from delphon and kortal were identifiable by their distinctive fashions flattopped conical hats on the delphonians and the westernstyle attire worn by those from kortal a territory situated near the border with neraka some of the miscreants have in fact confessed the khan said and planchets attention snapped back to him given the sort of persuasion meted out in the khans dungeon his prisoners would confess to anything to a man they insist the trouble began when elves paid for goods using debased coinage the soft background chatter ceased throughout the hail sahim had just accused the elves of passing coins made of inferior mixtures of metal rather than pure steel gold silver or copper the speakers slender brows drew together those who knew him well recognized the stirring of anger i know nothing of this he said tersely sahim leaned forward his expression one of concern traders in the souks are shrewd but many live on the knifeedge of ruin a days wages lost in bad coinage can mean starvation for their families i am told that word of the false coins reached the sons of the crimson vulture and they sought to make the offending elves pay in genuine metal he leaned back again spreading his hands expansively alas they could not tell the guilty from the innocent and waylaid all elves they found but be assured great speaker the matter is resolved the offenders will pay with their heads he announced this with the same casual air another man might adopt when promising a simple favor the speakers entourage wore grim expressions sahim while vowing to punish the rioters plainly blamed the elves for the trouble and was daring the speaker to contradict him a faint smile crossed gilthass lips the mighty khans justice be done he said inclining his head slightly might i make an offer in the interest of good relations between our peoples grandly the khan waved for him to continue let me repay those vendors who lost money and the families of the men who face your judgment this i will do out of my own treasury the humans filling the edges of the hall shifted murmuring among themselves they had not expected this sahimkhan on the other hand could not stop the grin that split his face he beamed saying the speakers generosity would not be wasted polite robbery thought hytanthas from his place with the honor guard he seethed at the injustice of the gesture that the speaker should pay for a riot not of the elves making sahim was stealing just as surely as if he held the speaker at the point of a knife and demanded his purse and hytanthas had no doubt every steel piece of the socalled indemnity would end in the khans pockets to distract himself from his anger hytanthas let his gaze wander the honor guard was divided into two lines each facing inward toward the speaker hytanthas was on the speakers right looking toward the khurs on sahims right those crowded along the north wall of the hall as he scanned the khurs he hoped to see the ragdraped man among them but be did not he did spot lord hengriff although draped in civilian dress the nerakan was unmistakable standing behind him were four more large humans like him they were cleanshaven and dressed in civilian finery hytanthas had no trouble recognizing them for what they werethe knights personal bodyguard and most probably the same men who had tried to take hytanthas and planchet at the temple of elirsana last night hamaramis suddenly barked an order the honor guard made a quarterturn facing away from the throne the speaker bowed slightly as the khan slipped away his audience was over the elves went out with proud dignity but every heart burned with shame and every jaw was clenched tight only the speaker appeared calm he spoke a few words to his valet planchets angry color lessened he nodded obediently and drifted away from the speakers side outside musicians courtiers and standard bearers began to form up again hytanthas took his place at the rear of the honor guard but was pulled aside planchet pushed a khurish robe at him and hissed shed your armor and don this youre staying in the city the captain knew why to look for faeterus unbuckling his breastplate under cover of his milling countrymen he whispered what do i do if i find him send word well take care of the rest planchet added the word is eagle eye that will mean youve found the sorcerer hytanthas pulled the robe over his head it smelled as though it had just come off its previous owner with a sun hat pulled down over his ears and his chin down to hide his hairless cheeks he slipped away from his comrades an investigation of the robes pockets yielded a purse containing twenty steel a sizable sum it ought to be enough to buy the information he needed one of the forward scouts came galloping back his horses hooves clattering loudly on the stony soil kerian reined up halting the column although the qualinesti said nothing until hed halted his mount before her she could tell by his face that hed been successful i found the pass general the entrance to the valley he confirmed the identifying landmarks kerian had memorized from gilthass map the three peaks snowcapped were there lined up abreast no tracks went in or out of the pass kerian was relieved she didnt imagine the nomads were done with them yet but at least they hadnt reached the pass first the sand beast too haunted her thoughts there was no telling when the creature might turn up again while the scout and his panting horse quenched their thirsts she turned to another important task it was time to apprise gilthas of their progress the sun was low in the late afternoon sky but she didnt want to wait until morning to dispatch a courier she chose a rugged kagonesti named redhawk to return to khurinost with the reports shed composed the sealed letters went into a leather pouch which the kagonesti looped around his neck she handed him one last missive a flat parcel wrapped in oilskin and sealed with wax this she said is for the speaker personally no one else the other dispatches may be handed to planchet or hamaramis but this goes into no hands but gilthas pathfinders redhawk swore to carry out the mission exactly laying a bluetattooed hand on the pouch around his neck he vowed this will not leave me so long as i live none knew better than she the seriousness of a wilder pledge when redhawk had diminished to a smudge of dust on the horizon she turned her attention back to the qualinesti scout lead us to the entrance into the pass well camp there for the night with the qualinesti in the lead the column moved out the three mountain peaks loomed ahead blotting out all sight of the way beyond kerian stared in amazement at their snowy tops she couldnt even remember the last time shed seen snow as the column entered the mouth of the pass the last fingernail slice of sun vanished below the western range to their left with the light gone the temperature plummeted leaving shivering riders to don longunused cloaks it really wasnt so cold but compared to the blast furnace of the high plateau the air felt frigid indeed the pass was a silent place the wind which had swirled around the elves since the khalkist mountains first came in view died away although there were more plants about scrub pines and gnarled junipers thorny greasebushes and spiky aloethe area seemed oddly lifeless the only sound to be heard was the clink of their horses hooves on the pebbly soil no birds chattered from the trees no insects buzzed color was returning to elven eyes the desert was dull all tans browns and grays surmounted always by a blue sky that cloudless seemed oddly flat at the mouth of the inathwakenti subtle shadings were restored to the landscapes palette the mountainsides were softly washed in purple and blue dark green pines stood over dwarf junipers in lighter greens moss and lichen mottled the rocks in silvery gray or a green as bright as the limes popular in khurikhan kerian did not like it when the valley had been nothing more than a spot on a map shed had many reasons for not wanting to come here much less to live here now that it was real now that she was here her objections only increased the very feel of the place was wrong tainted somehow she wasnt the only one to notice this favaronas had drawn his cape close around his shoulders feels like a graveyard he muttered his eyes darting left and right unconsciously the elves slowed their pace theyd come through the fiery crucible of the high plateau losing many of their number to nomads the sand beast and heat stroke and they had reached their goal at last yet no one felt any joy no one smiled like favaronas all were looking around uncertainly not drinking in the sight of their fabled destination but regarding it with suspicion talk ceased every face reflected the same thought what sort of place have we come to general tracks kerian shook off the tomblike mood and urged her mount into a trot the vanguard riders had found an area of prints horses had crossed the elves intended path from left and right kerian dismounted and joined one of the scouts kneeling to study the prints small hooves unshod she observed nomad ponies agreed the wilder scout many how long ago he put his sundarkened face scant inches from the prints then lifted a handful of trampled dirt crushed it and let it fall from his fingers half a day or less but more than an hour he reckoned so much for having beaten the nomads to the pass she thought unhappily kerian rose favaronas arrived leading his horse he asked what they had found nomads she said probably the same ones weve fought twice before why we arent in their desert anymore the archivist said exasperated to keep us out of the valley dusk had come and gone stars were appearing overhead kerian realized that even she with her keen eyesight found it difficult to penetrate the shadows ahead a sudden shiver chased itself down her spine and she muttered i almost wish they would the howl of a wolf pierced the air immediately it was answered by others both ahead and behind the elves kerians gloomy mood shattered stand to horse she cried drawing her sword favaronas did as she ordered but didnt see the need for such alarm surely even a large pack of wolves wouldnt attack a column of armed elves the lioness glowered at him those arent wolves librarian the enemy is upon us her officers came cantering up the balance of the company following deploy your riders now she ordered favaronass uncertainty evaporated abruptly as a hail of arrows fell out of the darkened sky the wolf cry was a nomad signal with a hundred riders the lioness moved down the slight slope to the east seeking the hidden archers the ground was broken by deep gullies cut during winter rains nomads skulked in these crevices raising their heads long enough to loose an arrow then ducking under cover again the mounted elves were forced to bend low to saber the enemy but in a few minutes they put the archers to rout whooping with victory they wouldve chased the fleeing humans but the lioness called them back returned to the main body of warriors she sat motionless in the saddle her head up straining to hear the slightest sound she divided her attention between north and south from one direction or the other the main attack would come she was beginning to understand nomad thinking feint into ambush was practically their only tactic wolf calls and a burst of arrows were intended to strike fear to fix the enemys attention in one direction while the main assault came from elsewhere the pass here was too wide for a strike from the west it would come from the north directly ahead or the south keep alert she called watch the shadows from the north came the rumble of approaching horses the lioness spread out her small band in skirmishing order each rider seven or eight feet from his neighbor by the sound of the enemys approach she estimated she faced a force slightly greater in size than her own others in the line had made the same mental calculation an anxious voice asked should we sit still and receive their charge unless you want to die tonight the lioness replied she was certain this was yet another feint the main attack still had not shown itself a dark mass of riders appeared out of the north the nomads were strung out in a long thin line stretching beyond the limits of the elves small formation fortunately the rough ground prevented the khurs from charging at full speed they had to pick their way around broken ground and small trees then climb through steep gullies in small groups under the lionesss steady hand the elves waited when the first nomads reached level ground she ordered half her command to charge a brisk melee began with the elves battling the khurs as they arrived piecemeal this effectively destroyed the nomads numerical advantage the battle continued khurs and elves wheeling and turning on the ground as the stars overhead performed their own slow stately march between the high peaks a rider made his way to the lioness he reported large numbers of nomads coming up from the south she felt a kind of relief at least the waiting was over how many she asked difficult to say general three hundred maybe more she sent him back to his comrades three hundred nomads against fewer than one hundred of her soldiers awaiting their charge even with the advantage of darkness those were daunting odds the elves around her watched her in silence the veterans with her since the days of rebellion in qualinesti sat as motionless as she younger warriors shifted nervously since she was the lionessadmired just short of worship yet first among equalsone spoke up asking what her orders were she turned a thoughtful look on him who carries our fire she asked certain elves in the warband were detailed to carry live coals in clay pots from these each nights campfires were lit the young elf couldnt fathom why the lioness would ask about this now but he replied after only a brief confused pause sergeant vitianthus has our fire general she knew vitianthus a silvanesti volunteer he was a former horse trainer and an elegant rider tell the sergeant i want firelots of it twisting in the saddle she pointed to a copse of cedars forty yards distant on their right flank have him set fire to those trees the young elf saluted and galloped away everyone is to remain where they are kerian commanded at her order swords were drawn and rested on shoulders sergeant vitianthus and a contingent broke off from the band and galloped to the cedar copse for a long interval nothing could be seen then sharp elven eyesight noted smoke rising nearly invisible in the night air the sweet cedar smoke drifted back over the motionless warriors an orange flame leaped up then another to the main body of nomads advancing steadily from the south the sight of fire was a shock the leading elements of adalas tribe faltered uncertain what was happening adala mounted on her donkey saw the flickering flames and shrugged so much the better a fire will make it easier to see the laddad and kill them gwarali who had begged for the honor of leading the attack agreed with her the burning trees clearly showed him elves on horseback waving fiery brands it seemed a futile gesture the trees were too few to make a blaze large enough to ward off the nomad warband all the desperate elves were doing was illuminating their own destruction he drew his sword and uttered the new war cryadala maita hundreds echoed him as he led the men forward wisely they did not gallop toward the foe but rode at a fast trot they saw the elves whod started the fire retreating from the burning copse and naturally went for the enemy they could see as the nomads skirted the blaze the crackle of burning wood and snap of boiling sap masked other sounds the weyalu never heard the hail of arrows that emptied a score of their saddles where are they coming from gwarali shouted the firestarters were still in view galloping away to the north no one could answer him another wave of arrows fell these werent random volleys lofted in the general direction of the khurs every missile found a target the arrows were well aimed even nomads farther from the fire and not illuminated by its light were being hit the answer hit gwarali like a bolt of lightning laddad could see in the dark he shouted a warning it was echoed back through the ranks and the weyalu faltered gwarali roared they can die in the dark too up swords more arrows came scything across the starlit landscape each wave bringing down men and horses gwarali pulled his horse up short causing the pony to rear on its hind legs he bellowed will you leave your murdered families unavenged did your fathers and brothers die in battle for nothing are you men backs straightened blood surged anew the weyalu lifted swords high and prepared to charge believe in your maita sons of the sand follow me for your gods for a perfectly aimed arrow cut off gwaralis rallying cry the point took him in the left eye burying itself deep the nomad chief was dead even as he toppled backward off his horse the lioness watched with satisfaction as the weyalu attack melted away the fire had worked even better than shed hoped by lighting it on their right flank the elves drew the nomads to that point the flames werent enough to light the battlefield for the humansin fact their proximity to it served to ruin what little night sight they hadbut the elves with their keener vision could clearly see the nomad riders there was no time to celebrate the fire was dying out stung by the elves arrows the nomads would probably return with everything they had it was time to go she and the archers rejoined the northern half of her army they had empty saddles of their own this was not a horsemans battle blundering through gullies with archers about according to gilthass map the pass narrowed about a mile in kerian decided they would advance and make a stand there the noise of the enemy approaching from behind them grew louder in close order the elves rode straight down the center of the pass favaronas kept close to the lioness with luck and her tactical skill he hoped they might yet escape the nomads pursuit adala took the loss of gwarali in stride bilath brother of adalas dead husband was leading the flanking riders now gwaralis nephew bindas took his uncles place at the head of the southern warband bolstered by the weyadans calm conviction weyalu warriors once more pushed forward eager to close with the laddad on a rocky pinnacle three miles away the sand beast raised its head and tasted the wind its prey was close by and in great numbers the itch in its iron claws soon would be salved by elf blood it gathered itself to spring there were humans in its path but they posed no obstacle one blinding rush and all the elves would die then the burning in its heart would be extingui hed one rush and it would all be over anew odor propelled by the east wind teased its nostrils the sand beast froze the scent was familiar an ancient memory one that caused the scales on its back to ripple in fear a strange warbling cry pierced the night high overhead a black object occluded the stars kerian heard it over the thud and jingle of her troops in motion hardly believing her ears she looked skyward eagle eye favaronas slightly ahead of her tried to look back while maintaining his seat what my griffon thats his cry i know it as well as my own voice she had no idea how eagle eye could be here when shed left him in khurinost but the griffons call was unmistakable standing in her stirrups she whistled shrilly to her delight eagle eye answered sounding closer now when the warbling screech came a second time the sand beast bolted strong as it was the urge to hunt elves could not overcome the primal fear inspired by the sound of a natural enemy descending the hill in one great bound the sand beast lowered its head struck the opposite hillside and immediately began burrowing it tore through slabs of slate as easily as a child digs in sand before the shadow of the griffon crossed the hill where the sand beast had been it was completely buried lying still as the rock around it the lioness stopped and her warriors followed suit they could now see the griffons black shape moving in the sky kerian cupped her hands around her mouth and whistled again the griffon descended rapidly flaring his wings and hovering over the elves none of them could enjoy the sight all were too busy trying to control their plunging horses kerian solved this dilemma for herself by vaulting from the saddle rising to her feet she held up a hand to the griffon and called his name eagle eye utterly ignoring the chaos around him landed next to her and lowered his hooked beak tucking it under her arm like a pet songbird you old monster she said fondly im glad to see you too your timing is excellent a shout interrupted the reunion favaronas engaged in a losing battle with his terrified horse yelled the nomads are getting close two hundred yards away the main body of nomads was in plain view their advance from the south had been halted temporarily as they too had to cope with frightened mounts from the east a second force of nomads was likewise delayed kerian estimated some four hundred khurs remained form up form up she called even as she leapt onto the griffons back she was airborne in the next heartbeat eagle eyes muscular hindquarters sending them into the air with a breathsnatching rush kerian turned his head toward the larger and closer southern nomad band shouting at her elves into the valleyat a gallop theres no time to waste her warriors sorted themselves into riding formation reins snapped and spurs dug in they surged northward on their right the second party of khurs was angling to cut them off with the lioness forced to concentrate first on the southern nomads the eastern band was beginning to regain control of their horses eagle eye flew so low over the nomad horsemen that kerian could have kicked their hats with her boot instead she crouched low over her mounts neck it wouldnt do to pick up an arrow from a sharpeyed nomad archer the griffons screeching cries sent the horses into a frenzy their riders seemed scarcely more composed tribesmen in eagle eyes path flung themselves off their mounts eagle eye banked flapped hard for altitude and soared back over the hectic scene kerian aimed to rejoin her fleeing command her birdseye perspective showed a dire situation the flanking nomads riding hard from the east had succeeded in getting in front of her elves she growled in frustration the trap she feared had caught them nomads were ahead and however disordered also behind them their only hope of survival was the inathwakenti where they would have room to maneuverand hide she reached her diminished band and hovered high above them draw swords all she cried three hundredodd blades rose in unison forward dont falter if the humans get in your way cut them down but dont stop to fight go boot to boot the wedge of elves hit the nomads headon the elves highly trained veterans on taller heavier horses pushed through the loose nomad formation trading sword cuts as they went bilath tried to hold his men as adala had instructed but the elves would not be denied bilath himself received a slash on the temple a second cut might have finished him but the elf warrior tore by without pause on the southern front the weyalu led by bindas were coming up fast their desert ponies were a hardy lot and the animals fear had faded as they grew accustomed to the griffons strange scent adalas stolid donkey had never given in to the terror on beholding the griffon adala proclaimed the strange flying beast a sign monsters from the abyss had been raised against them she told her rapt followers the wicked laddad thought to cow them but torghan the avenger would strengthen weyalu swordarms and steel their hearts the weyalu shouted adala maita then they thundered forward at a gallop riding near the weyadan wapah stared uncertainly at the griffon he recognized it as a creature associated with the silvanesti and didnt quite understand how it could be both a sign from those on high and a monster raised by the laddad for use against the people of the desert shrugging he decided this was just another example of what happened when a man strayed from the hard edges of the desert here mountains pierced the sky letting in confusion the griffon swooped in hovering in front of the nomad band adala tugged little thorns reins halting the donkey her warriors stopped as well begone monster adala shouted to the griffon return to the wicked land of your ancestors thats just what i plan to do said a voice from the creatures back and a javelin came flying at adala the mother of the weyalu held her place the javelin struck the ground a few feet in front of little thorns hooves burying its iron head six inches into the hard soil the shaft vibrated with the force of the throw the griffon wheeled and flew off into the night etosh came riding back from the head of the nomad band weyadan the laddad are entering the valley we have failed the anger adala had felt on hearing the laddad voice subsided her face resumed its patient cast all is well brother they have gone into the sacred valley but there they will perish the tribe she said would camp here blocking the only pass out of the valley when the laddad tried to escape they would be destroyed she urged little thorn forward grasped the javelin and worked it free of the soil wapah came up beside her as she was studying the weapon we should not stay here weyadan he said this land is not good the hard edges are dulled unnatural things abide we must stay our land and our honor demand it she looked up at him taller than she on his pony and added i have seen a new vision of our path cousin its not enough to expel the foreigners from the valley when the laddad here have been dealt with we will raise the tribes all the tribes of khur and lead them to khurikhan we will deal with the laddad there too she handed him the javelin and turned her animal away he touched the tip of the slender spear lightly it was keen enough to make his thumb bleed had it hit the weyadan it easily would have pierced her back to front wrapping the sharp head in a length of protective cloth wapah lashed the javelin across the rear of his saddle nomads were never wasteful six miles away the lioness brought eagle eye to ground far enough in front of her warriors that their horses wouldnt go wild they reined up elves and horses alike were panting for breath her officers and favaronas joined her on foot next to the griffon they didnt follow us she said i think theyre afraid of the valley or eagle eye im not sure which favaronas said lucky your creature found us i thought the time for such wonders was past kerian too had been marveling at the griffons cleverness with the rush of battle behind her she realized how odd it was that eagle eye had arrived fully saddled with weapons of battle like the javelin quiver in place she certainly hadnt left him stabled that way the answer to the conundrum was tucked inside the javelin quiver it was a folded parchment whose message convinced her that wonders were no match for the everyday power of love thought you could use a friend the note said it was signed simply g chapter saida surrounded by chanting priestesshealers stood by the bed of prince shobbat she dipped a finger in the oil warming in a shallow copper pan and traced on his forehead the seal of elirsana the high priestess was redeyed and haggard from her efforts this was the culmination of three days of work weaving a great healing spell around the delirious prince lesser potions and cantrips had not restored shobbats shattered wits nor healed his blindness though his wild ravings had been soothed and he had stopped flailing uncontrollably he was left lying rigid in his bed eyes closed saida had no choice but to perform the strongest most arduous spell of healing known to her acolytes and priestesses worked in shifts new ones arriving at the palace every six hours to relieve their predecessors the chant went on without a break for three days aromatics and incense were burned and elaborate designs in yellow paint were drawn on the walls and floor of the princes bedchamber the design created a great invisible funnel through which the goddesss healing power could flow shobbat lay in the center of the vortex a thick strip of leather between his clenched teeth to prevent them cracking under the strain the chanting priestesses came and went by a prescribed schedule but saida didnt budge she alone was irreplaceable for three days and nights she did not sleep she had performed the great healing spell only once before but none of the priestesses knew the circumstances saida would never discuss it the chanting abruptly stopped shadows of sickness leave this man she commanded solemnly suffering one be whole for the space of three heartbeats no one moved time itself seemed to halt in the room then shobbat sighed deeply the sound echoing in the stillness his rigid body went limp his eyes opened he blinked several times looking around as though his surroundings were unfamiliar am i dead he rasped not yet saida moved away to send word to sahimkhan that his son was healed on the bed shobbat lifted a hand to his face was he truly here was he at home in khurikhan the fire was gone from his mind but the memory of what hed seen in the oracles cave remained monstersanimals with the heads of humans and humans with the heads of animalshad come out of the shadows and engulfed him theyd called his name said he was one of them and suddenly hed known it was true his hands and feet changed to slender paws fur sprouted from his skin and in his mouth he tasted carrion jackal the misshapen monsters had shouted at him you are one of us sahimkhan entered clad in plain white geb his dark head bare of crown he looked like any worried father attending the bedside of his sick child my son he said quietly do you know me you are my lord sahim khan of all the khurs shobbat murmured a vast weariness dragging down his eyelids sahim turned to saida standing between two priestesses it was obvious that she too was sorely spent you have a fathers gratitude holy lady he said whatever price you name i shall pay gladly shobbats soft snores interrupted them and sahimkhan held out a hand to the high priestess she took his arm and accompanied him out the door that led to the princes private sitting room in silent ranks the priestesses of elirsana departed by a different exit the sitting room was lush the scene of many a princely revel sahim escorted the high priestess to a large chair and insisted she sit faint with weariness saida complied the austere white silk of her ceremonial gown stood out starkly against the chairs crimson magenta and gold wool brocade mighty khan she began then had to clear her throat to begin anew she was desperately thirsty but other things must come first mighty one i believe it was no mortal illness that afflicted your son sahims brows lowered in a fearsome glare poison a curse no sire the sickness was selfinflicted sahims mouth opened but saida continued without pause some deed of prince shobbats provoked this bout of madness his surprise abated and he looked dubious shobbat is no ascetic that is certain but i doubt he would commit a deed foul enough to drive himself mad not a foul deed an impious one the chair was deep and plush saida forced herself to sit stiffly upright the slightest relaxation of her vigilance and she would lose her battle against the fatigue that encased her limbs like dense sand the khan had little use for gods khurish or foreign and he still looked unconvinced she knew she must choose her words with great care prince shobbat has looked upon things a mortal should not know she said slowly what those may have beenshe shrugged her shouldersi cannot say mighty khan sahim waved these obscure matters aside vowing to take up the matter with shobbat when he was stronger if his heir was dabbling in magic sahim soon would cure him of such foolish curiosity he returned to the issue of payment begging the holy priestess to name her reward his coffers were full of steel and gold courtesy of his laddad tenants alone with his cronies sahim liked to boast that he was the bestpaid landlord in the world we do not crave wealth in our temple great khan but there is a boon you can grant us he grinned opening his arms wide tell me beloved of the goddess put an end to the violence against the elves he blinked taken aback how does the fate of the laddad concern you she told him then of the speakers interest in the valley of the blue sands and of the lionesss mission to find out whether the fabled valley was habitable when she finished her voice was almost completely gone she waited expectantly the khan astonished her by bursting into laughter the place where animals speak and stones grow like palm trees from the ground he sputtered quoting the fables excellent let them go there its a fitting place for them his loud merriment caused saida to wince with pain a prodigious headache was building behind her eyes closing them she murmured grant me this favor mighty khan guard the laddad while they tarry here dark forces gather around you seeking to destroy them have no commerce with these this time his laugh was sardonic the knights you mean or the bullmen of the seas yes all these dark forces have sought me out each wishes to destroy the laddad for their own safety i take their gifts if it pleases me his black eyes grew hard and no longer was he the grateful father robed and crowned or not it was the khan of all the khurs who stood looking down at the priestess now but i rule in khur not these others gilthass people can rely on my protection so long as it pleases me to guard them please concern yourself with your goddess holy lady and leave politics to me saida got to her feet stiffly bowed and departed the khan watched her go then took the chair shed just vacated saida was a great asset to khur and he was not a man to squander assets but her request troubled him beyond a certain grudging admiration for the speakers tenacity and an appreciation of elven style sahim cared little about the elves ultimate fate he was no friend of neraka nor the minotaurs he knew well that once the elves were removed his neighbors appetites would quickly switch to khur for all its empty desert sahims land bordered many vital areas a navy with access to its coast could dominate the bay of balifor hundreds of miles of desert made a formidable barrier against minotaurs trying to enter neraka from the north or against knights thrusting south to the fertile lands of minotaurheld silvanesti the speaker of the sun and stars was a temporary asset a fine catspaw distracting the troublesome knights and holding the bullmen in check this valley of the blue sands business worried him not at all yes it would be easier to keep an eye on the elves if they were under the walls of khurikhan but if they chose to maroon themselves in a remote mountain valley surrounded by the worst desert in the realm then that would be perfectly acceptable if the laddad waxed fat in the new location so much the better fat sheep sheared thick wool as the nomad saying went perhaps in time sahim could make the speaker of the sun and stars a true vassal of khur hadnt he done that for the most part with the nomads elves couldnt be any more proud and arrogant than desert tribesmen then it would be neraka and the minotaurs who must tread lightly all would regard the name of sahimkhan with fear thoughts of his nomadic subjects were like grains of sand in sahims cup of fine wine worthless fanatics all of them theyd been slipping into the city in larger numbers conferring with the wretch minok and going out to harass and murder the laddad in the name of their brutal god or perhaps in the name of the dark order a servant appeared in the doorway to prince shobbats bedchamber he bore a tray laden with rosewater fine linen and sweet wine go away i didnt summon you sahim said testily no mighty khan please forgive the intrusion i was summoned to wait upon prince shobbat but he isnt in his room i thought perhaps the servant looked hopefully around the sitting room empty but for the khan sahim shoved the lackey aside and entered the bedchamber the hour was late just past midnight and the only candles burning were a trio on a stand by the bedthe empty bed shobbats wrinkled sweatstained robe trailed off it onto the floor the servant spoke truly the prince was neither here nor in the water closet attached to his room the khan perched his fists on his hips hed thought the boy would sleep for a week where in kargaths name had he gone off to now the large mans shoulders nearly scraped the walls of the narrow alley his four companions were hardly less imposing yet despite their bulk all five moved quietly their soft leather boots silent on the timeworn pavement at the intersection of two lanes the leader stopped he probed the corner of the wall in front of him searching for three telltale notches scored in the brick finding them he turned right and moved on the others followed the lintel above the fifth door bore the same parallel notches leaving his four companions on watch in the alley the leader entered without knocking and carefully closed the door behind himself he turned back the hood of his cloak i am here lord hengriff said his bass voice rumbling in the small room the room brightened as the thin red line of a lamp wick was adjusted the light showed prince shobbat sitting at a table his bare dagger gleaming next to the lamp the ruddy lamplight also revealed the results of his encounter with the oracle of the tree the princes face was the gray of wood ash his eyebrows and beard were white and white streaked the hair combed back from his forehead his once soft features were drawn and his eyes burned from deep hollow sockets i heard you were unwell highness hengriff said i have recovered from what the nerakan saw this seemed a debatable conclusion this meeting is not wise but necessary shobbats hand strayed to the dagger caressing the wire wrapped grip but his eyes remained fixed on the knights face the time for talk is over the time has come to act my father must go he expected some reactionat the very least a nod of satisfactionbut hengriff only stood there immobile as stone shobbat demanded will neraka support me once im on the throne the order always supports strong rulers friendly to its cause shobbats fingers closed on the dagger grip and he slammed the weapon on the table making the little lamp jump why all the mystery he shouted cant you just give me a simple yes or no permit me to say highness your timing is not the best you have been out of circulation for some time yes and your father is very popular just now thanks to his humiliation of the elves how much money did he squeeze from gilthas in the name of reparations ten thousand steel a tidy sum thought hengriff sahims little triumph over the speaker would make him admired in the souks and taverns even by those who knew him to be a bloody tyrant he had executed eleven torghanists captured during the rioting even now their heads gathered flies in the plaza before the khuri yl nor yet hengriff knew the dead men were longtime criminals culled from the city dungeons the real culprits had purchased their safety minok high priest of torghan with the khans death sentence still hanging over him had given hengriff gold to buy freedom for himself and his followers after considering the possible repercussions of allowing the torghanists to remain in prison and perhaps talk under torture the knight paid the bribes first though he swapped minoks khurish coins for nerakan he intended the released prisoners to associate their deliverance with the order and to spend that money in the souks there was no better ambassador than money and slay him while he sleeps what do you think shobbat was saying a very good plan hengriff replied realizing with some amusement that while he was lost in thought the prince must have been outlining his plot to murder his father when will you strike soon there may not be time to warn you in advance i understand shobbat stood and tucked the dagger back into his sash this one an unsettling mixture of cherry red and lime green stripes hengriff waited till he was done then casually delivered the news hed brought your highness have you heard the elves have found the valley of the blue sands the effect was all hed hoped shobbat gave a violent start even faltering backward how did this happen he gasped gilthas sent his bitch kerianseray to seek the place they reached the valley three days ago shobbat sat back down with a thump the oracles prediction rang in his ears howthe prince cleared his throat twice how do you know this i have many eyes and ears in khurikhan even in the elves camp he folded massive arms across his chest why is this valley important highness what does gilthas expect to find there shobbat barely heard hengriff his thoughts were racing so the chain of events foretold by the oracle had begun his future his very life was in the balance he strove to master his emotions hed already given away too much to the dark knight who can say the valley is uninhabited he muttered it has some religious significance for the tribes who dwell nearby hengriff studied shobbat in silence the princes wan complexion was growing paler by the second pale as the stain that had spread through his beard and hair the man was a weakling hengriff thought if he werent so close to the throne of khur the knight would have washed his hands of him long ago hed been laughably easy to buy even more than his greedy father shobbat loved money not only for the power it represented but for the luxuries it could buy the order had toyed with the idea of installing him as puppet ruler of khur but his behavior had become increasingly erratic and evasive the elves expedition to the valley of the blue sands certainly disturbed the prince deeply it would probably disturb hengriffs superiors as well but they had an exaggerated opinion of gilthass shrewdness and a positive mania about the lioness the latter hengriff could understand much more than the former kerianseray had been a thorn in knightly flesh for years answering a question from shobbat hengriff explained that the elves had crossed the high plateau to reach the valley avoiding the wellwatched caravan route to kortal they fought several skirmishes with the weyalu tribe the last was a fullfledged battle i gather having failed to stop the elves going into the valley the nomads are camped at its entrance and are trying to recruit other tribes to help destroy the intruders when they come out shobbat tugged thoughtfully at his beard although he might wish the nomads every success in stopping the laddad no wouldbe khan could be happy to hear the desert tribes were massing every time that happened a khan lost his head like the rising of the sun but with much less warning a smile spread across shobbats face with his redrimmed eyes and pallid lips it was not a charming expression and now it was hengriffs turn to be surprised though he was practiced enough not to show it my lord the prince asked are you able to communicate with these distant events or do you only receive subsequent word of them aware of the import of what he was about to say hengriff replied the former your highness good i will compose a missive and you will have it conveyed to the tribesmen you say have gathered to stop the elves hengriff bowed slightly thinking he would do what he pleased the prince snapped a command and out of the shadows a lackey appeared bearing a leather case shobbat pushed aside bottles of wine and perfume a short sword and a purse thick with coins to pull out parchment ink and a penbrush the proclamation he composed was short and to the point written in large flowing script hengriff easily read the words upsidedown again he was surprised this ambitious fool had more talent for intrigue than he had imagined he might have to be more careful with the prince in the future shobbat signed the document with a flourish rolled it tightly and sealed it with black wax he pressed his signet into the wax and handed the scroll to hengriff you may be the savior of my country said the prince earnestly id rather be the destroyer of the elves replied hengriff shobbat showed his eyeteeth it is the same thing your message will be in nomad hands in three days your highness shobbat extinguished the lamp and the two men went their separate ways success my lord asked hengriffs lieutenant waiting outside hengriff glanced at the closed door how did one reckon success in this maelstrom of deceit and treachery he was still alive still working for the order that was one measure of success he grunted an affirmative and added i have another visit to pay when we get there you men can return to our quarters the five knights slipped away moving like a cluster of shadows out of the crowded hameek district hengriff led them to the northern part of the city known as the harbalah wrecked by malys and her minions it was still not rebuilt the sights and smells of the vibrant living sections of khurikhan ended when they crossed istra street into the ruins hengriff halted by a broken dwelling and dismissed his men they hesitated the lieutenant said my lord we obey but our lives are pledged to safeguard yours shouldnt we accompany you not this time go reluctantly they did hengriff remained where he was until the four loyal warriors turned a corner and were out of sight when he was satisfied he was alone he continued ahead no torches or lamps burned here there was only starlight to see by still he made good progress through the rubble and shattered houses he knew the way very well a tall tower stood out starkly against the night sky its upper floors had been toppled by the red dragon but even truncated the tower was still many times higher than any other structure in the vicinity piled around its base were the ruins of a fine villa once the home of the richest date merchant in khur his bones moldered beneath the toppled walls of his mansion clouds drifting in from the sea passed over the stars casting the ruins into deeper darkness it was an eerie journey through the ruined grounds cluttered with broken statuary rubble and blown trash the gardens nowadays home to little more than thin scraggly date palms roofless the interior of the once fine home was open to the air what remained of its gessoed walls was bright with painted scenes of desert life the pictures cracked and peeling the path through the trash was barely wide enough for hengriffs feet the one whod made it was much smaller than he he passed the first signa sixinch square of parchment bearing markings in red and black ink a warning a panic spell had been placed over the ruined house had hengriff not been wearing a countercharm he wouldve been seized by unreasoning fear when he reached the atrium with its dry fountain and garden of weeds he passed the second sign this one was a human skull eye sockets packed with clay a pebble of polished malachite had been pushed into each clayfilled socket making grotesque eyes thats exactly what they were the occupant of the blighted villa could watch the path with these magical eyes interlopers were dealt with harshly the knight came upon one such unlucky soul a khur lay sprawled by the fountain his torso had been ripped open his body left here as an extra warning to the unwary by his clothes hengriff took him to be a beggar come to search for trinkets he could sell he was past such needs now at the foot of the broken tower was the third sign an ordinary copperplate such as was used in taverns all around the city was nailed to the tower door with three iron nails lines were scratched into the copper they formed the sigil of madness anyone passing through the door without proper protection would go immediately insane hengriff snorted perhaps the villas current resident had come home once without his protective amulets that would explain much about him despite the devastation all around the great door swung smoothly inward silent on welloiled hinges the interior smelled strongly of musk hello he tried to call softly but his voice still boomed like a drumbeat something stirred in the darkness something big his hand went to his sword hilt faeterus its hengriff he said feeling somewhat foolish his voice could hardly be mistaken for any others a square of light appeared overhead as a trap door opened hengriff held up a hand to block the sudden glare the light showed him a strange beast curled against the far wall several yards away it had a lions tawny body and limbs but a long neck covered with small bronzecolored scales its head was its most disturbing feature framed by a short stiff mane of reddish hair the head was round like a humans with human looking icy blue eyes a flat nose and a very wide mouth the mouth split in a grin as hengriff tightened his grip on his sword hilt at least four rows of teeth one behind the other glittered like polished steel in the wide mouth the large eyes gazed at him steadily without blinking the knight knew then what had happened to the beggar lying dead outside a knotted rope unspooled from the open trap door its end striking the floor at hengriffs feet the knight began to climb senses alert a good place to ambush someone he thought as his head and shoulders penetrated the room above heat washed over him like a lowering weight oil lamps with silver reflectors lit the scene brightly but the warmth came from two large fireplaces opposite each other in the large round room fires blazed high in each the room was decorated in an extreme of khurish fashion that would have embarrassed a nativeborn khur dark yellow carpets were layered six inches deep helping to mask the warped floor every inch of wall space was covered by tapestries depicting not only khurish scenes of deserts and oases but foreign sights as wellthe barbaric splendor of ergoth the staid pageantry of old solamnia and geometric tarsan designs shot through with spun gold thread there were no chairs or proper tables only silk and velvet pillows divans spread with plush wool and damask rugs and low tables meant to be used by diners seated on the floor contributing to the suffocating atmosphere were jeweled incense burners hanging from the ceiling beams they filled the air with the heavy reek of spice hengriffs host had returned to his dinner after dropping the rope through the trap door an etched silver tray was balanced on the divan cushions beside him hengriff glanced at its contents and quickly looked away a bird of some sort plucked clean but still raw savage welcome noble hengriff said faeterus waving a hand gone was his bulky disguise shorn of the heavy ragged robes and thick gray wig faeterus was revealed to be an elf of advanced years with cottony white hair eyebrows like flyaway wings over hazel eyes and a chin sharp as the prow of a war galley his hands were unusually large for an elf with prominent joints and exceptionally long fingers darkly stained by decades of mixing potions he wore long white cotton trousers and an abbreviated geb thats quite a watchdog you have hengriff said casting about for a decent place to sit a rare creature indeed a manticore from over the seas it ensures my privacy faeterus indicated the knight could join him but hengriff settled himself on a low table nearby after deeming it strong enough to take his weight he would not recline on the cushioned divan with the mage nor sit on the carpeted floor at his feet like a supplicant a new development he announced prince shobbat has regained his wits as usual hes aflame to depose his father but when i mentioned the elves had gone to the valley he seemed ready to relapse hes so frightened hes willing to stir up the desert wanderers to stop the elves he held up shobbats letter he gave me this proclamation in which he incites them to make righteous war on the elves shobbat is an idiot does it say anything more faeterus bit delicately into the raw bird blood ran down his chin until he dabbed it with a napkin he invites the nomads here to khurikhan to destroy the elves in their tentcity faeterus froze then put down his dinner not an idiota madman maybe he says his father has betrayed khur by allowing the elves to remain here and by filling his coffers with elven steel theyll have sahimkhans head too in the bargain im sure thats what shobbat intends faeterus picked up a narrow conical goblet made of gilded glass and gulped wine like a sailor just back from a long voyage his fingers left gory prints on the shiny stem hengriff wondered whether his nails were naturally that umber shade or if he painted them an idiot after all faeterus said refilling his goblet sahim is popular the nomads wont unite against him not now perhaps if they had more provocation hengriff suggested that will take some thought the wanderers arent like ordinary people elf or human what pleases us offends them and what angers them we would consider trivial the mage leaned back against his cushions and added what will you do for me if i do this favor for you i wont wring your scrawny neck hengriff thought this isnt a souk elf im not here to bargain get to the point what do you want faeterus reclined on the cushions closing his eyes a trifle really he murmured hengriff doubted that the mage seemed immune to the standard temptations as far as hengriff could tell he had only two guiding principles hatred for his own race and devotion to the pursuit of his magical arts whatever he wanted it likely would be something extraordinary i want what gilthas wants the valley of the blue sands hengriff frowned at this puzzling reply he knew the nomads of the northern desert regarded the valley as sacred belonging to the gods and forbidden by them at the same time most of the stories hed heard in the souks and various taverns were improbable in the extreme in one the valley was said to house an army of stone soldiers motionless for two thousand years who would awaken on hearing a certain magical word if the wrong word of power was voiced they would animate only long enough to kill the one whod said it then resume their stony existence other tales said the valley contained a city of gold a race of invisible dragons oroddest of allthe tombs of dead foreign gods why all of a sudden did faeterus care about the valley of the blue sands hengriff stood stiffly over the years hed acquired too many injuries more than a few while chasing the lioness to remain hunkered down on the low table for very long ill convey your words to my masters he said evenly fables and legends aside the valley represents an excellent defensive position my order certainly wouldnt want the elves to settle there he glanced at a carafe sitting on the rug near faeterus the mage had a penchant for a delphonian vintage steeped with kuroba flowers which imparted a narcotic effect hengriff wanted none of that he would endure his thirst for a while longer oh one thing more he said casually gilthas has an agent in the city looking for you the mages hazel eyes opened quickly really an elf my spy on the speakers council did not specify could be a hired khur i hope not faeterus rubbed his chin with his fingers forgetting they were smeared with gore the bloody streaks made his gaunt face seem savage indeed i need a fullblooded elf for my latest experiment maybe i should let gilthass ferret find me hengriff had no desire to speculate on what experiments this loathsome creature might be planning duty discharged he wanted only to be gone he opened the trap door and held out his hand he needed new paper amulets so he could pass safely through the villas magical defenses each set of warding amulets worked in a very specific fashiononce as hengriff departed and once more allowing him to reenter faeterus would not have it any other way unfortunately faeterus was not ready to let him go instead of producing new amulets the sorcerer brought up the valley again asking for assurances it would be granted to him hengriff brusquely declined to make guarantees the decision is not mine to make he growled demanding the amulets faeterus suddenly gave a very birdlike warbling whistle in the chamber below the manticore sprang to its feet and came to stand below the opening it looked up and grinned hengriff had faced any number of horrors in his time but the sight of that horrible toohuman face and its rows of steelsharp teeth caused him to shudder he thought of the disemboweled beggar outside he turned a furious look upon the sorcerer faeterus held the paper amulets in one longfingered hand of course you may leave if you really wish to the mage assured him genially but perhaps we should discuss proper payment for my services first planchet set a covered dish before his master gilthas dining alone watched expectantly as the domed cover was whisked away chicken again nestled on a bed of roasted vegetables planchet offered him a choice of wines goodlund red or silvanesti white but gilthas told him to save the wine for kerians return the speaker of the sun and stars drank water and ate in silence usually he dined with the members of his court but for the past few days since the audience with sahimkhan his councilors had found various reasons not to attend everyone felt humiliated the qualinesti especially as gilthas was one of them lord morillon had praised the speakers diplomacy but even he made excuses to avoid dinner so gilthas had only planchet for company as the valet waited on him ten thousand steel pieces had gone out of gilthass personal treasury it wasnt all in steel of course much of it was gold and silver plate rescued from the blazing halls of the palace in qualinost some of the golden service dated back to the reign of speaker silveran they knew how to make fine things in those days the gold was hammered thin as paper yet remained stiff and strong no one today could duplicate the alloy silverans goldsmiths had used golden plates and fine wines were extravagances they could live without sahim was a blackguard gilthas had always known that extortion at his hands was as much a part of the speakers life as the deserts incessant heat yet gilthas would find a way to meet the khans greedy demands so long as it bought more time for his people his proud councilors did not understand that they clung to glittering memories of worldly glory those memories were all they had for comfort as they slept each night in their stifling tents lying on itchy woolen pallets and toiled each day just to stay alive khurikhan had been quiet since gilthass visit armed patrols of khurish soldiers tramped the back streets in strength discouraging malefactors and maintaining an uneasy calm traffic in and out of the city had fallen off although this was likely no more than a temporary condition traveling merchants were cautious folk having heard about the riot in the capital many diverted to delphon to peddle their wares if the situation remained calm if no more unrest developed they would return for now though the flow of khurs in and out of khurikhan had almost completely ceased repairs on the city wall faltered as stone caravans from kortal in the khalkist foothills dwindled sahim was spending great sums to import hard stone from the faraway mountains to bolster his defenses the route between kortal and khurikhan passed through the territory of the weyalu tribe for some reason the weyalu had abandoned their usual trade route without the nomads to man caravans the flow of hard stone to the capital stopped next to gilthass plate lay the dispatches from kerian a dusty desiccated courier had arrived with the reports late last night the kagonesti had placed the leather pouch in the speakers own hands then passed out falling from the saddle into the arms of taranath the dispatches he brought contained wonderful news the entrance to the inathwakenti had been found however gilthass elation was tempered by the other news in the dispatches kerians troop had clashed several times with armed nomads she reported this matteroffactly as if it was to be expected she assured him they had nothing to fear from the nomads the wanderers weapons were poor and their tactics feeble if necessary she could defeat three or four times the number shed faced thus far her words intended to reassure had exactly the opposite effect it was just this situation gilthas had feared more than anything else he understood sahimkhan and that made working with the human possible the nomads of the desert were another matter aloof proud as a dozen silvanesti lords the nomads were motivated by a complex tangle of piety and honor their fierce conviction in their own virtue made dealing with them difficult at best should they decide to make war in earnest upon the elves then life in khur would become much much harder perhaps even impossible the dark heart of the matter gilthas well knew was kerianserays fiery nature could she control herself she must not fight the desert folk defend herself yes but she could not hammer the nomads as she would dark knights or minotaurs the fragile peace between khurs and elves would not withstand wide bloodshed could the lioness carry out her reconnaissance without starting a war his expression must have reflected his inner turmoil planchet standing to one side asked if he was unwell gilthas smiled ruefully no old friend just thinking instead of eating he tried to pay attention to his dinner but hed lost his appetite all he could think was where was kerian what was happening to her now he didnt know whether the griffon had reached her safely but already he was doubting the wisdom of sending the creature he hoped she would use eagle eye wisely hed been secondguessing the mission for days now the nomads were fighting to defend their land he could understand that an armed force of foreigners had entered their territory and they were trying to drive them out perhaps he could have sent diplomats instead of scholars perhaps he shouldve tried to hire nomad guides perhaps he should not have put his hot tempered wife in charge yet he knew he couldnt have done otherwise kerianseray was the general of his armies his strong right arm through the dark days of the terrible journey across the plains of dust and the burning lands when thousands of their people had died kerians strength had sustained him had sustained all of them planchet claimed his attention gilthas saw the valet was standing by the door flap conversing with a servant sire planchet said lord morillon wishes to see you he says it is most urgent send him in a few days earlier gilthas had informed his closest councilors including morillon of kerians mission that she was seeking the inathwakenti and that he hoped the legendary valley might become a new home for their people for once morillon arrived without his usual corps of sycophants he looked grave great speaker i bring news of kerianseray partly sire the city is buzzing with the news of lady kerianserays arrival at the valley already planchet commented in amazement news travels fast there is more morillon said there are rumors that a great massacre has occurred hundreds of khurish women and children of the weyalu tribe were slain in camp many miles north of here some are saying that it was done by lady kerianserays troops gilthas stood so quickly his camp chair went over backward filthy torghanist lies i agree great speaker but the khurs might choose to think otherwise this was undeniable unchecked the massacre story could inflame khur from one end to the other riots in the souks would be nothing compared to the khurs outrage over this impatiently morillon asked sire what shall we do i will go to sahimkhan lay my thoughts before him once he sees we have nothing to hide he will protect us and if he wont planchet asked bluntly he must gilthas hesitated how many warriors are in camp about thirty thousand then have them stand ready planchet no fanfare though alert them quietly the valet hurried away to carry out his lieges order morillons worry had only increased great speaker fighting isnt the answer he said the khan can field twice our numbers more if he calls upon the desert tribes gilthas shook his head no he wont summon the nomads he fears them more than he fears us and i agree fighting is not the answer we must learn the truth about this massacre if it actually occurred and prove to the khan and his people that we are not responsible but what ifwhat we cant prove such a thing pressing a fist to his lips gilthas thought hard he did not believe kerian would kill innocent women and children but who could say what might have occurred in the far desert if a battle had taken place if innocents had been killed if proof of elven innocence was dubious there were too many ifs we must make preparations to leave the speakers pronouncement drained the color from morillons face leave to go where to where lady kerianseray is right now summon the council i want an inventory made of all food and water on hand i want emergency plans drawn up to evacuate khurinost on a moments notice he was talking of uprooting a hundred thousand souls stunned morillon could only nod as the speaker continued to pepper him with orders well need carts have as many made as possible if there arent enough animals to draw them use people if we cant make enough carts use travois the trip to the inathwakenti would be very long very harsh he explained great speaker dont be hasty morillon interjected let us discuss this sahimkhan is no friend of the desert tribes with proper motivation he would defend us if the nomads attacked gilthass smile was bitter perhaps but what if you are wrong what if he refuses to defend foreignersladdad foreignersagainst his own people theres not enough money in the world to buy safety from the khan if too many of his own people rise up to threaten him the smile vanished we must have a contingency plan we can offer to pay more for his protection that much steel will tempt him and buy us time see to it my lord personally arrange an audience at once today morillon rushed to do gilthass bidding like a disturbed anthill khurinost stirred to frantic activity meager supplies were counted weapons long stored taken out if the exiles were forced to flee every ablebodied elf would be required to take up arms to defend their lives and their freedom chapter the vale of silence was aptly named an hour after dawn the lioness and her warriors were riding across a flat funnelshaped valley that was utterly silent with no breath of wind stirring or birds calling the air was warm but far from the blistering heat of the desert outside and laden with moisture the areas other namevalley of the blue sands also was appropriate the soil beneath their horses hooves was bright bluegreen a strange shade between malachite and verdigris it also contributed to the quiet the soft soil seemed to absorb the sound of their movements to spare the horses undue stress kerian had sent eagle eye aloft without her then swung up behind favaronas the archivist wouldve exchanged placesafter all she was commander of the armiesbut she waved away his offer balancing easily even without the benefit of stirrups or saddle she studied their surroundings they rode past scattered stands of cedar and pine and boulders halfburied in the sandy soil the high mountains kept the valley floor in shade long after dawn which probably accounted for the pockets of mist that clung to the low places well librarian what do you think the lioness asked feels dead favaronas replied no birds no insects not even any flowers blooming he was right a profound stillness lay heavily over the area only a few miles in the effect was becoming unnerving it was easy to imagine how the valley came to be shunned curious nomads penetrating this far would become spooked and flee carrying with them tales of the eerie silence over the years those stories wouldve grown with every telling if the atmosphere was unsettling the scenery was increasingly beautiful as the valley opened to them the gray khalkist peaks on the eastern side took on a slateblue shade as the sun climbed over them slanting into the valley and washing the facing western range with golden light islands of grass appeared not the brown or gray flora of the desert but familiar green shoots the first theyd seen since leaving their homelands the presence of grass was more than nostalgic where grass grew livestock could live where livestock could live elves could live with the sun above the eastern mountains the temperature climbed but never beyond a pleasant warmth the lioness and favaronas came to a wide shallow stream that wandered across the valley floor it was shaded by two small willow trees their slender branches motionless in the still air kerian slid off the horses rump and squatted on a flat boulder by the waters edge even as favaronas called a warning she dipped her hand in the stream and lifted it to her lips to lead is to take risks she said smiling wryly then swallowed he didnt have to ask if the water was good his horse dropped its nose into the shimmering flow and drank noisily in minutes the entire command had followed suit the fresh water was like a gift from the gods the water theyd brought was warm and tasted like the skins and gourds in which it was carried the well water of khurikhan was bland and flat this water was icecold with a distinct and pleasant mineral bite eagle eye alighted a dozen yards away haunchdeep in the stream and dipped his feathered head to drink thirst slaked the beast stalked ashore on the east bank and lay down to sleep among cattails and tall grass before long his head was under his wing and he was snoring like a boiling kettle much refreshed the lioness allowed her warriors to linger by the stream watering their horses and washing their gritty faces and feet favaronas sat on a gray rock overhanging the stream and sketched on a slip of parchment with a charcoal stick the lioness watched a map of the valley take shape beneath his skillful hands drawing the long serpentine curve of the creek he asked what shall we call this stream youre drawing the map call it whatever you like after a pause he said lioness creek writing as he spoke speakers creek would be more appropriate you said i could call it whatever i like she shrugged and pulled off her boots the chilly water was a blessing to hot tired feet less than a quarter of an hour later their rest was abruptly interrupted the air shuddered from some distant concussion no sound of explosion followed there was only a shock wave that made the air and ground vibrate once very hard the horses shied violently favaronas dropped his charcoal marker kerian jumped to her feet the sand beast favaronas quavered kerian was dragging on her boots curse it pleasant scenery clean water and we start acting like farmers at a fair they were in unknown territory and she hadnt even posted pickets the elves quickly resumed their normal vigilance kerian ordered twenty riders to reconnoiter ahead another band of twenty she sent back toward the valley mouth in case the nomads or anyone else overcame their fear and decided to follow them bowarmed flankers rode out from the main column to watch for danger with her warriors fully deployed the lioness felt more at ease favaronas however clutched his map in both hands and stared wildly expecting any number of unnatural beasts to fall upon them calm yourself she told the scholar i dont think its the sand beast this time look at eagle eye the griffon was looking around but didnt seem particularly excited she swung into the saddle of a fresh horse its probably nothing more than echoes from an avalanche in the mountains he blinked at her in surprise then nodded slowly they were all so primed to find something otherworldly in the valley hed never considered a simpler explanation still he was glad when she sent eagle eye skyward it wouldnt hurt to have the griffons sharp eyes watching over them they forded the newly named lioness creek scouts met them reporting theyd found a clearly defined path beyond a field of halfburied boulders leaving the archivist with the main body of the army kerian trotted forward to see beyond the boulders three elves sat on horseback in the center of a wide lane thick with alluvial sand a fourth was on his knees digging with his hands as the lioness arrived he announced pavement she swung a leg over her horses neck and dropped to the ground sure enough beneath four or five inches of bluegreen soil hed found stone payers the two blocks was clearly visible clearing a larger area revealed more payers and something even more interestinga deep groove worn into the road they had seen such ruts before the grooves were made by wheels passing over pavement in the same line year after year this groove followed the slight downslope back toward the creek theyd just forded someone has called this valley home the lioness said question was was anyone still here she remounted and sent the scouts ahead her admonition to stay sharp wasnt really necessary the very brief respite theyd enjoyed at the stream was over all were alert when favaronas moved up with the main body he made note of the pavement on his sketch map the paved path led northeast into the heart of the inathwakenti the elves followed it slowly cautiously encountering nothing untoward until after midday when a scout galloped back with news they were approaching stone ruins very old and very big stone ruins ruins dotted the continent from balifor to sancrist isle when kerian was on the run from the dark knights who occupied her country she often sheltered in ruins in the western kharolis mountains relics of a time before the great cataclysm growing up in the wild shed had little knowledge of ancient history most of what she knew had been learned from tales traded around the campfire of the beautiful doomed irda race the twins sithas and kithkanan the decadent human empire in ergoth tales stranger still were told of the realm of istar where magic reigned until a fiery mountain fell from the sky and destroyed the city where glorious doomed istar once stood was now the whirling maelstrom of the blood sea not so far away from this place the lioness sent out more flankers to sweep either side of the road she kept to the path leading the main column forward all the reports she received were negative no quarry had been found either of the twolegged or the fourlegged variety not so much as a rabbit or a bird crossed their paths the widely spaced cedars and pines seemed bare of all life irritated by the lack of progress the lioness decided to try a loftier view she dismounted and walked a few yards ahead whistling for eagle eye the griffon came skimming in over the low trees to land in front of her she slipped a strung bow over her head and swung onto the tiny saddle pad continue down the road she told her officers then elf and griffon bolted skyward after years of khurish heat the rush of temperate air past her face was like a balm the climate surely was better here than in khurinost perhaps gilthas was on to something consternation flooded through her what was she thinking trade her birthright for a little comfort never yes this valley was more pleasant than the sweltering sandpit outside khurikhan but so what it wasnt her homeland wasnt and never would be she turned her attention to the terrain unrolling beneath herclumps of trees bramble thickets broad stands of tall fleshy aloe no wonder the flankers hadnt seen anything shed forgotten how much real foliage limited sight the loftier elements of the ruins rose into view at this distance they looked to be spires of white or gray stone jutting above the trees not columns in the usual sense they werent fluted or faceted only simple tapering spires as she drew nearer remnants of walls appeared their dimensions amazing each stone block was at least ten feet long and tall as a mounted warrior in some places the wall reared thirty feet high massive block fitted neatly atop massive block the cyclopean stones showed clear evidence of having been smoothed and shaped by intelligent hands eagle eye spiraled slowly down he alighted alongside an impressively tall stretch of wall elf and griffon contemplated the ruins as the rest of the column arrived conversation died everyone stared in awe at the mysterious monuments wondering who built them and how long ago the lack of decoration gave the stones an air of great indefinable age favaronas noticed something else the stones were completely free of lichen all the boulders and rocky outcroppings theyd seen in the valley borne healthy coatings of lichen or moss the ruins showed none the stones stood stark and clean against the blue sky and bluegreen soil have you ever seen stonework like this before kerian asked favaronas shook his head but judging by the size perhaps it was the work of ogres she found that difficult to believe ogres built their dwellings in a rough fashion they didnt waste effort carving or finishing the stones none of the elves could think of any race ogre or otherwise which could move blocks as enormous as these two soldiers measured one of the largest stone blocks at the foot of the wall it was twentynine feet long and eleven feet high ahead and on the right shouts and whistles arose qualinesti cattle calls many of kerians best scouts were former cow herders she took flight leaving favaronas and the rest gawking at the ruins the griffon headed straight for a pair of huge standing stones still capped by a massive lintel with kerian leaning low over his neck the creature sailed through wingtips brushing the pillars on either side he warbled low in his throat sounding so smug she couldnt help but chuckle the road theyd followed to the ruins continued ahead bound on both sides by a wall scouts wove in and out of the trees to kerians right they were harrying something on foot all she could see was a patch of pale brown darting through the brush the fleeing figure passed briefly into the clear it was an antelope the mountain breed with unbranched horns curving back over its head she swooped down shouting for it to halt and it turned to look up she glimpsed large brown m eyes before the antelopes legs got tangled in the creeper and it went sprawling in the thick undergrowth the qualinesti giving chase converged on the spot by the time the lioness landed and ran to where the beast had crashed there was nothing but a rats nest of torn vines two of the scouts dismounted were probing the foliage the creature was gone she helped them look but it was obvious an animal that size couldnt be hiding here backtracking out of the bed of vines they found its tiny hoofprints those at least were real other scouts rode up and explained how they originally had flushed the antelope theyd been riding past a thin line of aloes and stunted pines when the creature suddenly bolted from behind them hungry for fresh meat the elves had given chase it came out after you passed kerian said upon our oath said one of the kagonesti scouts knowing it seemed illogical no wild creature having secreted itself and avoided detection would then squander its coup by dashing out before the hunters were gone just as difficult to believe was that savvy scouts would miss a fullgrown antelope in the first place the kagonesti scout put a hand to his heart and vowed it wasnt there general i rode right through the spot there was no antelope there i swear it we were in the high desert a long time she muttered shaking her head maybe the sun baked our brains they didnt laugh the silent heaviness of the valleys atmosphere was affecting even the veteran kagonesti all were looking around warily as though uncertain what else might suddenly spring up from beneath their feet kerian who had knelt down to study the hoofprints stood quickly and admonished them for their foolishness we have enough problems to face without making up new ones next thing youll be telling me the creature was a spirit they looked struck by what she had meant as a jest kerian couldve bitten her tongue the rest of the column was moving up so she left the scouts and went to send eagle eye aloft voices were hushed as though the elves were passing through a holy place when favaronas arrived on foot kerian was seated on a low section of wall she gestured for him to join her he touched the stone gingerly as if expecting to find it hot satisfied he sat down she told him of the quarry that had eluded them it appeared to be an antelope but whatever it was it disappeared right in front of us he didnt seem surprised to hear this the old chronicles speak of strange forces at work here the manuscripts ive read dont mention clear dangers of course he added wryly clarity is not their strong suit the two of them speculated on the odd lack of wildlife but for the phantom antelope they had seen no animals at all not even insects a day had passed since theyd drunk from lioness creek and no one had reported any ill effects so the water supply seemed fine was there something else in the vale of silence inimical to life kerian knew gilthas would be sorely unhappy should his scheme to transplant the elves fail she was sorry for the disappointment he would feel but at the same time she was freshly annoyed at him he seemed convinced that the time had not yet come for them to liberate their ancestral lands but if the valley proved unsuitable for their people then what were they to continue in khurinost forever penned in their squalid tents relying on the favor of the human khan i wonder who could have built these great monuments favaronass voice cut across her growing anger the archivist had left his perch on the wall and was studying the wall further down the line an excellent question master archivist she said folding her arms across her chest how long would you need to find out he looked across the vast meadow of stone ruins and shook his head vaguely i couldnt begin to say it would depend on what we discover i see no obvious hints of the builders identity but someone raised these standing stones someone powerful long dead and long gone i presume the former yes he muttered the latter perhaps not what do you mean you touched on it yourself speaking of the vanishing antelope she gave him a blank look and he added ghosts spirits of the dead may still walk the ruins obviously her wilder brothers werent the only ones whose thoughts moved in that direction they were all letting this weird valley and its massive stone sentinels play tricks on their minds with a dismissive snort she jumped down from the wall and gave the archivist a friendly slap on the shoulder try to figure out who built this favaronas and dont worry we can leave any time we need to she knew this last was probably a lie an unknown number of armed nomads was likely poised outside the valley just waiting for the elves to return getting out of the inathwakenti might prove even more difficult than getting in bad been scouts returned they reported the ruins went on for milesthere seemed no end to themand still theyd found no signs of any living creatures it was late afternoon and theyd kept going without stopping the night before so the lioness decided to make camp here among the ruins the warriors were glad enough of the rest but favaronas was distinctly nervous about the choice of campsite still in this strange valley one spot was likely as good or worrisome as the next another courier this one a qualinesti was dispatched to khurinost the lioness knew he would need the cover of the coming night to slip past any nomads camped outside the valley so there was no time to compose carefully detailed reports the messenger carried a hastily written letter in which she thanked gilthas for sending eagle eye promised to put the griffon to good use against their enemies and outlined the bare essentials of the valleys nature they made camp in the lee of a sarsen that reared forty feet high while the warriors tended their horses spread bedrolls and gathered kindling for fires favaronas busied himself at the base of the towering monolith he built a leanto out of pine branches then laid a small campfire fed with dry juniper twigs the flames sent a sweet aroma into the cloudless sky equipped with fire and shelter the archivist unpacked his case of manuscripts and began reading he updated his sketch map and on spare scraps of parchment made notes for the speaker about what theyd seen in the valley kerian was pitching her own tenta few yards from the archivists fire since shed assigned herself the task of watching over himwhen foragers returned they brought only unwelcome news there was no game to be had you found nothing to eat nothing at all she asked a few bitter roots and pine seeds general said one another added i havent seen so much as a gnat or fly in this valley khur is the kingdom of flies and every other noxious insect why are there none here something drove them out favaronas murmured kerian turned he was seated by his small fire engrossed in his papers she asked him to explain his comment he looked up blinking slightly as his eyes focused on her rather than the manuscript so close to his face she asked again i cant name what has no name the archivist replied unhelpfully then returned to his studies he muttered to himself too low for kerian to catch the words she gave up trying to make sense of his musings and went to walk among her warriors the place shed chosen for their camp was at the intersection of two broad avenues one aligned northeastsouthwest the other crossing at right angles and aligned northwest southeast rainwashed dirt had filled in the slightly sunken roadbeds over the years but a little digging revealed they were covered by the same large paving stones as the road that had led the elves here from lioness creek the high walls of the khalkist meant sunset came early to the valley hours before the light would fade from the desert outside dusk blanketed their camp a chill seemed to spring out of the ground and the elves could see their breath patches of mist coalesced in lowlying areas kerian ordered a large bonfire built in the center of their camp which was also the center of the crossroads foragers had found plenty of deadfall pine cedar and fir limbs though no good hardwood and by the time the first stars winked into sight the blazing flames were sending sparks up to join them the firelight only made the ruins around them seem more eerie more strange a rotation of mounted sentries was posted a goodly distance from camp each elf was given a horn to blow and assigned a distinctive call if anything untoward happened the lioness would know exactly which sentry raised the alarm she checked on the archivist whatever anxiety favaronas felt about being in the valley it hadnt prevented him from sleeping he apparently had decided against sleeping in his leanto however and was snoring away in the lionesss tent she and her officers rebuilt the archivists little campfire at the base of the great sarsen and settled down to have their supper general now weve found the inathwakenti how long will we stay asked a qualinesti she shrugged swallowing a mouthful of beans i see no reason to stay well start back tomorrow astonishment showed on every face according to the information shed given them which shed gotten from gilthass map the valley was at least a dozen miles long shouldnt they explore further there might be dangers they hadnt discovered or other ruins or what of the nomads on the honor of my sword ill wager theyre waiting for us this came from glanthon one of the few remaining officers left from the royal qualinesti army and younger brother to planchet the speakers valet glanthon was as talkative as planchet was taciturn and kerian had no doubt he would expound upon his theme so she forestalled him well slip out quietly avoiding the nomads as much as possible a fighter by nature the lioness wouldve preferred to punch her way out thrashing the fanatical tribesmen on the way but her elves were too few if a single battle went wrong the entire command could be lost and she was determined to carry the truth of the valley back to gilthas in person the inathwakenti was not a new homeland for their exiled people a mild clime and scenic yes but something here was hostile to all animal life she put no stock in the archivists remark about ghosts yet there was no denying the total absence of living creatures well ride east to the mountains and look for another way out she announced theres got to be somethinggoat track deer trail something she smiled wryly over her beans all the animals had to go somewhere theres no other way out favaronas stood at the edge of the firelight by the door flap of kerians tent the lioness and her officers stared at him i studied the speakers map down to the smallest detail he said coming closer the ancient cartographer was very precise and he shows no other way out kerian asked then where did all the animals go did they die out favaronas admitted he didnt know the answer to that question he sat between her and glanthon accepting a plate of beans and a loaf of flat khurish bread since he seemed to have nothing more to contribute the warriors fell to talking about their clash with the nomads dissecting the tactics and fighting skills of the weyalu all agreed that if the nomads had better weapons they might not be sitting here now a horn sounded far away the discussion broke off the officers alert and listening the sound was a long wavering note the signal assigned to a silvanesti scout named camthantas his patrol area was northeast further along the same road theyd followed since crossing the creek two more horns blew and the lioness was on her feet nomads said favaronas dropping his plate of beans no she said her attention focused toward the sounds northeast from deeper in the valley the other two signals are from the sentries on either side of camthantas she pointed at two of her commanders indicating they and their troops would accompany her glanthon would remain to defend the camp the warriors scattered to their duties you too favaronas youre with me he jumped to his feet face ashen in the low light what im no warrior and i cant ride that beast of yours you dont have to ill go by horse eagle eye was asleep tethered inside an angle of stone wall hed spent many hours in the air today and had earned a good rest the lioness took favaronass arm and pulled him along im sorry but i may need your knowledge of the valley when be continued to babble frightened protests she whipped around and shouted into his face favaronas i need you and i will protect you in minutes forty elves led by the lioness with her reluctant companion riding pillion were cantering up the road toward camthantass position the vale of silence was lit only by the stars brilliant as a thousand diamonds on a bed of ebony silk off to kerians right another alarm horn sounded then another in succession the signals showed the source of the alarm was moving away from her and her small troop she pressed ahead when she reached camthantass assigned position she knew something was very wrong his horse was dead its stomach slashed open draw swords forty blades rose into the cool darkness first troop deploy left second right no one is to lose sight of his neighbor at the walk advance she felt favaronas trembling violently behind her his hands lightly holding her waist she was not without compassion he was indeed no warrior despite this and the deaths of his assistants hed not slowed them down on their difficult trek now he followed her into battleperhaps not willingly but without whining gruffly she told him to stop worrying about protocol and hold on tight his shaking hands clenched her waist they moved forward slowly her command to keep in sight of each other soon proved impossible to obey the warriors were forced to ride around sections of walls or monoliths something darted between two towering sarsens and favaronas let out a cry hed seen only a silhouette but it was bigbigger than a horse as he stuttered this warning realization flooded through kerian wrenching her horses head around she shouted the sand beast retreat retreat her words were punctuated by a nearby chorus of shouts followed by a veritable fanfare of horns she kicked her horse into a gallop favaronas yelped as he was flung backward but his grip never loosened rally to me by the road rally to me the forty elves converged on their general several confirmed her fears theyd seen the reptilian monster arrows were nocked the horses shied and snorted they could smell the sand beast and then it was upon them zigzagging through the ancient stones with unbelievable agility and speed bows creaked strings sang and arrows sped at the monster every one glanced off the lioness drew a bead on the monsters eye but it moved so fast her arrow flashed through empty air the sand beast charged among the elves throwing its horned head this way and that the horses mad panic made it hard for their riders to avoid the beasts rush horses and elves tumbled to the ground it leaped upon one struggling pair savaging them all the while arrows bounced off its armored hide how can we kill this thing kerian shouted desperately one horse braver than its fellows lashed out at the bloodthirsty beast with ironshod hooves coming directly at its eyes the monster backed up bumping against a standing stone the eighteenfoot monolith shifted favaronas clinging to kerians back saw this and it gave him an idea general look he shouted pounding her shoulder with the side of one hand the stone is loose if we topple it she began issuing orders before hed even finished while most of the troop fought to keep the monster where it was fourteen elves dismounted gathered on the other side of the stone to push the attackers charged launching arrows at the sand beasts head the creature was forced to blink every time an arrow flew at its eyes hips against the monolith it shook its head from side to side and screeched with frustrated fury now kerian cried fourteen elves threw themselves on the tottering spire it gave a little and the sand beast obligingly stepped forward when it felt the cold stone nudge its back the attackers pressed in harder and the sand beast fell back rocking the stone backward and loosening it further again elves clambered up to their comrades shoulders to get at the leaning stone with groans grunts and more than a few curses they shoved the monolith at its base the turquoise soil began to bulge and rise the monument was breaking loose get back get back elves on foot and horseback scattered suddenly freed of the annoying rain of arrows the sand beast lashed out with a foreclaw with its double burden the lionesss horse lagged behind the rest iron claws snared the animals flanks horse and riders went down in a heap the great stone continued its inexorable fall the sand beast sensed the danger but too late the tapered spire crashed down on its hips smashing it to the ground and pinning it beneath tons of stone the beast let out a highpitched howl elves scrambled up the monolith adding their weight to the burden on the creatures legs as it roared and clawed at the stone they stabbed furiously at the softer skin under its legs some swords snapped but enough penetrated to make blood flow stirred by an agony it had never known the sand beast arched its back with a mighty effort shifting pillar and elves and freeing itself crushed hindquarters dragging it fled mighty foreclaws propelling it several yards at a time the lust to kill elves was subsumed beneath a more primal needto live her warriors found the lioness groggy but uninjured atop her sprawled favaronas the archivist was senseless we beat it general its running away they shouted moving favaronas aside and pulling her to her feet the words penetrated the fog in her battered brain what go after it dont let it escape mounted elves spurred away kerian called for a new horse while one was being brought she knelt by favaronas blood trickled from his nose but his eyes had opened with her help he sat up holding his head in both hands we arent dead he muttered she grinned didnt i tell you id protect you i even let you land on me the sour look froze on his face as his gaze went beyond her look there issuing from the deep hole left by the uprooted monolith was a swarm of tiny lights they drifted and darted in the night air blue white red and a smoky orange the blue lights rose more quickly than the rest and winked out one by one white and red lights drifted to the ground and died like embers falling on wet grass only the orange wisps remained circling and rising the lioness had taken a few steps toward the lights but favaronas warned stay back dont touch them what are they i dont know but they were imprisoned by the standing pillar they werent meant to roam free a horse arrived for kerian wincing from her accumulated hurts she swung onto its back telling favaronas watch those things tell me what happens she spurted hard after the sand beast the orbiting orange lights peeled off in groups of two and three and followed her favaronas and the footbound warriors shouted warnings but she was already too far away to hear fiery pain kept the sand beast to a speed little better than a horses best gallop the bones broken in its left hip grated against each other sword cuts in the tender junction of its left hind leg burned great as its agony was even stronger was the fury blazing in its breast the need for vengeance pushed it onward it would visit this pain a hundredfold on the one who had sent it here if necessary it would cross the entire world to slay the one responsible for this agony something snagged its right rear foot brought up short the monster toppled forward burying its chin in the turf before it could get up more ropes whistled in snagging its horned head and front limbs each loop drew tight the one encircling its neck cinching so hard it couldnt draw breath then the creature found itself pulled in four directions at once kerian galloped into the fantastic scene the sand beast was down thrashing against its bonds wounded and confused it couldnt break the ropes holding it before more arrived its gyrations tore up clods of bluegreen soil and widened its wounds blood flowed freely additional loops cinched its neck its eyes bulged as the pressure on its throat grew and grew as her horse skidded to a halt she was amazed to see the orange lights sweep past her they never paused but flowed toward the tormented beast they held off a few feet sparkling like quartz in firelight until all their number was gathered then in unison they dropped when they touched the sand beasts hard flesh the area was bathed in a silent flash of white light a gust of cold wind stole kerians breath the ropes abruptly went slack causing the straining horses to surge forward and nearly unseating their riders to the amazement of all the sand beast was gone wapah halted at the flap of adalas tent weyadan i have food for you enter cousin he ducked under the ridge pole and knelt in front of her taking care not to spill the contents of the tin plate he carried only ripe olives bread and rice all cold but she made no comment on the poor fare two days had passed since the laddad had escaped into the valley of the blue sands adala had pitched her tent where she stood and the rest of the nomad warriors camped around her tending their wounded and burying their dead here they would remain until the elves returned trouble was they were not equipped for a long stay they had only the food and water they happened to be carrying at the time of the battle and nothing more it was their tradition to fight light and unencumbered siege warfare was not their style the bulk of their supplies had been lost when the family camp was attacked shortages appeared immediately inmost khurish camps each tent had its own fire but the nomads had so little fuel campfires were rationed to one per five tents traditionally they burned cow or goat droppings but they were far from their herds water was precious and food scarce adala went without a fire though any warrior in her host gladly would have given up his fuel to her she sat in her tent and sewed on a project of her own her only illumination the starshine she collected in a concave silver mirror set in the open door theres no sign of the enemy wapah reported she nodded but didnt look up her fingertips were pricked and red with irritation the inevitable consequence of sewing so long in such poor light he waited for her to stop sewing and eat when several long minutes passed with no sign of this happening he decided to go ahead and ask the question weighing on his mind she would eat when she would eat maita how long will we stay here lately the tribesmen had added this to her titles no longer speaking of adalas maita they named her fate itself we will stay here until the laddad come out she turned the heavy rectangle of cloth over and started stitching on the other side or until we are told to go told by whom those on high i am but their instrument frowning wapah departed it was a dark and somber camp he traversed back to the tent of bindas newly sworn war chief of the weyalu the tribes warmasters had taken to congregating there not least of all because bindass late uncle gwarali never traveled anywhere without a generous supply of wheat beer the leaders sat together in the hot darkness sipping beer from tiny brass cups and speaking in low tones about their situation already there was talk of leaving the valley mouth they didnt need to hover here the dissidents said all they need do was guard to route back to khurikhan and they would surely catch the laddad as they tried to return to their people food water medicine and other supplies could be had by trading if only they left this place and kept on the move that was their way sitting here in the shadow of the pillars of heaven was foreign and dangerous the weyadan knows what she is doing wapah insisted those on high have chosen her to cleanse our land do you doubt her none would say so but the beginning of that sentiment was plain in the black tent as plain as the aroma of gwaralis brew talk turned to strategy what was the best way to catch and defeat the elusive elves their longlegged horses were strong and fast if not as hardy as desert ponies laddad armor resisted the nomads favorite weapon the bow even their swords had longer blades than the tribesmens in estwilde the nerakans rode with lances said bindas hed served as a mercenary in the knights army during the recent great war they pierced any metal plate they rode at you need hardwood to make lances another mercenary veteran pointed out we can trade for it before the laddad come out and so it went voices rose and tempers flared as more beer was consumed and frustrations were voiced a few of the warmasters whod been to the world outside khur offered to lead troops into the valley to find the elves the older chiefs were shocked your crime would be as great as theirs one said where is it written we may not enter the valley said a young warmaster it is tradition yes but why what makes this place so sacred wapah cleared his throat many rolled their eyes the weyadans cousin was known as a talker when those on high made the world each in turn pressed a hand on the new ground leaving an impression each god said this is my place let no one desecrate it over time the elements and various upheavals obscured most of these places but the valley of the blue sands remains just as when the gods made it it is their place not ours and not the laddads silence reigned for a time broken only by the clink of brass cups and the splash of beer being poured bindas drained the last drops from his cup set it down he was asking pardon of the group preparing to suggest they all sleep when a strange metallic blast rang out over the camp the men hurried outside joining the rest of the camp likewise turning out to see what was happening the sound came again and they found its source on the crest of a ridge sixty yards away framed by the starry sky a rider on a rearing horse was blowing a horn bows were strung but bindas put a stop to anyone loosing an arrow an enemy would hardly announce his coming with a brass horn the rider galloped down the stony hillside zigzagging around juniper bushes and large rocks to the center of the camp this put him outside adalas tent the weyadan came out in time to receive the swirl of dust kicked up as the black horse skidded to a halt its rider was clothed in billowing robes not lightcolored like a traditional geb but scarlet turned nearly black by the starlight his head was covered by the robes hood he was lean with a pale foreign face he seemed small but perhaps that was only because his horse was so large eighteen hands at least who commands here he asked the voice was male and young do you understand me who is your leader i am adala stepped forward who are you i bring you a message from shobbat prince of khur he paused obviously expecting a response when adala gave none he added more loudly the prince calls upon the desert people of khur to save their country thats what were doing adala lifted her hem and approached she stopped quite close to the imposing horse and looked up at its crimsonclad rider i am adala weyadan of the weyalu chosen leader of these people this horse is not khurish neither are you who are you a messenger nothing more i was born beyond the mountains now i serve in khur i have a proclamation from prince shobbat will you receive it why does the prince of khur employ foreigners to do his bidding adala asked the messenger had removed a small scroll from his belt my horse is powerful and swift i came to khurikhan to serve adala shrugged one shoulder and murmured an old proverb a rat in a palace is still a rat the rider flung the scroll at her feet there is prince shobbats summons read it and know the truth or do i need to read it for you the slur went unchallenged adala picked up the scroll and handed it to bindas standing near her the war chief broke the seal and read the message aloud be it known i shobbat rightful prince of khur do set my hand to this message beloved sons of khur the plague of foreigners we have long endured now threatens our ancient land for five years the laddad have dwelt among us living their foreign lives and spreading their foreign ideas in khurikhan their steel buys hearts and their heresy clouds minds my father the khan of all the khurs sahim has succumbed to the lure of laddad money the nomads already thought this was true hearing it from sahims heir was a revelation there were murmurs and wide eyes all around the temples of khurikhan have become unclean sahimkhan allows the laddad to go where they will and flaunt the laws and customs of khur as a loyal son of khur bindas snorted at the irony of this phrase i cannot abide this treason any longer enough adala said what does he want bindas read silently for a moment then related the kernel at the end of the flowery message i therefore beseech all peoples of the desert who hold in their hearts the true soul of khur to ride to khurikhan and destroy the laddad pestilence there wind made the flames of the oil lamps waver the great horse obviously disliking the large number of humans that enclosed it snorted and stamped its hooves no one spoke well what is your answer the messenger finally asked adala stared up at the horse ignoring its riders question bravely the weyalu woman held up her hand even with her arm extended the horses head at the end of its proudly arched neck was beyond her reach the horse might have snapped off her fingers with one quick champ of its teeth instead its nervous movements halted and it lowered its head so the weyadan could pat its cheek lowering it further the horse nuzzled her hand the rider was surprised by his mounts docility he jerked the reins pulling his horses head up again are you going to answer he demanded adala spoke but not to him she turned black robes swirling around her feet and announced the foreign messenger and his great horse are signs we will go to khurikhan we will raise the tribes all the children of the desert will take up this cause it falls to us to purify khur looking north toward the blackness that was torghans teeth and the mouth of the valley she added let the laddad perish in their vanity those on high will attend to the blasphemers half a thousand weyalu warriors raised their hands over their heads and shouted in unison adala maita adala maita the noise was so great the couriers horse reared in alarm only the riders skill and quick thinking kept him in the saddle his task was complete and he had no desire to linger he put spurs to his black horse and galloped away filled with new spirit the nomads heaped all the carefully hoarded fuel on their campfires the flames blazed up sending gouts of sparks into the air the tribesmens chant soared upward as well as he rode away the nerakan courier could see the glow of the nomad fires for a long time he could hear their roar in chants even longer hengriff waiting on horseback in a draw a mile away heard them too sparks had fallen on the tinder all that remained was to see how big a bonfire would result chapter the gates of khurikhan were closed and bolted there was no warning no flurry of horns or rushing of guards the iron portcullises which once defied the minions of malystryx simply dropped into place the battlements normally patrolled by the khans soldiers emptied this was not a development gilthas had expected for a day and a half since word arrived of the supposed massacre of the nomad camp mobs of khurs armed with sticks hand tools and stones had issued from the city to attack khurinost several times the largest of these groups comprised a thou san people but each time they were turned back without difficulty by planchet hamaramis and the elven host tents on the camps periphery were torn down and burned but the angry khurs never penetrated far into khurinost then the city gates had closed the speaker and most of his advisors stood in the clear area in front of his royal tent the spot was the highest point in khurinost though not by much the late afternoon sun was behind them its orange light sparkled off the glazed tiles and yellow domes of khurikhan washing the scene in a deceptively pleasant and benign glow whats sahimkhan playing at is he trying to protect us from his people or what gilthas muttered none of his advisors knew absent from the group was lord morillon he was in the city seeking an audience with the khan planchet just returned from surveying the damage done to the outer ring of tents removed his helmet and mopped his forehead with a rag could be he wants to cut off our water he said he spoke out of his own thirst but his suggestion was a logical one every drop of water in khurinost had to be carried from the city if sahimkhan refused them access the next nearest wells were at vings oasis forty miles northeast a journey of two or three days for elves on foot the horrors of the march to khur five years ago would be repeated and on a daily basis gilthas needed alternatives he recalled hamaramis and with planchet discussed how to repair the situation we ought to storm the city hamaramis suggested the humans have left us ladders all around khurikhan the scaffolding erected for repair work on the walls remained in many spots planchet shook his head sahimkhan must know that hes not a fool the speaker studied khurikhan through a brass spyglass its ruby lenses polished by the gemcutters guild of qualinost had allowed him to watch the streets of qualinost from the heights of the palace now they brought khurish defenses into sharp focus for the speakers tired sunscorched eyes he hated the idea of attacking khurikhan they had dwelt here in relative peace and safety for five years they had no real enmity with khur if they stormed the city now they would have to go all out to win failure meant utter destruction they were too few to overwhelm the humans quickly so war in the desert kingdom would go on and on if neraka or the minotaurs intervened catastrophe would engulf elves and khurs alike perhaps it was not the khan who closed the gates planchet said he was worried about his young friend hytanthas who had not returned to the elves camp perhaps hytanthas had stumbled in his mission and the gates had been closed at the instigation of the mage faeterus hamaramis reminded them about the fanatical followers of torghan and planchet said they mustnt forget the nerakan emissary theyd seen in the khuri yl nor the khurs had longstanding ties to the dark knights and many of sahimkhans soldiers had served as mercenaries in their hire are we prepared to move the speaker asked still gazing through the spyglass we are short several hundred carts hamaramis replied there wasnt enough timber to build them and no time to trade for the wood so were building travois wilder elves often transported goods and possessions by this means a simple travois required only two long poles and canvas or hide to stretch between them it could be pulled by horse donkey or even a sturdy goat the trailing runners would not bog down in the sea of sand outside khurikhan glumly hamaramis departed to continue the preparations he was against leaving and his opposition had grown more open over the past few days he preferred to stay and attack seize the city he had argued negotiate with the khurs from the safety of their own stone walls what this bold forthright plan failed to consider was that once the city was theirs the elves were trapped the nomad tribes would gather and expend every last drop of blood to drive them out and neraka could not be ignored the knights would certainly intervene storming into khur as liberators the last hope of the elven nations would be caught neatly in a stone prison of their own making the answer gilthas still felt certain lay in finding a new place to live the elves needed barriers of distance and inhospitable wastes to guard them from the sudden proliferation of enemies only then could they grow and rebuild their strength a shadow fell on him and gilthas looked up planchet had opened a linen parasol to shade him i wonder where lady kerianseray is the valet said offering him a damp cloth gilthas pressed the cloth against his throat and brow some place cool i hope hed received a very short dispatch from her two days after the arrival of the first kerian and her warriors had entered the valley the climate was mild and damp but theyd found no signs of life strange stone ruins covered the valley as far as they could see she intended to penetrate to the center of the valley fulfilling her mission of exploration then return gilthas hardly knew what to make of the terse report it contained no details from his archivist favaronas and raised more questions than it answered was the inathwakenti suitable for their people or not was there a supply of fresh water any game what was so strange about the ruins did they show evidence of having been built by ancient elves as some of the legends had it the lioness did thank him for sending eagle eye to her but her promise to put him to good use against our enemies did not have a particularly diplomatic ring to it of course she was under great stress but did her reports have to be so vague and unhelpful was she allowing her personal feelings to color them she was dead against his plan to migrate to the valley like the other warriors around the speaker kerian preferred to decide her own fate by fighting even though he understood this he could not allow war to overtake his people he had to rule his own wife in that regard the stakes were too high he mopped his brow again glancing skyward the sun was relentless khurinost would exhaust its ready water supply in a day if khurikhan remained inaccessible more to the point he said where is lord morillon we need those gates opened lord morillon was saying those very words to sahimkhan on the rooftop garden of the royal citadel enormous screens woven of reeds and rushes shaded the garden in better times fountains flowed among the ferns and willows adding the music of falling water to the scene and allowing more tender plants to be grown as yet the water system had not been repaired so the greenery was confined to smaller potted bushes and flowers which servants carried indoors during the worst heat of the day despite its sparse look the garden still afforded an excellent view of the city if our people are shut out great khan they will be forced to storm the city for water attack khurikhan sahim thundered blood will run down the walls of the city should that happen the silvanesti noble bowed saying smoothly your majesty is wise blood indeed will flow elven and human honeytongued zunda stepped forward and intoned great is the patience of my master sahim the manyblessed his forbearance is like the gods own he has heard of the terrible atrocities wrought against his desert children and still he is merciful still he stays his hand against the laddad for he has pledged to maintain their safety the word of sahimkhan is like a thunderbolt implacable and unchanging suave diplomatic silvanesti never grind their teeth in frustration but lord morillon was close to doing just that he saidfor the eighth time since arriving at the palacethat there was no proof a massacre had occurred much less that it had been perpetrated by elves if the mighty khan would receive my king the speaker of the sun and stars he would know this tale is false desert tribesmen are known throughout this land for their truth telling said zunda it is for them as essential as water and salt i can only repeat there is no proof lady kerianseray or any other elven warriors have harmed a single nomad no one has offered the slightest evidence an atrocity has even occurred if it has the great khan should look elsewhere for culpritsneraka perhaps lord hengriff also was present on the rooftop the representative of the dark knights stood a few steps away among a crowd of other foreign dignitaries he overtopped by head and shoulders his dark face was expressionless as a mask even when the silvanesti noble invoked his countrys name the truth will be known sahim declared i believe in the will of the gods in reality sahimkhan believed in nothing but sahimkhan as always his mind was busy considering how best to make use of the current situation morillons threat to fight for water might prove a useful lever for prying more money out of neraka sahim sought out hengriff in the crowd only to discover the bullvoiced warrior had slipped away unnoticed such discretion was remarkable in so large a manremarkable and unnerving mighty khan the gates the silvanesti lord was saying he was a persistent snake sahim had to credit him for that next to round bewigged old zunda morillon looked trim cool and elegant sahim settled himself back in his thronenot the heavy priceless sapphire throne which never left the audience halland arranged his white and gold robes thus seated he was a head taller than the standing elf he made the most of his advantage looking down his nose at morillon zunda how long till sunset one hour mighty khan the vizier replied promptly hed long ago learned to have a multitude of disparate facts to hand even one which his master could easily know for himself simply by looking over his shoulder at the lowering sun sahim mulled the answer in silence for moment then barked commander of the guard the quick flash of surprise on morillons face was most gratifying the laddad wasnt as sure of himself as he appeared general hakkam came forward armor clanking he knelt before his lord commander take what troops you need and clear the city gates of all malcontents the khan said if they resist put them to the sword hakkams weathered face showed even more surprise than the elfs but he acknowledged the command immediately before he could rise to go sahim spoke again however the gates will remain closed it seemed all in the crowd were holding their breath none could fathom what the khan was up to from the look on morillons face it was obvious he too was at a loss as you must certainly recall my lord sahim said elves are not allowed within the city after nightfall the khan of khur cannot allow his defenses to be compromised the malcontents and rioters will be cleared from the gates at once and the gates will open as usualat sunrise tomorrow general hakkam departed morillon expressed his gratitude his words carried no trace of irony justice is the cornerstone of khanship sahim said allowing his amusement to show it was not a pleasant expression the merchants in the souks must trade im sure they miss their laddad customers he put a hand to his lips as if a thought had just occurred to him you had best warn your speaker keeping sufficient troops on the gates to ward off rioters will be a drain on my treasury i will of course be forced to institute a new tax an awed hush fell over the rooftop garden morillons breathing seemed suddenly loud all of his diplomatic training was required to keep him from shouting what tax mighty khan he asked henceforth all persons entering khurikhan to trade must pay an entry tax he glanced at zunda one gold piece per head the vizier lowered his eyes and nodded ever so slightly the amount was ridiculous exorbitant and fell especially on the elves who entered frequently for trade purposes morillons silvanesti aplomb failed him utterly his mouth fell open sahim smilingly assured him the tax was only temporary until the troops could be returned to their barracks morillon bowed stiffly i will convey the great khans words to the speaker of the sun and stars will your mightiness receive the speaker to discuss the matter of the alleged massacre sahim waved a hand magnanimously i need no reassurance my lord the word of the speaker of the sun and stars is more than enough for me pale tightlipped morillon swept out ignoring the stares of sahims uncouth courtiers another socalled tax this was the second time the khan had insulted the speaker to morillons face the silvanesti was a lifelong servant of the throne of the stars and his patience was nearly at an end sahimkhan didnt know it but hed made a lasting enemy of lord morillon this day passing through the citadel courtyard walking so rapidly his small entourage had to jog to keep up morillon noted two humans talking together lord hengriff and prince shobbat were deep in conversation by a shadowed wall that is to say shobbat was talking animatedly hengriff was listening arms folded across his chest the knights eyes moved crossing morillons gaze in passing and his impassive countenance altered the look on his face was so fleeting morillon found it difficult to categorize was it acknowledgment a grudging respect the dark order for all its machinations was a far more honorable opponent than the grasping conniving sahim perhaps in that brief moment knight and elf shared the realization that both were heartily sick of khur and its ruler change was coming whether it would be for neraka or the elves was uncertain but the current course could not continue a very eloquent glance in a snap of skyblue silk morillon was out the gate and gone hengriff continued to stare thoughtfully after him was delivered shobbat was saying voice rising did your courier get through as i ordered hengriff nodded and the prince demanded well has he returned i would speak to him about the nomads reaction the knight didnt respond he was still thinking about the silvanesti noble lord morillon was a chink in the speakers armor gilthas trusted him too much relied too heavily on his counsel but hengriff recognized morillons type he was of the class of elves who let their nation slide into ruin while they observed all the niceties of protocol and manners kerianseray and the qualinesti were much more dangerous they would have deduced long before now that they had a spy in their midst morillon was still in the dark youre not listening hengriff fixed the impatient prince with a baleful eye no im not when you calm down and speak rationally ill listen your highness shobbat quivered he wasnt used to such insolence any more than he was used to standing in the beat sweat stood out on his forehead tiny red veins webbed the whites of his eyes he had dyed his hair its usual dark shade but in strong sunlight the black carried a faint greenish tinge i need to know whats happening he said striving for a calmer tone are the nomads coming who can say highness your desert folk are like wolves fierce and wild ive lived here two years and i dont begin to understand them shobbat khur born and bred didnt understand the nomads either but he wasnt about to admit that to hengriff changing the subject the knight told him of his fathers agreement to clear all the city gates of troublemakers really all the gates you say the prince pressed a fist to his lower lip if soldiers of the household guard had been sent to all nine gates of khurikhan there couldnt be many left in the palace careful highness your thoughts leap from your face shobbat forced a careless laugh and palmed sweat from his forehead i dont know what you mean im simply suffering from the heat i should retire indoors and escape the warmth hengriff bowed to the heir of khur to your highnesss continued good health the prince withdrew once he had seemed a ridiculous figure but hengriff was beginning to wonder if he had underestimated him the situation was coming to a head and quickly hengriffs dispatches to jelek stressed this urgency he felt the order must be ready to move on a moments notice when the crisis came the fate of the elves would fall not to him who struck first but him who struck the most decisively six lengthy dispatches carefully enciphered he had sent to jelek via the border town of kortal six dispatches in as many weeks yet no answer had come back if hengriff had been the suspicious type he might think his messages werent getting through worse still could rennold be ignoring him odd sounds reached the citadel courtyard distorted by the brick canyons of khurikhan the tumult sounded like the crash of waves on a rocky shore hengriff knew better they were the sounds of conflict his four bodyguards arrived already mounted leading his horse my lord cried his man goldorf there is fighting at the city gates hengriff swung into the saddle sahimkhan ordered his troops to clear the gates who are his guards fighting torghanists hengriff betrayed surprise the priests of torghan were taking nerakan pay and he hadnt asked them to blockade the city so who had his dark eyes narrowed he suspected the meddling hand of prince shobbat in this development well lets see how sahims men fight he said grasping his reins in one large fist he and his bodyguards galloped straight to the west gate which faced the elves camp they scattered khurs left and right the lesser souk was emptying rapidly as the sound of swordplay rang over the market the sight of the nerakans on horseback only hastened the process this gate was known to citydwellers as malyss anvil because the red dragon had crushed so many foes against the stout iron portcullises when sahimkhans guards arrived the gatehouse had appeared undefended but as they broke ranks to open it stones and timbers rained down thrown by khurs concealed inside a squad was sent up each side of the battlement to storm the gate in unison and trap the attackers inside unfortunately the fanatics proved to be armed with more than brickbats they produced swords and spears and in the narrow confines of the parapet sahims guards had a real fight on their hands soon the ground around the gatehouse was littered with bodies most wore nomad gebs but more than a few wore the scale armor of the khans royal guard hengriff halted his horse some distance away to watch the unexpected fight his men pulled up respectfully behind him silent at first the bodyguards soon were offering a running commentary on the progress of the battle and bellowing advice to the outmaneuvered guards cut at their legs civilians are terrified of thatkeeps em from running away look at those shields dangling from their wrists like a ladys nosegay get your shields up you goatherds watch those spearpoints ill bet you wish you had a score of archers just now dont you shut up hengriff growled and the bodyguards subsided merely shaking their heads at the display before them below the guards breached the flimsy barricade around the gate leaping over baskets filled with brickbats they quickly routed the torghanists on the ground in hours the remaining eight portals were likewise free of malcontents long before that hengriff had led his men back into the city the knight had other falcons to fly during the coming night hytanthas arched his back stretching he was tucked inside an angle of broken wall on the grounds of a once beautiful villa through a chink in the wall hed been watching the ruined house for half a day hed begun to think he was on a kenders errand disguised again as a human he had lurked in wine shops and low inns seeking clues to the whereabouts of the elusive sorcerer faeterus hed learned nothing of note until he overheard a merchant complaining to his fellows about a peculiar order hed received i am a poulterer the merchant declaimed proudly not a trapper who orders a dozen live pigeons nobody eats those filthy birds his colleagues mocked him mercilessly apparently this was not the first time hed received such an order nor the first time hed complained about it then why didnt you refuse taunted one of his colleagues because of the money put in another there were guffaws around the table and the poulterer joined in the money was indeed good good enough to convince him not only to procure the despised pigeons but to deliver them to the citys ruined northern district hed stopped here for a refresher before venturing into that cursed area his comrades agreed the harbalah was home to ghostsand worse at this point hytanthas insinuated himself into the conversation posing as a delphonian down on his luck he offered to deliver the pigeons the chicken merchant was eager to shift the duty to another he paid hytanthas two silversinsulting wages which the elf accepted with fawning gratitudethen gave him directions and a warning remember leave the cages outside the old garden wall dont go any closer to the house why so much fuss its a ruin isnt it just dont if you value your lifes blood hytanthas heeded the warning he had placed the caged birds where hed been told then took up a position in one of the wrecked outbuildings to see who claimed them he was certain it would be faeterus the shattered mansion was the perfect setting for a renegade wage and hytanthas had heard unsavory stories about dark magical rites involving the sacrifice of animals like pigeons the land rose slightly from hytanthass position up to the villa proper as the sun set the shadows swelled like a dark sea claiming first the grounds then the decrepit house blocks warmed all day gave up their heat by night so hytanthas had a snug place from which to watch the pigeon basket too snug in fact after so many hours of inactivity he began to nod the clatter of broken stones jerked him from sleep gripping his sword hilt he peered through the chink in the wall the wicker basket was where hed left it its avian cargo asleep he heard another small avalanche of disturbed masonry someone was moving in the ruins a low breathy growl penetrated his hiding place then a voice hoarse with age pitched slightly high what is it talon intruders the voice was behind him to the left of the villas front door in the ruined garden with all the stealth imparted by heritage and training hytanthas rose up from his crouch and peeked over the low wall there was faeterus not ten yards away he was standing in profile hooded heavy robe draped over his hunched shoulders one longfingered hand held a thin glittering leash at the other end of the leash was a walking nightmare the monster stood on four feet like a lion and its body was covered by thick tawny hair it had a long neck coated in sleek bronzecolored scales atop this surrounded by a stiff red mane its head was an awful parody of an elven or human face with a flat nose and a mouth many times larger than a persons row upon row of silver metallic teeth filled the creatures fearsome smile its tail switched back and forth like a cats this is what happens when i take down my wards to receive new birds someone takes advantage faeterus said very well talon find the intruder he released the thin leash hytanthas ducked down he heard the monsters paws dig into loose rubble as it sprang away from its master whoever you are youd better run when the manticore finds you the meeting wont be pleasant hytanthas gathered himself took a deep breath and leaped over the wall he landed with feet wide apart and presented his blade to the robed mage he looked around nervously the manticore was not in sight in the name of the speaker of the sun and stars surrender faeterus looked surprised but only for an instant ah i see an elf hiding in a human shell that explains talons confusion whats your name hermit crab hytanthas told him just as the manticore came bounding back down the path hytanthas rushed forward laying the edge of his sword alongside faeteruss neck keep that thing away or ill have your head faeterus snapped his fingers the monster halted at once as if arrested by an invisible tether dropping on its haunches it stared at them with round cold blue eyes grinning with its insanely large mouth hot breath stinking of carrion washed over hytanthass face im taking you to the speaker to be judged for your crimes he said i dont think so hytanthas tapped him with the flat of his blade faeterus chuckled lightly adding yes a good blade and im sure you know how to use it but its not yet time for me to meet gilthas pathfinder with that he simply went away how or where hytanthas could not begin to guess but one instant he was gripping the mages bulky robe in the next blink of an eye his hand was empty his sword now resting on nothing dropped to the dirt the manticore leaped hytanthas got his blade up in time to ward off the monster his point raked across the bright scales but did not pierce them he backed rapidly keeping his weapon pointed at the beast huffing the manticore advanced slowly hytanthas spotted faeterus the mage now stood on a veranda high on the side of the ruined villa the basket of pigeons sat beside him his face showed no excitement merely calm curiosity apparently he wanted to see how his monstrous pet dealt with an armed and agile intruder hytanthas cut at the manticores eyes the creature stood its ground batting the tip away with one paw hytanthas reversed his motion and thrust at the paw his keen point pierced it from furred top to padded sole dark blood flowed the beast howled opening its mouth so wide the elf feared its head would break at the hinge and fall off its voice was high and piping the manticore attacked again hytanthas pirouetted aside but the beasts claws caught his khurish robe he was dragged down landing on his back atop broken masonry and the sword flew from his hand the monsters claws slashed across his chest the mail shirt he wore beneath his robe saved him from being gutted like a fish but the blow still knocked the wind from his chest furious at its failure to draw blood the manticore swatted the elf like a housecat toying with a mouse the blow sent hytanthas rolling across the weedy ground until he fetched up against a sizable date palm shedding sun hat and shredded robe the elf hefted several fistsized stones and hurled them at the creature they thumped against its chest eliciting grunts but barely slowed the manticore hytanthas turned and ran khurish sandals flapping he vaulted nimbly over ruined fences and broken walls but was forced to detour around larger obstacles his adversary simply bulled straight through everything in its path thereby gaining steadily on him as he leapt for the top of a stout pile of stone masonry the creature was so close behind he felt the rush of air as it swiped at his legs he hauled himself up and over the pile the manticore crashed into the pile but the masonry was too thick for it to break through with a humansounding scream of frustration the monster reared up rested its paws atop the pile and looked over frustration turned to unholy triumph and it grinned its quarry was trapped hytanthas stood with his back against the estates outer wall designed to enclose the villa like a miniature fortress whole sections had been toppled but it was his misfortune that this portion a good twenty yards long was intact fifteen feet high its surface was smoothly plastered allowing for no handholds even for a nimble and highly motivated elf with evident relish and terrifying slowness the manticore scaled the masonry pile its pale blue eyes never left hytanthass face and the elf stared back afraid if he looked away it would pounce suddenly the manticore froze right foreleg in the air hytanthas hadnt heard or felt anything but the creature obviously had it waited several long seconds tail twitching gaze flickering upward then resumed its advance on the veranda faeterus felt something too he released the pigeon hed been stroking moved to the edge of the gallery and stared out into the night a deep vibration suddenly shook ground and air gradually hytanthas discerned a new sound heavy footfalls and the noise of something weighty being dragged it was coming from his right a part of the estate he hadnt explored as he tried to make sense of the noises the manticore began behaving oddly attention fixed in the direction of the approaching footsteps it shrank down belly against the rubble pile as if trying to make itself small its thin lips parted and it hissed like a frightened cat the hair along its back stood up the heavy footfalls and dragging sound drew nearer bringing with them the metallic reek of blood the warm wind carried the stench of putrefaction as of a large wound gone black with gangrene the manticore howled loudly then rushed away keeping itself close to the ground cautiously hytanthas followed hed spotted his sword glittering faintly in the rubble it was a long way away and the manticore departing or not was between the weapon and him he was sizing up his chance of reaching it when something loomed up out of the darkness at first he thought it was the manticore but the sheer bulk of the thing was too great at least three times the size of faeteruss deadly pet he made out a pair of green eyes each at least ten inches across with large vertical black pupils and a huge face ringed by horns hytanthas screamed his cries were answered faeterus tossed a small globe into the air it exploded flooding the scene with brilliant white light the light was painful to hytanthas but bearable by its illumination he finally realized what it was he faced though he could hardly credit his eyes during his exile in khur the young elf had tried to learn all he could about the dangers his people might face here never had he thought to see a sand beast especially not in the middle of a city fortunately the creature did not seem overly interested in him head lowered against the glare the sand beast continued its advance toward the ruined villa someone had hurt it it hauled itself forward by its forelimbs its hindquarters dragging lifelessly behind where left hind leg joined sloping back a great festering wound spread the elf never considered running away his mission was to bring faeterus before the speaker he could hardly do that if he left the mage at the mercy of this monster faeterus hampered by his bulky disguise was descending the stone steps from the veranda talon the sorcerer panted attack the manticore came galloping over the debrisstrewn ground its earlier fear of the sand beast overcome by the will of its master in the last few yards its strides stretched to great bounds and on the third leap it threw itself on the sand beasts back wrapping its legs around the scaly hide the greenishgold scales covering the sand beasts throat resisted the manticores teeth but the mages pet kept trying the sand beast shook its horned head from side to side hoping to dislodge its attacker the manticore climbed up and hooked its foreclaws on the beasts lower jaw mouth opening wide the manticore worried the beasts throat the sand beast gave up trying to remove its tormenter lowering its head it ran itself against the nearest standing wall blocks burst apart and the manticore finally was knocked loose it rolled got its feet beneath it and sprang again with lightning precision the sand beasts head came around its jaws opened and it caught the manticore in midleap the manticore yowled in highpitched rage but only for a moment the sand beasts jaws closed on its neck a sickening snap and the human looking head dropped to the ground faeterus had reached the arena of battle the mage extended his left hand toward the furious sand beast and uttered a string of mysterious syllables an invisible concussion drove the beast backward a few feet but that was all metallic lids narrowed over its eyes a throaty growl rose from its throat and the beast advanced again youre only making it angry hytanthas yelled keep it busy and ill help you fight it the mages hooded head turned toward him yes perhaps you can be a help at that faeterus spoke a word and the globe of light overhead went out hytanthas his attention focused on getting to his sword was suddenly astonished to find himself not only plunged into darkness but dragged backward as if in the grip of an invisible band he protested flailing futilely against the force that held him faeterus waited until he was nearly in range of the sand beasts claws then released him with the beast thus distracted the mage made his escape he vanished into the outer darkness hytanthas wasted no time as soon as the magical force let him go he hurled himself to one side rolled and came up running clad only in mail shirt leggings and sandals he was unarmed and helpless once determined to take faeterus back to the speaker he would have to settle for bringing word of the mages whereabouts if he survived behind him he could hear the creatures advance chunks of masonry flew date palms snapped and broken walls burst apart as the sand beast kept coming its aim was uncanny either it could see very well in the dark or it had some other way of sensing hytanthass whereabouts the elf turned to see where it was in that brief pause the sand beast jumped at him hampered by injury the creature came up short but one foreclaw swiped across his mail shirt once more his armor saved hytanthas from death but even the glancing touch of the metallic claws was enough to tear through the mail as though it was linen the sand beast was thrown off balance it crashed to the ground and rolled down a short slope while the monster floundered in a rocky weedchoked area that once had been a stonelined pond hytanthas made good his escape he clambered up the shell of the gatehouse and dropped inside loose rubble shifted beneath his feet and he landed awkwardly slicing his leg on a sharp limestone block swallowing a groan of pain he listened for sounds of the sand beasts pursuit instead he heard human voices mens voices a tiny ember of relief flickered inside of him perhaps sahimkhans soldiers had heard the uproar in the harbalah and come to investigate a new fire burned in the air over the villa grounds no magical orb it was a flaming arrow its light fell on the sand beast dedicatedly gnawing off its own wounded leg and something else five mounted men they cantered through an opening in the villas outer wall one had a long lance couched under his arm the rest carried swords or bows their armor was nerakan not khurish hytanthas had no intention of cowering in safety while others battled that horror he hunted through the debris in the gatehouse and found a length of lead pipe corroded but heavy with his makeshift weapon in hand he slipped out to wait for the riders to reach him the sand beast gave up trying to sever its injured leg and dragged itself onto the cracked payers of the road to wait for the oncoming riders it was breathing hard its nostrils sending clouds of white vapor into the cooling night air the five riders drew abreast of hytanthas and rode on by the one in the center carrying the lance was lord hengriff the dark orders emissary to khur the five charged the wounded sand beast hengriffs lance pierced its broken hips the monster roared in pain and whirled snapping the lance shaft but leaving its head buried one foreclaw raked through the air and a horse went down it and its rider had been shredded neither rose again circling away hengriff drew a twohanded sword hytanthas couldnt imagine wielding such a weapon with only one hand while on horseback but the big knight handled the sword with practiced ease with his three surviving men guarding his flanks he galloped straight at the sand beast he rose in the stirrups and swung the sword using all his size and strength to drive the blade in up to its hilt behind the monsters shoulders his men loosed arrows at its head from only a few feet away two pierced its eyes before the beast shuddered and fell like a poleaxed steer the ground shook from the impact nearly knocking the approaching hytanthas off his feet hengriff dismounted leaning against the sand beasts ribs he was slumped forward over the pommel of his sword which he still gripped in both hands his eyes were closed his head bowed and hytanthas thought the breath had been driven from his lungs the elf cleared his throat to speak shh hengriff said the heartbeat is fading understanding came and hytanthas shuddered the knight wasnt recuperating from the mighty blow hed landed he was listening to the creatures life slip away the young elf said nothing conscious of the three other dark knights sitting on horseback around him thats it grunting hengriff worked his sword free of the monsters carcass cleaning the blade on a scrap of leather he angled a considering look at hytanthas the kill wouldve been more satisfying had it been at full strength how did you manage to wound it elf his disguise in tatters wrung out by fear and fighting hytanthas had no strength left to fence with the nerakan i didnt he said bluntly it arrived like that an absent nod then hengriff spoke to one of his men goldorf that lance broke too easily time was short my lord i had to improvise what of faeterus this question was directed at hytanthas the elf told the truth the mage had disappeared when the sand beast arrived i know you hengriff said eyes narrowing ive seen you before ah yes you were in the speakers honor guard when he had his audience with sahimkhan hytanthas had been only one of fifty elves in the honor guard impressed by the knights memory but striving not to show it hytanthas inclined his head confirming his identity so you came here hunting faeterus youre triply lucky elf lucky the mages wards didnt get you lucky his ugly pet didnt gut you and lucky we came along to deal with the sand beast hengriff sent his men on to the ruined villa i came hunting the mage too he said he was pursuing his own course raising the nomads against the elves and the khan sending this creature out to kill that shedragon kerianseray i wonder how it ended up back here he shook his head things have a habit of doing that around faeterus appearing or disappearing without warning have your men been sent to kill the mage hengriff didnt answer but he didnt really need to hytanthas doubted the knights would have much luck faeterus didnt seem the sort to linger where danger threatened the elf was losing strength swaying on his feet exhausted thirsty and injured from his battles with manticore and sand beast it seemed he was always tired or injured or thirsty these days perhaps hed been that way for years for all the years of his exile stupid not to have planned better brought food and water hed not expected to have to wait so long for faeterus certainly hadnt expected to battle a humanheaded manticore and a wounded enraged sand beast hytanthas realized hengriff was speaking to him he had no idea what the human had said worse hed completely forgotten the nerakan was here had forgotten everything but the miasma of fatigue and privation that enveloped him he forced his slumping shoulders to straighten and gripped the lead pipe more tightly im leaving he announced dont try to stop me a wolfish smile appeared on the knights face go back to your people elf before you drop where you stand and another of faeteruss creatures has you for dinner before he departed honor demanded one last thing of hytanthas lord hengriff he said with formal precision you saved my life thank you that was today dont expect a like outcome next time hengriff mounted his horse and cantered away heading up the hill to the villa hytanthas went in the opposite direction beginning the long trek back to khurinost the world was indeed a crazy place when a soldier in the speakers host was saved from death at the hands of a rogue elven wizard by a dark knight of neraka chapter chanting to synchronize their efforts a gang of elves hauled away on the ropes a timber frame rose off the ground wavered a bit then climbed higher as the warriors continued to pull easy easy there kerian called out if they pulled too quickly the frame would topple forward on them the early twilight had come to inathwakenti by torchlight the scene resembled a nightmarish dream all the soldiers of the lionesss command were mustered around the hole that had opened up when they pushed the monolith over on the sand beast some were on horseback others on foot but every one was armed and ready the reason for their increased wariness could be found in their dwindling numbers two nights had passed since the vanishing of the sand beast the lionesss original vow to leave the valley quickly was set aside after this event she decided they would remain an extra day to search for the elusive monster they hadnt found it instead several of her warriors had gone missing all were sentries riding guard duty alone on the perimeter of the camp then just past noon on this day five more elves had vanished the five were on foot foraging for roots and nuts no more than twenty yards from the site of the overturned monolith when they didnt return a search was conducted it turned up no signs of struggle no torn ground no dropped possessions the elves were simply gone together with everything they carried as favaronas was the nearest thing to an expert on the valley kerian asked him what he thought was happening i dont know general he said shivering with the fear that had become his constant companion glanthon said youve mentioned strange forces at work in the valley what do you mean just that strange unnatural things happen here i myself have favaronas broke off coloring in embarrassment kerian had no time for niceties of feeling she insisted he hold nothing back and he admitted having seen apparitions himself just the night before he described them as white shapes vaguely elven in form drifting through the stone ruins patches of mist glanthon scoffed no they moved against the wind the archivist insisted the lioness cut the air with an imperative hand were not here to collect ghost stories favaronas i want to know whos taking my people i dont know perhapshe gestured vaguely at the fallen monoliththe same force that carried off the sand beast after that discussion with no other conjecture to test kerian decided to investigate the hole beneath the stone spire rocks dropped into it revealed the bottom to be at least twenty feet down their hollowsounding impacts hinted at a chamber of some size as the sun lowered itself behind the western peaks trees were felled trimmed and lashed into a frame to support ropes lowered into the hole kerian intended to descend herself but her officers wouldnt hear of it none doubted she was prepared to do anything she might ask of her warriors but glanthon reminded her she did not have the luxury of taking such risks as general of the speakers army her life was too valuable to risk unnecessarily it finally was agreed that glanthon would enter the hole to favaronass dismay he was tapped to accompany glanthon me why me the archivist said his face pale even in the firelight kerian said youre the scholar there may be things down there you can recognize her phrasing was unfortunate favaronas blanched even whiter at the notion of things down there so kerian un buckled her own sword and fastened the scabbard around his waist if you see any ghosts give them steel if theyre flesh and blood theyll feel it she smiled and if theyre not flesh and blood they cant hurt you he did not look reassured a pair of stout ropes was tied to the handles of a small round shield that would serve as a platform glanthon and favaronas climbed on holding tight to the ropes with the whole command looking on they were lowered into the hole the opening wasnt much wider than the shield on which they stood as their feet sank into the black aperture favaronas said tell me again why were doing this to find clues to our comrades disappearance said glanthon stoutly and to carry out the speakers command to learn all we can about this valley arent you curious not any more their heads disappeared below the surface they entered a square shaft lined with stone the air cooled rapidly only eight feet below the surface their breath streamed out as white vapor all right the lioness called sounding very far away we could use a light favaronas said his voice rising glanthon assured him torches would be dropped down the hole after they reached bottom seems backward to me no sense announcing our coming announcing announcing to whom favaronass voice was a squeak now their shield footrest which had been lightly scraping the sides of the shaft entered open air they swung back and forth a few times then bumped into a solid floor step back glanthon said cupping a hand to his mouth he shouted torch a flaming brand crackled down the shaft where it caromed off the walls showers of sparks fell on them favaronas yelped and leaped backward but glanthon caught the falling torch deftly in one hand a second followed it favaronas didnt attempt to copy the warriors action the second torch hit the ground and went out the floor was ankledeep in thick white mist it was cold and damp but caused them no apparent harm glanthon retrieved the second torch lit it from his own and handed it to the archivist merciful ancestors favaronas breathed holding the brand high what is this place ahead and behind them stretched a tunnel arrowing straight northwest and southeast the ceiling had a slight arch to it and was high enough for both elves to stand erect favaronass awed comment had been inspired by the walls of the passage the tunnel was covered floor to ceiling with the most beautiful painting either elf had ever seen it depicted a landscape in such exquisite detail and realistic color they almost expected the trees to sway in the breeze could almost smell the scent of the flowers and hear the splash of the silvery river winding through the scene the ceiling was a serene blue with wispy white clouds who had painted this lovely vista and why bury it under the ground glanthon reached out to touch the wall but favaronas caught his arm dont he whispered dont touch anything glanthon nodded in solemn agreement they walked slowly down the tunnel the movement of their feet stirring the viscous fog the hem of favaronass robe grew dark with damp dew glistened on glanthons boots as they marveled at the unfolding work of art glanthon noted an oddity there were no living creatures depicted the scenery was beautiful and varied but contained no people nor any animals like the valley above favaronas said he frowned staring at the righthand wall it seems familiar somehow not to glanthon born and raised in qualinesti he knew its towns forests and farmlands well this painted landscape resembled no place hed ever seen it looks older than qualinesti somehow and more glanthon searched for the right word more formal like a lords garden favaronas stopped abruptly are there any silvanesti in our company yes why he pointed to the silverblue river that serpentined through the landscape on the righthand wall they should see this i think thats the thonthalas are you certain not certain no ive never been to silvanesti but it matches descriptions ive read could this place have been made by ancient silvanesti favaronas wasnt sure the ruins above were without any identifying marks yet they had none of the air of refinement associated with silvanesti sites the stonework was monumental but rather crude much more reminiscent of human handiwork than elven yet if he was right then whoever had painted this scene had at least visited the silvanesti heartland glanthon suddenly grabbed his companions arm in a painful grip startled the archivist yelped loudly what is there danger where he tried to draw the lionesss sword with one hand the warriors grip tightened further quiet he hissed look far down the tunnel in the darkness beyond the reach of the torchlight something stirred vaguely upright it was coming toward them glanthons sword was already in his hand favaronas managed to free his borrowed blade from its scabbard but glanthon whispered do nothing unless i say so nodding vigorously favaronas stepped closer to the warrior the approaching figure was small under five feet in height and of indistinct shape it resembled a person draped in diaphanous gray carrying no light it came on assuredly at a steady pace a very faint glow more attenuated than foxfire radiated from the figure and the pale aura was reflected by the mist which remained undisturbed by its passage sweat trickled down favaronass neck he was shaking so hard he couldnt hold the sword steady never again he vowed silently never again would he leave his archive not even for the speaker of the sun and stars would he abandon his beloved manuscripts againif he lived to get back to them the apparition seemed heedless of the two elves as it passed between them head lowered it brushed glanthons leg he felt nothing there was no sign of feet or legs the apparition merged with the fog lining the tunnel a sound like a sigh rasped down the stonelined passage alarmed glanthon thrust his torch at the specter the flaming pine knot passed through it without resistance but the ghost appeared to lift its head and turn it looked back at the elves both cried out in shock favaronas dropped his torch and it went out with that the ghost disappeared extraordinary favaronas exclaimed as glanthon relit his torch a cat or an ocelot perhaps or what are you babbling about that thing a long neck pricked ears white whiskers yet feminine somehow unbelievable glanthon stared at the archivist with mouth agape for a few seconds then said flatly youre hallucinating it looked nothing like that the warrior had seen a slight figure in loose robes cowl hanging down its back the head was wide and round like a humans without the delicate bone structure of an elf he had an impression of pale hair a blank unfinished face and empty black eye sockets despite his terror favaronass scholarly instincts were engaged and he seemed disposed to stand in the cold dim tunnel comparing and discussing their very different impressions of the ghost glanthon put a stop to this by taking his arm and hauling him forward wait were going on said favaronas wideeyed not far fifty more steps then well go back and report what weve seen favaronas complained at the arbitrariness of his decision why fifty why not twenty why not just turn around now it isnt logical whats the point glanthon ignored the mumbled commentary deciding it was only favaronass method of coping with his fear although he kept muttering the archivist also kept moving forward sword held up albeit in a very shaky hand theyd gone no more than thirty paces before the tunnel brought them to a chamber about three times as wide as the tunnel and twice as high its walls were barren of the painted reliefs along one side were a multitude of stone cylinders each about a yard long and four or five inches thick stacked on their sides like cordwood the opposite wall was covered with peeling white plaster the strange cylinders drew favaronas like a magnet he lifted one it was heavy made of a soft slippery stone like talc or gypsum a hole was bored through its long axis the object looked for all the world like a scroll asked glanthon holding his torch close no one ever made books of stone countered the archivist still the resemblance was uncanny at his suggestion they decided to take some of the cylinders back with them favaronas discarded his torch and laid two scrolls in the crook of each arm glanthon also took four but bore all in one strong arm so he could keep his torch the elves were walking back down the long tunnel to the entrance when they heard alarm trumpets on the surface struggling under the burden they carried warrior and scholar hastened to the waiting rope lift the warriors above shouted for them to hurry they stepped onto the shield platform and were hoisted back up more horns sounded as they neared the surface glanthon dumped his four cylinders on the ground as soon as he cleared the opening wheres the trouble we saw lights among the ruins over there a wilder elf pointed northeast the lioness has gone to investigate she had left behind only enough elves to watch the hole and pull the two explorers out the rest of her shrinking command had galloped off with her once favaronas was safely out of the hole glanthon left a warrior behind with him and ordered the rest to horse sitting on the ground favaronas watched them gallop away the single elf with him also stared after his departing comrades the look on his face eloquent of his desire go with them favaronas said waving a hand ill be fine the warrior shook his head youd be alone the archivist sighed the trouble whatever it is is out there not here with only a little more prompting the elf rode away by the light of the torches that ringed the hole favaronas studied one of the cylinders glyphs were incised into the soft stone in the uncertain light his sensitive fingertips gave him a better idea of their shape than his eyes could the writing was elvish or at least the characters were elvish the old writing used in silvanost on monuments palaces temples and public buildings he sounded out the syllables his fingers detected balafomthas hocsemath it made no sense perhaps this was some ancient dialect but it seemed to confirm the notion that silvanesti elves had inhabited this valley long ago what of the apparition in the tunnel below what was it and why had it appeared to him as a catlike female creature and to glanthon as a faceless human less than a mile away the lioness galloped through the tall monoliths and cedar trees ahead was her quarrya pair of glimmering green lights flying at saddle height above the ground some of her warriors were strung out behind her trying to keep up others had split off in smaller bands to chase different lights she was convinced these lights were flesh and blood riders carrying hooded lanterns to lure the elves into an ambush that must have been what happened to her missing warriors a local tribe of humans was playing a deadly game and she intended to put a stop to it tonight the twin green lights slowed she reined back not wanting to rush into a prepared trap and waited for the soldiers trailing her once they caught up she directed them to ride out wide on either side then sent her horse ambling forward the green glimmers retreated keeping the distance between themselves and her always the same as she emerged from a copse of juniper trees she glimpsed dark shapes close to the two lights triumph sang through the lioness she was right there were people out there she secured the reins to the pommel of her saddle and braced her bow in seconds shed sent an arrow speeding toward the righthand light the missile flew true the light shook violently then was still the lefthand light moved off swiftly leaving its comrade behind crowing with satisfaction she loosed her reins and cantered forward her arrow was embedded in the trunk of a thin tree and one of the lights was impaled on the shaft the fistsized green glow was fading fast by the time shed freed the arrow and brought it close enough to study the light was gone her gloved hands felt nothing foreign on the shaft shouts from flanking riders told her the other light had been found she rode toward them a curving expanse of gray wall loomed a band of mounted elves waited beside it kerian spotted glanthon in the group she hailed him how was your crawl underground she asked like a sorcerers nightmare general but right now we seem to have an intruder trapped he gestured at the wall behind them massively thick its top was at eye level to the mounted elves no structures showed beyond it kerian shook her feet free of the stirrups crouching on her saddle she sprang atop the wall glanthon and eight other elves joined her on the broad stone barrier the wall was a perfect circle enclosing a paved area forty yards across in the center of the pavement was a raised platform ten yards across and four feet high great wedges of gray stone had been fitted together to make the round platform drifting over it like leaves wafting on an autumn breeze were four glittering lights one each of green red yellow and blue kerian dropped to the pavement inside the wall our quarry has slipped away and left these willothewisps to keep us busy she said i intend to take one back to study wait we dont know what they are glanthon warned gathering himself to leap down and follow her she told him to stay where he was and kept going when she neared the center of the platform the lights abandoned their aimless paths and began to circle her faster and faster they whirled in evertightening circles remembering how the sand beast had disappeared when the lights touched it kerian didnt wait for the inevitable she threw herself flat on her stomach the lights crashed together above her and vanished in a silent burst of greenish light by the time glanthon and the others arrived she was sitting up well thats one mystery solved she said accepting glanthons hand to help her stand the lioness thought it likely the lights were responsible for the mysterious disappearances among her warriors where the elves had been taken and why remained unknown however and she couldnt risk searching any further were getting out of this valley now the ride to khurikhan would become legend after prince shobbats messenger departed adalas people hurriedly broke camp and began the journey south to the city of the great khan clouds rarely seen over the high desert blew in from the sea piling up like brilliant white dunes in the sky the heat of the wasteland caused the clouds to writhe and twist forming fantastic patterns of light and shadow on the ground below shade was an experience few nomads ever had while crossing the burning sands they rode with faces turned skyward watching the spectacle with a mixture of fascination awe and not a little fear adala swayed across the winddriven wastes on the back of stolid faithful little thorn dozing when the glare of the sun became too intense the frowning clouds were to her a portent of things to come she saw in them the boiling anger and pride of the laddad rising from their squatters camp to try to frighten the children of the desert and turn them away from their holy purpose like the masses of clouds the bluster of the laddad was impressive to behold but without substance two days away from the valley of the blue sands just after sunrise scouts brought word that a large mounted force was approaching from the west alarmed the desert warriors unslung their bows and shields forming themselves to receive an attack adalas warmasters and clan chiefs gathered around her drawn swords resting on their shoulders wapah seated behind bilath speculated that the laddad had heard of the weyalu approach and come out from khurikhan to meet them away from their vulnerable camp ten thousand pardons o weyadan said one of the scouts those coming toward us are not laddad but men bilath shifted in his saddle soldiers of sahimkhan they bear the banner of a scorpion on a field of yellow with three notches in the winds edge the standard of the mikku wapah supplied he was widely traveled and knew the standard of every tribe and clan the mikku were far from their usual range but they were nomads too brothers of the weyalu the khur the tondoon and the rest zaralan chief of the black horse clan voiced the prevailing opinion when he said theyre invading our territory well stand them off vowed bindas young and hot tempered no we are not here to shed the blood of our own said adala she addressed the scouts how far away are they four miles when we first saw them less by now maita she lifted a mostly empty waterskin and wrung a warm trickle into her mouth their time at the valley of the blue sands had left the weyalu short of water adala most of all i will meet them she said the chiefs protested vigorously if the mikku had come to fight the weyadan could be captured or killed before the rest of her host could defend her she shrugged off all their arguments brothers or enemies the mikku will not raise a hand i against me out of respect they did not contradict her zaralan suggested she take an escort for protection even a small escort would be better than none adala smiled a little i choose wapah the garrulous philosopher who even then was explaining in hushed tones the habits of dress and dining of the mikku tribe to the clan chiefs beside him heard his name and broke off his monologue weyadan you want me yes cousin ride with me to meet the mikku this was not what zaralan had in mind he said as much assuring wapah he meant no disrespect no need to abase yourself said wapah as he guided his horse through the ranks of clan chiefs and warmasters i pledge my life to protect the weyadans he positioned his horse alongside little thorn adala noted the tears in his hat brim made by laddad arrows and frowned poor wapah unmarried and without mother or sisters had no one to mend his clothes remind me to sew those up for you she said flicking a hand at his hat brim by her order the nomad host was to remain hidden on the northern side of a high dune so their great numbers would not startle the oncoming mikku bowing to the wisdom of her logic the warmasters rode back to their warriors the clan chiefs remained i dont like this bindas said the mikku know the law of the desert they should not enter our land unbidden honored chief be of strong heart whatever their purpose the mikku are just like us the desert lives in their souls and those on high speak to their hearts believe in my maita it leads me to a more distant place than this so saying adala tapped little thorns flank with a cane switch ears flapping the donkey shuffled over the crest of the dune with wapah riding close behind bindas turned to bilath zaralan and the other chiefs who had known adala longer does this woman think she holds fate in her hands he said permit me to say chief bindas you have it backward it is not adala weyadan who holds fate but fate which holds adala it was eloquence worthy of wapah but the words came from bilath brother of adalas slain husband adala and wapah soon saw lines of darkly dressed mikku riding across the sunbaked plain unlike the northern nomads who rode in loose timetested formations the mikku were deployed cavalryfashion in four exact lines each a double horselength apart they wore a great deal of metal armor signs of the favor shown them by the khan wapah watched their slow steady progress through the shimmering morning haze early sunlight flashing off their brass and iron equipment he commented on how heavy and hot their armor must be when we reach the city you may wish you were so burdened adala answered she knew the laddad and sahimkhans soldiers wore even more armor as a matter of course between the lonely pair and the several hundred horsemen was a long flat expanse swept by hot wind from the south adala tightened little thorns reins halting him on the lip of the sandy ridge above the plain wapah drew up beside her lets wait here folding his hands across the pommel of his saddle wapah nodded his pale eyes flicking skyward briefly it is a good day he said even this early the heat was devastating both of them had pulled the loosely woven dust veils over their faces to protect their eyes from the parched south wind the strange clouds towered above the land rising so high their undersides were gray from lack of sunlight while their tops were tinted orange by the dawn yet wapah wasnt referring to the weather he spoke of the feel of the day and his joy in their holy purpose adalas maita was running high the broader world soon would feel its power they had been seen the mikku halted studied the two mounted figures poised above them on the ridge then came on four lines of horsemen became two as the mikku spread themselves wide fifty yards away they halted so many swords to take one man one horse one woman and a donkey adala said what are they afraid of the philosopher at her side said we all fear something those who wield swords are often the most frightened of all nine riders from the center of the mikku formation continued forward while the remainder waited the nine found their imposing display bedeviled by the loose sand on the face of the ridge horses sank up to their hocks drawing their shod feet out with considerable effort wapah smiled the expression hidden by the dust veil covering his face as the full import of adalas logic became clear to him stopping here had given them the moral advantage of meeting the mikku on higher ground but she had foreseen a tactical purpose too the mikku lost momentum and dignity as they labored up the shifting slope twenty yards away the nine riders halted in the center was a nomad with the tallest brightest helmet the weyalu had ever seen golden horns sprouted from the polished steel brow curving up and back like a desert antelopes from their tips fluttered squares of shiny gold silk the sides and rear of the helmet were protected by heavy curtains of mail i am shaccan warmaster of the mikku said the warrior in the horned helmet who are you before speaking wapah glanced at his leader adala had shifted her dust veil exposing her fiery eyes to the mikku she nodded slightly at wapah greetings brothers of the desert peace to you and all your kin he called then introduced himself and adala are you alone weyalu shaccan asked those who believe are never alone adala replied is this not so the warmaster plainly did not like having his question answered with a question gruffly he said we were told the weyalu had left their range is that so we went to the valley of the blue sands but we have returned why are you here with the weyalu gone we ride for kortal to hire as caravan escorts you cannot wapah flinched at the impoliteness of adalas abrupt command shaccans thick eyebrows rose by what right do you stop us woman adala lifted her eyes to the sky i claim the right of divine maita those on high have chosen me to lead all the people of the desert to khurikhan to cleanse our land of foreign corruption you may join us after a moment of stunned silence shaccan put back his head and laughed he laughed so long and hard tears streaked his cheeks youre either mad or the greatest woman in khur he said dabbing at his eyes i like you are you married for the first time in many years adala was nonplussed as she regained her composure and admitted being a widow six of shaccans men surrounded her and wapah and the other two rode off to confirm the presence of the rest of the weyalu tribe shaccan grinned i thought this was going to be a dull journey when i heard the weyalu had gone i thought it must be because of plague or war now you speak of gods and corruption and maita youve been out in the sun too long stand aside it would be bad luck for me to harm one so insane adala didnt move were bound for khurikhan join us or share in the infamy of betraying your nation his affable manner evaporated youre in our hands now dont make trouble or there will be bloodshed the whole of the mikku are at my back you would take up arms against your sisters and brothers of the desert anyone who threatens the mikku is no brotheror sisterof mine a peal of thunder startled the horses wapah looked up the clouds had become heavy and dark lightning flickered among them he was past fifty and had seen rain only once before in his life during a visit to delphon twentytwo years ago adala paid no heed to the gathering storm i am chosen by those on high to do what must be done shaccan of the mikku i cannot refuse nor can you oppose me without risking the wrath of the gods this is my maita youre mad as a mouse shaccan ordered his warriors to take adala in hand hardly had the words left his lips than a tremendously loud burst of thunder broke over them horses shied and bucked and the men struggled to keep their animals calm only little thorn his eyes protected from sand and sun by an embroidered cowl stood placidly rain began to fall the fat droplets sending up tiny puffs of dust when they hit the ground the mikku young men all had never seen rain before they began muttering among themselves when he heard them use the word maita shaccan angrily drew his sword idiots does a madwoman make the rain seize her immediately wind swept over them driving warm rain into their faces wapah turned his horses head away from the gusts mikku thinking he was trying to flee thrust his sword at wapah it would have pierced his side had not adala intervened she caught the blade in her hand and shoved angry at being thwarted the mikku jerked his sword back laying open adalas palm she hissed in pain outraged wapah yelled he pulled out a scarf and tied it tightly around her injured hand the rain fell even more heavily lightning flashed and thunder boomed directly overhead blinding flash and earsplitting noise coming almost simultaneously this was too much for the mikkus horses the animals reared and fled taking their riders back down the slope to the main body of warriors only shaccan remained his horned helmet gleaming dully in the gray light filtering through the thick clouds he glared at the pair before him widow or not your life is over he cried here is your maita he raised his blade high to cleave the impassive adala from head to waist no sooner had the sword reached its apex than another bolt of lightning sliced down from the sky it struck the mikkus sword searing down the steel blade and the warmasters arm the blast knocked everyone down adala hit the sand and rolled to avoid being crushed by her falling donkey when her head cleared she crawled up the slope to wapah he was dazed but uninjured where shaccan had been was now a smoking pit in the sand adala crawled to its edge and looked down what she found was ghastly horse and man were dead horribly burned most of shaccans sword had melted and run down his arm like candle wax his flesh inside his armor was charred black his helmet was gone for which adala was profoundly sorry as it left bare the unbelievable ruin that had been his face she looked away from the grotesque visage and noticed the sand around shaccan had changed no longer filled with loose pale grains the crater in which he lay resembled a bowl of crude glass bluegreen in color adala immediately was reminded of the hidden valley did its soils bluegreen tint come from the same source the fire from heaven raindrops sizzled and hissed into steam when they hit the blasted corpse and glassy crater the other mikku gathered slowly dismounting and staring down into the crater so great was the terror on their faces as they regarded adala wapah was certain they would slay her forthwith disregarding the deeply ingrained stricture against touching the weyadan he crawled frantically to her and flung his body over hers away with all of you lest those on high strike you down as well he shouted at the swordwielding mikku wapah had misread the warriors they had no intention of lifting their weapons against adala instead all fell on their knees calling to her to forgive them pledging to serve her affirming their belief in the power of those on high adala tried to rise as she shifted beneath him wapah flushed in embarrassment and moved swiftly off she sat up straightening her black robes on her feet again she looked around at the kneeling mikku will you believe in my maita she asked them will you follow where i lead and fight only for the purity of khur to a man they vowed they would wapah went to round up his mount and adalas donkey the rain was easing and as wapah returned it ceased altogether he brought with him more than their mounts shaccans helmet was cradled in his arm the tall golden horned helm had been flung many yards away it appeared completely untouched by the lightning that had so utterly destroyed its owner while wapah was marveling over this and admiring the shining craftsmanship of the helmet the scouts shaccan had dispatched over the ridge came galloping back they were pursued by weyalu riders adala leading little thorn went to intercede mikku and weyalu drew apart as the weyadan stood between them judgment has been rendered upon shaccan she declared the mikku have chosen to join us the warriors who already had pledged themselves to adalas cause related the momentous events to their brethren the scouts could hardly credit the tale but the steaming crater and their dead warmaster brooked no argument the weyalu raised a cheer and the mikku joined in adala acknowledged their support with a nod then asked wapah for his arm he aided her in climbing back onto little thorn her face and hands were pink with flash burn while her eyebrows and eyelashes were completely gone concerned he asked if she was well the clouds had broken allowing shafts of morning sunlight to slice through the southern plain was dappled with these columns of golden light steam rose from the drying sand adala stared out at the view and said only your hat is in sad shape cousin take it off and ill sew the tears quickly before the sun returns and she did a healer salved and bandaged her injured hand then adala worked steadily on the torn hat as she and wapah rode down the ridge the weyalu streamed after them the mikku watched in awe until they fell in at the rear of the formation word of shaccans demise spread and more and more of the mikku joined the procession the ranks of adalas band had swelled from five hundred to more than five thousand chapter when the sun rose on khurikhan the city gates opened as the khan had promised however the soldiers on the western portal having lifted the iron portcullises and swung the great wooden doors inward gaped in consternation at what they faced on the other side the road dusty and sandscoured sloped away from malyss anvil to the outer ring of elf tents many of these had been torn down during the recent rioting but beyond them was the vast elven encampment elves stirred like hornets around a disturbed nest gathered on the road facing khurikhan were ten thousand elf lancers and archers in wellused armor the khurish soldiers had fought a bloody skirmish with wild fanatics the evening before and now they stared across forty yards of desert at ranks of elven cavalry poised to strike for a long time neither side moved the sun lifted itself above the khurman sea lofty bales of clouds blown in from the sea maneuvered silently overhead covering the ground with strange evermoving shadows word of the massed elven cavalry reached the khuri yl nor and sahimkhan dispatched general hakkam to find out the laddads intentions lord morillons warning about the elves storming the city was on everyones mind and no ones lips hakkam who as a boy had been shieldbearer to sahims father was a burly impatient man his armor was too tight and it chafed him unmercifully at the neck and waist he was constantly being given impossible or contradictory tasks by sahimkhan then receiving his masters ire when things did not turn out as he desired because of this hakkam was in a perpetually bad mood facing the city wall with the morning sun in their eyes the elves were hardly in better temper taranath commanded the ten thousand riders sorted into squadrons of fifty as in the old silvanesti army under their battered helmets and sunbleached mantles they were lean spare and ready to ride at any enemy they were commanded to destroy word flashed back to the speaker that the gates had opened throwing on an old robe of white silk with most of the gold embroidery torn out for it was too valuable to leave as mere decoration gilthas hurried to the eastern edge of khurinost with planchet at his heels no word from lord morillon or captain ambrodel gilthas asked planchet shook his head no sire they may not have been able to reach us while the gates were closed the unexplained disappearance of one of the speakers councilors had only increased the tensions in the elven camp gilthas knew it would take very little for a confrontation to explode the sight of numerous khurish guards on the city gate was just the spark this volatile situation did not need they reached the closely packed ranks of riders and planchet bawled make way for the speaker make way the riders chivvied their mounts to one side or the other to allow the speaker to walk between them hair in disarray sweat beading under his hollow eyes the speaker of the sun and stars made straight for the front line when the last line of riders broke ranks for him he found himself standing on the rubblestone road before the city wall khurish pot helmets were thick on the battlements as gilthas looked on their numbers increased has anyone come out or spoken to you he asked the nearest rider no one great speaker worried by his councilors absence gilthas was nevertheless pleased to see the gate open perhaps morillon had succeeded perhaps he would be coming out at any moment unless the khan had opened the portal for his own possibly nefarious reasons what do you make of this planchet studied the city wall left and right before answering they look as surprised to see us as we are to see them gilthas agreed if sahimkhan meant to attack his troops would have rushed out immediately not gathered on the walls and gawked for half an hour find me a herald he said lets see if we cant find out whats happening without bloodshed planchet offered to go himself and gilthas agreed planchets face was known to the khurs and he carried the weight of the speakers favor he was wearing a native geb perfect attire for the task no sense appearing as a warrior when a diplomat was needed a scrap of cloth tied to a lance made a serviceable white banner once planchet was mounted gilthas took hold of his horses halter find out their intentions and stress that ours are peaceful he said make certain our people still have access to the citys wells already the grip of thirst was on the tent city dont mention morillonnot just yet planchet nodded and started up the sloping road at a slow trot wind hissed over the northern dunes as he reached the place where the road leveled out he halted his horse the clouds parted and a beam of sunlight fell on him gilthas was cheered it was a good omen the mounted elf waited exposed and alone until the khurs sent out riders of their own after five long minutes a quintet of armored soldiers came out the gate a scarlet and gold pennant flew from one riders stirruppost the khurs approached slowly as though wary of treachery at one point planchet waved a biting fly away from his face and the khurs froze he realized they were very frightened in the center of the quintet flanked by imposing cavalry men rode a squat human with a thick neck and a beetred face as the khurs drew nearer planchet recognized him hail general hakkam he called peace be with you and with you planchet of qualinost rumbled the choleric general what in kargaths name goes on here i was about to ask you the same question the city gates have been closed to us since yesterday afternoon our only supply of water is what we carry from khurikhans wells we were beginning to get thirsty is that why you called out your army why else gangs have been assaulting us for the past two days general tents have been burned and our people beaten some quite badly we didnt know what might come forth next from the city the sons of the crimson vulture have caused much trouble for you and for the mighty sahimkhan consequently many of them have been sent to meet their ancestors then the city is open to us i have no orders otherwise a fresh gust smelling of the sea swept over the parley planchets truce banner snapped in the wind twisting in the saddle he raised the banner high and waved it at the horde of elven warriors who watched in silent concern when planchet turned back hakkam and his escort had their hands on their sword hilts i was merely alerting our soldiers that all was well planchet said mildly whos that coming two elven riders emerged from the line of heavy cavalry and cantered to where planchet and hakkam waited it didnt take long to recognize the speaker and a single escorting warrior general taranath when they arrived planchet explained the situation thank you general the speaker said to hakkam he extended a lean hand your duty has been well served with little enthusiasm the general shook the speakers hand gilthas assured him he would withdraw his warriors then added one other matter my councilor lord morillon did not return last night is he inside the city he had an audience with sahimkhan then left the palace is he well hakkam frowned how would i know he left the palace thats all i know with a curt nod hakkam turned his horse around planchet was aghast at the humans rudeness turning his back on a reigning speaker without so much as a byyour leave the shaft of sunlight so long shining on planchet and gilthas at last faded gilthas looked up at the roiling clouds he frowned a slender object dark against the sky seemed to hang in the air over the city no not hang it was moving falling arrow planchet shouted he threw himself in front of the speaker but the missile was plummeting from such a height its path was almost straight down the broadhead cut gilthass jaw and struck him in the hollow of the neck on the right side pandemonium erupted gilthas was saved from hitting the ground by taranath who caught him by the shoulders and bore him up hakkams guards drew swords whirling their horses in tight circles to see who had loosed the arrow a shout went up from the front rank of elven warriors they had seen the arrows fall and its awful termination the shout was followed by a hedge of swords sprouting along the line in ragged order for the rear ranks did not yet know what had happened the elves charged up the hill to their monarchs defense the thunder of the oncoming elves sent hakkams escort spurring for the city the thicknecked general roared come back you wretches stand your ground one halted the rest made straight for the city gate now swinging shut what treachery is this planchet cried kicking his feet free of the stirrups and leaping from his horse the speaker had collapsed over his horses neck it is not by my order hakkam retorted also dismounting he and planchet took the speaker from his horse and j lowered him gently to the road the arrow was still embedded in gilthass neck that did not come from my men said hakkam its not a khurish war arrow what is it then planchet demanded a hunting arrow my men arent issued such it was fortunate for gilthas the missile wasnt a war arrow stoutly shafted with a square or triangular iron head and leather fletching a war arrow would have driven deep into the elfs slender body the hunting missile lightly made with a flat broadhead and white pigeonfeather fletching had struck gilthass collar bone and stopped the wound was nasty but with prompt care it would not be fatal a wave of shouting elf warriors galloped by the figures kneeling on the road a handful halted but most kept going charging the city gate their angry shouts reached the weakened gilthas from somewhere deep within himself he tapped an unknown source of strength face white he struggled to rise planchet holding him down begged him to be still stop it gilthas said through clenched teeth thinking he was hurting the speaker planchet felt tears come to his eyes he whispered im sorry sire but you must be still please dont move no planchet stop the warriors dont let them fight i command it taranath heard the speakers order he snatched a trumpet from his saddle and blew recall he had to repeat it four times before all the hardriding warriors heard and heeded the foremost ground to a halt only yards from the city wall in between trumpet blasts hakkam was shouting at his own soldiers hold if any man looses an arrow ill have his head he roared none of the khurish soldiers loosed arrows or threw spears at the elves men and elves looked at each other in mutual confusion and alarm until the elves turned and galloped back to taranath healers from khurinost hastened through the press of warriors when they arrived the speaker was sitting up head bowed his white geb covered with a spreading crimson stain the first healer to reach him was a kagonesti with callused hands and dark tattoos on her face and arms arrows got to come out she said immediately planchet nodded once face grim ill do it someone must hold him still if he moves too much he could rupture an artery hakkam nearest knelt behind the speaker and gripped his shoulders ive got him the elves were nonplussed but the speaker murmured thank you general eyes flickering to planchets pale face he whispered proceed my friend the valet wrapped his fingers around the bloodslick arrow shaft and whispered forgive me with a single mighty pull he freed the arrow the kagonesti healer immediately sprinkled the wound with clotting powder and bound it tightly with linen too late she realized shed not offered the speaker a leather pad to bite she apologized but he didnt respond hes passed out she said gilthas raised his head not yet he smiled weakly at planchet wouldnt she be proud of me i didnt faint planchet understood who she was he managed to return the brave smile yes sire yes she would a litter was improvised and the speaker of the sun and stars carefully laid upon it four warriors hoisted the corners and headed back to khurinost leaving planchet and hakkam where they were taranath disperse the warriors planchet said the general began to protest but planchet cut him off maintain your patrols but stand down the cavalry taranath saluted and rode away as the elves cavalry began to disperse planchet handed hakkam the bloody arrow this archer is khurs enemy as much as ours the elf said hakkam gripped the arrow tightly never fear ill see this returned to its owner his meaning was abundantly clear the arrow would likely be returned point first on a rooftop three miles away prince shobbat lowered his bow he could hardly believe his miraculous aim no one could loft an arrow from so far much less hit their intended target impossible he whispered magic is the art of the impossible replied the ragged hooded figure behind him the lioness withdrew her shrinking command across the creek favaronas had given her name and they camped for the night tomorrow they would depart inathwakenti forever she hoped there were too many unknowns here no animals except those that seemed to vanish in front of them strangely powerful lights and unaccountable disappearances this valley was no sanctuary for their exiled people gilthas would have to understand that the ride back to the creek under a milky canopy of stars and clouds was an eerie one no crickets whirred in the underbrush no whippoorwills or nightjars called from the trees no frogs galumphed from the creeks there was only the soft clopclop of their horses hooves the more nervous among the warriors were for going on not camping but it was well past midnight and both horses and riders were tired better to start at dawn especially if they might have to fight their way out through khurish nomads kerian felt it was safe enough to camp once they were beyond the stream the massive stone ruins halted well short of the creek and the weird phenomena had occurred only after theyd crossed the creek coming in they pitched a bivouac on the south bank picketing the horses and dropping down to sleep on bedrolls without putting up tents before turning in kerian toured the camp she saw favaronas had built a small fire the only one in camp and sat hunched before it on his lap was one of the stone cylinders he and glanthon had found in the tunnel glanthon had told her of that strange expedition but learning what favaronas was doing with his prize could wait till morning she was asleep on her feet after a few words with the elves whod drawn first watch she unrolled her blanket beneath a juniper tree and lay down in moments she was asleep kerianseray did not dream much at least she didnt usually remember any dreams she might have her nights usually were battles between uneasy alertness and total exhaustion with exhaustion often the victor shed once told gilthas that living on the run from the order had taught her to sleep with one eye open he thought she was joking but her old comrades could attest that the lioness slept with one eyelid cracked open balanced on the daggers edge between sleep and wakefulness this was not the case tonight kerian fell deeply asleep then she began to dream vividly she was in a forest a dense woodland green and cool moss was thick underfoot and gentle sunlight filtered through the canopy of leaves the air was wondrous full of the scents of growing things a faint breeze teased her face reaching out she felt the suppleness of the leaves they were ash leaves slender and pointed kerian was in a forest of ash like the wild land along the silvanesti border into this idyllic setting came two figures one was a goblin with along beaky nose pointed chin and sallow graygreen complexion the other she glimpsed only briefly through the foliage but he appeared to be a silvanesti elf dressed in a silky green robe more suited to a city street than the deep forest the goblin said theys a nest in this one are you sure asked his companion oh aye i seen it come out last evning with the illogical logic of dreams kerian was no longer standing in the forest but was tucked into a hollow tree she didnt mind the tight confines this was home its walls were smooth and smelled strongly of musk an opening overhead led outside as did the hole in front of her home trembled the goblins face appeared in the hole he grinned showing crooked yellow teeth careful said the elf below him i dont want it damaged the goblins face went away from the hole and he reached one arm in long spidery fingers coming for kerians throat she didnt wait to be caught swift as a striking viper she uncoiled and sprang at the intruder she was slender no more than two feet long but her claws and teeth were sharp they tore into the goblins cheek and left eye with a shriek he fell backward taking kerian with him they crashed to the ground he jerked her loose and flung her hard against the trunk of her pine tree home she lay on her back stunned four paws in the air the goblin would have killed her then while she was helpless to defend herself he lifted his hatchet high but a hand grabbed his wrist from behind thats not what im paying you for it was the elf he had a long face a sharp chin and hazel eyes a robe of pale green silk hung in pleated folds from his narrow shoulders his blond hair was cut in an antique bowlshaped style his hands were large for an elf with long fingers and knobby knuckles look what it did to me screeched the goblin blood ran from his ruined eye and cheek the elf merely took a small bag from his waist and shook it the jangle of coins was unmistakable he counted thirty steel pieces into the goblins hand the goblin seized kerian by the throat and thrust her into a dirty burlap bag the effects of the blow were wearing off and she might have chewed her way out of the sack but she didnt the elf and goblin were talking about her and the elf gave her a name marten with the word came a rush of memories covered in brown fur with a white neck and chest she was more agile than a squirrel swifter than lightning she leaped from branch to branch climbed up and down rough barked trees lay in wait among green boughs for an unwary squirrel a dash a pounce teeth sinking into the rodents throat blood delicious warm she prowled the treetops despoiling nests for eggs or hatchlings and venturing to the ground to penetrate burrows in search of rabbits she was mistress of the twilight woods not even the panther or the bear could compete with her in ferocity in kills kerianseray knew she was dreaming but it was all so rich and real her own memories seemed to melt into those of the marten in the strange way of dreams time began to telescope passing rapidly yet with no sensation of speed the silvanesti was a mage hed been slaving for decades on a procedure that would transform a wild marten into a semblance of himself he took the marten bitch to his hut on the edge of the forest and began the lengthy laborious process it seemed to go well the marten became a young girl flawlessly elven in appearance with hazel eyes and sable hair he taught her civilized ways but she never quite lost her predatory instincts or animal appetites these he indulged he learned much from her associations with naturallyborn elves and humans in her twentieth year she began to change her pure silvanesti features softened and thickened giving her the look of a halfelf when fur reappeared on her legs the mage knew the transformation had failed again so many times he had performed the spell trying to find the perfect conjuration but every one had failed sooner or later one night soldiers from house protector came and arrested the mage kerian found herself chained in a deep dungeon in the heart of silvanost there she met others like herself creatures whose elven veneer had decayed but although the mages conjuration didnt make them fully elven it kept them from returning fully to their animal state such creatures could not be allowed to remain in silvanesti so they were exiled closed wagons transported them far from the land of their birth to the silent vale where the halfcreatures were turned loose to fend for themselves the night sky above kerians new home contained three moonsone white one blood red and a third black moon she knew twofooters couldnt see with their feeble eyes but she could see it she also could see something falling from the dark moon just as she recognized it as an arrow it struck the base of her neck she was knocked to the ground blood welled from her throat what treachery is this cried a faroff voice then a multitude shouted the speaker the speaker has been attacked she jerked awake she was lying on her bedroll and the night sky above her was the one she recognized she was kerianseray wilder elf warrior wife of gilthas not some halfanimal abomination rolling to her feet she caught sight of favaronas his back to her he squatted at the waters edge a few yards away sipping from his cupped hands she rose and called his name he almost fell headfirst into the creek she covered the distance between them in two long strides snagged the back of his robe and pulled him to his feet favaronas i had a terrible dream she said more than that a premonition he was taken aback the eversensible lioness talking of premonitions the earlier part of her dream of being an animal made to look like an elf was fading into a confusing jumble of sensations kerian skipped that part describing only the end the terrifyingly clear vision shed had of gilthas being hit with an arrow favaronas who had read much about historical presentiments of disaster didnt think such things occurred nowadays doubt was plain on his face it happened she insisted or will happen i dont know which but i felt it so what will you do she raked her fingers through her matted sweatsoaked hair what could she do gilthas was her beloved husband even more than that he was her speaker the king she had pledged to serve and defend she wanted to fly to him to make certain he was all right fly eagle eye he can get me to khurinost in half a day the griffon was tethered twenty yards from the horses further along on the path back to the mouth of the valley kerian turned to race off in that direction favaronas caught her arm general you cant abandon your warriors in the middle of the night because of a dream she jerked her arm free and glared at him but she knew he was right equally right was her conviction that gilthas was grievously wounded perhaps even dying while they stood here debating a difficult quandary but the lioness was not known for being indecisive rouse the camp she said wake everyone favaronas hurried away calling out to sleeping warriors shaking their shoulders kerian did likewise in minutes the entire band was awake if not completely alert glanthon hair askew rubbed his eyes and asked has something happened yes i must return to khurinost at once ill have the riders mount up theres no time struggling for calm she said i go alone on eagle eye the rest of you will proceed to khurinost without me she explained her dream to them as she had to favaronas her warriors knew her to be pragmatic not given to flights of fancy if the lioness believed shed been granted a premonition about the speaker they didnt question her conviction they were however plainly disconcerted by the content of her dream and that she was leaving them she gripped glanthons shoulder i have no choice youll be fine avoid the high plateau take the easier route down the caravan trail from kortal on the return journey they had less to fear from spies still she cautioned tell no one where youve been to favaronas she said if i could i would take you with me but eagle eye wont tolerate anyone else on his back he assured her he was not offended at being left behind it was vital that he get his manuscripts notes and the odd stone cylinders home intact he certainly couldnt have carried them all while hurtling across the sky on griffonback kerian was not one to waste time she filled two water skins in the creek took up a haversack with a bit of food and said goodbye to all the dazed warriors drew themselves up and saluted their leader before jogging up the trail to eagle eye she repeated her injunction to glanthon that he and the rest were to get themselves home safely if they were confronted by nomads they were to try to slip away without fighting and when you get back ill buy nectar for everyone she called and then she was gone favaronas and glanthon stood side by side watching long after she was swallowed by the darkness the warrior was muttering to himself speculating about the possibility of a nomad trick or weird dreams generated by the forces at work in the valley this feels wrong he said favaronas was thinking the same thing but they heard the cry of the airborne griffon and knew it was too late for misgivings word raced through the streets of khurikhan that the laddad king had been wounded some said killed the elves had withdrawn their soldiers but for how long blood was sure to flow opinion was divided as to who should bear the blame many khurs believed the sons of the crimson vulture had tried to assassinate the speaker others thought sahimkhan was involved sahim had his own theory the city gates cleared by his soldiers were kept open by entire companies of royal guards the khuri yl nor was sealed tight as a tomb alarm flags were hoisted all over the city recalling all soldiers to duty general hakkam brought the arrow still stained with the speakers blood to the palace and every bowyer and fletcher in the city was summoned if the arrows maker could be found its owner soon would be known in the norkhan behind the thickest walls in khur sahimkhan raged how had this come about who was trying to foment war with the laddad his favorite suspects were the torghanists whom he castigated as insolent ignorant savages his captains kept close around him his current wife sat in her place behind the sapphire throne huddled around her were the khans seven youngest children frightened but silent off to one side prince shobbat leaned one hip on a sideboard idly eating grapes from a silver bowl zunda who in moments of stress could speak as succinctly as any man said an emissary must go to the laddad with assurances of the mighty khans goodwill ill show them goodwill ill decorate the city battlements with the corpse of every man who bears a red tattoo mighty khan the situation may not call for such measures you go to the laddad zunda take saida and all priestesses of elirsana if the speaker can be saved holy saida can do it the old vizier bowed and obeyed any other action just now likely would cost him his head once the vizier had departed sahim summoned one of his captains a lean and wolfish fellow named vatan collect a hundred men and go to the temple of torghan sahim said arrest everyonepriests acolytes servants all of them if you find minok slay the wretch where he stands he turned away then paused a better idea coming to him no vatan bring minok to me alive his people might behave better if i hold their leader ill question him personally and well learn who else is part of this conspiracy vatan departed for the first time since summoning this emergency assembly sahim sat dropping heavily onto the throne his sunyellow robes billowed around him he spied hengriff on the periphery of the crowd and waved the knight forward hengriffs natural impassivity had been perfected by his time in khur when sahim asked his opinion of the orders just given hengriff did not say i think you a crude and brutal fool but replied blandly the mighty khan thinks swiftly and acts even faster sahim smiled i had good teachers what does your order do with rebels hang the unrepentant and subvert the rest is our custom the better policy would be to hang them all hengriff took sahims bloodthirsty admonition with outward good grace the time had come for him to put into action a bold plan he lifted the leather dispatch case in his hand and announced he had a confidential message from his order in a better mood for having set zunda and vatan to their respective tasks sahim dismissed his frightened family his captains and his fawning courtiers only a handful of his personal guard remained prince shobbat was among the last to leave tossing aside an empty grape stem before going out the double doors so what does the lord of the night have to say after weeks of hearing nothing from the order hengriff had decided on a dangerous deception he had forged a set of instructions ostensibly from rennold to himself if he guessed right all would be well if he chose a faulty course his head would certainly be forfeit his masters might forgive failure but not one committed in their own names he opened the leather flap and pulled out a sheaf of papers he made a show of glancing over the papers before clearing his throat and booming to his mightiness sahim khan of all the khurs greetings a loud noise halted hengriffs recitation shobbat suddenly reentered the hall at the head of twenty guards whats the meaning of this sahim demanded are the laddad i have news mighty khan i have learned the identity of the traitor in our city the author of all our troubles the one who conspired to slay the king of the laddad pleased sahim said excellent my son excellent who is it shobbat advanced until he was standing abreast of the dark knight the soldiers halted two steps behind the prince the traitor sire is lord hengriff for a moment no one moved no one seemed even to breathe brief as a heartbeat as long as forever then nearly everyone was in motion the papers fell from hengriffs hand the khans eight guards drew swords and rushed at him so did shobbats escort because he was at court hengriff was armed only with a dagger but he drew it without hesitation and lunged at shobbat the prince backed away groping for his own blade only the khan was still he sat on his golden throne watching hengriff slashed overhand at shobbat the prince clumsily warded off the strike his feet slipping on the polished floor much white showed around his eyes the soldiers who would have intervened were waved off by sahim he wanted to see how his son would fare against the formidable hengriff the answer was he quickly realized not well shobbat was no duelist his father a redoubtable warrior in his own right had required him to serve eight years in the army of khur shobbat spent the time learning archery and dice not swordplay the knight made a series of wide circular cuts shobbat backed away until his heel caught the hem of his robe he fell the knight stood over him sneering even this you bungle he said a sword point bright with blood suddenly protruded from his chest hengriffs sneer froze he looked back at the guard whod stabbed him now shobbat cried everyone strike home the guard withdrew his blade in spite of his wound hengriff whirled flinging his dispatch case at the mans face but nine more blades thrust home the knight thrust his dagger into the belly of another guard and wrenched the sword from his hand at last hengriff had a real weapon he caught two blades in a bind and whipped them aside thrusting he took the closest khur in the throat the man went down a blade passed under hengriffs outthrust arm cutting deeply into his armpit cursing the pain he recovered and slashed at the guard whod cut him severing the mans jaw from the rest of his face the knight avoided cuts and stabs from three sides as the khurs tried to hem him in he dispatched a fourth attacker when the man lunged too far and hengriff caught him by the wrist bringing his blade down he all but severed the mans arm at the elbow the guard dropped to the floor screaming and clutching his savaged arm he rolled away the doors of the throne room burst open more soldiers appeared they didnt charge in but stood transfixed by the appalling scene that met their eyes teeth bared in a hiss of pain drenched in his own blood and that of his attackers the towering hengriff was the very picture of an assassin shobbat shouted at the newcomers to surround the nerakan and kill him the princes voice broke through their shock they attacked hengriff was a master warrior but there was no escape for him still he put his back to one wall and fought on two more khurs fell to his sword the tiled floor around him grew slick with blood his wounds burned and his right attn was weak from loss of blood with one particularly effective counterthrust he drove half a dozen soldiers back against that many more in this temporary lull hengriff sagged against the wall he turned his burning obsidian gaze on shobbat the prince stood next to his fathers throne both of them protected by a wall of outraged soldiers you think youve won hengriff panted his voice still deep and carrying you forget who youre dealing with youll not outlive me long traitor shobbat sneered i dont fear your order loyal khurs will protect the throne not my order fool fear the laddad paling shobbat shouted finish him like a bear bayed by a pack of wolves hengriff fought with the desperate ferocity of the doomed he maimed three more attackers before two khurs with pole arms speared him from opposite sides their surviving comrades joined in pushing the halberd shafts and hengriff was driven back against the wall and pinned there his life drained away he slumped forward still held upright by the spearpoints piercing his body his eyes glazed the sword dropped from his lifeless fingers the guards gave a victory cry they sorted themselves into proper formation before their monarch shall we take his head great khan asked one throughout the bloody battle sahimkhan had sat on his throne with apparent calm taking in every aspect of the fight he was not convinced hengriff was a traitor but this was not the place to question his sons accusation the khan rose straightened his yellow robes and stepped forward to examine the dead knight no he said drag his body to the square before the palace placard it so all will know of his treachery the soldiers dragged hengriff out by the heels and dumped him in the courtyard before the palace gate one scrounged materials to make the sign sahim required the others stared up at the sky crowded with slowmoving billowing clouds theyd never seen such a display before what does it mean asked one another secretly a worshiper of torghan said those on high are angry they would see this land purged of evil a loud gargling screech gave emphasis to the soldiers prediction it sounded like no bird known in khur deep and powerful the cry was halfway between a lions roar and an eagles scream a second screech was followed by a freshening of the wind the gust traveled through the streets of the city the soldiers at the palace could follow its progress by the dust clouds it raised they turned away and covered their faces as it whirled through the square from west to east scouring the pavement and rocking the spindly scaffolding still attached to the palace walls uprights gave way and planks tumbled then as quickly as it had come the wind was gone in khurinost the odd screeching noise drew the elves out from under the woven grass mats that shaded the encampments narrow lane unlike the khurs many elves recognized that cry it had come from a silvanesti griffon planchet emerged from the speakers tent he certainly knew the cry although he could hardly credit hearing it now its author was so high silhouetted against roiling white clouds that planchets keen eyes could not discern whether or not the griffon bore a rider across the square an elf woman tried to comfort her crying child both of them frightened by the commotion overhead planchet went and spoke kindly to her dont be afraid he said its only a griffon i thought the khurs were coming to kill us whispered the elf woman they arent our enemies planchet assured her he squeezed her hand and chucked the chin of the crying child our speaker will not allow us to come to harm the elf woman obviously had not seen gilthas carried into his tent earlier barely conscious his wound had festered and a fever had erupted in his slender frame just now he had little ability to guarantee anything but the throne of the sun and stars had a power that went far beyond the mortal elf who held it like a potent talisman against evil planchets invocation of the speakers name calmed mother and child and he was able to leave them in much better spirits he had lost sight of the griffon he hurried back to the speakers tent to tell him of the sighting in gilthass bedchamber healers courtiers and captains stood by poised to do whatever was required of them great speaker planchet said kneeling by the bed did you hear the call of the griffon blue eyes hazed by fever turned slowly to the valets face you heard it i thought i was delirious gilthas whispered no sire it was real is she here i dont know i lost sight of the creature but we will find out soon gilthas licked dry lips and planchet held a small cup of water to his mouth once gilthas had swallowed a few drops he asked about lord morillon unfortunately the silvanesti had not been found planchet was forced to report they feared the worst an elven healer bent and whispered in his ear the valet nodded sire vizier zunda has come with priestesses from the temple of elirsana holy lady saida she is said to be wise in her craft admit them planchet turned to relay the order but a bizarre interruption occurred the air suddenly rushed out of the tent drawing the roof down violently the tired canvas split opening a great rent to the sky the attendants cried out in alarm directly over the speakers tent a neat round hole had been bored through the towering clouds it looked as though a giant finger had poked through the overcast sky and into the center of khurinost a whirlwind spun down from the hole drawing streams of cloud vapor with it as it descended on the speakers tent as the wind screamed planchet shouted orders healers knelt around the speakers bed covering him with their bodies warriors formed a square facing outward with swords drawn only seconds after it was first sighted the vortex touched down on the speakers tent tearing it apart walls and ceilings collapsed elves were buried under masses of fabric i hands over their heads the speakers loyal guards kept the roof off him and the healers covering him suffocating in the thick canvas planchet could not see but only hear the chaos elves were shouting footsteps pounding carefully he thrust the tip of his sword through the canvas and made a small opening no one protested so he widened the hole my ancestors planchet breathed what is it demanded gilthas pushing away the healers covering him not what great speakerwho the lioness was bounding over the wreckage of the tent eagle eye hadnt even touched ground before she was off his back and running toward her husband she wore only the tattered remains of her smallclothes and was soaked from head to toe she cleaved through the astonished guards and healers dropped to her knees and took her husband in her arms gilthas said her name over and over as planchet propped him up from behind despite the fresh blood that seeped from his cheek and neck his voice was joyous with relief kerianseray how how in the names of all the ancient gods did you get here i flew you sent eagle eye so i returned him her voice quavered nearly as much as his all the way from the valley of the blue sands i came she eased him back against the strong shoulder of planchet an arrow she said studying his wound with a practiced eye i knew it how did you know lady kerian shook her head at planchets question never mind who did it was it khurs nerakans the valet admitted they didnt know yet with kerians help planchet settled the speaker on his bed then went to round up food and drink for her and clothes though he did not say as much to her while they were moderately private gilthas took her hand you look wonderful he whispered his tearfilled eyes looking her up and down she grimaced suddenly selfconscious we ran into a storm aloft a tornado im lucky it left me any clothing at all only the lioness could ride home on the back of a whirl wind he teased are your warriors near she shook her head embarrassment hardening into grim lines no they were just leaving inathwakenti when i had to leave them briefly for her throat was truly parched she described their experiences in the valleythe phantom lights the stone ruins the disappearance of the sand beast and many of her warriors and the utter lack of any animal life not so much as a fly lives there gil leave it to the ghosts and willothewisps during her recitation however succinct gilthas began to succumb to the effects of his wound and fever as well as the shock of her arrival he was barely conscious cant be done he murmured and she had to bend close to hear what he said next we must leave this place his eyelids closed and he slept planchet returned with a jug of palm wine in each hand the guards and servants began working to rig new supports for the tent roof kerian took a jug of wine and put it to her lips planchet informed her of the disappearance of lord morillon she replied with a flippant comment but his careworn face was very somber hes been found lady he continued in the desert outside the north city gate his throat was cut from ear to ear chapter daybreak came with the nomads nowhere in sight glanthon had riders scour the pass for signs but the weyalu appeared to be gone the pine copses and juniper thickets on the hillsides overlooking the pass were empty on the floor of the pass a distinct trail of hoofprints led due south the way out of inathwakenti was free and clear as the lioness had commanded the company of elves would bear west not south the direction from which they had come this eventually would put them on the caravan road from kortal to khurikhan since that road bypassed the cauldron of the high plateau it was a safer route in some respects but for several days they would be riding further away from their comrades in khurinost and closer to the border with neraka still glanthon agreed with his commanders reasoning that this was the best way to go feeling a bit naked without the encircling mountains trees and ghostly ruins the elves rode forth into the open desert again one of the last tasks theyd completed before leaving inathwakenti was to make a small lap table for favaronas thin planks of yellow pine were pegged together into a surface that allowed the archivist to write and read while on horseback a hole near the top center of the board fitted over his saddle pommel this stabilized the lapboard and kept it from sliding off the moving horse favaronas shortened his stirrups and balanced the lapboard across his drawn up knees in this way he could work on his report to the speaker even as they were on the move without nomads to fight glanthon soon grew bored and came back to ride alongside favaronas and distract him with a discussion of the valley glanthon believed a system of tunnels underlay the ruins he was certain the secret of the ruins lay underground had time permitted he would have sought permission from the lioness to search further in the tunnels theyd found looking for signs of their missing comrades and more evidence of previous civilizations you think our missing warriors are in the tunnels favaronas said where else glanthon reasoned with magic involved theres no limit to where they might have been taken the next valley over or even to the stars themselves favaronass testy response silenced the talkative warrior but only briefly glanthon changed the subject asking whether favaronas had learned anything about the odd stone artifacts theyd removed from the underground chamber the archivist sighed not very much he admitted each of the eight stone cylinders bore a brief inscription engraved on one side favaronas was convinced theyd once been real books but had been changed to solid stone i have deciphered the labels at least partly they are not as i first thought a forgotten dialect of old silvanesti instead each syllable is an abbreviation of a longer word or phrase the first is marked bal afomthas which means balif lord of the thonthalas and hocsemath which i believe translates as halfway between lives what does that mean i wish i knew the archivist recalled the discussion at the speakers dinner the night before theyd begun this journey the cartographer sithelbathan had said the furthest outpost of the ancient elven kingdom balifs gate was supposed to have been located in or near the valley glanthon looked over his shoulder at the three mountains torghans teeth receding behind them you think those stones are the ruins of that outpost you think silvanesti made them not necessarily the imprecision of it all plainly made the archivist unhappy but im beginning to think the valley was visited by followers of general balif probably after the first dragon war thirtyfive hundred years ago we know from ancient tradition that balif left silvanesti under a cloud or a curse and eventually helped found the kender nation of balifor some authorities claim he became a kender himself but theres no evidence for that theory he sighed many relevant records are still in the temples of silvanost closely guarded others were lost in the first cataclysm perhaps these cylinders contain the true history of balif glanthon exclaimed favaronas drew his geb close around him as if feeling a chill despite the desert heat perhaps one other possibility has occurred to me but its really too frightful to contemplate glanthon had to prompt the scholar reminding him of his duty to the speaker before he would continue even then favaronas looked around furtively making certain no one was eavesdropping do you know much about the history of our race he asked glanthons education didnt extend much beyond reading writing and simple mathematics he admitted his lack of scholarship briefly favaronas described the founding of the first elven nation under silvanos goldeneye first speaker of the stars the land claimed by the elves the land that would one day be silvanesti was then occupied by powerful dragons conflict ensued the first dragon war in which balif led his griffon riders to victory the triumph was not balifs alone the gods of magic sent a trio of mages to aid the elves the mages were armed with five powerful dragonstones balif and the mages set a trap for the dragons luring them into a final battle then capturing their souls within the dragonstones the dragons empty bodies were transformed to ridges of stone and became part of the khalkist range they were part of that mountain range still like all elves glanthon knew silvanos had founded the nation that bore his name but hearing the story thrilling even in abbreviated form left him openmouthed what happened to the dragonstones he asked let me quote the chronicle of silvanos this was the book all aspiring archivists were required to learn by heart victorious the cloudlegion of lord balif carried the captive dragon spirits away north to the deepest range of the mountains here was the pit of nemithotham the deepest cleft in the world and into it lord balif cast the souls of one hundred dragons in case glanthon didnt follow him fully favaronas added the exact location of nemithotham is not known today but i suspecti fear inathwakenti was once the pit of nemithotham glanthon was amazed if favaronas was correct beneath the surface of the valley lay the greatest concentration of magical force in the world the captive souls of one hundred dragons and the nomads fearful respect of the place was entirely justified one dragon just one the formidable green dragon beryl had destroyed an army comprising thousands of elves even in death she had murdered elves plummeting from the sky she had crushed the city of qualinost so badly that the land collapsed and the whiterage river rushed in nearly all the survivors of the battle drowned the speakers own mother queen mother laurana had been killed and the site remained flooded to this day as far as anyone knew the dragons rotting corpse was still at the bottom of the lake giving it the welldeserved name nalis aren the lake of death glanthon was a survivor of that battle hardly a month went by that he didnt relive in dreams the horror and gallantry hed witnessed knowing well the havoc one green dragon had wreaked he could scarcely comprehend the destruction a hundred creatures could do seeing his stricken face favaronas reminded him it was only a theory and it didnt explain the ruins the disappearing antelope the lioness had seen or the strange ghost that had passed glanthon and favaronas in the tunnel the only hard facts the archivist had wrung from the scrolls thus far was that someone in sizable numbers had occupied the valley and they had a connection to the valiant doomed balif the titles of the other seven cylinders were as cryptic as that of the first he had puzzled them out as counting of the tribe halfway order of the breeding raising of the pillars and sleeping of the first one he thought it odd the labels of two of the eight randomly chosen cylinders mentioned halfway judging from the way the word was used he felt it referred to a group of people not a location whatever it means he said i confess i am glad to be out of that peculiar valley for good glanthon shook his head it may not be for good the speaker hopes the valley will be our new homeland ignoring favaronass shocked expression the warrior added that he thought the valley with its hidden entrance abundance of water and tunnel system would make a fine haven for them we must simply solve its various mysteries he finished stoutly favaronas said the humans may be right about the place there may be mysteries there we should not disturb what about our people not only the thousands languishing in that filthy camp outside khurikhan but the hundreds of thousands who bear the yoke of foreign conquerors do we forget them and take the easy path to everlasting exile favaronas had no answer glanthon was a dedicated warrior he found virtue in hardship and nobility in war how could an archivist at least twice his age tell the proud soldier that his ideals were wrong he couldnt instead he silently vowed to continue his study of the cylinders there had to be a way to get at the interior text if any the westward ride progressed without incident as dusk fell the warriors camped just below the summit of a broad gravelly hill theyd come across no signs of nomads the desert west of the mountains seemed as devoid of people as the vale of silence had been they had plenty of water from the valley but rations were growing short only pine nuts and berries had been found during their foraging trips in the valley tis sterility caused much comment among the elves many were former herdsmen or farmers and a few had been gardeners in the great city of qualinost in elven lands a gardener was no menial laborer but an artist comparable to a sculptor poet or painter they could come up with no obvious reason for the valleys lack of game and edible plants no twolegged hunters prowled its paths it contained plenty of water its climate was mild the soil was sandy and poor in many places not to mention having that odd color but nearer the highlands there should be better minerals in the earth common sense dictated the valley should be teeming with life why then was it so silent and empty favaronas had formulated an answer but he did not share it with the others not wishing to be drawn into a long discussion the ghostly lights in the ruins were attracted to horses riders and even the murderous sand beast he believed that over time the willothewisps had cleared the valley of animal life right down to the flies where the creatures had been taken he could not say but the speaker must consider this danger before bringing the entire nation to dwell there clouds appeared in the east high and solid looking the desert air usually was so dry no clouds could penetrate this far from the sea so their appearance caused much comment as the elves settled into camp when flickers of lightning flashed beneath the clouds the elves knew they were seeing something extraordinary but not even that could keep the weary warriors awake long favaronas labored far into the night trying to unlock the secret of the stone cylinders he gathered dry desert grasses and built a small fire by a stand of saltbush whose grayish green leaves had served as his dinner he laid one of the cylinders in the flames but fire had no effect on it he tried pouring water then oil on the cylinders to soften them but again met with failure the ends of the cylinders bore tight spiral patterns they looked like nothing so much as ordinary vellum scrolls turned to stone perhaps by age or magic if the former it might be possible to separate the books using mechanical means but if magic was involved his efforts were pointless the speaker would have to find skilled mages to unravel the guarded cylinders sometime past midnight favaronas fell asleep the cylinders arranged before him his fire had died to a bed of shimmering coals the soft crunch of footfalls woke him he had spent too many fearful days and nights in the valley to ignore such noises whos there he hissed likely the noise was innocent caused by one of glanthons soldiers favaronas called out again by turns nervous and angry the fellow could have the courtesy to answer he tossed a handful of dry grass on the coals of his fire flames blossomed to his heartthudding shock they illuminated a cloaked figure standing a few feet away the figure moved back seeking the darkness favaronas shouted getting quickly to his feet glanthon had given him a weyalu mace because it required little skill to wield he clutched it now he was terrified but certain his cry would rouse the warriors and they would protect him strangely none came the warriors around him remained still despite his continued shouts he heard snores and deep inhalations as they slept on undisturbed the cloaked intruder joined several similarly clad figures at the foot of the hill favaronas could make out four distinct i forms and in the nights deep folds he spied the movement of many more instead of fleeing the four came closer and surrounded him he waved the mace shouting at them to stay back with an enemy at each point of the compass he found himself whirling in a circle trying desperately to keep them all in view stranger the whisper brought him around to face one of the four give back what you have taken he knew immediately what was meant the stone cylinders who are you he demanded slender hands turned back the dark hood a lovely face appeared that of a young female elf with eyes and hair the color of sunlit gold the other three uncovered their heads revealing themselves to be elf maidens too one had hair and eyes of darkest onyx another was copper hued and the fourth silvery white all four were beautiful with flawless milky skin and crimson lips but their expressions were somber give back what you have taken repeated the golden haired maid favaronas lowered the mace these relics are important to us he replied cant you spare them in unison the four advanced a step toward him golden hair once more repeated her command with the others echoing it these werent phantoms unlike the translucent ghost hed encountered in the tunnel these elves were flesh and blood even in the poor light he could see the tracks left in their hair by combs hear the rustle of their robes see how their thin sandals pressed into the gravelly sand please we didnt mean to steal anything he said addressing golden hair im an archivist an expert on documents these cylinders are very old and id like to read them youre elves you must know how important these cylinders could be to our people do you know how to open them she unclasped her cloak and let it fall exposing bare flesh the others followed suit before favaronas could digest this development one of the maidens sprang on him from behind another snatched the mace from his hand and a third struck the backs of his knees toppling him to the ground his head hit the ground with such force that the stars overhead vanished in a sunrise of pain a terrible weight settled on his chest when his head finally cleared he saw the goldenhaired elf sitting on his chest although she looked so slight a strong breeze would sway her she was extremely heavy he could hardly draw breath against the crushing weight of her body he pleaded for air she leaned down grasping his head between her hands as she moved closer her lovely face shattered instead of a radiantly fair elf maid favaronas found himself eye to eye with a wolf one with golden eyes and matching pelt give back what you have stolen the wolf snarled he couldnt understand why the creatures didnt just take the stone cylinders and go they had certainly defeated him he couldnt move could barely breathe take them he wheezed why dont you just take them you shall have no rest until you return what you have taken so saying the wolf lifted one paw high favaronas couldnt draw breath to scream before the claws slashed across his throat the uneasy calm continued at khurikhan slatecolored clouds piled higher and higher over the city until they no longer flowed with the wind for the first time in living memory the desert sun vanished completely khurs and elves sweltered despite the unexpected shade no breath of wind stirred and the heat was stifling brief unpredictable showers of rain fell keeping everyone sodden steamy and uncomfortable the murder of lord morillon fanned the flames of fear and distrust already smoldering from the attempt on the speakers life there were no clues to his death no evidence pointed to anyone in particular but the view in khurinost was that morillon had been slain by fanatical torghanists sahimkhan agreed his fierce captain vatan and one hundred elite palace guards cleared the temple of torghan the entire college of priests was dragged away in chains along with two dozen scruffy nomads hiding in the temple grounds and a handful of terrified servants high priest minok could not be found the elves kept close to their tents they saw conspiracies every time more than two khurs appeared on the city street amp planchet and taranath quickly organized water collection for the entire colony warriors rather than ordinary citizens were sent to purchase the lifegiving liquid even without their chargers and dressed in regular attire the warriors cut an unmistakable profile as they stood watch over their comrades during one of these expeditions hytanthas ambrodel learned of the death of lord hengriff he sought out planchet on his return from the city the speakers guard commander harnaramis was with the valet hengriffs corpse lies in the palace yard hytanthas announced grimly wearing a placard that says traitor a suitable end for a dark knight hamaramis opined he saved my life that night at the ruined villa the captain insisted he may have had a nefarious purpose in mind but the truth is he saved me he seemed an honorable man hamaramis snorted and hytanthas added stubbornly he deserves better than to feed the flies planchet understood he went to a chest standing against the wall of the speakers tent and removed a small sack from one of its drawers he tossed it to hytanthas bribe the guards and secure the knights remains see to it he gets an honorable burial head held high under hamaramiss disapproval hytanthas departed to repay his debt to the dark knight of neraka that money could be better spent the two elves turned to see the lioness standing in the doorway leading to the speakers bedchamber dark circles shadowed her eyes shed been up all night nursing her injured husband it could be used to find morillons killer or the spineless fiend who tried to kill the speaker she said planchet poured a cup of raw wine and handed it to the lioness they might be the same person he said evenly barring a new player the roster of our foes is shrinking sahimkhan for all his grasping ways has shown hes not our true enemy and lord hengriff is dead who does that leave she asked the mage faeterus for one we dont know much about him but he tried to kill captain ambrodel evaded the nerakans and is still at large what about the torghanist high priest planchet shook his head a pawn in the game not a player i think sahimkhans been hunting him for days he dares not show his face anywhere in khurikhan prince shobbat hamaramis suggested here planchet frowned without replying the heir to the throne of khur was a cipher to the elves he had little to do with the running of the country and spent most of his time overseeing repairs to the palace or pursuing his personal pleasures it was rumored he was involved in hengriffs fall but the elves found this hard to credit no one in khurikhan took the spoiled pleasureloving prince seriously as a threat kerian held out her empty cup and planchet refilled it how fares the speaker lady hamaramis asked quietly he sleeps his fever waxes each night and wanes by day planchet said an entire corps of healers from khurikhan waits to attend him humans have done enough for the speaker she snapped her furious expression lasted only seconds then settled back into its usual stolid exhaustion our people can take care of him although she had no grudge against saida or the temple of elirsana kerian had been so shaken by the treacherous attack on gilthas that she wouldnt allow any humans near him elven sages lacking the resources of their native lands were having difficulty controlling his fever but kerian insisted only elves treat the speaker she finished her drink then returned to the dim room where gilthas slept the temperature was warm but bearable the heat kept at bay by the palm fan that rotated slowly next to his bed it was powered by the strong arms of boys who turned the crank located in an adjacent room so great was their desire to aid their speaker most had to be forced to rest and allow another to take his place around the rooms shadowed periphery healers consulted each other in whispers irritated by their murmuring kerian ordered the room cleared she sat on her side of the ropeframed bed careful not to block the breeze from the fan in the low light she could see sweat on gilthass forehead and along his jaw his breath was slow and steady but a little raspy his eyes were closed when she touched his cheek she felt the fever burning inside him i found the valley gil she said softly its just where your librarian said it would be but i fear its no place for us theres something wrong with it some kind of curse she grimaced at the ignorant word but could think of no otheron the place a force snatches away living creatures including our people we never discovered where they went the inathwakenti holds no animal life at all not so much as a lizard or a fly i know the place fascinates you and we can certainly send other explorers to study it but that valley is no sanctuary for our beleaguered nation he never stirred she took his hand despite the sweat on his face his hand was dry and hot as the sands outside she put her face close to his willing him to waken to be well to hear you must give up the foolish idea that we can find a new homeland we have a home two homes in fact its our sacred duty and our destiny to return and take them back thats what we should do what we must do she realized she was squeezing his hand releasing it she stood and paced across the room like a caged version of her namesake theres talk about me in the tents you know they say i abandoned my warriors to come home to you i cant deny it but i wont apologize for it i flew here to be by your side she halted her restless movement we have to get out of here gil once sahimkhan drains us of all our treasure hell sell us to the knights or the bull men or any of the other halfdozen groups that would like to see us exterminated or the nomads and torghanists will unite against us and save him the trouble then what will we do he didnt answer only lay breathing slowly six feet away yet he might as well have been across the continent her husband wasnt here hed gone somewhere she couldnt reach fear frustration and worry squeezed her heart she could no longer simply sit and stare at him picking up her helmet and swordbelt from a chair by the bed she departed when she reached the audience room she sent the healers back in again heal the speaker she said curtly past hamaramis and planchet past the courtiers waiting in hushed circles past her husbands loyal servants she strode in unyielding silence in the square outside the sprawling tent she found the company shed summoned one warrior held the reins of her horse she swung into the saddle without benefit of stirrup the lioness rode away toward khurikhan with forty armed and armored warriors behind her gilthas inhaled sharply and opened his eyes my heart he gasped healers rushed to his side thinking the speaker was complaining about the organ in his chest but he was not i heard you he panted come back my heart but kerian was already gone water from the recent rains stained the ruined villas white limestone walls opportunistic seeds long dormant in the soil had sprouted covering the pebbled paths and former gardens in a profusion of hairy green shoots the lioness had heard a full account from hytanthas of his adventure with faeterus and the mages monsters when she and her riders reached the villa ruins clustered around the broken tower she sent twenty elves to find the carcasses of the sand beast and manticore while she and the remaining twenty scoured the grounds for clues to the mages whereabouts the clouds above were still and no air stirred through the rubble piles and toppled columns the atmosphere carried the heavy expectant feeling of an impending storm it was unnerving to the elves and their horses the dead monsters were easy enough to find the headless manticore was draped over a pile of rubble closer to the villa the sand beast was likewise yielding to corruption the elves were forced to tie kerchiefs over their noses just to approach its body kerian entered the mansions front doorway scraps of parchment blew over her feet she speared one on her sword tip and brought it up to read it looked scorched every line of ink on the vellum was charred her reading skills were limited but she recognized the curls and tracery of a magical sigil the weakened parchment broke apart the fragments fluttered to the floor a warrior hailed her he had found the sorcerers sanctum in the broken tower she entered the tower through a large door that swung inward on silent hinges the interior was lit only by the faint daylight from an open trap door overhead she mounted a ladder theyd knocked together from house timbers and entered faeteruss former residence the round room was filled with carpets tapestries and numerous pillows daylight penetrated through hairline cracks in the tower walls aside from the overblown furnishings all they found were more pieces of disintegrating parchment a collar and leash for the manticore and an empty wicker cage one of the elves bent down peering into the shadows he stood up abruptly cursing kerian came over what is it dead birds six common pigeons the bane of soukats all over khurikhan lay dead on the rug their headless bodies were arranged in a neat line kerian spied a squat brass urn in the corner recognizing it as a khurish oil pot she picked it up and shook it it was half full she sent her warriors out as they went back down the ladder she began pouring mutton oil on the thick carpet tossing aside the empty urn she swept parchment fragments into a heap on the oilsoaked carpet with flint and steel she showered sparks on the little pile of tinder soon the first red flame crept forth smoke was puffing from the trap door opening as she joined her elves outside kerian saw the first flames erupt from the windows of the villa proper and knew the job was done not only was she taking away an enemys fortress she was sending him a clear message the lioness had taken the field against him and there would be no quarter in the gardens the other half of her company had gotten a dozen ropes around the sand beasts carcass the gangrenous wound on its hip gave kerian great satisfaction hengriff may have slain the beast but she and her warriors had slowed it down so he could do the job had he encountered the sand beast as they first had she had no doubt it would have killed the knight as easily as it had her brave warriors having roped the stinking carcass to their protesting horses the elves awaited her next order follow me she told them the company rode out of the harbalah and into khurikhan proper at the rear of the procession six riders dragged the lifeless body of the sand beast behind their mounts from windows and doorways khurs reacted with horror as the putrefying remains were dragged past their houses shedding blood and flesh as it went some screamed and many cursed the laddad as they passed the warrior riding nearest the lioness said general why are we its a gift for sahimkhan she said calmly the elves held their formation but all wondered whether they were on a suicide ride the human khan had been known to kill for insults far less than this the bulk of the carcass forced them to keep to the wide thoroughfares these took them through the heart of khurikhan by the time they skirted the grand souks a crowd had gathered behind them the lioness ignored the hostile angry khurs and rode steadily on word of their approach sped ahead and they arrived to find the gates of the khuri yl nor solidly shut against them kerian directed her troopers to drag the decaying sand beast up to the gate and cut it loose from the battlements above a khurish officer yelled what are you doing laddad you cant leave that there she removed her helmet despite the clouded sky her golden head shone like a landbound sun i am kerianseray consort of the speaker of the sun and stars she proclaimed in her best command voice this is a gift for sahimkhan with my compliments summon him the officer laughed harshly no one summons the khan of all the khurs tell him it has to do with the massacre of the nomad camp and with his pet sorcerer faeterus mention of the atrocity stirred the mob behind the elves angry shouts and denunciations flew the elven warriors tense already fingered sword hilts and worked to control their restive mounts only kerian remained calm she sat tall on her bay horse back straight eyes never leaving the khurish officer perhaps it was her calm insistence or the growling mob behind her that convinced him but the officer disappeared from the battlement for a time nothing happened distant thunder rumbled flies drawn by the carrion tormented everyone unclean cried the mob drive the killers out at last the double gates parted the crowd fell silent thunder murmured again a double line of khurish soldiers twenty in all marched out the gate behind them walked not sahimkhan but hakkam commander of the khans army the soldiers halted and hakkam strode between their lines approaching the lioness lady kerianseray he said he grimaced at the carcass youve been hunting i see no general like a vulture i only picked up what was already dead is sahimkhan coming of course not say what must be said to me sensing that she had gotten as far as she could she crossed her wrists on the pommel of her saddle and leaned forward over them this stinking carcass is all that remains of a sand beast i believe they are native to your remote desert hakkam conceded they were it was slain a few nights ago by lord hengriff you know the man kerian said sarcastically matching her tone hakkam replied a warrior of considerable prowess not the best intriguer this beast was slain in the harbalah on the grounds of a villa destroyed by malys the beast traveled there from the valley of the blue sands where it tried to kill me and my entire company her words set the mob surging and muttering again kerian raised her voice to be heard above them at first i thought it had come across us by accident but after its first attack it tracked us across fifty miles of open desert we passed by the peaceful camp of the weyalu tribe one night on our way to the valley we did them no harm the sand beast on our trail must have slaughtered them after we passed on a profound silence descended the buzzing of the flies sounded very loud when we fought the beast a final time we wounded it and it escaped wisely she didnt cloud the issue with talk of willothewisps and the instantaneous transference of the oneton sand beast from inathwakenti to khurikhan ask yourself general hakkam ask yourself as i have done why did this creature wounded and in agony turn up on the grounds of a wrecked mansion in your city he folded sinewy arms across his chest and obligingly said why it was returning to its mister the sorcerer faeterus who lived in the ruined mansion maddened with pain it attacked one of my warriors who was keeping an eye on the mage the fortunate arrival of lord hengriff put an end to its murderous rampage hakkarn stared at her for a moment longer eyes narrowed in thought then slowly approached the dead beast its rotting hide was nearly invisible beneath a writhing coat of blowflies hakkam was a hardened desert fighter and did not flinch what proof have you he called out over the buzz and whir of busy insects the proof of my word and the proof of logic i do not kill innocents a sand beast will and did and this sorcerer you speak of at large in your city perhaps in the palace of the khan even now find him general put your questions to him she raised a gloved hand and in unison her escort wheeled their horses a crowd of nearly one thousand khurs packed the back of the square the lioness rode back through her warriors and continued unhesitatingly toward the wall of humanity when the khurs realized she was not going to turn aside they scrambled out of her way the rest of the elves followed her an irritated hakkam spat on the pavement and glanced back at the khuri yl nor he hoped his sovereign had gotten a good whiff of the lionesss gift after ordering the rotten carcass hauled away he went to report to the khan sahimkhan was waiting in the inner courtyard he demanded an explanation the general gave a brief account of the lionesss reasons for bringing the dead monster to the palace the khans expression was odd unreadable even to his longtime general but his voice was firm as he replied this is a grave affront to the throne of khur i will complain to the speaker mighty khan the speaker lies gravely wounded in his tent hakkam reminded him while he is laid low kerianseray rules the laddad the general saluted and was dismissed he departed quickly so as to hide the faint smile on his face this also caused him to miss his khans low bemused chuckle sahim was intrigued by kerianserays argument the laddad had neatly escaped the massacre charge thickheaded nomads might still believe the elves had done it but word would circle the city within hours and the cityfolk would think otherwise sand beasts were nearly legendary nowadays so rarely were they seen but every khur knew the stories of their savagery in olden times a single sand beast had been known to rip through a herd of two hundred cattle or sheep in a single night in the territories where the monsters once dwelt in numbers nomad bands had to erect timber fences to defend their night camps even then many tribesmen still were slain to have one turn up here within the citys wall was indeed a wonder neatly done lady sahim thought as he reentered the citadel unfortunately his thoughts turned to faeterus and all trace of amusement vanished he was rapidly losing patience with the wretched mage faeteruss machinations were costing the throne of khur far more than his services were worth something would have to be done about that soon some distance away atop the citadel near where hed loosed the amazing arrow shobbat watched the elves depart and khurish soldiers drag the dead sand beast away the smell of corruption reached him even at this height he turned away holding a perfumed cloth over his nose potent smell isnt it shobbat flinched faeterus was there where he had not been an instant before i didnt send for you the prince gasped i wanted a good vantage point for the spectacle the hooded mage went to the edge of the balcony and peered down resting his long fingers on the parapet ugly creature i wonder how it got from the desert to the city surely someone ought to have noticed it wandering through an open gate it appears to have come here from the valley of the blue sands in a single night shobbat said rubbing his hands together they were unaccountably cold it came straight to you did you summon it certainly not the stupid creature wanted to kill me this incident will bear some study dont come here again faeterus its too dangerous for me the hood turned away from the distant view yes it is faeterus agreed and then was gone shobbats legs were trembling he sat abruptly on the sandstone bench at his back the mage was out of control coming and going from the palace at will something would have to be done about that soon still he had every reason to feel confident the elves had made it to the valley but theyd not stayed surely this would overturn the oracles prophecy he had rid himself of hengriff who first bribed him then blackmailed him about the bribery the memory of hengriffs death brought a small smile in some ways that had been a trial run for the removal of his father murder behind closed doors was no good it aroused opponents and gave traitors the mantle of pursuing justice the best assassinations were carried out in public with loyal supporters standing by many of sahimkhans guards were already in shobbats pay more would follow then shobbat would strike soon chapter favaronas awoke with a start the monstrous creatures of his nightmare were still vivid in his mind and he ached as if hed been wrestling a legion of attackers three hundred sixteen years he had lived and here he was sleeping in the desert dodging murderous nomads and prowling haunted tunnels the lovingly shaped halls of qualinost were far away in time and distance how he missed his old life there the measured pace of the royal library the smell of venerable parchment the dust of time collected on the wisdom of the ages he feared all of that was lost forever profoundly thirsty he sat up slowly and reached for a handy waterskin the collar securing the spout was a ring of polished tin it made a small but perfect mirror in its mirrored surface he glimpsed something on his reflection that brought a gasp of shock across his neck were four deep parallel scratches he cried out dropping the leather waterskin and clutching his throat the wounds did not hurt but he could feel the beads of clotted blood clinging to them it had not been a dream the bloodthirsty shapechangers were real he had to tell glanthon at once the sun was just peering over the featureless horizon its light was faint as the sky was layered with dull white clouds scrambling up the hill to glanthons tent favaronas found himself caught by the sight hed not seen an overcast sky since coming to khur it actually looked as though rain was possible he glanced back at his bedroll to make certain his parchments were covered one of the stone cylinders had unfurled favaronas hurled himself back down the slope his need to find glanthon forgotten muted sunlight dappled the book he touched the page it was cold stiffer than natural parchment but no longer stone it felt like heavy vellum the sort usually reserved for covers not text pages with great care he unrolled the curled page it was covered in writing a neat scribal hand the ink copperbrown against the yellow vellum the words were the same abbreviated elvish as the labels on each cylinder he couldnt simply read off the contents but would have to decode the abbreviations he ransacked his meager supplies for ink pen and paper he must transcribe the writing get it all down and worry about deciphering it later while he was engrossed the sun continued its slow rise the filtered orange light traveling across his bedroll when the light fell upon the second and third cylinders they also softened into readable scrolls the tightly furled pages loosening with a soft whish favaronass heart thudded in his chest what was happening here the cylinders had been exposed to sunlight before and had not opened was it because the clouds were screening the normally harsh sunlight was it the first light of dawn could it have something to do with his dream that was not a dream just now it did not matter the mysterious books were open around him the warriors stirred a sparse meal was prepared and eaten horses were watered and fed whenever a warrior passed by the archivist found himself shielding the open scrolls from view without knowing why he felt a need to keep this development to himself when the sun was more fully up beams of stronger light reached out through gaps in the clouds and fell upon the scrolls one by one they curled up again turning white and hard becoming stone once more favaronas tried to stop the process by shading the books but the transformation was inexorable barely an hour after he noticed the first book opening all were stone again hed managed to copy out only a third of the first tome good morning the archivist convulsed like a guilty lover glanthon had arrived bearing his gear on one shoulder what favaronas said looking up oh yes good morning glanthon squinted at him are you hurt what are those marks on your neck favaronass hand went to his throat this nothing i rolled over on a stone while sleeping and scratched myself glanthon could see no such stones in the immediate area of favaronass bedroll but if the speakers archivist didnt want to parade his problems glanthon would not press the matter well be moving out soon its two days to the caravan i road i want to keep clear of kortal itself too many nerakan spies favaronas nodded what he wanted most right now was for glanthon to go about his business so he could begin translating the writing hed taken down from the first open scroll he feigned a headache and asked to be left alone until the company actually departed unsuspecting glanthon wished him better health and left the camp grew noisier as the warriors curried their horses saddled them and stowed their gear favaronas broke his fast with a bag of dried vegetable chips and a cup of water and tried to make sense of what hed written the writing was like the labels line after line of abbreviations without break punctuation or capitalization and only a small tic of the scribes pen separating each syllable who would record valuable records in such a difficult fashion still if each syllable represented a word in old elvish he should be able to read the entire document but it would take time the first line was nat hat om bar sem hoc ved nat could stand for many things from the word for rooster nathi to the verb meaning to behead natcar by the time the company was ready to depart favaronas had translated four lines and those only roughly the book on which he was working was apparently volume three of a longer work it began in midsentence not unusual in documents from ancient times he commanded us to raise the stones as part of the sacred star or pattern that the powers of heaven had buried might be enhanced in this place there followed several words he could not puzzle out then many were weak and reverted or changed by this time the work went slowly many died and their spirits walked by night confined by the power or place they sought to control now favaronas really did feel a headache coming on the thicket of ambiguous syllables yielded their secrets so slowly he knew translating the cylinders would require weeks of continuous labor he would never be able to keep their secrets for that long in the confines of khurinost why keep them a secret at all he raised the cup of water to his lips with a trembling hand the answer was terribly clear power a frightening theory was growing in his mind that the fabled dragonstones were buried under the ruins that a secret colony had grown up in the valley centuries after the dragonstones were buried a colony devoted to harnessing their forbidden power he imagined the ruins were all that remained of an enormous magical operation intended to allow the colonists to tap the dragonstones as a waterwheel and mill and utilize the power of a flowing stream was the design finished history did not record the rise of a great city of magic in the inathwakenti the few lines favaronas had read implied the colonists died off faster than their work could be completed who were they and why did they die the fact that their chronicles were written in truncated silvanesti lent weight to the theory they were elves but no speaker of the stars would have tolerated such an illicit enterprise maybe that was the final answer to the mystery of inathwakenti the builders of the ruins had been rounded up and perhaps exterminated by the speaker of the stars oh how he longed for access to the ancient archives of silvanost what mysteries they must contain he regretted saying as much as he had to glanthon glanthon was a good soldier but the scope of this revelation was beyond him he might spread the word to the other warriors and he would want to turn over anything they found to the lioness the vale of silence was no place for swords and soldiers it ought to be quarantined with access strictly controlled and only the wisest sages and mages allowed inside of course favaronas himself did not qualify as either but wasnt this exactly the task of an archivist to recover lost records while searching for evidence in the annals of two ancient kingdoms who better than he to unravel the secrets of inathwakenti favaronas had learned much from the hardships of this journey no longer was he merely a beerloving librarian his time with the lioness had taught him the necessity of decisive action thus inspired he moved swiftly now he wrapped the cylinders in his bedroll added his notes and the few provisions he hid and tied the resulting bundle with cords he placed the precious bundle at the foot of the hill on a large area of soft sand he swept his footprints away then dug a hole large enough to contain the bundle and himself if he drew his knees to his chin wrapping his belt sash around his face to protect eyes nose and mouth he lay in the hole and buried himself completely for a moment the weight of the warm sand pressing down on him brought panic with his head turned to the side he discovered he could breathe well enough the sash filtered the sand from the air concentrating on the marvelous knowledge contained in the cylinders he clutched to his chest he forced himself to be calm this was the right thing to do he must have time to decode the knowledge contained in the cylinders he waited favaronas favaronas glanthon and other soldiers could be heard calling him he felt the vibration of hooves pounding nearby sweat pooled in the hollow of his neck but he did not answer eventually the calls died away though it took longer than he had imagined guilt stabbed him glanthon sounded very worried he kept his soldiers searching for what seemed like hours but although the archivists legs twitched once or twice with the urge to put an end to his scheme he did not he stayed where he was the sand grew warmer as the day wore on but the unusual layer of clouds kept it from becoming too hot to bear favaronas dozed waking in terror several times dreaming hed been buried alive or was sharing his hole with those horrible leaping spiders at long last the heat in the ground abated he had heard nothing outside for hours and decided it was safe to emerge when he tried to unbend his knees he found them locked in place his arms and hands worked so he clawed his way to freedom the sun was still up but sunset was only an hour or so away pain like knifethrusts gripped both of his legs it took an age but finally he was able to straighten them and to stand the walk back to inathwakenti would be a long one but night was the best time to cross the desert on foot if any time was right he took up the bundle of cylinders and supplies abruptly loneliness swamped him a sense of his own insignificance in the vastness of the desert he felt fear bubble up too very little would be required to cause his fear to bloom into panic and panic would kill him he must think clearly and carefully he squeezed the bundle in his arms reveling in the weight of the scrolls i will know all he declared i will learn all that they can teach me courage bolstered he put the lowering orb of the sun at his left hand and set out north across the rocky sand and windblown dunes wind gusted through the sea of tents flapping roofs and shivering taut anchor lines a hard rain had lashed khurinost just after sunset and the sodden tents steamed in the cool night air no one slept elves clustered in the narrow lanes or sat in groups before fires in open squares talk was of the growing dangers around themthe attempt on the speakers life the murder of lord morillon the attack on the city gates by khurish fanatics morillon was respected by many the speaker loved by all yet no one in khurinost would survive if the water supply was cut off the gates had reopened but talk turned inevitably to the fact that it could so easily happen again half the elves believed it would be necessary to storm khurikhan and secure the wells the other half felt it was time to leave exactly where they would go was a subject of great debate with gilthas sleeping kerian took some time for herself general hamaramis a fastidious fellow owned one of the best bathtubs in khurinost his tent was currently unoccupied as he was with his troops keeping watch on the khurs so she stole away for a muchneeded bath long days in the desert had left her feeling dry dirty and wrung out like a washcloth worse the stench of her encounter with the sand beasts carcass could not be overcome by her usual quick ablutions in a basin of water the odor of decay had permeated every part of her right down to the roots of her hair if she didnt clean up soon she thought it might never come off hamaramiss tub was a homemade contraption comprising tent stakes supporting heavy canvas sides but just now it seemed more luxurious to kerian than the gold silver and porcelain fixtures in the palace of qualinost she hauled her own water from a brass tank outside the generals tent and she didnt bother heating it it was nearly the warmth of blood anyway thanks to the khurish climate long hunted by enemies the lioness was too wary to strip to the skin and chose to retain her underclothes before stepping into the tub she carefully combed the thick gritencrusted mass of her hair sand and tiny gravel cascaded to the floor with every stroke the tub wasnt long enough for her to stretch out fulllength once in she pulled up her knees and leaned back submerging head and hair the clear water turned gray the old general disdained soap as an effete affectation preferring to scrub himself with a sponge kerian eyed the creamy brown sponge which hung on a peg inside the tent decided it looked rough enough to plane wood and made do with a scrap of linen for a washcloth she straightened her legs leaning against the back of the tub and closed her eyes the tent was quiet save for intermittent gusts of wind outside and the tapping of some metal object stirred by the breeze with effort she cleared her mind and let the quiet and blessed moisture work their soothing magic she dozed that looks wonderful she didnt start since shed heard him coming and recognized his halting gait but she was surprised to see him looking more than frail gilthas leaned against the wooden doorframe hed donned a geb the sleeveless garment hanging loosely without benefit of belt it bulged over the bandages on his right shoulder a dressing gown was draped over his shoulders the stump of a spade handle served him as a cane i cant believe youre up and about she said its a shock to me too he replied smiling faintly without warning he began to slide off the jamb kerian was out of the tub in a flash catching him before he hit the floor hamaramiss furniture like the general himself was rather spare kerian eased gilthas onto a short unpadded bench and stood looking down at him hands on hips dripping on the carpet you shouldnt be out of bed youll aggravate your wound its healed she looked surprised and he added high priestess saida is quite skilled i gave orders she wasnt to be admitted he was taken aback why it was a human who wounded you weve had quite enough favors from them gilthas coughed wincing you wouldnt say that if it was your shoulder he rasped but she would of course annoyed yet unwilling to berate him while he was so weak she decided to finish her bath taking up hamaramiss rough sea sponge and stepping back into the tub she dedicated herself to scrubbing feet and legs while her husband watched finally the heavy silence and his grim expression were too much whatever it is just say it she said tossing the sponge into the bath with a splash im trying to find the words his voice was calm but concern laced every syllable you left your command in the valley of the blue sands yes kerian this is a grave matter she nodded it wasnt a decision i made lightly but glanthon is a competent officer hell get his warriors and favaronas home that isnt the point he paused then spoke the words seemingly wrenched from him a commander shouldnt abandon her soldiers i thought you were dead or dying and i dont need you to school me in how to be a commander apparently you do my health was totally irrelevant your first duty was to your warriors leaving them to fend for themselves could be construed as cowardice that brought the lioness to her feet sending waves of water over the sides of the tub how dare you no one calls me a coward not even you he leaned back panting slightly exertion and emotion taking their toll youre no coward kerian i know that but your behavior of late has been reckless and dangerous im told you dragged the rotting corpse of a sand beast to sahimkhans door with a grim nod she admitted it why he asked she flung out her hands to make a point of course i was accused of slaughtering unarmed women and children i realized the sand beast was probably responsible maybe at the direction of that traitor faeterus if i had simply told the story to sahimkhan he might not have believed me or he mightve ignored me by putting my case to the people of khurikhan i ended the lie at once you have sorely offended sahimkhans dignity i dont care about his dignity she wrung water from her hair and stepped out of the tub when she looked at her husband again his face was utterly still the lines on it seemingly etched twice as deep as before his gaze fixed on the floor concerned she held out a hand to him meaning to help him back to bed do you care about my dignity you have disobeyed my strictest orders the hand dropped to her side what orders she asked genuinely confused not to fight with the khurish nomads what in chaoss name are you talking about they attacked us then you should have evaded them he thumped the carpet with his cane they knew where we were going i couldnt very well evade them and carry out your pointless expedition at the same time he pushed himself upright his eyes held no anger only a deep sadness kerianseray i love you more than my life he whispered her towering rage drained away but i must do whats best for the elven nation he added your actions continue to provoke our enemies and aggravate our allies you have consistently made impulsive reckless choices at a time when the slightest nuances of our deeds can mean life or death his posture straightened and in that instant her husband was gone it was the speaker who addressed her now you are removed as commander of my armies had he pulled out a blade and thrust it home he could not have astonished her more she stared at him in shock as he went on in time i trust you will appreciate why i must make this decision will understand what an increasingly difficult political situation were in taranath will take command of the cavalry hamaramis retains command of my personal guard you may serve in any company you wish or you may retire from service with that he turned ponderously and leaning heavily on his makeshift cane limped out several yards away in the corridor leading to the tents main room planchet waited when the speaker appeared planchet covered the distance between them in three long strides many unhappy tasks were required of a monarch the one hed just performed had been the very worst gilthas turned a gray sweating face to planchet and whispered it is done take me home water dried on kerians skin how much time passed she didnt know but when she finally came to herself she was sitting on the rug her back against the bathtub her small clothes were stiff and dry dismissed she was dismissed by her husband how many years had she borne arms against the enemies of her people how long had she shed blood and fought foes more numerous more powerful more ruthless than she she had won and she had lost many times over but always she fought on never had she quit and now she was dismissed cast aside disparaged gilthas was wrong she had made mistakes she admitted that but her course wasnt reckless it was right if their people were to survive they needed bold and vigorous action not soft words and evasion inathwakenti was a dead end as dangerous to the elves as the desert heat and marauding nomads perhaps their people werent yet strong enough to retake silvanesti and qualinesti but they would hardly grow any stronger in this dreary field of tents living off the charity of barbarous humans nor could they grow stronger by crossing the murderous cauldron of the high plateau only then to face the deadly mysteries in the valley of the blue sands no elves must take control of elven destiny once more if gilthas and his soft advisors couldnt see this someone would have to show them the way they clung to an imaginary life thinking protocol and precedence mattered thinking politeness and accommodation would keep their people safe someone would have to make them understand reality the first step to saving the elven race was right here they must take khurikhan and use it as their base for striking outward from khur gilthas always had been reluctant to confront sahim because the human khan had offered the elves sanctuary during their time of trouble but that sanctuary had come to have much too high a priceand kerian wasnt thinking only of steel and silver the life theyd been forced to live begging humans for every scrap they received was draining the heart and soul from her people sahimkhan was a liar a schemer and a greedy bandit he deserved no consideration and less mercy with khurikhan in their hands the elves would have access to the sea ships could be commandeered or built and the lioness and her fighters would harry the coasts of silvanesti and qualinesti ships of their former conquerors could be taken and raids mounted on coastal towns there were islands with temperate climates in the southern and eastern courrain that would fall to a determined attack the new elven nation would be a seafaring nation building their wealth and power against the day they would take back their ancestral lands that day would come fists clenched kerian swore to herself it would come and not in some dim distant future but soon very soon she got to her feet dressing quickly in her dirty garments it was obvious that talking to gilthas and his advisors would be pointless she would make her case to the warriors like herself they understood the realities of life with them behind her gilthas would be forced to listen to her he could be made to see the logical perfection of her plan it was fully dark outside and the wind rushed through the lanes first one way then back the other rosy haloes glowed inside the clouds overhead the strange sight halted kerian despite the fervor of purpose burning in her breast lightning was white or bluish even in the godsblasted wastes of khur lightning wasnt red as she navigated the twisting byways on her way to the warriors quarter she encountered no one however she quickly knew she was not alone a hundred yards from hamaramiss tent she glimpsed shadows moving behind her senses honed by years on the run warned her the next time there was a flash of scarlet lightning kerian whirled abruptly she saw no one but had no doubt she was being followedand by more than one person she shucked the scabbard from her sword cooking smoke drifted through the lane small black shapes flitted overhead making faint chirping noises shed seen bats in khur just one other time the night the ash leaves had fallen on her recent events had driven the omen from her mind now that memory returned full force she continued her march up the alley making as much noise as she could without being too obvious reaching a threeway intersection she sprang to her right and sprinted down the winding path taking long strides and landing only on her toes an old kagonesti trick to foil trackers she ran far enough to lose her breath then ducked behind a cloth merchants stall its flaps closed for the night the bats still flickered overhead dodging between the canvas rooftops when they had passed silence descended no sounds of pursuit reached her ears she stepped out of hiding to continue on her way and her bare feet trod on soft green leaves without looking she knew they were ash leaves fresh air teased her back turning she glanced back along the twisting lane the overlapping edges of the fabric roofs flapped lazily then settled again wind puffed down the path making the tents belly in and out like the breathing of enormous animals all but one one tent didnt flexbecause someone was pressed against it kerian set her feet firmly and gripped her sword hilt in both hands she didnt have long to wait four figures dashed into view the leader held a hooded lamp and when he saw kerian he opened the shutter wide bright light dazzled her so she lunged forward and swatted the brass lamp away it landed in the sand flickered and kept burning but less brightly recovering from her lunge she heard her attackers draw swords one after the other the first the one whod held the lamp thrust at her throwing himself off balance in his zeal to reach her she bound up his blade in a parry and drove him back with a punch to his nose a second attacker came at her point first she swung up at him in a wide arc their blades met and the force of her swing sent his sword flying completing the circle she beat aside the blade of the first attacker and repaid him in full shoving the tip of her sword through his collar bone deep into his chest blood welled her attackers were strong and fast dressed in gebs they wore gray cloth masks that completely covered their heads they carried silvanestistyle swords but that meant little local artisans had taken to making such blades to peddle to the elves who did not care for the guardless khurish swords the craftsmens ingenuity had sparked a fad for laddadstyle weapons among the youths of khurikhan as she held them off she shouted for help no one answered this part of khurinost seemed deserted the lioness was on her own she snatched up the fallen lamp and used it like a shield fending off sword points one of her three remaining foes got too close and she clouted him with the lamp he went down but his hard head broke the oil reservoir off the lamp died she dropped it and a blade found her empty hand it scored a deep cut along the back of her left wrist rapid footfalls told her that at last someone was coming her hope of assistance died quickly when she saw the new arrivals wore gray hoods having whittled her attackers to two they now swelled to eight she flung herself at a tent wall sword outthrust she sawed the stiff canvas and dove headfirst through the opening the tent was used for storage only baskets and sacks greeted kerians eyes she dodged around them slashed through the opposite wall and found herself back outside in a parallel street scarlet lightning danced above her and the wind played down the lanes in gusty waves tents flapped somewhere nearby a metal bucket got loose and clanged end over end driven by the freakish wind from the noise they were making kerian knew her attackers had split up some were coming through the holes shed made in the tent while others were circling the tent to try and cut her off she saw no glory or purpose in dying just now so she took to her heels her hand was bleeding leaving a distinct trail in the sand even a goblin could track her a single set of rapid footfalls closed in behind her when they got close enough she threw herself on her face and let the assassin overrun her in a flash she was up and had run him through he dropped to his knees she dodged in front of him and tore the hood from his head he was an elf a silvanesti placing her bare foot on his chest she shoved him onto his back with her sword tip at his throat she cried why are you doing this who put you up to it he writhed in agony his comrades were coming fast behind them kerian repeated her question letting her blade draw blood the prince he rasped the prince of khur thunderstruck she dropped to the sand beside the dying elf she took hold of his geb and dragged him up till they were nose to nose why why does shobbat want me dead for the throne of his father that made no sense but he was past answering any other questions the rest of the murderous band was upon her she snatched up the dead elfs sword in the weird light of windblown torches and red lightning the lioness went through the remaining assassins like a reaper through hay one of her early teachers was a master of twosword fighting which he always claimed was superior to any other type the secret he said was to let your opponent parry then counterstrike while his blade was engaged on this night she put his teachings to the ultimate test the assassins were nimble and capable fighters but they had never faced a warrior like the lioness one by one they fell stabbed or slashed by one of her whirling blades none fled their orders were clear the last fellow fought best against her slicing a bloody line on her right arm and another on her left cheek before she broke through and impaled him with both her swords at once he collapsed and she released her blades allowing his dead body to carry them to the ground for a moment she stood covered in their blood and her own breath coming in gasping gulps then the strength left her legs she dropped to her knees then fell facedown onto the bloody hardpacked ground chapter the cavalry spent fruitless hours sweeping the dunes for favaronas worried but unable to delay further glanthon resumed the trek southwest the sun was touching the western dunes painting the broad desert in shades of gold when glanthon rode to the top of a sand ridge overlooking the caravan trail to kortal it was always a busy trail thick with long trains of plodding donkeys burdened by panniers of goods or herds of goats and shaggy desert sheep hundreds of khurish nomads plied the caravan route every day carrying goods from south to north and back trade had never ceased even during the most terrifying days of the late war the trail was empty today as far as glanthon could see in both directions nothing stirred but the wind carrying streams of sand across the packed roadbed inathwakenti had seemed the most isolated spot in the world after its emptiness glanthon would have welcomed the company even of scruffy humans instead he found their isolation persisting he descended the ridge to the road years of traffic had left it sunken a foot deep from horseback he could tell that not only had no one passed by today no one had passed by in several days the desert wind constant as breath had erased all but a few prints in another day thered be no marks left at all had some calamity overtaken kortal war plague sand stormsmany possibilities sprang to mind the rest of the expedition appeared on the ridge glanthon whistled and waved them down of the five hundred riders and three scholars whod left khurinost with kerianseray just under three hundred remained to be honest glanthon found the most recent loss of favaronas cut him the deepest because the archivist had vanished while he himself was in charge his secondincommand a qualinesti named arimathan rode up glanthon hailed him we seem to be alone in the world what do you make of this strange situation the nomads are gone said the laconic arimathan yes but where have they gone no sooner had glanthon said this than an awful answer entered his mind form up two lines he barked all who have bows string them keep them braced and ready the elves obeyed but questioned him with puzzled looks the nomads have left their territory theyd only do that in the direst circumstances and where would they go khurikhan they must have gone to khurikhan he chivvied his elves until all were ready the entire command set out at a trot down the caravan road anxiety knotted glanthons chest he could be wrong but he didnt think so it all made terrible sense the nomads having decided to drive the foreigners from their land were no longer satisfied to fight the lionesss small band of explorers they had gathered their people together and ridden to khurikhan to strike at the source of the laddad contagion to destroy khurinost shobbat sat in a heavy mahogany chair regarding an elegant goblet the silver had been hammered paperthin the bowl was small as a childs fist and from certain angles translucent allowing the delicate amber nectar inside to shine through the utmost care and concentration were required to handle and drink from such an ethereal cup each one was unique made by an elf artisan enjoined by law to create only a single such vessel every ten years since the coming of the laddad to khur shobbat had acquired sixteen of these precious vessels hed ruined four before learning how to hold them these socalled cloud cups were among his most treasured possessions relics of a vanishing culture that would not rise again if he had his way not one of his handpicked assassins had returned he found this very unsettling so much so hed had to set the cloud cup on the table at his elbow in his current state of agitation he would surely snap the slender stem and crush the airy fineness of the bowl since the laddad soon would be extinct he must preserve those of their arts he found attractive surely enough time had passed for his hirelings to carry out their mission how hard was it to kill one female even as he posed the question to himself he knew the answer in the case of the lioness very hard indeed the resources of the knights of neraka been devoted to capturing or killing her for many ineffective years thats why shobbat had hired silvanesti for the task these particular elves had no attachment to kerianseray they didnt revere her past deeds as the qualinesti did and like most who had once lived in luxury they had not adapted well to their current poverty shobbat merely added plenty of steel to their own sense of noble purpose as elves they had the stealth and senses to reach the lioness he thought it a neat solution to a thorny problem every hunter knows that the best way to trap a jackal is with a trained jackal shobbat didnt like elves even in exile they reeked of smug superiority and condescension on the other hand he didnt hate them hate was a failing only the lowly could afford a king must be above such petty sensations lest they cloud his mind no the destruction of the elves was simply a necessary action if he was to circumvent the oracles prophecy they had to go and that was that it wasnt murder but an act of statesmanship monarchsand monarchstobedid not commit crimes the elves represented an obstacle to his attaining the throne of khur hed overcome so many others the meddling hengriff who was nearly as smug as the laddad the high priest minok no one would ever find him and the smooth laddad schemer morillon removing him had been a spur of the moment decision shobbat realized morillon had too much of the khans ear to be allowed to live too often his clever tongue unhinged shobbats carefully arranged plans hed made certain the laddad noble was found his death sowed doubt about sahimkhans authority and confusion about his loyalties shobbat had failed to kill the laddad king but even wounding him had been very helpful the laddad blamed torghanists for the crime just as the sons of the crimson vulture blamed sahimkhan for the disappearance of their high priest everyone was in a proper turmoil and at the right moment shobbat would step forward to restore order and bring glory to khur once again only two more needed to die before shobbat moved against his father one was the laddad queen and the other the slippery sorcerer faeterus shobbat knew he would have the most trouble with the mage faeterus came and went like smoke through a chimney making him difficult to poison or stab perhaps the best way to get rid of a mage was to use magic the night crept by like a craven cur fearful of being noticed shobbats servants had long since retired leaving their master alone in his sitting room on the east side of the royal citadel he passed the time by considering how he would redecorate the private quarters of the khan once he held that position his father reveled in the acquisition of wealth a trait shobbat shared but sahim had no taste no sense of style his quarters were a jumble of possessions thrown together without any regard for arrangement or aesthetics why didnt even one of his hired blades return with news of success or failure perhaps kerianseray had managed to evade death shobbat considered the worst possible case that she had discovered her masked assailants were elves and forced one to reveal who hired him what would she do then she would go to her husbandnot for protection but to get her lieges sanction for her vengeance but gilthas was still very ill kerianseray had forbidden holy saida even to see him shobbat was in the most secure place in khur he had already destroyed an important knight of neraka he had little to fear from one laddad female even one so fierce as the lioness except for her barbaric ploy with the sand beast kerianseray hadnt stirred from the elven camp since her husband was wounded he put out his hand and let the weight of the goblet rest on his fingertips he brought it to his mouth one never touched a cloud cup with ones lips instead he held it a hairs breadth above his open mouth and allowed a slender stream of nectar to pour from the cup and down his throat kerian did not return to the speakers tent wounded she continued on to her original destination the one place she felt she belonged the warriors enclave almost half the army was in the field patrolling the desert outside khurinost the rest were astonished when she staggered in amongst them wan and bleeding they settled her on a stool and put a clay cup of raisin wine in her hand an elf knelt by her and began to dress her sword cuts the khurs are plotting against us she declared describing her narrow escape from assassins she did not mention her attackers were silvanesti more important was the one who had hired them they killed lord morillon tried to kill the speaker and theyve tried to slay me twice what shall we do commander asked a qualinesti veteran she opened her mouth to give orders then closed it with a snap she gulped sweet raisin wine then said i am no longer commander of the army the speaker has relieved me surprise did not rob them of their voices numerous warriors demanded to know why i was told that my transgressions were these i left my company in the field to fly to my husbands side i fought nomads who attacked me first she lifted her head and stared at the elves around her i who have fought with all my strength to save the elven race from destruction i continue to fight if youll follow me we can save our people her appeal met with a mixed reaction the warriors of long service whether silvanesti or qualinesti found the idea of flouting the speakers authority deeply troubling others younger fighters whod known no other leader than the lioness were not so hesitant two stood then six then ten vowing to follow the lioness wherever she led in moments nearly half the warriors present had declared for her it was to the rest that she addressed herself i know you wish to keep faith with the speaker that is your choice but know this he is consumed by a dream to transplant the elven nation to a hidden valley in the khalkist mountains the place from which i have just returned i tell you now that valley is no place for us it is rife with strange magic which cost our band a dozen warriors and there is no game no deer no rabbits not even insects or birds live in the valley she paused to watch the elf work on her hand then added theres only one true home for us the home in which we were born i swear i will dedicate my life to freeing those homes from the foreign oppressors who hold them now the speakershe swallowed hardhas given the homeland up he thinks we can live happily in a tiny foreign valley kept safe only by the good graces of the khan of khur and our neighbors beyond the mountains the knights of neraka her stirring heartfelt speech moved many of the holdouts to declare for her but a number of warriors still remained silent they stood and made to leave the warriors communal tent a few younger elves moved to stop them but kerian waved them off let them go she said theyre honorable warriors they must follow their own hearts theyll go to the speaker one of her supporters pro they should he needs to know where we stand the officers dispersed to rouse their sleeping troops even should some of the troops switch sides kerian reckoned she would have seven to eight thousand elves pledged to her that would give gilthas pause it was one thing to consider arresting a few malcontents quite another to restrain eight thousand seasoned warriors by the time kerians loyalists assembled on the north side of khurinost dawn was breaking a column of riders appeared from the south heading straight for them this was the night patrol led by taranath hed mistaken kerians band for his morning relief as economically as she could kerian explained she had broken with gilthas she didnt try to minimize her own failings but laid out the whole tale taranath listened in silence and when she was done said this is the wrong course commander youre splitting the army and a divided host is a weakened host the most ardent among her supporters began to shout challenges at taranath demanding to know whether he believed it was their destiny to regain their lost lands before he could answer a third column of riders emerged from khurinost and rode steadily toward them at their head was old hamaramis in full martial splendor with him were the officers who had first declined to stand with kerian when hamaramis drew near he called lady give over your sword to me at once those are the speakers orders his use of her title rather than her rank caused her to flinch slightly some of the older elves tended to prefer her title as a matter of course but the difference had taken on a new significance now that gilthas had dismissed her recovering she smiled a dark and dangerous smile if the speaker wants my sword hell have to ask for it in person please dont provoke a fight lady taranath pleaded quietly then dont fight me taran join me the sky above was still cloudy but a narrow band of clear air lay on the eastern horizon the disk of the rising sun shone through that clear band flooding the desert with roseate light the brilliance only made the clouds appear even darker by contrast what will it be she asked our swords together hilt to hilt or opposed point to point an elfin taranaths company interrupted drawing their attention to the city the battlements of khurikhan bristled with signal flags even as the elves turned to look the deep blat of rams horns rang out from the city sounding a general alarm the khurs think were going to attack growled hamaramis and so we should kerian retorted take the city make it the base from which our campaign begins the old general twice her age stared at her from under his dented gilded helmet youve gone mad lady he said soberly utterly mad the conclave was interrupted again a trio of elven scouts came galloping across the western desert bent low over their racing steeds before they reached the mass of cavalry one rider slid from his horse his back bristled with arrows the other two kept coming they rode straight into the center of the three forces gathered on the slight rise west of khurikhan somewhat confused by the presence of three senior commanders they saluted the lioness commander an army of nomads approaches hamaramis was all set to inform them that he not the lioness was in command but their news drove the words from his lips consternation was general and loud only the lioness seemed unfazed how many and where she snapped some ten thousand nomads were approaching from the west one scout reported they were no more than six miles away recollecting himself hamaramis called for couriers one he sent to carry the news to the speaker three others were to ride through khurinost alerting the people in general what are the people to do then kerian demanded her horse began to prance sensing her agitation follow me and well stop the nomads before they reach the tents they may not be hostile said hamaramis though even he did not believe this the last time so great a concentration of nomads had assembled in khur was to aid salahkhan against the hordes of malys khurish tribes didnt congregate in such numbers for any purpose but war from the ranks of hamaramiss escort emerged hytanthas ambrodel the captain was still bandaged from his encounters with the manticore and sand beast commander shall i fetch eagle eye he said raising his voice to be heard over the ceaseless bleating of the horns in khurikhan no time for that kerian looked west from whence ten thousands nomads approached just cut his tether she added hell seek me out he hurried away as she wrenched her horse around general hamaramis an enemy is near you can arrest me later right now we have a battle to fight she spurred forward with her loyalists streaming after her without being ordered the elves from the night patrol behind taranath broke ranks and followed as well hamaramiss two hundred warriors stirred anxious to join their comrades some called for permission to ride after the lioness hamaramis said the speaker of the sun and stars earnestly wishes to avoid war those are his orders i obey my speaker turning his horse hamaramis started back down the low dune for khurinost now alive with alarm the first two rows of his warriors followed him but the rest remained rooted where they were dividing desperate glances between the disappearing lioness and their valiant old leader someone finally snapped reins with a loud crack and bolted after the lioness most others joined in leaving taranath hamaramis and a couple dozen or so riders behind dawns light washed taranaths agonized expression i want to go too he whispered so do i hamaramis unbuckled his helmet and pried it off barely sunup and already he was sweating but being a soldier means more than lusting for battle it means you obey the orders of your lawful superiors if you dont youre no more than a barbarian he replaced his helmet proudly the old warrior returned to his speaker with him went fourteen warriors general taranath fought his conscience for a few seconds more then rode off with a handful of others to join the lioness for today he was a barbarian from a ridge northwest of the city adala scrutinized khurikhan by the muted light of the cloudy new day the place was little more than a brown smudge above the desert sands but it was the first true city shed ever seen for days in advance of her arrival shed sent spies into khurikhan to learn what sahimkhan and the laddad were doing the news they brought was very troubling the laddad came and went as they pleased while the khans soldiers had violated the temple of torghan and arrested his holy priests the holy ones were being blamed for an attack upon two laddad an attack most likely done by thieves or beggars to the chiefs and warmasters gathered with adala it sounded as though the foreigners had sahimkhan doing their bidding what shall we do weyadan asked hagath chief of the mikku in the still air the bearded men were sweating profusely even lifelong desertdwellers needed a breeze adala gathered the long braid of her hair and pulled it forward over her shoulder this helped cool her neck only a little i will speak to the khan of the laddad she announced the men were shocked what purpose could there be in talking to the foreign invaders their necks are on the block if the laddad swear to leave our homeland i would let them go what about the massacre of our parents wives and children cried bindas with her eyebrows and eyelashes singed off adalas face looked stark and fearless the guilty will not escape their lives are part of our price if the laddad khan gives over the killers of our people then his nation may depart in peace but they must go out from khur bindas asked who should go with her to meet the elves adala proposed they all go she felt it would be best for the chiefs and warmasters of the tribes to hear what the foreigners said and how she answered them the party rode out flanked by riders carrying spears with inverted water jugs on their points the traditional nomad symbol of truce at adalas command the men kept their swords sheathed and bows unstrung she herself went unarmed as always during their discussions thunder had rumbled as they crested a long ridge a fork of lightning flashed directly over adalas party and thunder cracked immediately the horses shied but the anxious horde of nomads let out a cheer those on high were signifying their favor again anyone could see it the fire from on high followed the weyadan and did not harm her a small patrol of elven cavalry saw the party of nomads come trotting out of the desert the patrol had not yet heard of the nomad hordes approach but they were wary of the small band in front of them one of the elves recognized the truce sign and explained to his captain the meaning of the upsidedown pots on the escorts spears send a message to lord planchet the captain said calmly tell him some nomads are paying us a friendly visit he turned to the courier emphasize friendly the sun had risen beyond the clear air on the eastern horizon and was once more sheathed in clouds the courier galloped in and out of uncharacteristic sprinkles of rain by the time they entered khurinost horse and rider were trailing wisps of steam the speaker and his closest advisors were assembled in the circular audience hail in his repaired tent one by one various couriers relayed their news word of kerianserays revolt set the councilors humming when this was paired with notice of the arrival often thousand nomads the conversation grew heated indeed gilthas had sent orders for kerian to halt her advance on the nomads and return to khurinost but he had no confidence she would heed his command the sodden courier delivered his news that nomad leaders wished to meet with the speaker of the sun and stars and that they carried the nomad symbol for a friendly parley with that the room fell still gilthas said i will meet them great speaker no planchet burst out its not wise or safe let me go in your stead healed of his fever and wound the speaker still was weak and found it difficult to walk or stand for extended periods seeing the leader of the elves in such a state might embolden the nomads reluctantly gilthas was forced to agree with his old friends assessment there was no time to organize an aweinspiring procession of elven strength from his days in masquerade hytanthas ambrodel had learned enough about the nomads to tell the speaker they would not respect planchet if he showed up alone or in too ragged a fashion so a fine white horse was secured for the speakers valet with a retinue that included a hundred mounted warriors and captain ambrodel planchet rode out of khurinost first he must head off the lioness the parley would be pointless if she launched an attack he found her leading eighteen thousand warriors over half the elven army along the ridge northwest of khurikhan her headlong charge had slowed to a walk as her wellhoned tactical sense took over shed sent out numerous scouts and was awaiting their return when planchets delegation overtook her lady in the name of the speaker of the sun and stars i command you to return to khurinost with all your riders planchet said i answer to a higher power than the speaker now she replied reining up the elven people the nomads have asked for a parley are you so bent on war you wont let me talk to them she shrugged talk all you want it wont change a thing the khurs want our blood time was short amid echoing thunder planchet put his white horse next to kerians bay stay your hand lady he urged for one hour i beg of you like the ardent young officers at her back he held his breath he could watch the thoughts progress across her face like the play of sun and shadows on the desert sands despite the shared years that lay between them he had no certainty she would give him the time he needed at last she nodded for an old friend one hour less if the nomads move against khurinost planchet nodded and dug in his spurs his entourage bolted down the dune after him relief at the lionesss agreement quickly faded swallowed by new worry the valet felt like an impostor for all his gifts he did not have the regal bearing or poise that came naturally to his liege his physique was long but slightly stooped his hair bleached dead white by the khurish sun he was no ones idea of a kingor khan for that matter the chiefs of the nomads heard the horn blasts and saw dust trails rising into the leaden sky adala was bent forward on little thorns back hands busily working wapah saw she had a small rattan basket the binding on the rim had become frayed and she was replacing it with a fresh strand of grass the khan of the laddad wapah whispered she nodded i will be done before he arrives as the elves drew closer the nomad chiefs and warmasters sat up straighter on their sturdy ponies the elves were mounted on longlegged horses making them seem taller seated as she was on her faithful donkey adala was the lowest person in the entire group she was also as always the only woman present she gave no sign of noticing any of this instead she finished her repair of the basket working the ends of the new rim into place then hung the container from the short horn on her saddle the elf on the white horse leading the others stopped looking up and down the line of nomad chiefs he announced i am planchet councilor to the speaker of the sun and stars monarch of all the elves mild surprise rippled through the human assembly he had spoken in khur adala seemed unimpressed she replied in the common tongue i am adala fahim saran di kyre weyadan of the weyalu and keeper of the maita i would speak to your khan now the elves were caught off guard planchet regarded the blackdraped motherly woman with surprise clearly he had expected to be dealing with one of the fiercelooking men our speaker is engaged i represent him he said and i speak for the weyalu the mikku the tondoon and the mayakhur you are the leader of all those tribes in this cause by the will of those on high i am i am honored to meet you how shall i address you she is weyadan or maita wapah offered some of the chiefs glowered at him for speaking out of turn planchet recognized the second word as meaning something like destiny or luck he chose the other less emotional title i am honored to meet you weyadan there are many swords here today how can we keep them in their scabbards many transgressions have been committed against our people by the laddad i tell you only two you are foreigners and you are invaders we have the permission of sahimkhan to dwell in his country planchet countered sahimkhan will answer to those on high for his venality so shall we all weyadan adalas dark eyes hardened you send spies to measure our land you have entered a valley sacred to those on high this is sacrilege our speaker meant no blasphemy planchet replied evenly we need a place to live where the climate is not so harsh he heard the valley of the blue sands was such a place we had never heard it was sacred we thought only that there we would be out of your desert and away from your cities desecration was not our intention a snort of disbelief came from one of the younger warmasters the chiefs around him although plainly just as skeptical glowered at him for his breech of manners adala never took her eyes from planchet whats done is done and you must answer for it we must dwell some place weyadan it is the right of every living being to have a home you had homes and lost them the gods have turned their backs on you laddad from his place behind planchet hytanthas listened to the exchange with growing annoyance he had expected the nomads leader to be a simple uncouth fanatic this woman was neither there was strength in her strength even the young qualinesti recognized but while planchet was mindful of the diplomatic niceties she persisted in hurling insults and epithets planchet tried to reason around adala saying dark forces had conspired to deprive the elves of their homelands and they sought only to take their fate in their own hands and find a new sanctuary if some customs of the desert folk had been transgressed he regretted it but the survival of the elven race required bold measures what of the customs of war adala asked her entire demeanor suddenly eloquent of barely suppressed fury the custom that one does not murder wives and mothers children and the aged those who cannot fight the tenor of the meeting changed instantly hatred emanated from the nomads like the heat of the desert planchet was taken aback after the lionesss illconceived but undeniably dramatic gesture with the dead sand beast hed put the rumored massacre out of his mind like the citydwelling khurs the elves now believed that if the deaths had happened they were the work of a wild beast unfortunately the nomads knew nothing about that or about the possible involvement of the rogue faeterus they still blamed the lionesss troops for the deaths of their families hoping her answer would help him formulate a response planchet asked adala to explain her accusations hundreds of weyalu were murdered near the entrance to the valley of the blue sands no warriors were present only children women old people yet every one was cruelly slain not simply put to the sword but ripped to pieces then set afire why do you think we are responsible he asked we found tracks of laddad horses of a laddad army nearby the khans soldiers were in the city and no foreign soldiers have come over the mountains since the red beast perished the only killers in the area were the laddad army and its female warmaster hytanthas could remain silent no longer before planchet could speak the younger elf burst out general kerianseray didnt slaughter anyone it was a sand beast controlled by the will of an evil sorcerer it nearly killed me too his outburst provoked the nomads the younger warmasters actually drew swords planchet alarmed raised a placating hand at his back he heard the concerted creak of a hundred elven bows being drawn all because of this simple gesture if his arm fell the nomads would die stay your hands planchet said sharply realizing his error adala spoke with equal harshness to her nomads swords were grudgingly sheathed bowstrings relaxed adalas gaze skewered hytanthas the speakers woman led the laddad in the desert she said that i know who is this sorcerer you speak of at planchets nod hytanthas told her what they had learned of faeterus that he was in the khans pay was perhaps an elf but certainly a criminal and had caused the massacre with one of his nefarious creatures the nomad delegation muttered among themselves adala appeared to weigh something in her mind found an answer then folded her hands across her donkeys neck very well planchet of the laddad tell your speaker this those on high teach us mercy is the gift of the strong so i grant you mercy you may go in peace the elven warriors were astonished planchet less so go where weyadan he asked anywhere beyond the borders of khur and if we refuse eye to eye adala stared at her opponent in her black matrons robes the weyalu woman did not look much like the loyal bodyguard of the elven speaker but inside their hearts were made of the same stern stuff both knew it then there will be war terrible war with no conclusion but annihilation adalas words sent a chill through everyone present an instant later a cold breeze swept over the dunes carrying heavy droplets of rain and more than a little sand members of both delegations were shifting on their mounts eyeing each other muttering to their comrades planchet did not move he kept his attention on the weyadan she had not moved either and something told him she was not done yet he was right in exchange for this mercy she said you must give us the slayers of our families both of them we will do them justice at that hytanthas jostled forward planchet snagged his reins stopping him well short of the nomads but bilath bindas and hagath of the mikku interposed themselves between their leader and the furious young elf our commander is not a murderer hytanthas shouted as for the mage we want him too you cannot charge his crimes to us savages youre the ones who murdered lord morillon arent you what mercy did you show him he was left to rot in the desert with his throat slashed be silent planchet cried in as great a voice as anyone had ever heard him use go back to camp now snatching his reins free hytanthas galloped back through the lines of the escort he did not return to the city as ordered but galloped directly over the intervening sand hills to where the lioness was poised with her army only his wound had kept him from joining her in the first place not even that would stop him now adala looked to the dark sky would her maita come forth again would the fire from on high strike down the laddad or would the sun break free of its shroud and shine on her highlighting her righteous cause neither happened instead a squall of tepid rain lashed the motionless parties adala drew her veil close around her face and pointed an accusing finger at planchet it is on your head she intoned the choice of life or death war or peace is yours give over the speakers woman and the laddad sorcerer you have until the next sunrise ever after we are enemies he made no reply only sat stiffly in the saddle as the rain poured down adala turned little thorns head and trotted away her warmasters and chiefs filed behind her watching the elves warily for signs of treachery rain fell harder finally planchet tilted his head back to let the rain wash down his sorrowful face save us all from true believers he muttered sahimkhan strode briskly through the corridors of his citadel while horns blasted outside every living soul in the khuri yl nor was in motion running hither and yon carrying arms or foodstuffs or valuables deeper into the fortress sahim parted the chaos as he went even in their terror of a nomad attack servants moved nimbly out of his way in the citadel courtyard he found general hakkam and prince shobbat why are the nomads here sahim demanded hakkam said we dont know mighty khan the city gates have been shut and the garrison mustered on the walls shobbat put a soft fist to his lips and coughed discreetly his father roughly bade him speak up mighty khan the nomads obviously have come to make war on the laddad perhaps the torghanists stirred them up shobbat paused assuming a thoughtful air the laddad speaker sent an armed company to the khalkist mountains on a mysterious errand they violated weyalu territory and its said they massacred two thousand women and children in their beds the khan snorted a lie only two hundred were killed and it appears a sand beast committed that crime he turned to his general hakkam how many riders can you field five thousand on short notice mighty khan more given time gather your troops you are to drive the nomads back into the desert how dare they bear arms before my city when im done with them theyll think the sand beast a gentle pet hakkam bowed and was about to go when shobbat laid a hand on his fathers arm saying wait mighty khan hakkam paused and sahim looked at his son as if hed lost his mind shobbat released him adding quickly sire dont be too hasty perhaps this dire situation can yield a great harvest for khur let the fight go forward whoever wins khur will be a better place for the losers absence sahim made a fist and knocked his son to the ground with a single blow idiot dolt fool what are you thinking i have given the laddad my protection how strong will our neighbors think me if i allow the elves to be destroyed beneath the very walls of my capital by those i am supposed to rule when shobbat was felled activity in the courtyard and in the gatehouse ceased everyone halted to stare at the prince sitting on the ground his lips bleeding his scarletclad father standing over him like an avenging demon the powerful voice of sahimkhan filled the courtyard and consider this wastrel if the nomads lose more will come to avenge them if the laddad lose there will be no one left to pay for our repairs and your pleasures goaded beyond reason the khan drove the toe of his slippered foot into shobbats ribs dont presume to offer guidance to me again get out of my sight doubled over in real pain shobbat got to his feet and slunk away no one not sahim or hakkam or those in the courtyard saw the strange look of triumph that passed quickly over his face go general take your soldiers and drive the nomads back into the wastes at once mighty khan sahirn was still shaking with fury when he stalked into his private rooms his sons foolish words had given him an outlet for his fears but hadnt erased them from his mind his worry over the sudden appearance of the desert tribes so disturbed him that he didnt notice the figure standing by the wall in the seam of two great hanging tapestries only when it spoke did he whirl drawing the short sword concealed in his flowing robes when he saw who accosted him he uttered several choice curses such language said his visitor and from a king im in no mood for your tricks keth sahim said testily he tossed his sword onto a tiled tabletop and ran fingers through his beard kethamesh was a distant cousin a member of the same tribe as sahim and his private womanofallwork while he dropped heavily into a chair keth poured herself a cup of his best wine she lowered the dust veil from her face to drink long ago shed lost an eye and wore a tan leather patch over the empty socket her skin was tawny brown like that of many nomads but she had fair hair wisps of which escaped from her headdress she was a socalled yellow khur from the coastal lands of the extreme eastern part of sahims realm i found the mage but not the priest she reported she drained her cup then refilled it sahim had set her to find faeterus and minok when his legion of soldiers informers and spies failed in that task where is he below she answered tapping a foot on the stone floor she meant the system of caverns natural and manmade under the city they had been enlarged by sahims grandfather for use as cisterns but the water proved brackish and undrinkable the empty noisome caverns were a perfect retreat for the hunted faeterus if you know where he is go get him keth shook her head theres not enough money in the world to get me down there when he said he would order her to go she did something no one else in khurikhan would dare do she laughed at him im not one of your soldiers you cant order me anywhere sahim changed tack what of minok no trace at all he must be dead you havent earned your pay sahim told her sourly i hired you to find both and bring them to me she tossed a heavy purse on the rug at his feet your money farewell cousin call me again if you need anythingif youre still khan that is replacing her veil she went back to the secret door behind the tapestry sahim called for her to wait and she paused one sinewy hand on the fringed tapestry how can i get to the mage i cant leave him down there hatching plots unhindered he said you know assassins send some sahims laugh was bitter cutthroats will never take faeteruss measure i need someone better keth lowered her dust veil again there is a man or rather not a man a laddad bounty hunter called robien i worked with him once well bring him to me right away youll find him hard to work with why is he a drunkard worse she grinned hes honest and true not like you at all tired of her insolence he snapped just get him ill overlook his honesty if he can bring faeterus before me she bowed and went out the hidden door sahim listened to the horns still blowing outside the whole palace was quivering with marching soldiers and scurrying servants damn all the foreigners he fumed theyre as bad as those desert savages while the khan was surrounded by boiling excitement the speaker sat alone in his silent tent planchet and hamaramis were out tending to his business the servants had been given leave to be with their families gilthas had never felt so alone in all the years of separation from kerianseray while she lived and fought in the greenwood and he played the puppet king in qualinost he always had felt close to her they shared a connection that went beyond love beyond proximity during the terrible march into exile they were apart for weeks at a time each knowing the other might be killed at any moment but still they had been connected now she was gone in every sense of the word gone from his house gone from his city gone from his life he knew he had done his duty by removing her she had no vision no understanding of the delicate dangerous path they must tread if their race was to survive her way would lead to total destruction yet duty was small comfort to him it was a good thing to be alone no one should see the speaker of the sun and stars weep hytanthas brought the lioness the news from the parley the nomads were demanding her and the sorcerer faeterus as their price for peace the assembled warriors greeted this broadside with shouts of derision sounds like a good bargain kerian remarked commander hytanthas cried she stared out over the rolling dunes and at the dust raised by the nomad host on the move a great deal of dust from a great many horses it would be a fair bargain she said if they meant it unfortunately she was certain they did not mean it nomads wouldnt have come all this way just to avenge the camp massacre that was nothing more than a convenient excuse a wedge to pry apart the elves and sahimkhan the nomads had no intention of giving up everything for the heads of two elves they were on a mission to destroy every elf in khur still it sparked an idea she was confident her warriors could defeat the nomad host but the war thus started wouldnt end with this single battle more and more tribesmen would join the fight until the elves found themselves swamped by fanatics her dreams of retaking the elven homelands would founder beneath a horde of unshod hooves she studied the officers clustered around her horse the longest serving among them was a qualinesti named ramacanalas take command ramac she said im going to the nomads shouts erupted and hytanthas seized her horses bridle to keep her from riding away she broke his grip and silenced them all with a hardeyed glare im going remain here if the nomads move toward khurinost hit them as hard as you can with everything weve got theyll kill you hytanthas exclaimed the lioness favored him with an ironic smile not today chapter eight men abreast the khurish royal cavalry rumbled out the citys north gate their armor was a mix of native and nerakan style with pointed helmets angular breast plates and spiky knobs at every bend of knee elbow and ankle their favored weapon was a very heavy saber its blade shaped like a crescent moon their mantles had started out royal blue but long exposure to the harsh sun had faded them to the color of the spring sky over khurikhan the khurs were among the best soldiers hired by the dark knights but since the arrival of the elves sahimkhan had allowed the longstanding contract with neraka to lapse he had ample compensation from taxes fees and other official extort ions to replace the money paid by the order general hakkam rode at the head of the column flanked by standard bearers and heralds once the tail of the column cleared the city gate he halted his men and sent out flankers on both sides and well ahead to scout the situation the cavalry moved forward at a walk alert for ambushes in his long career hakkam had fought nomads before they were fearless hardy and addicted to surprise attacks he had no intention of losing men to or being humiliated by a rabble of tribesmen especially with the laddad as witness the scouts soon returned with strange news a sizable force of mounted laddad were on the north ridge watching the nomads the tribesmen were massed in the lake of dreams this dry depression six miles from khurikhan had earned its name because travelers commonly saw mirages of water in the broad hollow between dunes like the laddad the nomads were motionless waiting hakkam uttered an oath his lieutenants thought he was cursing the nomads or the laddad but in fact he was abusing the name of sahimkhan what had the master of khur sent him into forward he said facing his horse west at a leisurely walk five thousand khurish horsemen followed their general into the unknown shafts the clouds casting beams down on the glittering clanking procession unlike adala hakkam didnt take the light as a sign of godly favor it was shining in his mens eyes alone of all the nomads gathered on the dune ridge overlooking khurikhan adala slept after returning from the tense meeting with the laddad lord she finished some mending then lay down in her small tent and went to sleep rain and thunder did not disturb her nor did the presence of eighteen thousand armed laddad after midday the sky grew dark and swollen as if the heavy clouds would burst of their own weight soaking the land below sentinels galloped back to the nomad camp with peculiar news a single laddad rider was approaching bilath had sent a band of bowarmed weyalu to the high sandhill on the north side of the lake of dreams from there they could pick off anyone daring to enter the camp they might have dealt thus with the rider had not the sharpeyed warmaster of the tondoon haradi recognized her haradi had been with adala at the parley and had heard talk of the female laddad warmaster kerianseray also called the lioness this rider had burnished gold hair which fell unbound past her shoulders it must be the lioness etosh dispatched wapah to waken the weyadan wapah knelt outside the closed door flap of adalas tent and called softly she bade him enter he put his head inside keeping his eyes respectfully on the ground weyadan the female laddad warmaster comes alone she lay with her back to him without moving she said summon the chiefs and warmasters they will sit in judgment of the criminal it is maita he said sagely and then withdrew adala sat up slowly her head still ached as it had ached for the past three days the sky was responsible the clouds hung over the desert like a gravid beast shed never known air this ponderous it weighed on her so heavily she felt her skull would crack from the pressure the usual cure for headache chewing a leaf of the makadar bush had provided no relief at all she poured tepid water in a copper pan and washed her hands face neck and feet during her ablutions she blessed the names of her ancestors and called upon those on high to judge her deeds this day if she was found wanting in virtue or truth she begged the gods to strike her down a bundle lay just inside the entrance to her tent it proved to be a beautiful new robe of red linen handsomely embroidered in white the style and skill of the needlework marked it as having come from the women of the mayakhur tribe the collar and matching headdress were silk handdyed and fit for the khans consort but as much as adala respected the sentiment behind the gift she couldnt wear the beautiful robe this was not a feast day nor a day of celebration justice was to be done harsh justice it was not a time for festive clothes she put the new clothes aside and retied the sash of the muchmended black robe she wore every day and slept in as well taking up an ivory comba gift from her late husband kasamir and one of her few fine possessionsadala mastered her unruly hair lately she had noticed that some of the hairs the comb pulled out were not black but gray once her hair was smoothly braided she emerged from her tent every chief and warmaster awaited her they stood in a double line facing inward with adala at the apex small patches of daylight speckled the ground shining through rents in the ceiling of clouds turning to the weyalu on her right adala greeted bilath and etosh wapah stood a few steps behind them as he was neither chief nor warmaster then came yannash of the tondoon and his warmaster haradi then hagath of the mikku and so on down one line and up the other ending with the mayakhur leaders on adalas left she took an extra moment with wassim thanking the chief of the mayakhur for the embroidered robe given her by his women and explaining why she could not wear it today then she addressed herself to the entire gathering the day is coming she said for our land for justice we must be strong she spread her arms this land was granted us by those on high but only so long as we remain pure enough to hold it let the foreigners the killers of our children be purged from khur she spoke calmly but her last declaration brought a cheer from the assembly they raised their swords high and shouted maita maita maita beyond them the warriors of khur heard their chiefs and warmasters proclaiming their loyalty to adalas fate and they echoed it even more loudly again and again they roared voices soaring to the turbulent heavens and rolling out in all directions people for miles around could hear them raising his voice to be heard over the shouts bilath said weyadan what of the sorcerer and sahimkhan we came to impose justice on them too sahim will meet his fate but not today as for the supposed sorcerer i do not know him if he is guilty the gods will bring him to us adala frowned she could have forgiven sahimkhan his past transgressions if he had sent his soldiers to fight alongside her people but he had not he continued to cower behind his stone walls in time adala had no doubt her maita would deal with him too wapah brought little thorn forward and helped her climb onto the donkey let this day be long remembered she said it is the day justice was reborn in khur with these words and the acclaim of ten thousand voices adala rode to the lip of the lake of dreams trailed by her loyal chiefs and warmasters in their varying martial finery the mikku were the best armed but the tondoon were the most numerous they wore no metal at all reserving what iron and brass they had for their swords and daggers tondoon weaponry was highly prized at the top of the depression she halted little thorn the donkey lowered his head to munch on a clump of saltbush through the haze and warping heat rising from the sand she saw a single rider approaching on a tall bay horse archers on the hilltop followed her every move with arrows nocked with utter nonchalance the laddad woman came onward someone behind adala remarked on the elfs bravery adala shook her head it is not courage but arrogance she does not believe we can harm her haradi moved forward maita let me slay her i will do it for you for all the tribes of khur men no matter their tribe were united by a childish love of glory be still she said as to an impatient youngster the weyadan was wrong about one thing it wasnt arrogance that fueled kerians bravery but calm acceptance the archers on the hill didnt concern her because she knew the nomads wanted revenge not simply to kill her she knew she wouldnt die today knew it might be days before she died maybe longer on the other hand there was a possibility however slim that she would get out of this alive if she did then nothing would stop her goal to restore the fortunes of the elven nation after announcing her intention to turn herself over to the nomads she took the time to write several letters to her comrades and friends the last and shortest was to her husband save our people take them home she wrote that was all words didnt seem to matter anymore but maybe by this gesture she could restore gilthass will to do the right thing for their race twenty yards from the line of bedecked barbarian chieftains kerian halted her horse she wished eagle eye was here nothing made a grander or more frightening impression than a rampant silvanesti war griffon i hear you wanted to see me she called bilath shouted come closer it is not seemly to bellow at such a distance kerian made no move to comply so some of the warmasters started toward her she drew her sword in one fluid motion feeble daylight flashing off the elfforged blade the nomads stopped did you come to fight or surrender adala called fight the lioness never surrenders so saying she dug in her spurs and shot ahead leaning low over the horses neck arrows hissed into the sand behind her as she charged in moments she was among the nomad chiefs thrusting and slashing this ended the threat from the archers who couldnt loose at her without hitting their own leaders adala steered her donkey out of reach as kerian laid about on all sides she lopped the hand off a chief in a bright green geb then booted another in the ribs with her ironshod foot the nomads swords were keen but close in their lack of handguards was a grave disadvantage kerian cut off fingers of two warmasters who tried to flank her her blade hissing down their swords finding no crossguard to halt its run and biting into their hands unable to cope with this whirlwind up close the nomads flew apart like grains of sand before a storm gust shouts rang as the chiefs called for support then one nomad cried louder than the rest no i will take her for maita kerian now faced a single opponent haradi of the tondoon only twenty already he was warmaster of the most populous of the seven tribes he was handsome with olive skin green eyes and a closely trimmed beard he also had the only sword with a handguard in the nomad army the weapon was a relic of his fathers days as a nerakan mercenary the two combatants went round and round slashing probing finding no openings kerian had to keep one eye on the other nomads swirling close around her in case they tried to intervene none did with his blade inverted haradi stabbed at her face she diverted his sword enough to spare her eyes but not her left ear the tip of his sword tore through the shell of her ear an ugly painful wound she promptly repaid him with a thrust under his outstretched arm which pierced his armpit he gasped slumped forward and dropped his sword she would have finished him but the world around her exploded lightning flared and thunder crashed all of a sudden pitching kerian to the ground had any nomad come upon the lioness then he would have found her an easy kill the flash seared her eyes so severely she couldnt see all was white glare and roaring noise she couldnt have been hit directly by lightning shed be dead but the strike must have come very close in the midst of the intense dazzling light she saw a flicker of darkness gradually it grew more distinct became darker and more defined she heard the flutter of wings for a moment she thought it was eagle eye but it was not the majestic griffon that flashed past her bleeding face but a large bat why did she keep seeing bats she wondered though the question did not much trouble her she was floating in a strange disconnected netherworld a torrent of cold rain jerked her back to reality she found herself lying close behind her fallen horse the poor bay was dead its neck broken and her left leg was caught beneath its weight nearby was the nomad warriors mount also dead of the warrior himself she saw no sign men on horseback surged past her shaking off confusion and streaming rain she realized they were sahims royal cavalry not nomads or elves the heavily armored khurish horsemen had charged into the lake of dreams smashing the larger but disorganized nomad host and driving it back flying above the hardriding khurs were five balls of blue fire she rubbed her eyes and shook her head hard thinking her vision had been affected by the blast but the lights remained larger than the willothewisps at inathwakenti they flew more purposefully turning in a stately slow dance some thirty feet above the battlefield neither khurish cavalry nor khurish nomads seemed to notice them kerian wrenched her leg from under the dead horse and stood immediately the blue globes angled toward her they moved so swiftly she had no chance to dodge at their touch the world exploded once again in a crack of thunder and blaze of light the storm clouds dispersed quickly after the battle like a forgehammer the sun returned to beat down on the scene the lake of dreams was littered with the remnants of the flight hakkams cavalry reinforced by fresh contingents from the city had driven the nomads back so hard and fast their camp was overrun and abandoned to the khans men hakkam ordered the camp burned while the elves watched from khurinost a tent city not unlike their own was ruthlessly destroyed hakkam broke off his pursuit of the beaten nomads he and his men rode back to khurikhan to be greeted by the cheers of their people in the wake of the cavalrys departure came scavengers from khurikhan to poke in the ashes of the nomad camp by the khans law robbing those who had fallen in battle meant death despite this desperately poor or boldly greedy khurs stripped fallen warriors on both sides in the grand souks so much iron and brass turned up in the days following the battle the price of scrap metal fell by twothirds late in the day scroungers quartering the lake of dreams found a big bay horse quite unlike the usual nomad ponies the bay was trapped in the laddad fashion with a heavy war saddle and mail aprons protecting neck and hindquarters it lay dead at the edge of a sixfootwide hole in the sand the crater was lined with blackishgreen glass remnants of a lightning strike no riders body was found nearby thorough if not reverent the khurs stripped the horse of its trappings to do so they had to heave the dead animal up beneath it they found a thick pile of leaves still green though crisp and dry it seemed a weird discovery but none of the khurish scavengers recognized the leaves they had never seen the ash trees of more temperate climes exposed by the removal of the fallen horse the desiccated leaves whirled away on the wind and the dead the tondoon chief consulted the tally in his hand four thousand one hundred and sixteen slain or rendered incapable of further fighting he said solemnly adala thanked him she and her champions rode near the head of their war bands making for the safety of the deep desert ironfisted hakkam had finally ceased his pursuit not wanting to risk his cavalry in the deeper sands but still the nomads kept going west toward the lowering sun into the fastness of the desert the faces of the chiefs around her were grim practical as ever adala was noting the cuts and tears in their robes shed need an army of seamstresses to mend them all what now weyadan asked her kinsman bilath trying not to sound dispirited we continue the fight she answered simply this war isnt finished until one side or the other is undone we still live those who live can continue the fight but can we defeat the khan and the laddad the new chief of the tondoon othdan scowled and clenched the reins of his pony like bindas of the weyalu othdan was young only twentysix many of the old faces were gone othdan was succeeding two chiefs who had died fighting one had been fortyfour the next thirtyseven he reminded them of the scouts reports the laddad had at least ten thousand cavalry that had not entered the fray there were nods and murmurs of agreement the weyalu fighters remembered how fiercely even a small force of laddad cavalry had fought during the journey to the valley of the blue sands how can we stop such troops othdan said theyre too powerful too powerful to fight in open battle yes adala agreed but as ants devour the panther so can we overcome the laddad it will take patience and skill we must bind up our wounds and wait for our opportunity her stare burned into each of them like the blazing sun in the west none of us must forget the debt we owe our dishonored dead to avenge their murders and purify the land of khur of its foreign taint wearily the chiefs agreed and turned their mounts to gallop off and see to their men only wapah remained adala was silent for a long time so long that wapah thought she dozed but she wasnt sleeping she was thinking hard thoughts do you still believe in my maita she asked many think our defeat by the khans troops means those on high have abandoned us i believe he said simply then because he was wapah the philosopher he added does the herd know the mind of the shepherd adala weyadan virtue will triumph your maita will triumph for a moment a smile played over one corner of her mouth good old wapah how can you be so sure your maita must triumph if we are given the choice between good and evil it follows there is value to making the choice evil means chaos and the end of our lives since sane people do not willingly end their lives we choose good so we may survive for the world to survive good must triumph in the face of such confidence adala did not mention her own doubts sheer power had saved the laddad this time such force was itself neither good nor bad the morality lay in how it was used as a sword could kill an innocent child or a fiendish enemy if adala and her people were to prove victorious they needed power of their own before they faced the laddad in open battle striding the halls of the khuri yl nor prince shobbat stopped every so often and looked back into the shadowed recesses behind him he kept hearing noisesrustlings and soft scrapings like the scrabbling of rats it was not rodents but assassins he feared hengriffs death might stir trouble with the dark knights but the order had no patience with bunglers they might blame hengriff for his own death for mingling too intimately in khurish affairs either way their next emissary would have to be a far more clever plotter to get the better of shobbat he smiled at the thought the expression ended in a wince of pain his father had a hard fist shobbats jaw was well bruised the stone walls jealously hoarded every sound inside them as shobbat entered his private quarters again he heard a soft rustling sound as of padded feet turning quickly he saw them haifa dozen monstrosities like the ones the oracle of the tree had shown him lurked in the shadows along the far wall of his sitting room animals with human heads and humans with animal heads terror ran its icy fingers through his gut but he refused to give in to his fear the creatures werent real they were only hallucinations a product of his weariness and the ache in his head hed had a very trying day he closed his eyes tight then opened them it worked the monstrosities were gone he laughed in relief in answer six inhuman voices chuckled and growled the elves whod chosen to follow the lioness returned to khurinost somber and chastened their leader was gone and shortly after she rode away to give herself to the nomads sahimkhans warriors fell on the unsuspecting tribes like a thunderbolt the elven warriors had accomplished little this day the nomads were in headlong flight for the safety of the deep desert the body of lady kerianseray had not been found none knew whether she was dead or alive the speaker of the sun and stars awaited the return of his prodigal warriors in a small pavilion pitched just outside the northern edge of khurinost with him were planchet and hamaramis he leaned on a cane crafted from a spear shaft decorating the front of its wooden handle was a squarecut amethyst the gift hed received from the old gemcutter weeks before hytanthas ambrodel was among the returning riders the young qualinesti broke ranks and approached he dismounted before the speaker captain ambrodel what word do you bring me a sad one great speaker there is still no sign of lady kerianseray gilthas had feared as much hed ordered the lake of dreams searched for any trace of his consort the captain had led the search himself the speaker sent him back to the returning riders hamaramis cleared his throat great speaker what of the warriors who mutinied they disobeyed their commanders and followed lady kerianseray against your orders they must be punished from their faces gilthas thought theyd been punished already the old general obviously did not discipline must be maintained sire hamaramis added punish over half the army what would that do to morale gilthas said gloomily planchet intervened certain zealots can be singled out great speaker after a pause gilthas nodded dont treat them too harshly he said their loss is my loss he swayed a little despite his cane smoothly planchet eased a stool behind him and he sat the valet hid his own worry but hed begun to wonder whether the speaker would ever be whole again the khurish priestesses had cured him yet he was still so weak the silver in his hair more pronounced gilthas was not much older than captain ambrodel but he seemed a generation removed sahimkhan has done us a great service today the valet suggested the nomads had been repulsed without the loss of elven lifesave one perhaps i wonder how much hell charge us for the service hamaramis muttered sourly gilthas gazed over the dunes that filled the landscape around the tent city the tan hills seemed to him the body of a vast sleeping giant lying on its side sahim will not get another copper from us this incident proves the time has come for us to go hands cupped over the head of his cane gilthas looked up at his loyal friends first hamaramis then planchet to inathwakenti the valley of the blue sands is the place hospitable asked planchet what of the dangers lady kerianseray mentioned we have many scholars and sages among us they will unravel the mysteries besides gilthas frowned there are dangers here too and they will grow greater if we stay the nomads had been driven back but only temporarily they would recover and return using the desert as a shield against sahims powerful but ponderous army plots in the city would continue so long as the sons of the crimson vulture agitated against the elves the rogue sorcerer faeterus was still at large compared to these pressing ills how terrible could inathwakenti be gilthas saw his retinue watching him and he knew their troubled thoughts he too sometimes wondered whether he had become obsessed with a spot on an old map was it sanctuary or delusion the only way to know the truth was to go there as inevitable as drawing breath his thoughts returned to kerian he refused to count her as dead he would know in his heart if her life had ended more likely she had been carried off by the nomads to whom shed so valiantly surrendered herself he already had resolved to send a small band of warriors to determine her fate and rescue her if possible he would put hytanthas ambrodel in charge however far the nomads went however long it took the dedicated captain would follow if kerian had been slain gilthas must know if she was adalas prisoner he must get her back the one thing he could not do was remain any longer in khurikhan sahims resources would be invaluable in the search for kerianseray but the elves must leave him on good terms if they tarried gilthas risked losing the entire elven nation the survival of his people must outweigh the welfare of his wife dreams were murky things as the sun settled low between the western dunes and the hot blue sky cooled to the colors of fire gilthas closed his eyes and let his chin rest on his hands they were all such a long way from home like children they were trying to find their place in the world but children he mused didnt usually have half a continent trying to kill them trying many had tried and failed the ancient race of elves firstborn of the world would not be swept into oblivion without a mighty struggle they would call on every scrap of strength talent and enterprise to save themselves a hundred thousand had followed their speaker into exile after the dual destructions of their homelands from this core of strength this seed a new elven nation would grow all that was needed was a sanctuary to allow the seedling to take root dreams were awake gilthas opened his eyes to the dying sun
