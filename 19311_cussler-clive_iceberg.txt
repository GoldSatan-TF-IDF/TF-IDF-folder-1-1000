clive cussler iceberg prologue the druginduced sleep wore off into nothingness and the girl began the agonizing struggle back to consciousness a dim and hazy light greeted her slowly opening eyes while a disgusting putrid stench invaded her nostrils she was nude her bare back pressed flat against a damp yellow slimecoated wall it was unreal an impossibility she tried to tell herself upon awakening it had to be some kind of horrifying nightmare then suddenly before she had a chance to fight the panic mushrooming inside her the yellow slime on the floor rose and began working up the thighs of her defenseless body terrified beyond all reason she began screaming screaming insanely as the abomination crawled ever upward over the naked sweating skin her eyes bulged from their sockets and she struggled desperately it was uselessher wrists and ankles were chained tightly to the oozecovered surface of the wall slowly ever slowly the ungodly slime crept across her breasts and then just as the unspeakable horror touched the girls lips a vibrating roar and a phantom unseen voice echoed throughout the darkened chamber sorry to interrupt your study period lieutenant but duty calls lieutenant sam neth snapped the book in his hands shut dammit rapp he said this to the sourfaced man seated beside him in the cockpit of the droning aircraftevery time i come to an interesting part you butt in ensign james rapp nodded toward the book its paperback cover illustrating a girl struggling in a pool of yellow slimekept afloat rapp deduced by a pair of immense buoyant breasts how can you read that crap crap neth grimaced painfully not only do you invade my privacy ensign you also fancy yourself my personal literary critic he threw his big hands up in mock despair why do they always assign me a copilot whose primitive brain refuses to accept contemporary style and sophistication neth reached over and placed the book in a crudely constructed rack hanging from the side panel by a coat hanger several dogeared magazines depicting the unclothed female body in numerous seductive positions also rested in the rack making it quite apparent that neths taste in literature didnt exactly take in the classics neth sighed then straightened up in his seat and peered through the windshield at the sea below the united states coast guard patrol plane was four hours twenty minutes into a dull and routine eighthour iceberg surveillance and charting mission visibility was diamondclear under a cloudless sky and the wind barely moved the rolling swellsa unique condition for the north atlantic in the middle of march in the cockpit neth with four of the crew members piloted and navigated the huge fourengined boeing aircraft while the other six crewmen took up office in the cargo section eyeballing the radar scopes and other scientific instruments neth checked his watch and then turned the plane on a sweeping arc settling the nose on a straight course toward the newfoundland coast so much for duty neth relaxed and reached for his horror book please show a little initiative rapp no more interruptions till we make st johns ill try rapp responded dourly if that books so absorbing how about letting me borrow it when youre finished neth yawned sorry i make it a point never to lend out my private library suddenly the headset crackled in his ear and he picked up a microphone okay hadley what have you got back in the dimly lighted belly of the plane seaman first class buzz hadley stared intently at the radar set his face reflecting an unearthly green glow from the scope i have a weird reading sir eighteen miles bearing threefourseven neth clicked the mike switch come come hadley what do you mean by weird are you reading an iceberg or have you tuned your set into an old dracula movie maybe hes picking up your sexy terror novel rapp grunted hadley came back on judging from the configuration and size its a berg but my signal is much too strong for ordinary ice very well neth sighed well have a looksee he frowned at rapp be a good boy and bring us around to course threefourseven rapp nodded and turned the control column executing the course change the plane accompanied by the steady roar of the four pratttney piston engines and their endless vibrating beat gently banked toward a new horizon neth picked up a pair of binoculars and trained them on the unending expanse of blue water he adjusted the focus knobs and held the glasses as steady as possible against the quivering movement of the aircraft then he glimpsed ita white inanimate speck sitting serenely on a glistening sapphire sea slowly the iceberg grew larger inside the two circular walled tunnels of the binoculars as the cockpits windshield closed the distance then neth picked up the microphone what do you make of it sloan lieutenant jonis sloan the chief ice observer aboard the patrol plane was already studying the berg through a halfopen cargo door behind the control cabin runofthemill garden variety sloans robotlike voice came over the earphones a tabular berg with a mesa top id guess about two hundred feet high probably about one million tons runofthemill neth sounded almost surprised garden variety thank you sloan for your highly enlightening description i can hardly wait to visit there someday he turned to rapp whats our altitude rapp kept his eyes glued straight ahead one thousand feet the same altitude weve been at all day and yesterday and the day before that just checking thank you neth interrupted pontifically youll never know rapp how increasingly secure my old age becomes with your able talents at the controls he fitted a battered pair of flying goggles to his eyes braced himself for the blasting cold and opened his side window for a closer look here she is motioning to rapp make a couple of passes and we shall see what we shall see it took only a few seconds for neths face to feel like the embattled surface of a pin cushion the icy air tore at his skin until it thankfully turned numb he gritted his teeth and kept his eyes glued to the berg the huge ice mass looked like a ghostly clipper ship under full sail as it floated gracefully beneath the cockpit windows rapp eased the throttles back and twisted the controls slightly sending the patrol plane into a wide sweeping bank to port he ignored the bank and turn indicator and judged his angle by peering over neths shoulder at the gleaming mound of ice three times he circled waiting for a sign from neth to level the plane out finally neth pulled his head in and picked up the microphone hadley that berg is as bare as a newborn babys ass theres something down there lieutenant hadley came back ive got a beautiful blip on my i think ive spotted a dark object skipper sloan interrupted down near the waterline on the west face neth turned to rapp swing down to a hundred feet it took only minutes for rapp to comply more minutes passed and still he circled the berg holding the aircrafts speed a bare twenty miles an hour above stalling closer neth murmured intently another hundred feet why dont we simply land on the damn thing rapp offered conversationally if he was overly concerned he didnt look it his face wore the expression of one who was about to fall asleep only the tiny beads of sweat on his brow betrayed the total concentration upon the risky flying job at hand the blue swells seemed so near he felt as if he could reach past neths shoulder and touch them and to add fuel to his growing tenseness the walls of the iceberg now towered above the plane the summit disappearing entirely above the frames of the cockpit windows one twitch he thought one tricky air current and the port wing tip could catch on a wave crest and instantly transform the giant aircraft into a selfdestructing cartwheel neth became aware of something now something indistinct something flying across the unseen threshold between imagination and reality it slowly materialized into a tangible thing a manmade form finally after what seemed an eternity to rapp neth pulled his head back into the cabin again closed the side window and pressed the mike switch sloan did you see it the words sounded stiff and muffled as if neth were talking through a pillow at first rapp thought it was because neths jaw and lips were frozen with the cold but then he sneaked a fast glance and was surprised to see neths face frozen not with cold but with the blank look of genuine awe i saw it sloans voice came over the intercom like a mechanical echo but i didnt think it was possible neither did i neth said but its down therea ship a goddamned ghost ship imbedded in the ice he turned to rapp shaking his head as if he didnt believe is own words i couldnt make out any details just a blurred outline of the bow or maybe the stern its impossible to tell for certain he slipped off the goggles and raised the thumb of his right hand in the air motioning up gratefully rapp sighed and leveled out the patrol plane putting a comfortable margin of space between the aircrafts underbelly and the cold atlantic excuse me lieutenant hadley came through over the headphones he was hunched over his radar set painstakingly studying a little white blip almost in the exact center of the scope for what its worth the overall length of that thing in the berg is in the neighborhood of one hundred and twentyfive feet a derelict fishing trawler most likely neth vigorously massaged his cheeks wincing at the pain as the circulation began to return shall i contact district headquarters in new york and request a rescue party rapp asked matteroffactly neth shook his head no need to rush a rescue ship its obvious there are no survivors well make a detailed report after weve landed in newfoundland there was a pause then sloans voice came through make a pass over the berg skipper ill drop a dye marker on it for quick identification right you are sloan make the drop at my signal neth turned again to rapp bring us over the high part of the berg at three hundred feet the boeing its four engines still turning at reduced power swept over the stately iceberg like a monstrous mesozoic bird in search of its primeval nest back at the cargo door sloan raised his arm pausing then at neths spoken command sloan tossed a gallon pickle jar full of red dye out into space the jar grew smaller and smaller shrinking to a tiny speck before finally striking the smooth cliff face of the target peering back sloan could see a bright vermilion streak spreading slowly down the millionton mound of ice right on the button neth almost sounded jovial the search party wont have any trouble spotting that one then suddenly grimfaced he stared down toward the spot where the unknown ship lay entombed poor devils i wonder if well ever know what happened to them rapps eyes took on a thoughtful look they couldnt have asked for a bigger tombstone its only temporary two weeks after that berg drifts into the gulf stream there wont be enough left of it to chill a sixpack of beer the cabin became clouded by a silence a silence that seemed intensified by the incessant drone of the planes engines neither man spoke for several moments each lost in his own thoughts they could only look at the ominous pinnacle of white rising out of the sea and speculate on the enigma locked beneath its icy mantle at last neth slouched backward nearly horizontal in his seat and became his old imperturbable self again i strongly suggest ensign unless you have a hankering to ditch this lumbering bus in fortydegree water you take us home before the fuel gauges die from thirst he grinned menacingly and please no interruptions rapp threw neth a withering look then shrugged and turned the patrol plane once more on a course toward newfoundland when the coast guard patrol plane had disappeared and the last steady beat of its engines had faded away in the cold salt air the towering iceberg once again lay enshrouded in the deathly stillness it had endured since being broken from a glacier and forced into the sea off the west coast of greenland nearly a year before then suddenly there was a slight but perceptible movement on the ice just above the waterline of the berg two indistinct shapes slowly transformed into two men who rose to their feet and stared in the direction of the retreating aircraft from more than twenty paces they would have been invisible to the unaided eyeboth wore white suits that blended in perfectly with the colorless background they stood there for a long time patiently waiting and listening when they were satisfied the patrol plane was not returning one of the men knelt and brushed away the ice revealing a small radio transmitter and receiver extending the tenfoot telescopic aerial he set the frequency and began turning the crank handle he didnt have to crank very hard or very long someone somewhere was keeping a tight watch on the same frequency and the answer came almost immediately chapter lieutenant commander lee koski clamped his teeth a notch tighter on the stem of a corncob pipe jammed his knotted fists two inches deeper in his furlined windbreaker and shivered in the intense cold two months past fortyone years eighteen of them in the service of the united states coast guard koski was short very short and the heavy multilayered clothing made him look nearly as wide as he was high his blue eyes beneath the shaggy wheatcolored hair gleanyed with an intensity that never seemed to dim regardless of his mood he possessed the confident manner of a perfectionist a quality that helped in no small measure in his section as commander of the coast guards newest supercutter the catawaba he stood on the bridge like a gamecock legs braced apart and didnt bother to turn when he spoke to the tall mountain of a man standing beside him even with radar theyll play hell finding us in this weather the tone was as crisp and penetrating as the cold atlantic air visibility cant be more than a mile slowly deliberately lieutenant amos dover the catawabas executive officer flipped a cigarette butt ten feet straight into the air and watched with analytical interest as the smoking white tube was caught by the wind and carried over the ships bridge far out into the rolling sea wouldnt make any difference if they did he mumbled through lips that were turning blue from the chilly breeze the way were pitching the pilot of that helicopter would have to be extremely dumb or dead drunk or both to even consider touching down back there he nodded aft toward the catawabas landing platform already wet from the blowing spray some people dont give a damn how they die koski said severly no one can say they werent warned dover not only looked like a big bear but his voice seemed to growl from somewhere deep within his stomach i signaled the copter right after it left st johns informing it of the building sea and strongly advising against a rendezvous all i got from the pilot was a polite thank you it was beginning to drizzle now and the twentyfiveknot breeze flung the rain over the ship in driving sheets that soon sent all the men who were on duty above deck scurrying for their oilskins fortunately for the catawaba and her crew the air temperature held at f still eight degrees away from the dread of freezing a nasty situation that would have quickly covered the entire ship with a blanket of ice koski and dover had just slipped into their oilskins when the loudspeaker on the bridge crackled mechanically captain weve just picked up the bird on radar and were guiding it in koski picked up the hand transmitter and acknowledged then he turned to dover i fear he said casually a plot is brewing youre wondering why all the urgency to take on passengers dover asked arent you i am indeed im also wondering why the orders to stand by station and receive a civilian helicopter came direct from the commandants headquarters in washington instead of our own district command damned inconsiderate of the commandant koski growled dot to tell us what these people want one things certain theyre not going to find themselves on a pleasure cruise to tahiti koski suddenly stiffened and cocked an ear in the direction of the unmistakably thumping beat of a helicopters rotor blade for half a minute it was invisible in the heavy overcast then both men spotted it at the same time it was coming from the west through the light rain and heading in a direct line toward the ship koski recognized it immediately as a twoseater civilian version of the ulysses q a craft capable of nearly two hundred and fifty miles an hour hes nuts to try it dover said dryly koski didnt comment he grabbed the transmitter again and exploded into it signal the pilot of that copter and tell him not to attempt a touchdown while were pushing through tenfoothigh swells tell him i wont be responsible for any insane actions on his part koski waited for a few seconds his eyes glued to the helicopter well the speaker crackled in reply the pilot says hes most grateful for your concern captain and he respectfully requests that you have some men on hand to secure the landing gear the instant he touches the pad hes a courteous bastard dover grunted ill say that for him jutting his chin out an extra half inch koski took another viselike grip on the pipe stem courteous hell theres every possibility that idiot will wreck a goodsized piece of my ship then he shrugged in resignation and picked up a bull horn shouting into the mouthpiece chief thorp have your men ready to secure that bird the second it lands but for gods sake keep them under cover until its firmly on the padand have a crash crew standingby right about now dover said softly i wouldnt trade places with those guys up there for all the sex goddesses in hollywood the catawaba could not head squarely into the wind koski calculated because the ttirbulence dealt by the superstructure would litirl the aircraft to sure destruction on the other hand if the ship ran abeam of the sea the roll would be far too excessive for the helicopter to land firmly on the pad all the years of skill and judgment coupled with the knowledge of the catawabas handling characteristics made his decision almost routine well take them in with the wind and sea broad on the bow reduce speed and make the necessary course change dover nodded and disappeared into the wheelhouse he returned a few moments later broad on the bow as ordered and as steady as the sea allows caught in the cold grip of apprehension koski and dover stared at the bright yellow helicopter as it swept through the mist headed into the wind and approached the catawabas stern on a thirtydegree angle above the ships spreading wake though the wind was buffeting the ulysses badly the pilot somehow managed to keep it in a level position about a hundred yards back it began slackening speed until it finally stopped in midair hovering like a hummingbird over the rising and falling landing pad for what seemed an eternity to koski the helicopter maintained its height while the pilot gauged the high point of the cutters fantail each time it lifted on the crest of a passing swell then abruptly when the landing pad hit its apogee the copters pilot cut back his throttles and the ulysses dropped neatly onto the catawaba a bare instant before the stern lurched downward in the trouch of the next wave the skids had hardly kissed the pad when five of the cutters crewmen dashed across the tilting deck and began struggling under the strong gusts to secure the helicopter before it was blown over the side into the water the engine exhaust soon died away the rotor blades idled to a stop and a door opened on the side of the cockpit then two men their heads bowed against the driving mist leaped to the platform that son of a bitch dover murmured in wonder he actually made it look easy koskis face tightened their credentials had better be firstrateand their authority better come from coast guard headquarters in washington dover smiled maybe theyre congressmen on an inspection tour not likely koski said curtly shall i escort them to your cabin koski shook his head no offer them my compliments and bring them to the officers mess then he grinned slyly right about now the only thing that truly interests me is a hot cup of coffee in precisely two minutes commander koski was sitting at a table in the officers messroom his cold hands gratefully encircling a steaming mug of black coffee it was nearly half drained when the door opened and dover entered the room followed by a chubby character with large rimless spectacles mounted on a bald head that was edged by long unkempt white hair although the initial effect reminded koski of a stereotypic mad scientist the face was round and goodnatured and the brown eyes had a crinkled grin the stranger caught sight of the commander and marched up to the table and extended his hand commander koski i take it hunnewelldr bill hunnewell sorry to inconvenience you like this koski rose and shook hunnewells hand welcome aboard doctor please sit down and have a cup of coffee coffee cant stand the stuff hunnewell said mournfully id sell my soul for a nip of hot cocoa though cocoa weve got koski said agreeably he leaned back in his chair and raised his voice brady a steward wearing a white jacket ambled from the galley he was long and lean and walked with a gait that could only spell texas yessir captain whatll it be a cup of cocoa for our guest and two more coffees for lieutenant dover and koski stopped and peered questioningly behind dover i believe were missing dr hunnewells pilot hell be along in a minute dover bore an unhappy look on his face it was as if he tried to signal a warning to koski he wanted to be sure the helicopter was tied down securely koski stared back speculatively at dover but then he let it go there you have it brady and bring the pot i could use a refill brady simply nodded in acknowledgment and returned to the galley hunnewell said its true luxury to have four solid walls around me again sitting in that vibrating kite with nothing between me and the elements but a plastic bubble was enough to turn a mans hair gray he ran his hand through the few remaining white strands surrounding his dome and grinned koski set down his mug and he wasnt smiling i dont think you realize dr hunnewell just how close you came to losing the rest of your hair and yourself as well it was pure recklessness on the part of your pilot to even consider making a flight in this weather i can assure you sir that this trip was necessary hunnewell spoke in a benevolent tone the same tone he might have used lecturing a schoolboy you your crew your ship has a vital function to perform and time is the critical dimension we cannot afford to lose a single minute he pulled a slip of paper from his breast pocket and passed it across the table to koski while i explain our presence i must ask you to set an immediate course for this position koski took the paper without reading its contents forgive me dr hunnewell i am not in a position to grant your request the only order i have from the commandants headquarters is to take aboard two passengers nothing was mentioned about giving you carte blanche to run my ship you dont understand koski stared piercingly over his coffee mug at hunnewell that doctor is the understatement of the day just what is your capacity why are you here put your mind at ease commander im not an enemy agent out to sabotage your precious ship my phd is in oceanography and im currently employed by the national underwater and marine agency no offense koski said equably but that still leaves one question unanswered perhaps i can help clear the air the new voice came soft but firm with an authoritative resonance koski stiffened in his chair and turned to a figure who leaned negligently against the doorwaya tall wellproportioned figure the oaktanned face the hard almost cruel features the penetrating green eyes suggested that this wasnt a man to step on clad in a blue air force flight jacket and uniform watchful yet detached he offered koski a condescending grin ah there you are hunnewell said loudly commander koski may i present major dirk pitt special projects director for numa pitt koski echoed flatly he glanced at dover and lifted an eyebrow dover only shrugged and looked uncomfortable by any chance the same pitt who broke up that underwater smuggling business in greece last year there were at least ten other people who deserve the lions share of the credit pitt said an air force officer working in oceanogaphic programs said dover a little out of your element arent you major the lines around pitts eyes etched into a smile no more than all the navy men who have gone to the moon you have a valid point koski conceded brady appeared and served the coffee and cocoa he left and returned again setting down a tray of sandwiches before retreating for the last time koski began to feel uneasy in earnest now a scientist from a prominent government agencynot good an officer in another branch of the service with a reputation for dangerous escapadesbad news but the combination of the two sitting there on the other side of the table telling him what to do and where to goabsolute plague as i was saying commander hunnewell said impatiently we must get to that position i gave you as quickly as possible no koski said bluntly im sorry if my attitude seems hardnosed but you must agree im perfectly within my rights in refusing your demands as captain of this ship the only orders im obliged to obey come from either coast guard district headquarters in new york or the commandants office in washington he paused to pourhimself another cup of coffee and my orders were to take on two passengers nothing more i have obeyed and now im resuming my original patrol course pitts eyes weighed koskis granite features as a metallurgist might test a shaft of highgrade steel probing for a flaw suddenly he straightened up and cautiously walked over to the galley door and glanced in brady was busy pouring a bulky sack of potatoes into a huge steaming pot then pitt still cautiously turned and scrutinized the alleyway outside the messroom he could see his little game was working koski and dover were exchanging confused looks between taking in his movements finally seeming satisfied there were no eavesdroppers pitt moved to the table and sat down leaning close to the two coast guard officers lowering his voice to a murmur okay gentlemen heres the story the position dr hunnewell gave you is the approximate location of an extremely important iceberg koski colored slightly but managed to keep a straight face and what if i may ask without sounding stupid major do you class as an important iceberg pitt paused for effect one that has the remains of a ship imbedded under its mantle a russian trawler to be exact crammed with the latest and most sophisticated electronic detection gear soviet science has yet devised not to mention the codes and data for their entire western hemisphere surveillance program koski didnt even blink without taking his eyes off pitt he took a pouch from under his jacket and calmly began loading his corncob six months ago pitt continued a russian traller bearing the name novgorod rode just a few mil off the greenland coast and kept watching other activities at the us air force missile base on disko island aerial photographs showed that the novgorod carried every electronic reception antenna in the book and then some the russians played it cool the trawler and crew thirtyfive highly trained men and yes women too never strayed within greenlands territorial limits she even got to be a welcome sight to our pilots who used her as a checkpoint during poor weather most russian spy ships are relieved of duty every thirty days but this one maintained its position for a solid three months the department of naval intelligence began to wonder at the long delay then one stormy morning the novgorod was gone it was nearly three weeks before her relief ship appeared this time lag compounded the mysterythe russians up to then had never broken their habit of relieving a spy ship until another one appeared on station pitt paused to tap his cigarette in an ashtray there are only two routes the novgorod would have taken home to mother russia one was to leningrad via the baltic sea and the other was through the barnets sea to murmansk the british and norwegians have assured us the novgorod took neither in short somewhere between greenland and the european coast the novgorod disappeared with all hands koski put down his mug and stared thoughtfully at its stained bottom it strikes me a bit strange that the coast guard was never notified i know for a fact that weve received no report of a missing russian trawler it struck washington a bit strange too why would the russians keep the novgorods loss a secret the only logical answer is they didnt want any trace of their most advanced spy ship found by a western nation koskis lips twisted in a sarcastic grin youre asking me to buy a soviet spy ship locked in an iceberg come now major i gave up on fairy tales when i discovered there was no oz over the rainbow or a pot of gold under it pitt matched koskis grin be that as it may it was olie of your own patrol planes that spotted a ship matching the outline of a trawler in an iceberg at nw its true koski said coldly the catawaba is the closest rescue ship to that position but why havent my orders to check it out come direct from district command in new york cloak and dagger stuff pitt answered the last thing the boys in washington wanted was a public announcement going out over the radio fortunately the pilot of the aircraft who spotted the berg waited until he landed before making a detailed location report the idea of course is to go over the trawler before the russians have a chance to catch on i think you can appreciate commander how invaluable any secret information concerning the soviet spy fleet is to our government it would seem more practical to place investigators on the iceberg who are skilled in electronics and intelligence interpretation the subtle change in koskis tone could hardly be called a softening but it was there if you dont mind my saying so a pilot and an oceanographer dont make sense pitt looked penetratingly at koski across to dover and back to koski again a false front he said quietly but one with a purpose the russians arent exactly primitive when it comes to espionage operations they couldnt help but become suspicious of military aircraft milling about an area of open sea where few if any ships ever travel on the other hand national underwater and marine agency aircraft are commonly known to conduct scientific projects in desolate waters and your qualifications im experienced at flying a helicopter in arctic weather pitt answered dr hunnewell is with little doubt the worlds leading authority on ice formations i see koski said slowly dr hunnewell will study the berg before the intelligence boys crash the party you have it hunnewell acknowledged if that really is the novgorod under the ice its up to me to determine the most expedient method for entering the ships hull im sure youre aware commander icebergs are a tricky lot to play with its like cutting a diamond a miscalculation by the cutter and the prize is lost too much thermite in the wrong place and the ice can crack and split apart or sudden and excessive melting might cause a change in the center of gravity forcing the berg to topple upsidedown so you see it is imperative the ice mass be analyzed before the novgorod can be entered with any degree of safety koski leaned back and noticeably relaxed his eyes locked on pitts for a moment and then he smiled lieutenant dover sir kindly oblige these gentlemen and lay a course for nw full ahead and signal district command in new york of our intent to depart station he watched for a change of expression on pitts face there was none no offense pitt said equably i suggest you drop that signal to your district command im not suspicious or anything major koski offered apologetically its just that im not in the habit of cruising all over the north atlantic without letting the coast guard know where their property is okay but id appreciate it if you didnt mention our destination pitt snuffed out his cigarette also please notify the numa office in washington that dr hunnewell and i have arrived safely on board the catawaba and will continue our flight to reykjavik when the weather clears koski raised an eyebrow reykjavik iceland our final destination pitt explained koski started to say something thought better of it then shrugged id better show you to your quarters gentlemen he turned to dover dr hunnewell can bunk with our engineering officer major pitt can move in with you lieutenant pitt grinned at dover then stared back at koski the better to keep an eye on me you said it not me koski replied surprised at the pained expression that crossed pitts face four hours later pitt was dozing on a cot that had been squeezed into the iron womb dover called his cabin he was tired almost to the aching point but too many thoughts were running through his mind to allow him entry into the paradise of deep sleep one week ago at this time he had been sitting with a gorgeous sexmad redhead on the terrace of the newporter inn overlooking the picturesque waterfront of newport beach california he fondly remembered caressing the girl with one hand while holding a scotchrocks in the other contentedly watching the ghostlike pleasure yachts glide across the moonlit harbor now he was alone and regrettably suffering on a plankhard folding cot aboard a tossing coast guard cutter somewhere in the refrigerated north atlantic ocean i must be a cardcarrying masochist he thought to volunteer for every madcap project that admiral sandecker keeps dreaming up admiral james sandecker chief director of the national underwater and marine agency would have shied at the term madcap projectdamned bung twister would have been more his style damned sorry to drag you from sunny california but this damned bung twister has been dumped in our lap sandecker a small firehaired griffonfaced man waved a seveninch cigar in the air like a baton were supposed to be engaged in scientific underwater research why us why not the navy youd think the coast guard could handle its own problems he shook his head in irritation puffed on the cigar anyway were stuck with it pitt finished reading and then laid a yellow folder marked confidential on the admirals desk i didnt think it was possible for a ship to freeze up in the middle of an iceberg its extremely strange o it couldnt happen finding the right berg might prove difficult its already been four days since the coast guards sighting that overgrown ice cube could have drifted halfway to the azores by now dr hunnewell has charted the current and drift rate to within a thirtysquaremile area if your vision is good you shouldnt have any trouble spotting the berg particularly since the coast guard dropped a red dye marker on it spotting it is one thing pitt said thoughtfully r landing a helicopter on it is another wouldnt it be more convenient and less dangerous to arrive by no sandecker interrupted no ships if that thing under the ice is as important as i think it is i dont want anyone except you andhunnewell within fifty miles of it this may come as a surprise admiral but ive never set a copter down on an iceberg before its very possible no one else has either thats why i requested you as my special projects director sandecker smiled mischievously you have the annoying knack of successfullyshall we saydelivering the goods this time pitt asked slyly do i have the opportunity of volunteering i wouldnt have it any other way pitt shrugged helplessly i dont know why i always give in so easily to you admiral im beginning to think you have me pegged as a firstclass pigeon a broad grin rode across sandeckers face you said it not me the latch clicked and the cabin door swung open pitt lazily opened one eye in time to see dr hunnewell come in the overweight doctor did a tightrope act trying to maneuver between pitts cot and dovers clothes locker before he finally reached a small chair by a writing desk audibly he sighed in chorus with the but dr hunnewell chairs creaking protest as he cased his bulk past the seats how in gods name does a titan like dover get into this thing he incredulously asked no one in particular youre late pitt yawned i expected you hours ago i couldnt go sneaking around corners or slithering through ventilators as if i was on my way to a spy convention i had to wait for an excuse to talk to you excuse yes commander koskis compliments dinner is served why all the subterfuge pitt asked with a cagey grin we have nothing to hide nothing to hide nothing to hide you lie there like an innocent virgin waiting for her first communion and easy say we have nothing to hide hunnewell shook his head hopelessly well both be in front of a firing squad when the coast guard learns we flimflammed them out of the use of one of their new cutters helicopters have a nasty habit they wont fly with air in their fuel tanks pitt said sarcastically we had to have a base of operations and a place to refuel the catawaba was the only ship in the area with the necessary facilities besides you sent that phony message from the coast guard commandantyoure on the hook for that one that incredible yarn about the missing russian trawler you cant deny thats yours from beginning to end pitt placed his hands behind his head and stared at the ceiling i rather thought everyone enjoyed it i have to hand it to you that was the slickest con job its been my misfortune ever to witness i know there are times when i hate myself have you considered what may happen when commander koski sees through our devious little plan pitt stood up and stretched we simply do what any good con man would do and that is hunnewell prompted dubiously pitt smiled we siply worry about it when the time comes chapter of all the oceans only the atlantic is totally unpredictable the pacific the indian even the arctic each have their personal idiosyncrasies but all have one trait in common they seldom fail to provide a hint of their coming moods not so the atlantic especially north of the th parallel of latitude in a matter of a few hours a glassy calm sea might be transformed into a foamwhipped cauldron instigated by a force hurricane or there are times when the atlantics fickle nature works in reverse heavy winds heavy seas during the night may give every indication of an impending storm yet when the dawn comes there is nothing to see but an azure nor beneath an empty sky and so it was for the men on the catawaba as the new sun found them cruising comfortably over a peaceful seascape pitt woke slowly his eyes coming into focus on the rear of a pair of extralarge white shorts amply filled by dover who was bending over a small basin brushing his teeth youve never looked lovelier pitt said dover turned around the toothbrush poised over his bottom left molars huh i said good morning dover merely nodded mumbled something incoherent through the toothpaste and turned back to the basin pitt sat up and listened the hum of engines was still there and the only other mechanical sound came from the rush of warm air through the ventilator the motion of the ship seemed so smooth it was almost imperceptible i dont wish to appear a rude host major dover said smiling but i suggest you blossom from that sack we should be within range of your search area in another hour and a half pitt threw off the blankets and stood up first things first how is your establishment classed when it comes to breakfast a twostar michelin rating dover said cheerfully ill even treat pitt had a fast wash decided against a shave and quickly slipped into his flight clothes he followed dover into the passageway wondering how a man as large as the lieutenant could wander around the ship without running his head into low bulkheads at least ten times a day they had just finished a breakfast that pitt figured would have cost at least five dollars in any of the better hotels when a seaman came up and said that commander koski wanted to see them in the bridge control room dover followed him with pitt lagging a few steps behind carrying a cup of coffee the commander and hunnewell were crouched over a chart table as they entered the room koski looked up the outthrust jaw no longer set like the bow of an icebreaker and the intense blue eyes seemed almost tranquil good morning major are you enjoying your stay the accommodations are a bit cramped but the food is superb the hard but genuine smile came on what do you think of our little electronic wonderland pitt made a threehundredandsixtydegree scan of the control room it was like something out of a science fiction space movie from floor to ceiling the four steel bulkheads stood buried behind a mechanical avalanche of computers television monitors and instrumented consoles endless rows of technically labeled switches and knobs crisscrossed the equipment garnished by enough colored indicator lights to fin a casino marque las vegas very impressive pitt said casually sipping his coffee airsearch radar and surfacesearch radar scanners the latest lorantype navigational equipment of medium high and ultrahigh frequencies not to mention computerized navigational plotting pitt spoke with the nonchalant air of a public relations director employed by the boatyard that laid the catawabas keel the catawaba comes equipped from the factory with more extensive oceanographic communications navigational aerological and plotting equipment than any ship its size in the world basically commander your vessel is designed to remain in midocean under any atmospheric conditions as a weather station to conduct search and rescue operations and to assist in oceanographic research work i might add that she is manned by seventeen officers and one hundred sixty enlisted men and cost between twelve and thirteen million dollars to build at the northgate shipyards in wilmington delaware koski dover and all the other men in the bridge control room with the exception of hunnewell who remained intent on the chart froze if pitt had been the first martian to visit earth he couldnt have possibly been the object of more incredulous apprehensiveness dont be surprised gentlemen pitt said feeling the warmth of selfsatisfaction i make it a habit to do my homework i see koski said grimly it was obvious that he didnt see perhaps you might give us a clue as to why youve studied your lessons so diligently pitt shrugged as ive said its a habit an irritating one at that koski looked at pitt with a hint of uneasiness i wonder if youre really what you say you are dr hunnewell and i are bona fide pitt said reassuringly well know for certain in approximately two minutes major koskis tone suddenly turned cynical i like to do my homework too you dont trust me pitt said dryly a pity your mental anxiety is all for nothing dr hunnewell and i have no intent or the means for that matter of endangering the safety of your ship or crew youve given me no opportunity for trust koskis eyes were bleak his voice icy you carry no written orders ive received no radio signals regarding your authority nothing nothing but a vague message from coast guard headquarters announcing your arrival i might point out that anyone with a knowledge of our call signal could have sent that communication nothings impossible pitt said he couldnt help but admire koskis perception the commander had struck the nail precisely on the head if youre playing a shady game major i want no part of iti koski broke off to accept a signal form from a seaman and studied it carefully taking his time about it a strange considering look crossed his face then he frowned as he passed the sheet across to pitt it seems that youre a neverending source of surprise if pitt didnt look uncomfortable he certainly felt it theohous exposure had been a long time coming and he d had plenty of time to prepare unfortunately he hadnt come up with a plausible backup story pitt quickly decided there was little he couldd do but take the form from the commanders hand and appear unconcerned it said regarding your inquiry of dr william hunnewell and major dirk pitt dr hunnewells credentials are of the highest caliber he is director of the california institute of oceanography major pitt is indeed special projects director for numa he also is the son of senator george pitt these men are engaged in oceanographic research vital to the interests of the goverdment and are to be extended every assistance and courtesy also inform major pitt that admiral sandecker requests that the major beware of frigid women it was signed by the commandant of the coast guard the defense rests pitt said savoring each syllable to the hilt sandecker the old fox had used his influence to finagle the coast guard commandant into playing the game pitt let out a deep breath and handed the message form back to koski l it must be nice to have friends in high places koski said a touch of anger in his voice it helps on occasion i have no choice but to be satisfied koski said heavily that last part if im not infringing upon some sacred trust was code no great secret pitt answered its only admiral sandeckers sly way of telling dr hunnewell and me to continue on to iceland after our investigation of the iceberg koski stood there for a moment not saying anything he shook his head slowly in puzzlement and was still shaking it when hunnewell thumped his fist on the chart table there it is gentlemen the precise location of our ghost shipgive or take a few square miles hunnewell was magnificent if he had been aware of the tension a few moments before he showed absolutely no evidence of it he folded the chart and shoved it into the pocket of his windbreaker major pitt i think it best if we take off as soon as possible whatever you say dog pitt said agreeably i can have the chopper warmed up and ready to go in ten minutes good hunnewell nodded were now in the area where the berg was sighted by the patrol plane according to my calculations at the present rate of drift the iceberg should reach the edge of the gulf stream sometime tomorrow if the ice patrols estimate of the size is correct the berg is already melting to the tune of a thousand tons an hour when it hits the warmer water of the gulf stream it wont last ten days the only unanswered question is when will the derelict be released from the ice conceivably it could already be lost hopefully its still there and will be for a few more days what do you figure for the flight distance pitt asked approximately ninety miles to the general vicinity hunnewell answered koski looked up at pitt as soon as you take off ill reduce speed to one third and maintain a heading of onezerosix degrees how long do you make it before we rendezvous three and a half hours should do the job pitt replied koski looked thoughtful four hoursafter four hours im coming into the icepack after you thank you commander pitt said believe me when i say im grateful for your concern koski believed him are you certain i cant bring the catawaba in closer to your search area if you should have an accident on the berg or have to dive in the sea i doubt if i could reach you in time in fortydegree water a man in full clothing only has a life expectancy of twentyfive minutes well have to risk it pitt took a final sip of his coffee and stared idly at the empty cup the russians might already smell a rat if one of their trawlers has sighted your coast guard vessel sunday cruising in an area outside its regular patrol station thats why the end run with the helicopter we can stay low enough to avoid any radar scanner and still be tough to sight visually time is important also a copter can get in and out of the novgorods location in one tenth the time it would take the catawaba okay koski sighed its your show just see that youre back on the landing platform by he hesitated looking at his watch no later than then he grinned if youre a good boy and arrive on time ill have a fifth of johnnie walker waiting pitt laughed now thats what i call one hell of an incentive i dont like it hunnewell shouted above the racket of the helicopters engine exhaust we should have sighted something by now pitt looked at his watch timewise were in good shape still over two hours to go cant you go higher if we double our range of vision wed double our chances of detecting the iceberg pitt shook his head no can do wed also double the possibility of our own detection its safer if we stay at a hundred and fifty feet we must find it today hunnewell said an anxious expression on his cherub face tomorrow may be too late for a second try he studied the chart draped across his knees for a moment then picked up a pair of binoculars and focused off to the north at several icebergs floating together in a cluster have you noticed any bergs that come close to matching the description were looking for pitt asked we crossed one about an hour ago that passed the size and configuration requirements but there was no red dye on its walls hunnewell swung the binoculars scanning a flat restless ocean studded with hundreds of massive icebergs some broken and jagged others rounded and smooth like paperwhite geometric solids thrown haphazardly over the blue sea my ego is shattered hunnewell said mournfully never since my high school trigonometrj class have my calculations been so far off perhaps a change in wind direction blew the berg on a different course hardly hunnewell grunted an icebergs underwater mass is seven times the size of what shows on the surface nothing but an ocean current has the slightest effect on its movement it can easily move with the current against a twentyknot wind an irresistible force and an immovable object rolled up into one lump that and much moreamned near indestructible hunnewell talked as he peered through the glasses of course they break up and melt soon after drifting south into warmer waters but during their passage to the gulf stream they bow neither to storm nor man glacier icebergs have been blasted by torpedoes eightinch naval guns massive doses of thermite bombs and tons of coal dust to soak up the sun and speed up the melting process the results were comparable to the damage a herd of elephants might suffer after a slingshot bombardment by a tribe of anemic pygmies pitt went into a steep bank dodging around the sheer sides of a highpinnacled berga maneuver that had hunnewell clutching his stomach he checked the chart again two hundred square miles covered and nothing achieved he said lets try due north for fifteen minutes then head back east to the edge of the ice pack then south for ten minutes before we cut west again one graduated box pattern to the north coming up pitt said he tilted the controls slightly holding the helicopter in a sideswinging movement until the compass read zero degrees the minutes wore on and multiplied and the fatigue began to show in the deepening lines around hunnewells eyes hows the gas situation thats the least of our worries pitt replied the elements were short on at the moment are time and optimism might as well admit it hunnewell said wearily i ran out of the latter a quarter of an hour ago pitt gripped hunnewells arm hang in there dog he said encouragingly our elusive iceberg may be just around the next corner if it is its defied every drift pattern in the book the red dye marker could be it washed away in the storm yesterday fortunately no the dye contains calcium chloride a necessary ingredient for deep penetrationtakes weeks sometimes months for the stain to melt away that leaves us with one other possibility i know what youre thinking hunnewell said flatly and you can perish the thought ive worked closely off ani on with the coast guard for over thirty years and ive never known them to mistake an ice position sighting thats it then a millionton chunk of ice evaporated mt pitot left the sentence unfinished partly because the helicopter was beginning to drift off course partly because he glimpsed something hunnewell suddenly stiffened in his seat and leaned forward the binoculars jammed against his eye sockets i have it hunnewell cried pitt didnt wait for a command he dipped the helicopter and headed toward the direction indicated by hunnewells binoculars hunnewell passed the glasses to pitt here take a peek and tell me these old eyes arent picking up a mirage pitt did a juggling act with the binoculars and the helicopters controls while fighting to keep the engine vibration from jiggling the iceberg out of focus can you make out the red dye hunnewell asked anxiously like a stripe of strawberry in the middle of a scoop of vanilla ice cream i cant understand it hunnewell shook his head that berg shouldnt be there by every known law of current and drift it should be floating at least ninety miles to the southeast but it was there resting on the sharp horizon line a massive towering hunk of ice beautifully carved by nature grotesquely marred by manmade chemicals before pitt could lower the binoculars the ice crystals on the berg caught the sun and reflected the brilliance into his eyes the intensity blasting through the lenses temporarily blinded he gained altitude and altered course a few degrees to remove the glare it was nearly a full minute before the skyrockets behind his eyeballs finally faded away then suddenly pitt became aware of a dun almost imperceptible shadow in the water he hardly had time to distinguish the dark shape as the helicopter skimmed over the blue swells not three hundred feet beneath the landing skids the iceberg was still a good seven miles away when he swung around in a great half circle toward the east and the catawaba what in hells the matter with you hunnewell demanded pitt ignored the question im afraid we have uninvited guests nonsense there isnt a ship or another aircraft in sight theyre coming to the party through the basement hunnewells eyebrows raised questioningly then he slowly slumped back in the seat a submarine a submarine it is quite possible it may be one of ours sorry dog thats wishful thinking then the russians beat us to it hunnewells mouth twisted dear god were too late not yet pitt turned the helicopter into another circling arc this time back toward the iceberg we can be standing on the ice in four minutes it will take the sub at least a half hour to reach the berg with any luck we can find what we came for and get the hell out before their crew lands thats cutting it a bit fine hunnewell didnt sound very confident when the russians see us run about on the berg they wont come unarmed you know id be surprised if they didnt actually the captain of that russian sub has enough weapons at his command to blast us to pieces anytime he has the inclination but im betting he wont take the chance what has he got to lose nothing but he gains the repercussions of a mre fat international incident any commander worth a ruble in his position will be certain were in constant radio contact with our home base notifying them of his subs position and ready to scream bloody murder at the first shot this side of the atlantic is our stomping grounds and he knows it hes too far from moscow to play the role of a block bully all right all right hunnewell said go ahead and set us down i suppose even getting shot at is better than sitting another minute in this toothjarring niixmaster pitt said no more he made the approach and set the helicopter down without any difficulty on a small flat area of ice no more than twenty feet long by fifteen feet wide then before the rotor blades had come to a final stop he and hunnewell jumped from the cockpit and stood on the silent iceberg wondering when the russian submarine would surface wondering what they would find beneath the shroud of ice that separated them from the cold unfriendly waters they could see no life feel no life their cheeks were touched lightly by a frigid breeze but apart from that there was nothing nothing at all chapter the tense minutes passed in total silence minutes before pitt could bring himself to say anything that was important when at last he did his voice sounded to him like a vague whisper y whisper he thought hunnewell was probing the ice thirty feet away the russian submarine now riding motionless on the surface lay a quarter of a mile from the northern edge of the iceberg finally pitt managed to attract hunnewells attention with a voice that was still hushed by the cathedrallike silence times running out doc it still seemed he might be overheard though the russians couldnt have picked up his words had he shouted at the top of his voice im not blind hunnewell snapped how long before they get here by the time they set a dinghy in the water row in from the sub and step ashorefour hundred yards if its an inchitll takethem between fifteen and twenty minutes weve no damned time to lose hunnewell said impatiently any luck yet nothing hunnewell boomed back the derelict must be deeper than i thought he ramined the probe feverishly into the ice its here its got to be here a hundredandtwentyfivefoot vessel couldnt have disappeared maybe the coast guard saw a phantom ship hunnewell paused to adjust his sunglasses the ice patrol crew might have been fooled by their eyes but not by their radar equipment pitt moved closer to the open door of the helicopter his gaze swung to hunnewell then back to the sub and a second later he was peering through the binoculars he studied the tiny figures that were erupting from the hatches of the lowsilhouetted submarine and scrambling hurriedly across the seasplashed deck in less than three minutes a large sixman dinghy was inrated dropped beside the hull and boarded by a group of men carrying an assortment of automatic weapons then an indistinct popping sound came over the rolling blue water the sound was enoughenough for pitt to drastically cut his original time estimate theyre coming five maybe six of them cant tell for sure are they armed hunnewells query sounded urgent to the teeth my god man hunnewell shouted irritably dont just stand there and gawk help me search for the derelict forget it pitts tone was unhurried theyll be here in another five minutes five minutes you said i didnt count on their dinghy having an outboard motor hunnewell stared stricken at the submarine how did the russians find out about the derelict how could they have possibly known the location no great feat pitt answered one of their kgb agents in washington undoubtedly got hold of the coast guards sighting reportits hardly a classified secretand then dispatched every fishing trawler and submarine they had in this part of the atlantic to search the ice field its an unfortunate coincidence for us but a lucky one for them that we both discovered the iceberg at the same moment it looks as if weve thrown the ball game hunnewell said bleakly theyve won and weve lost dammit if we could only locate the derelicts hull we could at least destroy it with thermite bombs and keep it out of the russians hands to the victor goes the spoils pitt murmured all one million tons of the finest purest genuine greenland ice in the atlantic ocean hunnewell was puzzled but said nothing pitts apparent indifference made no sense tell me dog pitt continued whats todays date the date hunnewell said dazedly its wednesday march twentyeighth were early pitt said three days early for april foolsday hunnewells voice was flat and hard this is hardly the time or place for levity why not somebodys played a tremendous joke on us and on those clowns out there pitt gestured toward the rapidly approaching landing party you the russians were all starring in the greatest laugh riot ever to hit the north atlantic the climax of the final act comes when we all learn that there is no derelict in this iceberg he paused to exhale a cloud of smoke as a matter of fact there never was one total incomprehension and the meager beginnings of hope touched hunnewell go on he prompted besides radar contact the crew of the patrol plane reported that they sighed the outline of a ship in the ice yet we saw nothing before we touched down that alone doesnt figure they were in an aircraft flying at a probable patrol speed of two hundred miles an hour if anything our chances of spotting something from a hovering helicopter were far higher hunnewell looked thoughtful he seemed to be weighing what pitt had said im not sure what youre hinting at then he smiled suddenly his old cheerful self again but im getting wise to your siv mind you must have something up your sleeve no magic you said it yourself by every known law of current and drift this berg should be floating ninety miles to the southwest true hunnewell looked at pitt with a new respect and the conclusion exactly what do you have in mind not what but who doc someone who is leading all of us on the proverbial wildcoose chase someone who removed the red dye from the iceberg containing the lost ship and spread more of the same over a decoy ninety miles off the track of course the iceberg we flew over hours ago the same size configuration and weight but no red stain thats where well find our mystery ship said pitt right where you calculated it was supposed to be but whos playing games hunnewell asked his face set in a contemplative twist obviously it isnt the russians theyre as confused as we were at the moment it doesnt matter pitt said the important thing is to bid fond farewell to this floating ice palace and fly off into the blue our uninvited guests have arrived he nodded down the slope of the berg or perhaps you hadnt noticed and hunnewell hadnt but he noticed it now the first of the landing party from the submarine came piling on the berg walking cautiously onto the edge of the ice within a few seconds five pitt and hunnewells direction they were dressed in blackrussian marinesand heavily armed even at a hundred yards pitt could discern the unmistakable look of men who knew exactly what they were out to do pitt casually climbed aboard the helicopter turned the ignition switch and pushed the starter even before the rotor blades swung into their first revolution hunnewell was ensconced in the passengers seat with his safety belt tightly secured before he closed the door to the cockpit pitt leined out cupped both hands to his mouth and shouted to the advancing russians enjoy your stay but dont forget to pick up your litter the officer leading the men from the submarine cocked an ear then shrugged uncomprehendingly he was certain that pitt was hardly likely to shout in russian for his benefit as if to signal the occupants of the helicopter of his peaceful intentions the officer lowered his automatic weapon and waved a salute as pitt and hunnewell relinquished possession of the iceberg and rose into the radiant blue sky pitt took his time keeping the helicopter at a minimum cruising speed and holding on a northward course for fifteen minutes then after they were out of sight and radar range of the submarine he swung around in a long circle to the southwest and by eleven fifteen they had found the derelict as they bore down on the great ice giant pitt and hunnewell shared a strange sense of emptiness it wasnt just the end of the long hours of uncertaintythey were already past the time limit set by commander koskiit was the eerie appearance of the mystery ship itself neither man had ever seen anything quite like it the atmosphere around the berg had a terrifying desolation that belonged not to earth but to some dead and distant planet only the rays of the sun broke the inertness penetrating the ice and distorting the lines of the ships hull and superstructure into a constantly changing series of abstract shadows the sight seemed so unreal that it was difficult for pitt to accept the visible fact of its existence as he adjusted the controls and lowered the helicopter to the ice he half expected the entombed vessel to vanish pitt tried to land on a smooth spot near the bergs edge but the sloping angle of the ice proved too great he finally put down directly on top of the derelict hunnewell leaped from the helicopter just before the skids kissed the ice and had already paced the derelict from bow to stern when pitt joined him odd hunnewell murmured most odd nothing protrudes above the surface not even the masts and radar antenna every square inch is sealed solidly under the ice pitt pulled a handkerchief from his flight jacket and blew his nose then he sniffed the air as if testing it smell anything out of the ordinary doc hunnewell tilted his head back and inhaled slowly there is something of an odor too faint though i cant make it out you dont travel in the right circles pitt said grinning if youd get out of your laboratory more often and learn a bit about life youd recognize the distinct aroma of burnt rubbish wheres it coming from pitt nodded at the derelict under his feet where else but down there hunnewell shook his head no way its a scientific fact you cant smell an inorganic substance inside a block of ice from the outside the old proboscis never lies the midday warmth was beginning to overcome the cold so pitt unzipped his flight jacket there must be a leak in the ice you and your educated nose hunnewell said acidly i suggest you stop playing bloodhound and start placing the thermite charges the only way were going to get inside the wreck is by melting the ice mantle well be taking a risk trust me hunnewell said mildly im not about to split the berg ald lose the derelict the helicopter and ourselves as well i intend to begin with small loads and work our way down by degrees i wasnt thinking of the iceberg i was thinking of the wrecked ship theres a damn good chance the fuel tanks have ruptured and allowed diesel oil to slosh the entire length of the keel if we miscalculate and ignite as much as a drop the whole derelict goes up in one fiery puff hunnewell stamped his foot on the hardpacked ice how do you expect to get through thatwith an ice pick dr hunnewell pitt said quietly i wont argue the fact that your name is known far and wide for your hyperscientific intellect however like most superbrains your mental depth for practical everyday runofthemill matters is sadly lacking thermite charges ice picks you say why bother with complex and muscleexerting sclemes when we can simply perform an open sesame routine youre standing on glacial ice hunnewell said its hard and its solid you cant walk through it sorry my friend youre dead wrong pitt said hunnewell eyed him suspiciously prove it what im getting at is the labor has already been done our machiavelli and his merry band of busy helpers have obviously been here before us he pointed dramatically upward please observe hunnewell lifted a quizzical eyebrow and looked upward and intently studied the broad face of the steep ice slope along the outer edges and near the lower base only a few yards from where pitt and hunnewell stood the ice was smooth and even but beginning at the summit and working downward into the middle of the slope the ice was as pockmarked as the backside of the moon well now hunnewell murmured it does appear that someone went to a lot of trouble to remove the ice patrols red dye stain he gave a long expressionless look at the towering ice pinnacle then turned back to pitt why would someone chip the stain out by hand when they could have easily erased all trace with explosives i cant answer that pitt said maybe they were afraid of cracking the berg or maybe they didnt have explosives who can say however ill lay a months wage that our clever little pals did more than merely chip ice they most certainly found a way to enter the derelict so all we do now is look for a flashing sign that says enter here hunnewells tone was sarcastic he wasnt used to being outguessed and his expression showed that he didnt like it a soft spot in the ice would be more appropriate i suppose hunnewell said youre suggesting a camouflaged cover over some sort of ice tunnel the thought had crossed my mind the doctor peered over the top of his glasses at pitt lets get on with it then if we stand around here theorizing much longer my testicles will probably get an acute case of frostbite it shouldnt have been all that difficult not by a long shot yet it didnt go as easily as pitt had figured the unpredictable occurred when hunnewell lost his footing on the slope and slid helplessly toward a steep ledge that dropped into the icy sea he fell forward desperately clawing at the ice his nails scratching and bending painfully backward through the hard surface he slowed momentarily but not enough his fall happened so abruptly that his ankles were already scraping the edge of the thirtyfoot drop before he thought of shouting for help pitt had been busily prying up a chunk of loose ice when he heard the cry he swung around took in hunnewells deteriorating plight had a lightning impression of how impossible rescue would be once the doctor had fallen into the freezing water and in one swift movement tore off his flight jacket and flung himself across the slop in a flying leap feet first legs lifted crazily in the air to hunnewells panicflooded brain pitts move looked like an act of pure madness oh god no no he shouted but there was nothing he could do but watch pitt hurtle toward him like a bobsled there might have been a chance he thought if pitt had stayed on the berg now it seemed certain that both men would die in the freezing salt water together twentyfive minutes commander koskis words flashed through his head twentyfive minutes was all a man had to remain alive in fortydegree waterand with all the time in the world they never could have pulled themselves back onto the sheer sides of the iceberg if hed had precious moments to think about it pitt would have undoubtedly agreed with hunnewell he surely looked like a madman skiding over the ice with his feet high above his head suddenly with only a legs length remaining before he collided with hunnewell pitt brought his feet flashing down with a power and swiftness that even in these desperate circumstances made him grunt in pain as his heels crashed through the ice dug in tenaciously and brought him to a musclejarring stop then as if triggered by instinct in the same motion he threw a sleeve of his jacket to hunnewell the thoroughly frightened scientist needed no coaxing he grasped the nylon fabric with a grip that no vise could have equaled and hung on trembling for almost a minute waiting for his middleaged heart to slow down to a few beats above normal fearfully he stole a glance sideways and saw what his numbed senses could not feelthe edge of the ice ledge cut across his waist at the navel when youre up to it pitt said his voice calm but pierced with a noticeable trace of tenseness try pulling yourself toward me hunnewell shook his head i cant he murmured hoarsely its all i can do to hold on can you find a foothold hunnewell didnt answer he only shook his head again pitt bent over between his outstretched legs and tightened his grip on the jacket were sitting here though the courtesy of two hard rubber heels not steel cleats it wont take much for the ice to crack around them he flashed an encouraging grin at hunnewell make no sudden movement im going to pull you clear of the ledge this time hunnewell nodded he felt a sick ache in his stomach the tips of his torn fingers throbbed his sweatsoaked face reflected the terror and pain one thing and one thing only reached through his blanket of fear the determined look in pitts eyes hunnewell stared at the calm face and in that moment he knew that pitts inner strength and confidence were gaining a toehold in his own frightened mind stop your blasted grinning he said faintly and start pulling cautiously an inch at a time pitt hauled hunnewell slowly upward it took him an agonizing sixty seconds before he had hunnewells head on a plane between his knees then pitt one hand at a time let go of the jacket and grabbed hunnewell under the armpits that was the easy part pitt said the next exercise is up to you his hands free hunnewell wiped a sleeve across his sweaty brow i cant make any guarantees your dividers are they on you hunnewells expression went blank for a moment then he nodded inside breast pocket good pitt murmured now climb over me and stretch out full length when your feet are solidly on my shoulders take out the dividers and jam them into the ice a piton hunnewell exclaimed suddenly aware damned clever of you major hunnewell began hauling himself over pitts prostrate form straining like a locomotive climbing the rockies but he made it then with pitts hands firmly clamped on his ankles hunnewell pulled out the steelpointed dividers that he normally used for plotting distances on charts and rammed them deeply into the ice okay hunnewell grunted now well repeat the process pitt said can you hold on make it quick hunnewell answered my hands are nearly numb tentatively one heel still imbedded in the ice as a safety measure pitt tested his weight on hunnewells legs the dividers gripped firm working as swiftly and as smoothly as a cat pitt crept past hunnewell felt his hands grope over the edge of the slope where it leveled out and wiggled up onto safe ground he didnt waste an instant almost immediately it seemed to hunnewell pitt was throwing down a nylon line from the helicopter half a minute later the pale and exhausted oceanographer sat on the ice at pitts feet hunnewell gave a great sigh and gazed into pitts relieved face do you know what im going to do first thing when we set foot in civilization yes pitt said smiling youre going to buy me the finest gourmet dinner in all reykjavik round up all the booze i can drink and introduce me to a sensuous buxom icelandic nymphomaniac the dinner and the booze are yoursi owe you that much the nymphomaniac i cant promise so many years have passed by since ive negotiated for a womans charms im afraid ive lost the touch pitt laughed clapped hunnewell on the shoulder and helped him to his feet dont sweat it old friend girls are my department he stopped abruptly and said sharply your hands look like you held them against a grindstone hunnewell lifted his hands and stared indifferently at the bleeding fingers not really as bad as they look a bit of antiseptic and a manicure and theyll be as good as new come on pitt said theres a firstaid kit in the copter ill fix them up for you a few minutes later as pitt tied the last small bandage hunnewell asked did you find any sign of a tunnel before i took my spill its a slick piece of work pitt replied the entire circumference of the entrance cover is beveled a perfect match with the surrounding ice if someone hadnt got careless and cut a small handgrip id have walked right over it hunnewells face suddenly grew dark this accursed iceberg he said grimly i swear that it bears a personal enmity against us he flexed his fingers and solemnly studied the eight little bandages masking the tips his eyes seemed strained and his face looked weary pitt walked over and raised a round slab of ice three feet in diameter by three inches thick revealing a circular hole barely large enough for one man to crawl through he turned his head away the stench of burnt paint fabric and fuel mixed with torched metal rose from the opening that should prove i can detect smells through an ice cube pitt said yes youve passed the nose test hunnewell said smilingly but youve failed miserably on your thermite charge theory thats nothin but a burnedout hulk down there he paused to give pitt a scholarly gaze over the tops of his spectacles we could have blasted until next summer without doing any damage to the derelict pitt shrugged win a few lose a few he passed a spare flashlight to hunnewell ill go first give me five minutes before you follow hunnewell crouched at the edge of the ice tunnel as pitt knelt to enter two ill give you two minutes no more then ill be right behind you the tunnel illuminated by the shattered rays of the sun through the ice crystals above ran downward at a thirtydegree angle for twenty feet stopping at the blackened steel plates charred and bent of the hull the smell by this time was so strong that pitt found it an effort just to breathe he shook off the irritating odor and dragged himself to within a foot of the firescarred metal discovering that the tunnel curved and parallelled the hull for another ten feet ending finally at an open hatch savagely twisted and distorted he could only wonder at the witehot temperatures responsible crawling over the jagged edge of the hatchway he stood up and swung the beam of his flashlight surveying the heatdefaced walls it was impossible to tell what purpose the compartment served every square inch was gutted by the terrible intensity of the fire pitt suddenly felt a dread of the unknown he stood deadstill for several minutes forcing his mind to regain control of his emotions before he stepped across the debris toward the door leading to the alleyway and shone the light into the darkness beyond the beam torched the whole black length as far as the stairway to a lower deck the corridor was barren except for the charred ashes of a carpet it was the silence that was eerie no creaking of the plates no throb of the engines no lapping of water against a weedencrusted hull nothing only the complete soundlessness of a void he hesitated in the doorway for a long minute his first thought conviction rather was that something had gone terribly terribly wrong with admiral sandeckers plans this wasnt what they had been led to expect at all hunnewell came through the hatchway and joined him he stood next to pitt staring at the blackened walls the distorted and crystallized metal and the melted hinges that once held a wooden door wearily he leaned the doorway his eyes half closed shaking his head as it coming out of a trance well find precious little thats of any use to us well find nothing pitt said firmly what the fire left our unknown friends have undoubtedly picked clean as if to emphasize his words he played the beam on the deck revealing several overlapping footprints in the soot traveling to and from the open hatchway lets see what theyve been up to they went out into the alleyway stepping through the ashes and debris on the deck moved to the next compartment and entered it had been the radio room most of the ruins were scarcely recognizable the bunk and furniture were skeletons of charred wood the remains of the radio equipment one congealed mess of melted metal and hardened drippings of stained solder their senses by now had become accustomed to the overpowering stench and the grotesque carbonized surroundings but they werent the least bit prepared for the hideously misshapen form on the deck oh good god hunnewell gasped he dropped his flashlight and it rolled across the deck and came to rest against the shockingly disfigured remains of a head illuminating the skull and teeth where they burst from the incinerated flesh i dont envy him his death pitt murmured the ghastly sight was too much for hunnewell he staggered off into one corner and retched for several minutes when he finally returned to pitts side he looked as if hed recently returned from the grave im sorry he said sheepishly ive never seen a cremated corpse before i didnt have the vaguest idea what one looked likenever gave it much thought really its not a pretty sight is it theres no such thing as a pretty corpse pitt said he was beginning to feel a touch of sickness himself if that lump of ashes on the deck is any indication of things to come we should find at least fourteen more just like it hunnewell grimaced as he stooped and picked up his flashlight then he slipped a notebook from a pocket held the light under his arm and flipped through several pages yes youre right the ship sailed with six crewmen and nine passengers fifteen in all he fumbled a little before finding another page this poor devil must be the radio operatorsvendborggustav svendborg maybe maybe not the only one who can tell for certain is his dentist pitt stared at what had once been a breathing fleshandblood man and he tried to imagine how the end had come a furnacelike wall of red and orange flame a brief unearthly scream the searing shock of pain that drove the mind into instant insanity and the limbs flailing in the contorted dance of death to die by fire he reflected the last seconds of life spent in indescribable agony was an extinction abhorred by every living man and beast pitt kneeled down and studied the body more closely his eyes squinted and his mouth tightened it must have been almost as he had visualized but not quite the scorched form was curled in the fetus position the knees drawn up almost to the chin and the arms pulled tightly against the sides contracted by the mtnse heat upon the flesh but there was something else that caught pitts attention he focused the flashlight on the deck beside the body illuminating dimly the twisted steel legs of the radio operators chair where they protruded from beneath his disfigured remains hunnewell his face void of all color asked what do you find so interesting in that grisly thing have a look pitt said it would seem that poor gustav was sitting down when he died his chair literally burned out from under him hunnewell said nothing only eyed pitt questioningly doesnt it strike you strange pitt continued that a man would calmly burn to death without bothering to stand up or make an effort to escape nothing strange about it hunnewell said stonily the fire probably engulfed him while he was hunched over the transmitter sending out a mayday he began to choke with sickness again god were not doing him any good with our conjectures lets get out of here and search the rest of the ship while im still able to walk pitt nodded and turned and passed through the doorway together they made their way into the bowels of the derelict the engine room the galley the salon everywhere they went their eyes were laid on the same horrifying spectacle of death as in the radio room by the time they discovered the thirteenth and fourteenth bodies in the wheelhouse hunnewells stomach was slowly becoming immune he consulted his notebook several more times marking certain pages with a pencil until only one name between the padded covers remaimed that didnt have a neat line drawn through it thats about it he said snapping the book shut weve found them all except the man we came for pitt lit a cigarette and blew a long cloud of blue smoke and seemed to consider for a moment they were all charred so far beyond recognition he could have been any one of them but he wasnt hunnewell said positively the body wont be too difficult to identify at least not for me he paused i knew our quarry rather well you know pitts eyebrows raised no i didnt know no secret really hunnewell puffed on the lenses of his glasses and polished them with a handkerchief the man weve lied schemed and risked our lives to findunfortunately as it probably turns out deadattended one of my classes at the oceanographic institute six years ago a brilliant fellow he motioned toward the two cremated forms on the deck a pity if he ended like this how can you be certain youll be able to tell him from the others pitt asked by his rings he had a thing about rings wore them on every finger except his thumbs rings dont make a positive identification hunnewell smiled a little there is also a toe missing from the left foot will that do it would pitt said thoughtfully but we havent found a corpse that qualifies weve already searched the entire ship not quite hunnewell pulled a slip of paper from the notebook and unfolded it under the beam of his flashlight this is a rough diagram of the vessel i traced a copy from the original in the maritime archives he pointed at the creased paper see here just beyond the chartroom a narrow ladder drops to a compartment directly beneath a false funnel its the only entrance pitt studied the crude tracing then he turned and stepped outside the chartroom the opening is here all right the ladder is burned all to hell but enough of the rung bracing is left to support our weight the isolated compartmentsituated in the exact center of the hull without benefit of portholeswas savaged even worse than the others the steel plating on the walls curved outward buckled like crinkled sheets of wallpaper it appeared empty no trace of anything that remotely resembled furnishings was left after the conflagration pitt was just kneeling down poking the ashes searching for a sign of a body when hunnewell shouted here he fell to his knees over here in the corner hunnewell focused the light on the sprawled outline of what had once been a man now a barely discernible pile of charred bones only bits of the jawbone and pelvis were recognizable then he bent very low and carefully brushed away an area of the remains when hunnewell stood up he held several small pieces of distorted metal in his hand not proof positive perhaps but about as certain as well ever get pitt took the fused bits of metal and held them under the beam of his light i remember the rings quite well hunnewell said the settings were beautifully handcrafted and inlaid with eight different semiprecious stones native to iceland each was carved in the likeness of an ancient nordic god sounds impressive but garish pitt said to you a stranger maybe hunnewell returned quietly yet if you had known him his voice trailed off pitt eyed hunnewell speculatively do you always form sentimental attachments to your students genius adventurer scientist legend the tenth richest man in the world before he was twentyfive a kind and gentle person totally untouched by his fame and wealth yes i think you could safely say a friendship with kristjan fyrie could result in a sentimental attachment how strange pitt thought it was the first time the scientist had mentioned fyries name since they had left washington and it had been uttered in a hushed almost reverent tone the same inflection pitt recalled that admiral sandecker had also used when he spoke of the icelander pitt was conscious of no awe as he stood over the pitiful remains of the man who had been one of the most powerful figures in international finance as he stood there staring down his mind simply could not associate the ashes at his feet with the fleshandblood person the worlds newspapers referred to as the apotheosis of the swinging intellectual jetsetter perhaps if he had met the celebrated kristjan fyrie an emotion of some sort might be present now but then pitt truly doubted it he wasnt one to impress easily take away the clothes of the greatest living man his father once told him and you behold a very embarrassed naked and defenseless animal pitt looked at the twisted metal rings for a moment and then passed them back to hunnewell and as he did he heard the faint sound of movement somewhere on the deck above he froze listening intently but the sound had died in the blackness beyond the upper hatchway there was something sinister in the quality of the silence that hung over the devastated cabina feeling that someone was observing their every motion listening to their every word pitt nerved himself for an act of defense but it was too late a powerful light beam played into the room from the top of the ladder blinding his eyes in its blazing glare robbing the dead gentlemen by god i do believe you two are capable of most anything the face was hidden behind the light but the voice unmistakably belonged to commander koski chapter without moving without replying pitt stood in the middle of the charred deck he stood there it seemed to him for a decade while his brain worked to explain koskis presence he had expected the commander to arrive on the scene eventually but not for at least another three hours it was now obvious that instead of waiting until the prescribed rendezvous time koski had altered his heading and pushed the catawaba at full speed along hunnewells plotted course into the ice pack as soon as the helicopter was out of sight koski swung the flash beam to the ladder exposing dovers face beside him we have much to talk about major pitt dr hunnewell if you please pitt thought of a cleverly worded comeback but dismissed it instead he said up your ass koski you come down and bring that hulking goon of an exec officer if it will make you feel any safer there was almost a full minute of angry silence before koski replied youre hardly in a position to make rash demands why not theres too much at stake for dr hunnewell and me to sit here and suck our thumbs while you play amateur detective pitt knew his words were arrogant but he had to get the upper hand over koski no need to get nasty major an honest explanation will go a long way youve lied since the moment you set foot on my ship the novgorod indeed the greenest cadet at the coast guard academy wouldnt think of identifying this hulk as a russian spy trawler the radar antennas the highly sophisticated electronic gear you described with such authoritydid the equipment evaporate i didnt buy you and hunnewell from the beginning but your stories were convincing and my own headquarters however mysteriously backed you up youve used me major my crew my ship as you would a streetcar or a service station an explanation yes i dont think its asking too much merely the answer to one simple question what in hell is coming off koski was in the fold now pitt thought the cocky little commander wasnt demanding he was asking you still have to come down to our level part of the answer lies here in the ashes there was a moments hesitation but they came koski followed by the mammoth form of dover climbed down the ladder and faced pitt and hunnewell okay gentlemen lets have it youve seen most of the ship pitt asked koski nodded enough eighteen years of rescue c at sea and ive never seen a vessel gutted as bad as this one do you recognize it impossible whats left to recognize it was a pleasure craft a yacht that much is certain beyond that you can flip a coin koski looked at pitt a faint puzzlement in his eyes im the one who expects answers what are you leading up to the lax ever hear of it koski nodded the lax disappeared over a year ago with all hands including its owner the icelandic mining magnate he hesitated recalling fyrie kristjan fyrie christ half the coast guard searched for months didnt find a sign so what about the lax youre standing on it pitt said slowly letting his words sink in he aimed his flashlight at the deck and this cremated mess is all thats left of kristjan fyrie koskis eyes widened and the color drained from his face he took a step forward and stared down at the thing in the yellow circle of light good god are you sure burned beyond recognition is a gross understatement but dr hunnewell is ninety percent certain of fyries personal effects yes the rings i overheard not much perhaps but considerably more than we could find on the other bodies ive never seen anything like this koski said in wonder it cant be a ship this size couldnt vanish without a trace for nearly a year and then pop up burned to a cinder in the middle of an iceberg it would seem that it did just that hunnewell said sorry dog koski said staring into hunnewells eyes though im the first to admit that im not in your league when it comes to the science of ice formations ive kicked around the north atlantic long enough to know that an iceberg might get sidetracked by currents drifting in circles or scrape along the newfoundland coast for up to three yearsample time for the lax by some remote chance to become trapped and entombed but if youll forgive the word play the theory doesnt hold water youre quite correct commander hunnewell said the chances are extremely remote for such an occurrence but nonetheless conceivable as you know a firegutted ship takes days to cool if a current or wind pushed and held the hull against the iceberg it would only take fortyeight hours or less before this entire ship imbedded itself under the bergs mantle you can achieve the same situation by holding a redhot poker against an ice block the poker will melt its way into the block until it cools then the ice if refrozen around the metal locks it tight okay dog you score on that one however theres one important factor no one has considered which is pitt prompted the final course of the lax koski said firmly nothing strange about that pitt offered it was in all the newspapers fyrie with his crew and passengers left reykjavik on the morning of april tenth of last year and laid a direct heading for new york he was last sighted by a standard oil tanker six hundred miles off cape farewell greenland after that nothing more was seen or heard of the lax again thats fine as far as it goes koski pulled his coat collar around his ears and fought to keep his teeth from chattering except the sighting took place near the fiftieth paralleltoo far south of the iceberg limit i would like to remind you commander hunnewell said raising an intimidating eyebrow that your own coast guard has logged as many as fifteen hundred bergs in one year below the fortyeighth parallel and id like to remind you dog koski persisted that during the year in question the number of iceberg sightings below the fortyeighth parallel came to zero hunnewell merely shrugged it would be most helpful dr hunnewell if youd explain how an iceberg appeared where none existed then with the lax frozen in its clutches ignored the prevailing currents for eleven and a half months and cruised four degrees north while every other berg in the atlantic was drifting south at the rate of three knots an hour i cant hunnewell said simply you cant koskis face went blank with disbelief he looked at hunnewell then at pitt then back to hunnewell again you rotten bastards he said savagely dont lie to me thats pretty salty terminology commander pitt said harshly what in hell do you expect youre both highly intelligent people yet you act like a pair of mongoloids take dr hunnewell here an internationally renowned scientist and he cant even explain how an iceberg can drift north against the labrador current either youre a fraud dog or youre the dumbest professor on record the plain simple truth is that its as impossible for this berg to reverse drift as it is for a glacier to flow uphitl nobodys perfect hunnewell said shrugging helplessly no courtesy no honest answer is that it its not a question of honesty pitt said weve our orders just as you have yours up to an hour ago hunnewell and i were following a precise plan that plan is now out the window uhhuh and the next move in our game of charades the problem is we cant explain everything pitt said damned little in reality ill tell you what dr hunnewell and i know after that youll have to draw your own conclusions you could have leveled with me sooner hardly pitt said as captain of your ship you have full authority you even have the power to disregard or challenge orders from your commandant if you feel they endanger your crew and ship i couldnt take a chance we had to give you a snow job so youd cooperate fully besides we were not to confide in anyone im going against those orders right now could be another snow job could be pitt said grinning but whats the percentage hunnewell and i have nothing more to gain were washing our hands of this mess and heading for iceland youre dropping all this in my lap why not abandoned and drifting derelicts are your bag remember your motto semper paratus always prepared coast guard to the rescue and all that the twisted look on koskis face was priceless i would appreciate it if you just stuck to the facts without benefit of tawdry remarks very well pitt said calmly the story i concocted on the catawaba was true up to a pointthe point where i substituted the novgorod for the lax fyries yacht of course wasnt carrying classified electronic equipment or any other clandestine mechanical devices for that matter the cargo actually consisted of eight majorleague engineers and scientists from fyrie mining limited who were on their way to new york to open secret negotiations with two of our governments largest defense contractors somewhere on boardprobably in this roomwas a file of documents containing a geological survey of the ocean floor what fyries research team bad discovered under the sea or where remains a mystery this information was vitally important to a great number of people our own defense department desperately yearned to get their hands on it and so did the russians they pulled out all stops to grab it the last statement explains a great deal said koski meaning koski exchanged knowing looks with dover we were one of the ships that searched for the laxit was the catawabas first patrol every time we blinked our eyes we found ourselves crossing the wake of a russian vessel we were just egotistical enough to think they were observing our search patterns now it turns out that they were nosing after the lax too it also neatly ties in with the reason we butted in on your show said dover ten minutes after you and dr hunnewell left the flight pad we received a message from coast guard headquarters warning of a russian sub patrolling around the ice pack we tried but couldnt raise you small wonder pitt interrupted it was essential that we maintain strict radio silence once we headed for the derelict i took the precaution of switching the radio off we couldnt transmit much less receive after commander koski notified headquarters of our failure to contact your helicopter dover continued a signal came through hot and heavy ordering us to hightail it after you and act as escort in case the sub got pushy how did you find us pitt asked we hadnt passed two icebergs before we snotted that yellow copter of yours it stood out like a canary on a bedsheet pitt and hunnewell looked at each other and began laughing whats the joke koski asked curiously luck plain simple paradoxical luck said pitt his face twisted in mirth we flew all over hell for three hours before we found this floating ice palace and you found it five minutes after you began searching pitt then briefly told koski and dover about the iceberg decoy and meeting with the russian submarine good lord dover muttered are you suggesting that were not the first to set foot on the iceberg the evidence is plain pitt said the ice patrols dyed stain has been chipped away and hunnewell and i found footprints in nearly every cabin of the ship and theres more something that takes the whole situation out of the mysterious and puts it in the category of the macabre the fire the fire undoubtedly accidental fires have been happening on ships since the first reed boats floated down the nile thousand of years ago murder has been going on for much longer than that murder koski repeated flatly you did say murder with a capital m except for the excessive degree ive observed nothing i havent already seen on at least eight other burnedout ships during my service on the coast guardbodies stench devastation the works in your honored opinion as an air force officer what makes you think this one is any different pitt ignored koskis testy remark its all too perfect the radio operator in the radio room two engineers in the engine room the captain and a mate on the bridge the passengers in either their staterooms or salon even a cook in the galley everybody exactly where he should be you tell me commander youre the expert what in hell kind of a fire would sweep through the entire ship roasting everyone to a crisp without their making the slightest attempt at selfpreservation koski tugged at an ear thoughtfully no hoses are scattered in the passageways its apparent no one tried to save the ship the nearest body to the fire extinguisher lies twenty feet away the crew went against all laws of human nature if they decided at the last minute to run and die at their routine duty stations i cant imagine a cook who perferred dying in his galley to saving his life that still proves nothing panic could have what does it take to convince you commandera belt in the bicuspids with a baseball bat explain the radio operator he died at his set yet its a known fact that a mayday signal was never received from the lax or anyother ship in the north atlantic at the time seems a bit odd that he couldnt have gotten off at least three or four words of a distress call keep going koski said quietly his piercing eyes had an interested glint pitt lit a cigarette and blew a long cloud of blue smoke into the refrigerated air and he seemed to deliberate for a moment lets talk about the condition of the derelict you said it commander youve never seen a ship gutted as badly as this one why it was carrying no explosives or flammable cargo and we can rule out the fuel tanksthey caused the blaze to spread yes but not to this degree on the opposite end of the ship why would every square inch burn with such a high intensity the hull and superstructure are steel and besides hoses and extinguishers the lax had a sprinkler system he paused and pointed at two misshapen metal fixtures hanging from the ceiling a fire at sea usually starts at one location the engine room or a cargo hold or a storage area and then spreads from compartment to compartment taking hours and sometimes days to fully consume a ship ill bet you any amount you care to cover that a fire investigator would scratch his head and cross this one off as a flash fire one that totaled out the entire ship within a matter of minutes setting a new record ignited by causes or persons unknown what do you have in mind for the cause pitt said a flamethrower there was a minute of appalled silence do you realize what youre suggesting youre damned right i do pitt said right down to the violent blast of searing flame the hideous swish of the jets the terrible smoke from melted flesh like it or not a flamethrower is the logical answer they were all listening now with horrified interest hunnewell made a choking noise in his throat as if he were going to be sick again its outlandish unthinkable koski murmured this entire setup is outlandish pitt said evenly hunnewell stared at pitt blankly i cant believe that everyone stood like sheep and let themselves be turned into human torches dont you see pitt said our fiendish friend somehow either drugged or poisoned the passengers and crew probably slipped a massive dose of chloral hydrate into their food or drinks they all could have been shot dover ventured i studied several of the remains pitt shook his head there were no signs of bullets or shattered bones and if he waited until they were all knocked out by the poisoni prefer to they died outrightscattered them around the ship and then went from compartment to compartment with a flame thrower koski left the surmise unplumbed but what then where did the killer go from there before attempting to answer that one hunnewell said wearily i wish someone would kindly explain where the murderer materialized from in the first place he obviously wasnt one of the passengers or crew ne lax sailed with fifteen men and it burned with fifteen men logic dictates that this was the work of a team who boarded from another ship wont work said koski any boarding of one ship by another requires some sort of radio contact even if the lax had picked up survivors from a phony shipwreck the captain would have immediately reported it koski suddenly smiled as i recall fyries last message asked for the reservation of a penthouse suite at the statlerhilton in new york poor bastard dover said slowly if money and success ends like this who needs it he looked at the thing on the deck again and quickly turned away god what kind of maniac could murder fifteen humans at a sitting methodically poison fifteen men and then calmly cremate them with a flamethrower the same maniac who blows up airliners for insurance money said pitt one who can kill another human with the same lack of shattering guilt youd experience after swatting a fly the motive here was obviously gain fyrie and his people made a discovery that was extremely valuable the united states wanted it russia wanted it but a dark horse got away with it was it worth all this hunnewell said with sickness in his eyes it was to the sixteenth man pitt stared down at the grisly remains on the deck the unrecorded intruder who became the death of the party chapter iceland the land of frost and fire rugged glaciers and smoldering volcanoes an island prism of lavabed reds rolling tundra greens and placid lake blues stretched under the rich gold glow of the midnight sun surrounded by the atlantic ocean bounded by the warm waters of the gulf stream in the south and by the frigid polar sea to the north iceland rests midway as the crow flies between new york and moscow a strange island of kaleidoscopic scenes far less cold than its name suggests the average temperature in the cold month of january rarely rises above that of the new england coast of the united states to someone seeing it for the first time iceland seems indeed an unequaled phenomenon of beauty pitt watched the jagged snowpacked peaks of the island grow on the horizon and the flashing water below the ulysses turn from the deep blue of the great ocean depths to the rich green of the inshore surf then he altered the controls and the helicopter dipped neatly on a ninetydegree angle and a parallel course along the steep lava cliffs that burst from the sea below they passed over a tiny fishing village nestled on a barron circle bay its roofs painted in a checkered myriad of tile reds and pastel greens an outpost at the gateway of the arctic circle what time is it hunnewell asked awakening from a light sleep ten minutes past four in the morning pitt replied god to look at the sun youd think it was four in the afternoon hunnewell yawned loudly and made a vain attempt to stretch in the cramped confines of the cockpit about now id give my right arm if i could go back to sleep between the crisp white sheets of a soft bed keep your eyes propped open it wont be long now how far to reykjavik another half hour pitt paused to make a visual check of the instruments i could have cut north sooner but i wanted to sightsee the coastline six hours fortyfive minutes since we left the catawaba not bad time probably could have shaved that considerably if we werent handicapped with an extra fuel tank without it wed be back there somewhere trying to swim four hundred miles to shore pitt grinned we could have always sent a mayday to the coast guard judging from the mood commander koski was in when we took off i doubt if hed put himself out for us if we were drowning in a bathtub and he had his hand on the plug in spite of what koski thinks of me id vote for him as admiral any time he decided to run in my book hes a damn good man you have a funny way of expressing your admiration hunnewell said dryly except for your perceptive deduction concerning the flame thrower hats off to you for that one by the wayyou really didnt tell him a damned thing we gave him the truth as far as it went anything else would have been fifty percent guesswork the only real fact that we omitted was the name of fyries discovery zirtonium hunnewells gaze was lost in the distance atomic number forty i barely squeaked through my geology class pitt said smiling zirconium what makes it worth mass murder purified zirconium is vital in the construction of nuclear reactors because it absorbs little or no radiation every nation in the world with facilities for atomic research would give their eyeteeth to have it obtainable by the carload admiral sandecker is certain that if fyrie and his scientists did indeed discover a vast zirconium bonanza it was under the sea close enough to the surface to be raised economically pitt turned and stared out of the cockpit bubble at the dark ultramarine blue that stretched almost unrippled to the south a fishing boat with a chain of dories sailed out to sea the tiny hulls moving as easy as if they were gliding across a tinted mirror he watched them through eyes that barely saw his mind dwelling on the exotic element that lay covered by the cold waters below a hell of an undertaking he muttered just loud enough to be heard over the drone from the engines exhaust the problems of raising raw ore from the sea bottom are emense yes but not insurmountable fyrie limited employs the worlds leading experts at underwater mining thats how kristjan fyrie built his empire you know dredging diamonds off the coast of africa hunnewell spoke with what sounded like simple admiration he was only eighteen a seaman on an old greek freighter when he jumped ship at beira a small port on the coast of mozambique it didnt take him long to catch the diamond fever there was a boom on in those days but the big syndicates had all the productive claims tied up thats where fyrie stood out from the resthe had a shrewd and creative mind if diamond deposits could be found on land not two miles from shore he reasoned why couldnt they lie underwater on the continental shelf so every day for five months he dove in the warm waters of the indian ocean until he found a section of the seabed that looked promising now the trick was scrounging the financing to buy the needed dredging equipment fyrie had arrived in africa with nothing but the shirt on his back to beg from the white moneyed interests in the territory would have been a waste of time they would have taken everything and left him with nothing one percent of something is often better than ninetynine percent of nothing pitt interjected not to kristjan fyrie hunnewell replied defensively he had a true icelanders sense of principleshare the profits but never give them away he went before the black people of mozambique and sold them on forming their own syndicate with kristjan fyrie of course as president and general manager after the black people raised the financing for the barge and dredging equipment fyrie worked twenty hours a day until the entire operation was running like a computer at ibm the five months of diving paid offthe dredge began to bring up highgrade diamonds almost immediately within two years fyrie was worth forty million dollars pitt noticed a dark speck in the sky several thousand feet higher and in front of the ulysses you certainly seem to have studied the fyrie history i know it sounds strange hunnewell went on but fyrie seldom stayed with a project more than a few years most men would have bled the operation dry not kristjan after he made a fortune beyond his wildest dreams he turned the whole business over to the people who financed the venture just gave it away lock stock and the popular barrel he distributed every share of his stock to the native stockholders set up a black administration that could run efficiently without him and took the next boat back to iceland of the few white men held in high esteem by the africans the name of kristjan fyrie stands right at the top pitt was watching the solitary dark speck in the northern sky turn into a sleek jet aircraft he leaned forward screwing up his eyes against the bright blue glare the stranger was one of the new executive jets built by the british fast reliable and capable of whisking twelve passengers halfway around the world in a matter of hours without a fuel stop pitt barely had time to realize that the stranger was painted an ebony black from nose to tail when it swept past his range of vision traveling in the opposite direction what did fyrie do for an encore he asked mined manganese off vancouver island in british columbia and brought in an offshore oil field in peru to name a few there were no mergers no subsidiaries kristjan built fyrie limited into a great industry specializing in underwater geological exploitation nothing else did he have a family no his parents died in a fire when he was very young all he had was a twin sister dont really know much about her fyrie put her through a finishing school in switzerland and so rumor has it she later became a missionary somewhere in new guinea apparently her brothers fortune meant nothing to hunnewell never finished the sentence he jerked sideways facing pitt his eyes staring blankly his mouth open in surprise but no words coming out pitt barely had time to see the old man slump forward limp and dead to all appearances as the plexiglass bubble encircling the cockpit shattered into a thousand jagged slivers and fell away twisting to one side and throwing up an arm to protect his face from the blasting wall of cold air pitt momentarily lost control of the helicopter its aerodynamics drastically altered the ulysses nosed sharply upward almost on its end throwing pitt and the unconscious hunnewell violently against their backrests it was then pitt became aware of the machine gun shells striking the fuselage aft of the seats the sudden uncontrolled maneuver temporarily saved their lives the gunner aboard the black jet had been caught off guard adjusting his trajectory too late and sending most of his fire into an empty sky is slow steed withunable to match the helicopter without stalling the mysterious jet soared forward and swung around in a hundredandeightydegree turn for another assault the bastards must have made a sharp circle east and south and west before attacking from the rear pitt quickly figured as he struggled to bring the helicopter on a level course a near impossible task with a twohundredmileanhour air stream tearing at his eyes he throttled down trying desperately to reduce the unseen force that pinned his body against the seat the black jet swept by again but this time pitt was ready for it he pulled the ulysses to an abrupt horizontal stop the rotor blades frantically beating the atmosphere raising the light craft in a straight vertical climb the dodge worked the pilot of the jet roared under pitt unable to bring the machine gun to bear twice more pitt managed to shake his attacker but it was only a question of time before his opponent compensated for his rapidly diminishing bag of tricks pitt didnt kid himself there was no escape the battle was too onesided the score was seven to nothing in favor of the visitors with only a few seconds left to play in the fourth quarter a grim smile wrinkled around pitts eyes as he lowered the copter to a bare twenty feet above the water victory was hopeless but there was a slight chance an infinitesimal fingertip chance he thought for a tie score he studied the inkblack aircraft as it jockied for the last pass there was nothing left now but the mad clangor of steeljacketed bullets smashing through the thin aluminum skin of the ulysses pitt steadied the small defenseless craft and hovered as the jet dove like a concrete bird directly toward him the gunner laying prone and firing out an open cargo door played it cool this time he laid down a steady stream of shells waiting for the narrowing gap to carry them into the path of the helicopter the barrage of death was only thirty yards away now pitt braced himself for the impact and threw the ulysses straight up into the attacking plane the helicopters rotor blade shattering as they sliced through the jets horizontal stabilizer instinctively pitt flicked the ignition switch off as the turbine engine without the drag from the rotor raced wildly mid the howl of tortured metal then the racket stopped and the sky was silent except for the wind that whistled in pitts ears he snatched a glance at the strange jet just before it crashed into the sea nose first its tail section hanging like a broken arm pitt and the unconscious hunnewell werent much better off all they could do was sit and wait for the crippled helicopter to drop like a stone nearly seventy feet into the cold atlantic water when the crash came it was much worse than pitt had anticipated the ulysses fell on its side into the iceland surf in six feet of water a scant football field length from shore pitts head whipped sideways and glanced off the door frame sending him into a vortex of darkness fortunately the agonizing shock of the icy water jolted him back to dizzy wakefulness waves of nausea swept over him and he knew he was only a hairbreadth away from saying to hell with it and drifting off to sleep for the last time his face twisted with pain pitt undid his seat belt and shoulder harness taking a gulp of air before a breaking wave crest passed over the helicopter then quickly he unfastened the insensible hunnewell and lifted his head above the swirling water at that instant pitt slipped and lost his balance as a crashing breaker knocked him from the ulysses into the surf still grasping hunnewell by a death grip on the coat collar he battled the rolling surge as it swept him toward shore rolling him endoverend across the uneven rocky bottom if pitt ever wondered what it was like to drown he had a pretty good idea now the freezing water stung every square inch of his skin like a million bees his ears failed to pop and his head was one tormenting ache his nostrils filled with water stabbing like a knife at his frontal sinus and the thin membranes of his lungs felt as if theyd been dipped in nitric acid finally after bashing his knees into a bed of rocks he struggled to his feet his head bursting gratefully into the pure icelandic air he swore to himself then and there that if he should ever decide to commit suicide it definitely wouldnt be by drowning he staggered from the water onto a pebblestrewn beach half carrying half dragging hunnewell like a drunk leading a drunk a few steps beyond the tideline pitt eased his burden down and checked the doctors pulse and breathing both were on the fast side but regular then he saw hunnewells left arm it had been terribly mangled at the elbow by the machine gun bullets as quickly as his numbed hands would allow pitt took off his shirt tore off the sleeves and tightly wrapped them around the wound to stem the flow of blood as bad as the tissue damage looked there was no artery spurt so he automatically discarded the idea of a tourniquet in favor of direct pressure then he sat hunnewell up against a large rock made a crude sling and elevated the wound to aid the control of bleeding pitt could do nothing more for his friend so he lay down on the lumpy carpet of stone and let the unwelcome pain in his body and the hated currents of nausea sweep through his body relaxing as much as the sickness would let him he closed his eyes shutting out a magnificent view of the clouddotted arctic sky deep unconsciousness should have held pitt for at least several hours but a distant alarm in the depths of his brain began signaling and instinctively in response to the stimuli his eyes popped open only twenty minutes after they had closed the scene was different the sky and clouds were still there but something stood in front of them it took a second for pitts eyes to focus on the five children standing around him there was no fear in their faces as they stared down at pitt and hunnewell pitt sat up on one elbow forced a smileit wasnt easyand said good morning group up a bit early arent you as if on cue the younger children looked at the oldest a boy he hesitated several moments collecting his words before he spoke my brothers and sisters and i were herding our fathers cows on the meadow above the cliffs we saw your he paused his face blank helicopter pitt prompted yes that is it the boys face brightened helicopter we saw your helicopter lying in the ocean a slight blush reddened his flawless scandinavian complexion i am ashamed that my english is not so good no pitt said softly im the one who is ashamed you speak english like an oxford professor while i cant even offer you two words in icelandic the boy beamed at the compliment as he helped pitt struggle awkwardly to his feet you are hurt sir your head bleeds ill survive its my friend who is injured seriously we must get him to the nearest doctor quickly i sent my younger sister to fetch my father when we discovered you he will bring his truck soon just then hunnewell moaned softly pitt leaned over him cradling the bald head the old man was conscious now his eyes rolled and stared at pitt briefly and then stared at the children he was breathing heavily and tried to speak but the words caught in his throat there was a strange kind of serenity in his eyes as he gripped pitts hand and in a strained effort murmured god save thee then he trembled and gave a little gasp dr hunnewell was dead chapter the farmer and his oldest boy carried hunnewell to the land rover pitt rode in the back holding the oceanographers head in his lap he closed the glazed sightless eyes and smoothed the few long strands of white hair most children would have been terrified of death but the boys and girls who surrounded pitt in the bed of the truck sat silently and calmly their expressions devoid of all but total acceptance of the only certainty that waits for everyone the farmer a big handsome outdoorhardened man drove slowly up a narrow road to the top of the cliff and through the meadows pulling a small cloud of volcanic red dust behind the tailgate within minutes he stopped at a small cottage on the outskirts of a village of white farmhouses dominated by the traditional icelandic churchyard a somber little man with soft green eyes enlarged by thick steelrimmed glasses came out introduced himself as dr jonsson and after examining hunnewell led pitt into the cottage where he stitched and bandaged pitts threeinch head gash and made him change into some dry clothes later as pitt was drinking a strong brew of coffee and schnaps forced on him by the doctor the boy and his father entered the boy nodded to pitt and spoke my father would consider it a great honor if he could transport you and your friend to reykjavik if that is where you wish to go pitt stood and stared a moment into the fathers warm gray eyes you tell your father that i am deeply grateful and that the honor is mine pitt held out his hand and the icelander gripped it hard the boy translated his father simply nodded and then they both turned and left the room without another word pitt lit a cigarette and looked quizzically at dr jonsson youre a member of a strange people doctor you all seem to be brimming with warmth and courtesy within but your exterior seems completely dry of any emotion youll find the citizens of reykjavik more open this is the country we are born into an isolated and stark but beautiful land icelanders who live away from the city are not noted for gossip we can almost come to understand each others thoughts before we speak life and love are commonplace death is merely an accepted occurrence i wondered why the children appeared so unconcerned when sitting next to a corpse death to us is merely a separation and only a visual one at that for you see the doctors hand pointed through a large picture window at the gravestones in the churchyard they who went before us are still here pitt stared several moments at the grave markers all rising on their individual crooked angles among the green mossy grass then his attention was caught by the farmer who was carrying a handcrafted pine coffin to the land rover he watched attentively as the big silent man lifted hunnewells form into the traditional tapered box with all the strength and tenderness of a new father with a baby what is the farmers name pitt asked mundsson thorsteinn mundsson his sons name is bjarni pitt stared through the window until the coffin was pushed onto the truckbed then he turned away ill always wonder if dr hunnewell would still be alive if id done things differently who will ever know remember my friend if you had been born ten minutes sooner or ten minutes later your path might never have crossed his pitt smiled i get what you mean but the fact is his life was in my hands and i fumbled and lost it he hesitated seeing the scene again in his mind on the beach i passed out for half an hour after i bandaged his arm if i had stayed awake he might not have bled to death put your conscience to rest your dr hunnewell did not die from loss of blood it was the shock of his injury the shock of your crash the shock of below freezing sea water no im certain an autopsy will show that his aging heart gave out long before his blood he was getting on in years and he was not from what i could determine a physically athletic man he was a scientist an oceanographer the best then i envy him pitt looked at the village physician speculatively why do you say that he was a man of the sea and he died by the sea he loved and perhaps his last thoughts were as serene as the water he talked of god pitt murmured he was fortunate yet i feel i will be fortunate when my time comes to be laid to rest over there in the churchyard only a hundred steps from where i was born and among so many of the people i have loved and cared for i wish i could share your affinity for staying in one spot doctor but somewhere in the distant past one of my ancestors was a gypsy ive inherited his wandering ways three years is my alltime record for living in the same location an interesting question which of us is the most fortunate pitt shrugged who can tell we both hear the beat of a different drummer in iceland jonsson said we follow the lure of a different fisherman you missed your true calling doctor you should have been a poet ah but i am a poet dr jonsson laughed every village has at least four or five you will have to search far and wide for a more literate country than iceland over five hundred thousand books are sold annually to two hundred thousand people our entire population he broke off as the door opened and two men walked in they stood calm efficient and very official in their police uniforms one nodded a greeting to the doctor and pitt suddenly got the entire picture you neednt have been secretive about calling the police dr jonsson i have nothing to conceal from anyone no offense but dr hunnewells arm was obviously mangled by gun shots ive treated enough injured hunters to know the correct signs the law is explicit as im sure it is in your country i must report all bullet wounds pitt didnt like it much but he had little option the two muscular policemen standing before him would hardly buy a story about a phantom black jet attacking and shooting the ulysses full of holes before being rammed in midair a connection betaeen the derelict in the iceberg and the jet was neither coincidental nor accidental he was certain now that what started out as a simple search for a missing ship had turned out to be an unwanted involvement in a complex farflung conspiracy he was tiredtired of lying sick of the whole goddamn mess only one thought gripped his mind hunnewell was dead and someone had to pay were you the pilot of the helicopter that crashed sir one of the policemen inquired an utmistakable british accent and a courteous tone but the sir seemed forced yes was all pitt answered the policemen seemed taken aback for a moment by pitts terse reply he was blond had dirty fingernails and was dressed in a uniform that left his wrists and ankles showing your name and the name of the deceased pitt major dirk pitt united states air force the man in the coffin was dr william hunnewell national underwater marine agency pitt thought it strange that neither policeman made an attempt to write the information down your destination it was undoubtedly the airfield at keflavik no the heliport in reykjavik a flicker of surprise crossed the blond policemans eyes it was barely perceptible but pitt caught it the interrogator turned to his partner a darkskinned burly character with glasses and said something in icelandic he swung his head toward the land rover outside scowled noticeably then turned back to pitt could you tell me your departure point sir greenlandcouldnt give you the name of the town its spelled with twenty letters and to an american its totally unpronounceable dr hunnewell and i were on an expedition for our government charting icebergs in the east greenland current the idea was to crisscross the denmark strait by refueling at reykjavik and then head back west to greenland on a parallel course fifty miles further north unfortunately we didnt plan well ran out of fuel and crashed on the coast thats all give or take a few details pitt lied without knowing exactly why god he thought its becoming a habit where exactly did you crash how the hell should i know pitt said unpleasantly go three blocks past the cow pasture and turn left at broadway the helicopter is parked between the third and fourth waves its painted yellow you cant miss it please be reasonable sir pitt took satisfaction at the sudden flame in the policemans face we must have all the details in order to make a report to our superior then why dont you stop beating around the bush and ask about dr hunnewells bullet wounds the official facial expression on the darkskinned policeman cracked in a stifled yawn pitt stared at dr jonsson you did say thats the reason theyre here it is my duty to cooperate with the law jonsson seemed hesitant to speak suppose you explain your comrades wound said dirty nails we were carrying a rifle to shoot polar bears pitt said slowly it accidentally discharged in the crash the bullet striking dr hunnewell in the elbow as far as pitt could see the two icelandic policemen werent reacting at all to his sarcasm they stood quiet looking at him with impatient speculationspeculation pitt thought at how they would subdue him if he resisted any physical demands on their part he didnt have to wait long i am sorry sir but you force us to take you to our headquarters for further interrogation the only place youll take me is to the american consulate in reykjavik i have committed no crime against the people of iceland nor broken any of your laws i am quite familiar with our laws major pitt we do not relish getting out of bed at this time of morning for an investigation the questions are necessary you have not answered them to our satisfaction so we must take you to our headquarters until we can determine what happened there you will be free to call your consulate in due time officer but first would you mind identifying yourselves i do not understand the policeman stared coldly at pitt why should we identify ourselves it is obvious what we are dr jonsson can vouch for our authenticity he offered no papers or the usual police identification card all he showed was his irritation there is no doubt as to your official capacity gentlemen jonsson said in an almost apologetic tone however sergeant amarson usually patrols our village i do not believe i have seen you come through our village before amarson had an emergency call in grindavik he asked us to answer your call until he could arrive are you being transferred to this territory no we were just passing through on our way to the north to pick up a prisoner we stopped in to say hello and have a cup of coffee with sergeant amarson unfortunately before the pot became hot he received your call and the one from grindavik almost simultaneously then wouldnt it be wise to hold major pitt until the sergeant arrives no i think not nothing can be accomplished here he turned to pitt my apologies major please do not be angry at our how do you say it in your country running you in he turned to jonsson i think it best if you came along too doctor in case the major has complications from his wounds its merely a formality a strange formality pitt thought considering the circumstances he had little choice but to comply with the policemans wishes what about dr hunnewell we will ask sergeant amarson to send a lorry for him jonsson smiled almost diffidently forgive me gentlemen i havent quite finished with the majors head wound i have two more stitches to insert before he is ready for travel if you please major he stood aside and motioned pitt back into the examining room closing the door i thought you were all through butchering me pitt said goodnaturedly those men are imposters jonsson whispered pitt said nothing there was no surprise on his face as he stepped softly over to the door put an ear against it and listened satisfied when he could hear voices across the next room he came back and faced jonsson youre positive yes sergeant amarson does not patrol grindavik also he never drinks coffeehis system is allergic to it so herefuses even to stock it in his kitchen your sergeant does he stand five foot nine and weigh about one hundred and seventy pounds to the inch and within five poundshe is an old friend i have examined him many times jonssons eyes clouded with puzzlement how could you describe a man you have never met the character who does all the talking is wearing amarsons uniform if you look closely you can see the outlines where the sergeant stripes used to rest on the sleeve i do not understand jonsson said in a whisper his face was very pale what is happening i dont have half the answers sixteen maybe as many as nineteen men have died and the killing will probably go on id guess sergeant amarson was the latest victim you and i are next jonsson looked stricken his hands clenched and unclenched in bewilderment and despair you mean i must die because i have seen and talked with two murderers im afraid doctor that youre an innocent bystander that must be eliminated simply because you can recognize their faces and you major why have they concocted such an elaborate scheme to kill you dr hunnewell and i also saw something that we shouldnt have jonsson stared into pitts impassive face it would be impossible to murder us both without creating excitement in the village iceland is a small country a fugitive could not run very far nor hide very long these men are no doubt professionals when it comes to killing someone is paying them and paying them well an hour after were dead theyll probably be relaxing with a drink in one hand aboard a jetliner bound for either copenhagen london or montreal they seem lax for professional assassins they can afford to be where can we go their car and mundssons truck are in front of the housetheyd easily cut us off before we could open a door pitt swung a hand toward a window iceland is open country there arent ten trees within fifty miles you said it yourself a fugitive could not run very far nor hide very long jonsson bowed his head in silent acceptance then he grinned faintly then our only alternative is to fight it is going to be difficult taking a life after spending thirty years trying to save them do you have any firearms jonsson sighed heavily no my bobby is fishing not bunting the only equipment i possess that might be classed as weapons are my surgical instruments pitt walked over to a white steelframed glasspaneled cabinet that held an assortment of neatly arranged medical instruments and drugs and opened the door we have one convenient advantage he said thoughtfully they dont know were wise to their nasty little plot therefore we shall introduce them to a good old american game known as pin the tali on the donkey only two more minutes had elapsed when jonsson opened the door to the examining room revealing pitt parked on a stool holding a bandage to his bleeding head jonsson motioned to the blond man who spoke english could you please assist me for a moment i am afraid that i need a third hand the man raised his eyebrow questioningly then shrugged to his partner who sat with his eyes half closed his overconfidence giving birth to thoughts a thousand miles away jonsson keeping any suspicion at a low level purposely left the door slightly ajar but not enough to allow vision of more than a fraction of the examining room if you could hold the majors head on a slight angle with both hands then i can finish without interruption he keeps twitching and ruining any chance for a neat stitch job jonsson winked and then spoke in icelandic these americans are like children when it comes to pain the fraudulent policeman laughed and nudged the doctor with his elbow then he walked around in front of pitt bent down and gripped pitts head with both hands on the temples come come major pitt a few stitches are nothing what if the good doctor had to amputate your it was all over in less than four secondssilently with seeming indifference and nonchalance pitt reached up his hands and grabbed the blond man around the wrists surprise showed for a brief instant in the strangers face then true shock as jonsson clamped a heavy gauze pad over his mouth and jammed a syringe against his neck in the same movement ne shock gave way to terror and he moaned in his throat a moan that could not be heard because pitt was loudly cursing jonsson for a nonexistent sewing operation the eyes above the white gauze began to lose focus and the man made a desperate effort to hurl himself backward but his wrists were held solidly in the vise of pitts grip then the eyes turned upward and he quietly collapsed into jonssons arms pitt quickly knelt down and pulled a service revolver from the unconscious mans belt holster and stepped softly to the door as soundless as he was swift he lined up the gun and jerked open the door swinging it all the way to its stop for a second the touthlooking brute with the spectacles sat there in stunned immobility staring at pitt in the doorway then his hand shot to his holster freeze pitt ordered the command was ignored and a shot blasted through the small waiting room there are many who claim the hand is quicker than the eye but there are few who will take the stand that the hand is quicker than a speeding bullet the gun flew from the bogus policemans hand as pitts shell tore into the wooden grip taking a thumb along with it never before had pitt seen such dazed uncomprehension and shocked in the paid killer stared at the bloody halfinch stump where his thumb had been pitt made to lower his gun but raised and aimed it again as he caught the look on his opponents facemouth tightened to a thin white line black hatred glaring out from the squinting eyes behind the glasses shoot me major quickly cleanly here he tapped his chest with his uninjured hand well well so you speak english my compliments you never gave me the slightest hint that you understood any of the conversation shoot me the words seemed to echo in the little room and in pitts ears for an interminable time why rush things theres every possibility youll hang for murdering sergeant amarson anyway pitt pulled the hammer of the revolver back for singleaction g i take it im safe in assuming you did kill yes the sergeant is dead now please do the same for me the eyes were cold yet pleading youre pretty anxious to get yourself planted jonsson looked but said nothing totally off balance he struggled to graspr a new set of circumstances a complete reversal of all his previous values as a doctor he couldnt just stand there and watch an injured man bleed profusely without aid let me take care of the hand jonsson volunteered stay behind me and dont move pitt said any man who wants to die is more dangerous than a cornered rat but good lord man you cannot stand there and gloat over his pain jonsson protested pitt ignored jonsson okay four eyes ill make a deal with you the next bullet goes through your heart if you tell me the name of the man who pays your salary the animallike eyes behind the glasses never left pitts face he shook his head silently and said nothing this isnt wartime friend youre not betraying your god or country loyalty to an employer is hardly worth your life you will kill me major i shall make you kill me he advanced toward pitt ill give you credit pitt said youre a persistent bastard he pulled the trigger and the revolver roared again the bullet smashing into the burly characters left leg just above the knee rarely had pitt seen such disbelief in a human face the paid killer slowly sank to the floor his left hand clutching his torn left leg trying to stem the blood flow his right hand lying motionless on the tile surrounded by a growing pool of red it seems our friend has nothing to say pitt said he pulled back the hammer to fire again please do not kill him jonsson pleaded his life is not worth the burden on your soul i beg you major let me have the gun he can cause no further harm pitt hesitated several moments torn between compassion and revenge then slowly he handed the revolver to jonsson and nodded jonsson took it and put his hand on pitts shoulder as if in secret understanding i am heartbroken that countrymen of mine should cause so much grief and pain to so many the doctor said with weariness in his voice i will take care of these two and contact the authorities immediately you go with mundsson to reykjavik and rest you have a nastylooking head wound but it wont prove serious unless you aggravate it stay in bed for at least two days that is a direct order from your doctor there appears to be a slight obstacle to your prescription pitt smiled crookedly and pointed through the front doorway you were one hundred percent correct about creating excitement in the village he nodded in the direction of the road where at least twenty villagers stood silently holding every type of weapon from telescopic rifles to smallbore shotguns all aimed steadily at the door of jonssons cottage mundsson was resting his gun easily in the crook of one arm one foot solidly on the second doorstep his son biarni slightly off to one side with an old mauser boltaction rifle pitt held both hands out where they could easily be seen i think now is an appropriate time doctor to give me a recommendation nese good townspeople arent sure who plays the good guys or the bad guys jonsson stepped past pitt and spoke for several minutes in icelandic when he finished the guns began to lower one by one and several of the villagers drifted toward their homes while a few lingered on the road to await further developments jonsson extended his hand and pitt gripped it i fervently hope you meet with success in finding the man responsible for the terrible number of senseless murders jonsson said if you should meet him i fear for your life you are not a killer if you were two men would lie dead in my home your concern for life i fear will be your defeat i beg you my friend do not hesitate when the moment arrives god and luck go with you pitt threw a last salute at dr jonsson and turned and stepped down the front steps to the road bjarni held the passenger door of the land rover open for him the seat was firm and the backrest stiff but pitt could not have cared less his entire body was numb he sat there as mundsson started the engine and shifted through the gears steering the truck over a stretch of smooth narrow pavement toward reykjavik pitt could have easily drifted off into a dead sleep but somewhere in the deep recesses of his mind a spark refused to go out something that he saw something that was said an undistinguishable something refused to let his mind slow down and rest it was like a song he couldnt quite recall whose title was on the tip of his tongue finally he gave it up and dozed off chapter time after time the exact number became lost pitt struggled up from the bottom of the rolling surf and staggered onto the beach dragging hunnewell time after time he bandaged the oceanographers arm only to slide into darkness again desperately every time the event ran through his brain like an image from a film projector he tried to hang onto those fleeting moments of consciousness only to lose out to the inevitable fact that nothing can change the past it was a nightmare he thought vaguely as he tried to tear himself away from the bloodstained beach he gathered his strength and with a mighty effort forced his eyes open expecting to see an empty bedroom the bedroom was there all right but it wasnt empty good morning dirk said a soft voice id almost lost hope that you would ever wake up pitt looked up into the smiling brown eyes of a longbodied girl who sat on a chair at the foot of his bed the last birdie with a yellow bill who hopped upon my windowsill didnt resemble you in the slightest he said she laughed so did the brown eyes she pushed the long strands of shining fawncolored hair behind her ears then she stood up and walked around to the head of the bed with a movement that could best be described as mercury flowing down a meandering glass tube she wore a red wool dress that clung to her precisionshaped hourglass figure the bern topping a pair of neatly sculptured knees she wasnt exactly beautiful in the exotic sense nor was she overly sexy but she was cutedamned cutewith a pert attractiveness that melted every man she met she touched the bandage on the side of his head and the smile gave way to a feminine look of florence nightingale concern youve had a nasty time hurt much only when i stand on my head pitt knew who she was her name was tidi royal and he knew her reason for genuine anxiety he knew her fun andgames personality was misleading she could pound out one hundred and twenty words a minute on a typewriter for eight hours without a yawn and take shorthand a shade faster the primary reasons why admiral james sandecker hired her as his private secretaryor so he steadfastly claimed pitt pulled himself to a sitting position and peeked under the covers to see if he was wearing anything he was just barelya pair of boxer shorts if youre here it could only mean the admiral is close by fifteen minutes after he got your message over the consulates radio we were on a jet to iceland hes pretty shaken about dr hunnewells death admiral sandecker blames himself hes going to have to stand in line pitt said i got there first he said youd feel that way tidi tried to speak lightly but it didnt quite come off guiltridden conscience probably trying to redo the event in your mind the admirals extrasensory perception must be working overtime oh no she said i dont mean the admiral pitt frowned quizzically a dr jonsson from a little vilage to the north called and gave the consulate very explicit instructions regarding your convalescence convalescence crap pitt snapped which reminds me what in hell are you doing in my bedroom she looked hurt i volunteered volunteered to sit with you while you slept she said dr jonsson insisted theres been a consulate staff member sitting in this room every minute since you closed your eyes last evening our what time is it a few minutes past tenam i might add god ive wasted nearly fourteen hours what happened to my clothes thrown out in the trash i should imagine they werent fit for rags youll have to borrow some from a staff member in that case how about rounding up something casual while i take a quick shower and shave he tossed her his biteisworsethanbark look and said ok dearheart face the wall she remained facing the bed ive always wondered what it would be like to see you wake up in the morning he shrugged and threw back the covers he was halfway through the motion of pushing himself to his feet when three things happened his eyes suddenly saw three tidis the room swayed as though it was made of rubber and his head began to ache with the mother of all aches tidi stepped forward abruptly and clutched his right arm her face reflecting the florence nightingale concern again please dirk your head isnt ready for your feet yet nothing its nothing i stood up too fast he made it to his feet and lurched into her arms youd make a lousy nurse tidi you get too involved with your patients he held onto her for several moments until the triplets became one and the bedroom stood at rigid attention only the ache in his head refused to diminish youre the one patient id love to get involved with dirk she held onto him tightly and made no attempt to remove her arms but you never seem to entice me youd stand next to me in an empty elevator and never recognize me at all there are times when i doubt whether you know i exist oh i know you exist all right he pushed himself away and started slowly for the bathroom refraining from facing her as he talked your vital statistics are five foot seven one hundred thirtyfive pounds thirtysix inches around the hips an astonishing twentythree inches at the waist and the bust a probable thirtysix ccup all in all a figure that belongs on the centerspread of playboy there is also the lightbrown hair framing an eager bright face enhanced by sparkling brown eyes a pert little nose a perfectly formed mouth flanked by two dimples that only show when you smile oh yes i almost forgot two moles behind the left ear and at this moment your heart is beating at approximately one hundred and five thumps per minute she stood there like a stunned winner on a tv quiz show momentarily at a loss for words she reached up and touched the two moles like wow i cant believe i heard you its unreal you like meyou really care for me dont get carried away pitt hesitated in the bathroom doorway and faced her im very attracted to you as any man would be to a pretty girl but im not in love with you you you never gave me any indication youve never even asked me for a date sorry tidi youre the admirals personal secretary i make it a rule never to play games that close to him pitt leaned against the doorframe for support i respect that old guy hes much more than just a friend or boss i wont cause complications behind his back i understand she said humbly but i certainly didnt figure you for the modest hero who sacrifices the heroine to a typewriter the rejected virgin who throws herself into a convent isnt exactly your bag either must we get nasty no pitt said approvingly why dont you be a good girl and scrounge me up a change of clothes lets see if youre as observant of my dimensions as i am of yours tidi said nothing in reply just stood there looking forlorn and curious finally she shook her head m a feminine display of irritation and left exactly two hours later clad in surprisingly wellfitting slacks and sport shirt pitt sat across a desk from admiral james sandecker the admiral looked tired and old far beyond his years his red hair was tousled in a shaggy unkempt mane and it was obvious from the stubble on his chin and cheeks that he hadnt shaved for at least two days he held one of his massive cigars casually in the fingers of his right hand stared at the long cylindrical shape for a moment and then set it in an ashtray without lighting the end he granted something about being glad to see pitt alive and still connected in all the right places then the weary bloodshot eyes studied pitt intently so much for preliminaries your story dirk lets have it pitt didnt give it to him instead he said i just spent an hour writing a detailed report of what occurred from the time hunnewell and i lifted off from the numa pad at dulles international until the farmer and his boy brought us to the consulate i also included my personal opinions and observations knowing you admiral iventure to guess youve read it at least twice i have nothing to add all i can do now is answer your questions what little of sanderkers face was open for expression seemed to indicate a certain interest if not downright curiosity at pitts flagrant insubordinate behavior he stood up all five foot six inches of him revealing a blue suit that cried out for a pressing and peered down at pitt a favorite tactic when he was ready to orate once was all i needed major no dirk this time when i want sarcastic remarks ill book don rickles or mort sahl and be assured of a professional job i appreciate the fact that youve been harassed by the coast guard and the russians had your butt frozen off on an iceberg looking at incinerated cadavers not to mention getting shot at crashing in the atlantic ocean and having a man die in your arms since i pulled you off that nice warm beach in california just seventytwo hours ago but that does not give you the unmitigated right to hardass your superior i apologize for the disrespect sir the words were there but the tone was sadly lacking if i seem a bit testy its simply because i smell a puton i have the distinct impression that you dropped me into an intricate maze without benefit of a road map so an eighth of an inch lift of the heavy red eyebrows to begin with hunnewell and i were on damn thin ice when we swindled the coast guard into using its finest cutter for a refueling base or at least i thought we were not hunnewell he knew the whole setup was fixed from beginning to end i thought wed bought a jail cell when commander koski signaled coast guard command in washington for confirmation of our presence i studied hunnewell he pored over his charts as if nothing was happening no quiver of the hand no indication of sweat on the brow he was completely at ease with the situation knowing that you had taken care of everything before we left dulles not quite sandecker picked up the cigar and lit it and gave pitt a shrewd look the commandant was inspecting a damn hurricane warning facility in florida you were already crossing novascotia before i could get to them he blew a huge cloud of smoke toward the ceiling please continue pitt slouched back in his chair a dim nearly undistinguishable outline of a ship turns up in an iceberg the coast guard doesnt have the slightest idea what registry it is yet four days go by and there is no investigation the catawaba is only hours away but is never notified of the sighting why somebody in the capitol with the authority high authority ordered hands off thats why sandecker toyed with the cigar i suppose you know what youre talking about major hell no sir pitt answered without the facts im guessing but you and hunnewell didnt guess there wasnt the slightest doubt in your minds that the derelict was the lax a ship that had been listed as missing for over a year you had absolute proof how or where it came from i cant say but you had it pitts green eyes blazed into sandeckers at this point my crystal ball gets foggy i was surprised but hunnewell was genuinely stunned when we found that the lax was burned to junk this factor wasnt in the script was it admiral in fact everything including your wellplanned scheme began to go down the drain someone you didnt count on was working against you someone with resources you or whatever agency in our government that is cooperating with you never considered you lost control even the russians were thrown off the track youre up against a shrewd mind admiral and the message is written in neon lights this guy doesnt play for ice cream and cake at birthday parties he kills people like an exterminator kills tetes the name of the game as advertised is zirconium i dont buy it people might kill one or two persons for a fortune but not in wholesale lots hunnewell was your friend for many years admiral mine for only a few days and i lost him he was my responsibility and i failed his contributions to society outstrip anything im capable of better id have died on that beachinstead of him sandecker showed no reaction to any of this his unblinking eyes never left pitts face as he sat behind the desk thoughtfully tapping the fingers of his right hand on the glass top then he stood up came around the desk and put his hands on pitts shoulders bullshit he said quietly but firmly it was a miracle you both made it to shore there isnt a bookmaker in the world who would give odds on an unarmed helicopter knocking a machineguntoting jet out of the sky im the one to blame i had a hint of what was going to happen and i wasnt smart enough to read the cards i didnt deal you in on the action because it wasnt necessary you were the best man i could lay my hands on for a tricky chauffeur job as soon as you got hunnewell here to reykjavik i was going to put you on the next flight back to california he paused to check his watch theres an air force reconnaissance jet leaving for tyler field new jersey in one hour and six minutes you can make connections for the west coast when you get there no thanks admiral pitt rose from the chair and walked to the window staring over the citys peaked and sunsplashed roofs ive heard that icelandic women are coolly beautiful id like to see for myself i can make that an order no good sir i understand what youre trying to do and im grateful the first attempt on my life and hunnewells was only half successful the second was much more elaborate and cunning and was reserved for me alone the third should be a masterpiece id like to stick around and see how its going to be staged sorry dirk sandecker was back on friendly terms again im not going to throw your life away with the wave of a hand before i stand at your graveside ill have you locked up and standing in front of a courtmartial for willful destruction of government property pitt smiled ive been meaning to talk to you about service regulations admiral he came across the room and casually sat on the edge of the desk for the past year and a half i have faithfully carried out all directives issued from your office ive questioned none of them however the time has come the walk in to get a few facts straight number one if it was possibleand it isntfor you to courtmartial me i doubt if the air force would take it lightly if one of their officers was tried by a naval court second and most important numa is not the bridge of the flagship of the fleet therefore you are not my commanding officer you are simply my bossno more no less if my insubordination infuriates your senses and naval traditions then you have no other choice but to fire me thats the way it is admiral and we both know it for several seconds sandecker made no comment but his eyes glinted with a strange sort of amusement then he threw back his head and began to laugh a roaring deep laugh that filled the room from carpet to ceiling god if there is anything worse than a cocky dirk pitt i hope it becomes infected with syphilis and rots in hell he returned to the chair behind the desk and sat down hands clasped behind his head ok dirk ill put you in at first string but youll be required to play straight ball no fancy independent plays agreed youre the boss sandecker winced noticeably okay out of respect for your ah superior suppose you give me the whole story from the beginning ive read the written words now i want to hear it orally direct from the horses mouth he peered at pitt with an expression that dared argument shall we commence sandecker heard pitt out then said god save thee thats what he said thats all he said then he was gone id hoped dr hunnewell might have offered me a clue to the whereabouts of the lax between the time it vanished and the time it became inbedded in the iceberg but he volunteered nothing except a historical sketch of kristjan fyrie and a lecture on zirconium he did as he was told i didnt want you involved that was two days ago now im involved up to my neck pitt leaned over the desk toward the older man lets have it you sly old fox what in hell is going on sandecker grinned for your sake im going to take that as a compliment he pulled out a bottom drawer and propped his feet on it i hope you know what youre letting yourself in for i dont have the vaguest idea but tell me anyway all right then sandecker leaned back in his swivel chair and puffed several times on his cigar this is what took place as far as it goestoo many pieces are missing for even a fifty percent glimpse at the overall picture about a year and a half ago fyries scientists successfully designed and constructed a nuclear undersea probe that could identify fifteen to twenty different mineral elements on the ocean floor the p e opera y posing elements to neutrons given off by a laboratoryproduced element called celtinium when activated by the neutrons the elements on the oceans bottom gave off gamma rays which were then analyzed and counted by a tiny detector on the probe during tests off iceland the probe detected and measured mineral samples of manganese gold nickel titanium and zirconiumthe zirconium in huge and unheardof amounts i think i see without the probe the zirconium could never be found again pitt said thoughtfully the prize then is not the rare elements but rather the probe itself yes the probe opens a vast and untapped frontier for undersea mining whoever owns it wont control the world of course but possession could lead to a direct reshuffling of private financial empires and a healthy shot in the arm for the treasury of any country with a continental shelf containing a rich storehouse of minerals pitt was silent for a few moments god is it worth all the killing sandecker hesitated it depends upon how bad somebody wants it there are men who wouldnt kill for every cent in the world and there are others who wouldnt hesitate to slit a throat for the price of a meal in washington you informed me that fyrie and his scientific team were on their way to the us to open negotiations with our defense contractors i take it that was a little white lie sandecker smiled yes that was actually an understatement fyrie was scheduled to meet with the president and present him with the probe he looked at pitt and then said more positively i was the first one fyrie notified when the tests on the probe proved successful i dont know what hunnewell told you about fyrie but he was a visionary a gentle man who wouldnt step on an ant or a flower he knew the far reaching good the probe would bring to mankind he also knew what unscrupulous interests would do to exploit it once the probe fell into their hands so he decided to turn it over to the nation that he was certain would make beneficial and charitable use of its potentialso much noble crap in my book but you have to give the dogooders of the earth credit they make an honest stab at helping the rest of us ungrateful rabble his face looked pained a goddamned shame kristjan fyrie would be alive this minute if hed been rotten and selfish pitt grinned knowingly it was a welladvertised fact that admiral sandecker in spite of his boilerplate exterior was at hart a humanitarian and he rarely disguised his disgust and hatred for greeddriven industrialistsan outspoken trait that didnt exactly make him in great demand as a guest at society dinner parties isnt it possible pitt asked for american engineers to develop our own probe yes in fact we already have one but compared with fyries probe it operates with all the efficiency of a bicycle next to a sportscar his people made a breakthrough that is ten years ahead of anything we or the russians are currently developing any ideason who stole the probe sandecker shook his head none its obviously a wellfinanced organization beyond that were playing blindmans buff in a swamp which country would have the necessary resources to you can forget that speculation sandecker interrupted the national intelligence agency is positive no foreign government is in the act even the chinese would think twice before killing two dozen people over an innocent nondestructive scientific instrument no its got to be a private motive for what purpose besides financial gain he shrugged helplessly we cant even guess all right so the mysterious organization has the probe so they strike a bonanza on the sea floor how do they raise it they cant sandecker replied not without highly technical equipment it doesnt make sense if theyve had the probe over a year what good has it done them theyve put the probe to good use all right sandecker said seriously testing every square foot of the continental shelf on the atlantic shore of north and south america and they used the lax to do it pitt stared at him curiously the lax i dont follow do you remember dr len matajic and his assistant sandecker flicked an ash into the wastebasket jack oriley pitt frowned recalling i airdropped supplies to them three months ago when they set up camp on an ice floe in baffin bay dr matajic was studying currents below a depth of ten thousand feet trying to prove a pet theory of his that a deep layer of warm water had the capacity to melt the pole if only one percent of it could be diverted upward what was the last you heard of them pitt shrugged i left for the oceanlab project in california as soon as they began routine housekeeping why ask me you planned and coordinated their expedition yes i planned the expedition sandecker repeated slowly he screwed the knuckles of his index fingers into his eyes then pushed the hands together and folded them matajic and oriley are dead the plane bringing them back from the ice floe crashed in the seano trace was found strange i hadnt heard it must have just happened sandecker put another match to his cigar a month ago yesterday to be exact pitt stared at him why the secrecy nothing was mentioned in broadcast about their acident as your special projects director i should have been one of the first to be informed only one other man besides myself was aware of their deathsthe radio operator who took their last message ive made no announcement because i couldnt try to bring them back from their watery grave sorry admiral pitt said youve lost me completely all right then sandecker said heavily five weeks ago i received a signal from matajic seems oriley while on a scouting trek spotted a fishing trawler that had moored to the north end of their ice floe not being socially aggressive he returned to base and informed matajic then together they trolled back and paid a friendly call on the fishermen to determine if they needed assistance an odd bunch matajic said the ship flew the flag of iceland yet most of the crew were arabs while the rest represented at least six different countries including the united sates it seems a bearing had burned out in their diesel engine rather than drift around while repairs were made they decided to tie up on the ice flow to let the crew stretch their legs nothing suspicious in that pitt commented the captain and crew invited matajic and oriley on board for dinner sandecker continued this courteous act seemed harmless enough at the time later it was seen as an obvious attempt to avoid suspicion by sheer coincidence it backfired so our two scientists were also on the list to see something they shouldnt have you guessed it some years previously kristjan fyrie had entertained dr hunnewell and dr matajic aboard his yacht the exterior of the trawler had been altered of course but the instant matajic stepped into the main salon he recognized the ship as the lax if he had said nothing e and oriley might have been alive today unfortunately he innocently asked why the proud and plush lax that he remembered had been converted into a common fishing trawler it was an honest question but one that had cruel consequences they could have been murdered then and there and their bodies weighted and dropped into the seano one would have ever known its one thing for a ship to go down at sea with all hands the newspapers forgot the lax one week after it disappeared but two men and a government research station not likely the press would have exaggerated and harped on the enigma of the abandoned ice station for years no if matajic and oriley had to be eliminated there were less conspicuous methods shooting an unarmed plane out of the air without telltale witnesses for example that appears to be the pattern sandecker said softly it wasnt until our two scientists had returned to their base camp that matajic began to have doubts the captain of the trawler had simply passed his command off as a sister ship to fyries lax it was a possibility matajic told himself but if the ship earned its keep as a fishing trawler where were the fish even the distinct aroma had been missing he got on the radio and contacted me at numa headquarters told me the story along with his suspicions and suggested that the coast guard make a routine investigation of the trawler i ordered them to stand by while i sent a supply plane north to return them to washington as quickly as possible to make a detailed report sandecker tapped the cigar ashes into the wastebasket again a grim expression on his face i was too late the captain of the trawler must have monitored matajics message the pilot made it to the ice floe and picked them up after that the three of them vanished sandecker reached inside his breast pocket and pulled out a worn and folded piece of paper this is matajics last message pitt took the paper from the admirals hand and unfolded it across the desk it read mayday mayday the bastards attacking black number one engine is the words abruptly ended enter the black jet exactly with his only witnesses out of the way the captains problem was now the coast guard whom he was sure would show up at any moment pitt looked at sandecker speculatively but the coast guard didnt come they were never invited youve yet to fully explain why you maintained silence even after you were certain three of numas men were killed murdered like cattle by a group of traveling butchers at the time i didnt really know the vagueness wasnt like sandecker normally he was as decisive and direct as a bolt of lightning i suppose i didnt want the sonsofbitches responsible to have the satisfaction of knowing how successful they werl thought it best to let them wonder its snatching at leaves in a hurricane i admit but its just barely possible they might make an unplanned move a mistake that will give us a slim lead to their identity when and if i resurrect the ghosts of matajic and oriley how did you handle the search party i notified all search and rescue units in the northern command that a valuable piece of equipment had fallen off of a numa research ship and was floating around lost i gave out have taken and waited for a the course the plane would sighting report there was none sandecker waved his cigar to indicate helplessness i also waited in vain for the sighting of a trawler matching the hull design of the lax it too had evaporated thats why you were dead sure it was the lax under the iceberg lets just say i was eighty percent certain sandecker said i also did a bit of checking with every port authority between buenos aires and goose bay labrador twelve ports recorded the entry and departure of an icelandic fishing trawler matching the laxs altered superstructure for what its worth it went under the name of surtsey surtsey by the way is icelandic for submarine i see pitt groped for a cigarette and then remembered that he was wearing a strangers clothes a northern fisherman would hardly troll so close within territorial waters working the undersea probe is the only credible explanation its as if we were presented with a pregnant rabbit sandecker grunted one solution leaves us with a new brood of unfathomable puzzles are you in contact with commander koski yes the catawaba is standing by the derelict while a team of investigators combs it thoroughly in fact i received a signal from them just before you struggled from bed three of the bodies were positively established as fyries crew the rest were too badly burned to identify like an edgar allan poe ghost story fyrie and his people and the lax disappear into the sea nearly a year later the lax turns up at one of our research stations with a different crew then soon after that the same ship becomes a burnedout derelict in an iceberg with the remains of fyrie and the original crew on board the more i dwell on it the more i kick myself for not catching that air force jet to tyler field you were warned pitt managed a sour grin as he lightly touched the bandage on his head one of these times im going to volunteer once too often youre probably the worlds luckiest bastard sandecker said living through two attempts on your life in the same morning which reminds me how are my two friendly policemen under interrogation but short of gestapo torture methods i seriously doubt if we even get so much as a name rank and serial number out of them they keep insisting that theyre going to be killed anyway so why should they offer us information who is doing the interrogating national intelligence agents on our airbase at keflavik the iceland government is cooperating with us every step of the wayafter all fyrie was practically their national hero theyre just as interested in finding out what happened to the probe and the lax as we are sandecker paused to remove a small bit of tobacco from his tongue if youre wondering why numa is mixed up in this instead of sitting on the sidelines and cheering on the national intelligence agency and their army of super spies the answer is or i should say was hunnewell he corresponded with fyries scientists for months offering his knowledge toward the ultimate success of the probe it was hunnewell who was instrumental in the development of celtinium only he had a rough idea of what the probe looked like and only he could have safely disassembled it that of course explains why hunnewell had to be the first aboard the derelict yes celtinium in its refined state is very unstable under the right conditions it can explode with a force equal to a fiftyton phosphate bomb but with a pronounced characteristic difference celtinium fulminates at a very slow rate burning everything in its path to ashes yet unlike more common explosives its expansion pressure is quite low about the same as a sixtymileanhour wind it could go off and melt but not shatter a pane of glass then my flamethrower theory was a bust it was the probe that went off and turned the lax into an instant pyre sandecker smiled you came close but that means the probe is destroyed sandecker nodded his smile rapidly fading all of it the murders the probe the killers search for undersea treasure it went all for nothinga terrible terrible waste its possible that the organization behind this affair has the design and plans for the probe in its possession it is more than possible he paused then went on almost absently a lot of good it will do them hunnewell was the only person on earth with the process for celtinium as he often said it was basically so simple that he kept it in his head the fools pitt murmured they murdered their only key to constructing a new probe but why hunnewell couldnt have been a serious threat unless he found something on the derelict that led to the organizations paid mastermind i havent the vaguest idea sandecker shrugged helplessly anymore than i can guess who the unseen men were who chipped the red dye marker off the iceberg i wish i knew where in the hell to take the next step pitt said ive taken care of that little matter for you pitt looked up skeptically i hope this isnt another one of your famous favors you said it yourself you wanted to see if icelands women were coolly beautiful youre changing the subject pitt looked steadily at the admiral here it comes let me guess youre going to introduce me to a burly steelyeyed icelandic female government official who is going to make me sit up half the night going over the same old tired questions and answers that ive already covered sorry admiral im not up to it sandeckers eyes narrowed and he sighed suit yourself the girl i have in mind isnt burly or steelyeyed or a government official for that matter she happens to be the loveliest woman north of the sixtyfourth parallel and i might add the wealthiest oh really pitt suddenly came alive whats her name kirsti sandecker said with a sly smile kirsti fyrie kristjan fyries twin sister chapter if snorris restaurant in reykjavik could be picked up and placed down in any of the epicurean distinguished cities of the world it would be instantly greeted with respectful acclaim its one great hall with open kitchen and earthen ovens only a few feet from the dining area was designed in the viking tradition richly panneled walls and intricately carved doors and beams rovided the perfect atmosphere for a leisurely yet elegant dinner the menu selection was created to reward even the most picky gourmet and along one entire wall stood a buffet table with over two hundred different native dishes pitt surveyed the crowded dining hall the tables were filled with laughing talkative icelanders and their lovely women he was standing there his eyes taking in the scene his nostrils basking in the rich food smells when the maitre d came up and spoke in icelandic pitt shook his head and pointed at admiral sandecker and tidi royal comfortably ensconced at a table near the bar he made his way over to them sandecker waved pitt to a chair opposite tidi and hailed a passing waiter in the same motion youre ten minutes late sorry pitt said i took a walk in the tjamargardar gardens and did a little sightseeing looks like you found yourself a swinging mens shop tidi remarked admiringly her wise brown eyes roved over his wool turtleneck sweater belted corduroy jacket and plaid slacks i grew tired of wearing handmedowns he said smiling sandecker looked up at the waiter two more of the same he said what will you have dirk what are you and tidi drinking holland ginschnapps if you prefer it seems to be big with the natives pitt twisted his mouth no thanks ill stick with my old standby cutty rocks the waiter nodded and left where is this exciting creature ive heard so much about pitt asked miss fyrie should be along any minute sandecker replied just before we were attacked hunnewell said that fyries sister was a missionary in new guinea yes little else is known about her in fact few people knew she even existed until fyries will named her sole beneficiary then she appeared at fyrie limited one day and took the reins as smoothly as if she had built the empire herself dont get any ideas in that bedroom mind of yours shes shrewdjust as shrewd as her brother was then why bother with the introductions you say hands off yet i get the distinct impression that im supposed to play prince charming get cozy but not too cozy youve chosen the wrong man admiral im the first to admit my looks hardly put me in the rock hudsonpaul newman class but i have a nasty habit when it comes to pursuing skirtsim picky im not geared to assault every girl that comes into sight especially one who is the spitting image of her brother spent half her life as a missionary and runs a giant corporation with a mace and chain sorry admiral miss fyrie hardly sounds like my type i think its disgusting tidi said disapproving the eyebrows arched above the huge brown eyes numa is supposed to be dedicated to scientific research of the oceans none of this talk sounds very scientific to me sandecker threw her an admonishing stare a facial display that he was unquestionably a master at projecting secretaries should be seen and not heard tidi was saved from fher reprimand by the timely arrival of the waiter with the drinks he set them on the table with an accomplished motion and then left sandecker watched until the waiter was several tables away before he turned back to pitt nearly forty percent of numas projects are designed and planned around mining the sea floor russia leads us by a wide margin in surface programs the science of her fishing fleet far surpasses anything weve got but she lags badly in deep submersiblesa damned vital piece of equipment for undersea mining this is our strong point we want to maintain this advantage our country has the resources but fyrie limited has the technical knowledge with kristjan fyrie we had a good close working association no now that hes only a memory i dont care to see the results of our efforts lost just when our programs are on the verge of hitting paydirt ive talked to miss fyrie all of a sudden shes very noncommittalsays she has decided to reevaluate her firms programs with our country you said shes shrewd pitt said maybe shes holding out to the highest bidder theres nothing in the book that says she has to be as magnanimous as her brother dammit sandecker said irritably anything is possible maybe she hates americans shes not alone if so there must be a reason and weve got to find it enter dirk pitt stage left precisely but no hankypanky im taking you off the pacific oceanlab project definitely and putting you on this one forget playing secret agent while youre at it leave the intrigue and the dead bodies to the national intelligence agency youre to act in your official capacity as special projects director for numa no more no less if you stumble onto any information that might lead to the people who killed fyrie hunnewell and matajic youre to pass it on pass it on to whom sandecker shrugged i dont know the nsa didnt see fit to tell me before i left washinton great ill take out a fullpage ad in the local newspaper pitt said sourly i dont recommend it sandecker said he took a long swallow from his glass and mide a wry face god what do they see in this stuff he took another swallow from a glass of water i have to be in washington the day after tomorrow that gives me enough time to smooth the way for you withahmiss fyrie with fyrie limited ive arranged an exchange program im taking one of their top engineers with me to the states to observe and study our techniques while youre to stay here and report on theirs your primary job will be to restore the close relationship we once enjoyed with the fyries management if this fyrie broad has been so cool toward you and numa why did she consent to meet us tonight out of courtesy dr hunnewell and her brother were good friends his death and the fact that you made a gallant but losing attempt to save his life played on her feminine emotions in short she insisted on meeting you shes beginning to sound like a cross between catherine the great and aimee semple mcpherson tidi said sarcastically i cant wait to meet my new boss face to face pitt said sandecker nodded you can in precisely five secondsshe just walked in pitt turned and so did every other male head in the restaurant she stood in the foyer very tall and very blond like a fantasy of womanly perfection incredibly beautiful as if caught in the perfect pose by the lens of a fashion photographers camera her statuesque figure was encased in a long violetcolored dress of velvet with peasant embroidery on the sleeves and hem now she caught sandeckers wave and she walked over to the table moving with a graceful flowing motion that possessed all the suppleness of a ballerina and more than the suggestion of a natural athlete by this time all the women in the restaurant were eyeing her with instinctive envy pitt pushed back his chair and rose and studied her face as she approached it was her tan that intrigued him the delicately clear tanned complexion somehow seemed foreign to an icelandic woman even one who spent a good portion of her life in the back country of new guinea the total effect was striking the blond hair a carefree casual look with a controlled tousled effect the deep violet eyes tbal matched the color of her dress she was hardly what pitt had imagined to say the least my dear miss fyrie im honored that you could dine with us admiral sandecker took her hand and kissed it then he turned to tidi who wore a mask of friendliness may i introduce my secretary miss tidi royal the two women exchanged polite but typically cool feminine greetings then sandecker turned to pitt and this is major dirk pitt the real driving force behind my agencys projects so this is the brave gentleman youve told me so much about admiral her voice came across husky and terribly sexy i am deeply sorry for the tragic loss of dr hunnewell my brother thought very highly of him were sorry too pitt said there was a pause while they looked at each other kirsti fyrie with a touch of speculation in her eyes and with what might have been more than friendly interest pitt with analytical male appraisal he was the first to break the silence if i sit here staring miss fyrie its because admiral sandecker failed to warn me that the head of fyrie limited had such mystic eyes i have been paid compliments by men before major pitt but you are the first to describe my eyes as mystic purely academic pitt said the eyes are doors to the secrets a person hides from within and what deep dark shadows do you see lurking within my soul pitt laughed a gentleman never reveals a ladys private thoughts he offered her a cigarette but she shook her head seriously our eyes have something in common miss fyries eyes are deep blue tidi said yours are green what could they possibly have in common miss fyries eyes like mine have rays that spread from the pupil into the iris pitt said theyre sometimes called flashes he paused to light a cigarette i have it from the best authority flashes are a sign of psychic powers are you clairvoyant kirsti asked i admit to being a failure pitt replied i always lose at poker because i have yet to read my opponents cards or mind how about you miss fyrie can you see into the future he saw a fleeting shadow across her eyes i know my destiny therefore i can control it pitts dark grinning features gave nothing away as he began to enter into the spirit of the eternal chase he leaned across the table until only a few inches separated their eyesgreen stared into violet i take it you usually expect to get what you want yes her answer came without an instants hesitation then suppose i told you that under no circumstances would i ever attempt to make love to you i know the sort of thing you expect me to say major an expression of defiant determination animated her face but if i really desired you and demanded your attention i would be playing into your hands eternally no i seldom bother with something i do not want i shant totally impore your empty rejection pitt acted as if he were unconscious of any static in the atmosphere why miss fyrie i hardly figured you for a copout artist she looked blank a copout artist thats american for chicken tidi said with a razorsharp tongue coated with several layers of sugar admiral sandecker cleared his throat he was thinking of what might happen if this trend in the conversation were to continue i see no reason for an old man to sit here and listen to all this lighthearted talk while hes starving particularly when several square yards of deliciouslooking food sits begging for attention only ten feet away please allow me to introduce you to our native buffet dishes kirsti said i trust major pitts appetite for food is more regulated than his appetite for sex touche pitt laughed he rose and pulled back kirstis chair from this moment forward my every move will be with moderation the varieties of fish seemed endless pitt counted over twenty different dishes of salmon and nearly fifteen of cod alone they each returned with their plates heaped with near overtherim helpings i see youve taken a fancy to our cured shark meat major kirstis eyes were smiling ive heard a great deal about the processing pitt said and now at last i have a chance to try it the smile in her lovely eyes turned to a flicker of surprise as he ate several slices are you sure youre aware of how we prepare it of course he answered the species of shark found in colder waters cant be eaten fresh so you slice it in strips and bury it in beach sand for twentysix days and then cure it in the wind youre eating it raw you know kirsti persisted is there any other way pitt said as he forked another slice into his mouth didnt have an easy time trying to shock him miss fyrie sandecker cast a distasteful eye at the shark meat dirks hebby is gourmet cooking his specialty is fish and he is an expert on international seafood preparation actually its quite good pitt managed between mouthfuls however i do think the malaysian version has a better flavor they cure the shark meat wrapped in a seaweed called echidna this gives it a slightly sweeter taste than the icelandic delicacy americans usually order steak or chicken kirsti said you are the first i have known who prefers fish not entirely pitt said like most of my countrymen my favorite standby is still a good double hamburger with french fries and a chocolate malt kirsti looked at pitt and smiled i am beginning to think that you are blessed with an iron stomach pitt shrugged i have an uncle who is san franciscos leading bon vivant in my own small way im trying to follow in his footsteps the rest of the meal was eaten with a minimum of small talk everyone relaxed and comfortable in the atmosphere of friendliness and good food two hours later during a strawberry and ice cream flambo especially concocted by pitt and an agreeable chef kirsti began to make apologies for an early departure i hope you will not think me rude admiral sandecker but i am afraid i must leave you miss royal and major pitt very shortly my fiance has insisted on taking me to a poetry reading tonight and since i am only a woman it is difficult to refuse his wishes she gave tidi a soft female look of understanding im sure miss royal can appreciate my situation tidi instantly grasped the romantic inference i envy you miss fyrie a fiance who loves poetry is a rare catch admiral sandecker beamed a felicitating smile my sincerest wishes for your happiness miss fyrie i had no idea you were engaged who is the lucky man the admiral held his composure exceedingly well pitt thought he knew the old man was stunned right down to his shoe soles this development would call for a different set of ground rulesalready pitt found himself wondering what the competition was like rondheimoskar rondheim kristi announced my brother introduced v in a letter oskar and i exchanged pictures and corresponded for two years before we finally met sandecker stared at her wait a minute he said slowly i think i know of him isnt he the one who owns an international chain of canneries rondheim industries a fishing fleet the size of spains navy or am i thinking of some other rondheim no thats right kirsti said his executive offices are right here in reykjavik the fishing boats painted blue flying a red flag with an albatross pitt inquired kirsti nodded the pioatross is oskars good luck symbol do you know his boats ive had occasion to fly over them pitt said of course pitt knew the boats and their symbol so did every fisherman of every country north of the fortieth parallel rondheims fishing fleets were notorious for wiping out fishing grounds almost to the verge of extinction robbing the nets of the other fishermen and dropping their own distinctive reddyed nets inside the territorial boundaries of other countries the rondheim albatross carried as much respect as the nazi swastika a merger between fyrie limited and rondheim industries would result in a most powerful empire sandecker said slowly almost as if he were weighing the consequences pitts mind was running along the same channels suddenly his train of thought was broken when kirsti waved her hand there he is there they turned and followed kirstis gaze to a tall snowhaired distinguishedlooking figure vigorously stepping toward them fie was fairly young late thirties his face strong and lined by years of ocean gales and salt air the eyes were cool bluegray above a strong narrow nose and a mouth that looked goodnaturedly warm though pitt musedrightlythat it could quickly straighten and harden to an aggressive line during business hours pitt mentally wrote him down as a sharp and cunning opponent he made a note never to turn his back to him rondheim stopped before the table his even white teeth flashing in a seemingly cordial smile kristi darling how delightful you look tonight then he affectionately embraced her pitt waited to see where the bluegray eyes would move to nextto himself or the admiral he guessed wrong rondheim turned to tidi ahand who is this lovely young lady admiral sandeckers secretary miss tidi royal kirsti said may i present oskar rondheim miss royal he made a slight bow i am charmed by such interesting eyes pitt had to hold his napkin to his mouth to muffle the laughter i think this is where i came in tidi began to giggle and sandecker joined in with a hearty laugh that turned heads at the nearby tables pitt kept his eyes on kirsti he was intrigued by a frightened almost panicky expression that flickered across her face before she forced a thin smile and went along with the surrounding mirth rondheim didnt go along with it at all he stood there his eyes staring blankly in confusion and his mouth pressed tightly together in angerone didnt need to be a mind reader to see that he wasnt in the habit of being laughed at i said something humorous he asked this seems to be the night for complementing women on their eyes pitt said kristi explained to rondheim and then hurriedly introduced sandecker it is indeed a pleasure to meet you admiral the cool look was back in rondheims eyes your reputation as a mariner and oceanographer is widely known throughout seafaring circles your reputation is known widely throughout seafaring circles mr rondheim the admiral shook rondheims hand and turned to pitt major dirk pitt my special projects director rondheim paused a moment making a coldly professional assessment of the man standing before him before he extended his hand major pitt how do you do pitt gritted his teeth as rondheims hand closed like a vise pitt fought a desire to squeeze back instead he let his hand go limp in a deadfish grip good heavens mr rondheim youre a very strong man im sorry major rondheim winced with surprised disgust and jerked his hand back as though he had been shocked by an electrical circuit the men who work for me are a rugged breed and have to be treated as such when i am off the deck of a fishing boat i sometimes forget to act like a gentleman of the land goodness mr rondheim you neednt apologize i admire virile men pitt held up his hand and wiggled his fingers no harm done as long as i can still wield a brush do you paint major kirsti asked yes landscapes mostly i also enjoy doing floral still lifes there is something about flowers that inspires the soul dont you think kirsti looked at pitt curiously i would love to see your work sometime unfortunately all of my canvases are in washington however id be delighted to present you with my impressions of iceland while im here pitt held a finger against his lips in a femine gesture watercolors yes thats it ill do a series of watercolors perhaps you can hang them in your office you are very kind but i could not accept nonsense pitt interrupted your coastline is magnificent im simply dying to see if i can capture its contrasting forces of sea and rock meeting one another in a natural eruption of light and color kirsti smiled politely if you insist but you must permit me to do something for you in return i ask one favora boat to do your shoreline justice i must sketch it from the sea nothing fancy any small cruiser will do see my dockmaster major he will have a cruiser ready for you she hesitated a moment as rondheim loomed up and placed his hand on her neck and shoulder our boats are moored at pier twelve come darling rondheim said whiteteethed and softly max is reading his new anthology tonight we must not be late his hand tightened and she closed her eyes i hope you good people will excuse us yes of course sandecker said its been a very enjoyable two hours miss fyrie thank you for joining us before anyone could say anything further rondheim hooked his hand through kirstis arm and led her from the dining room as soon as they passed beyond the door sandecker threw his napkin down on the table okay dirk suppose you explain your little act what little act pitt asked innocently i admire virile men sandecker mimicked that goddamned homo actthats what i mean all that was missing was the lisp pitt leaned forward elbows on the table his face dead serious there are situations that offer a definite advantage in being underestimated this is one of them rondheim exactly hes your reason behind fyries sudden reluctance to cooperate with the united states and numa the man is no dummy once he marries kirsti fyrie control of two of the largest privately owned corporations in the world will come under one roof the possibilities are immense iceland and its government are too small too dependent on the future fyrie rondheim cartel for its economy to offer even a token resistance against a highly financed takeover then with the right strategy the faero islands and greenland giving rondheim virtual control over the north atlantic after that one can only guess in which direction his ambitions lie sandecker shook his head youre assuming too much kirsti fyrie would never go along with an international power play she will have no choice in the matter pitt said in marriage the spoils go to the dominant personality a woman in love is blind is that it no pitt answered i dont think this is a match based on love now youre an expert on affairs of the heart sandecker said sarcastically no contest pitt said grinning but we are fortunate in having an expert in our midst who has a builtin natural intuition for such things he turned to tidi care to give us a feminen opinion dearheart tidi nodded she was terrified of him sandecker looked at her speculatively what do you mean by that just what i said tidi said firmly miss fyrie was scared to death of mr rondheim didnt you see how he clutched her neck i guarantee that shell be wearing high collars for the next week until the bruises disappear are you sure youre not imagining or exaggerating tidi shook her head it was all she could do to keep from screaming sandeckers eyes were suddenly full of hostility that rotten sonofabitch he gazed at pitt steadily did you catch it yes this increased sandeckers anger then why in hell didnt you stop it i couldnt pitt said i would have had to step out of character rondheim has every reason to think im a faggot i want him to go right on thinking that id like to think you have a hazy idea of what youre doing sandecker said grimly however im afraid you bricked yourself into a corner with that crap about being an artist i know for a fact that you cant draw a straight line natural eruption of lightmy god i dont have to tidi will handle that little chore for me ive seen samples of her work its quite good i do abstracts tidi said a pained look on her pretty face ive never tried a truelife seascape fake it pitt said briskly do an abstract seascape were not out to impress the head curator at the louvre but i have no supplies tidi whined besides the admiral and i are leaving for washington the day after tomorrow your flight has just been canceled pitt turned to sandecker right admiral sandecker folded his hands and mulled for a few moments in view of what weve learned in the last five minutes i think it best if i hang around for a few days the change of climate will do you good pitt said you might even get in a fishing trip sandecker studied pitts face fairy queen imitations painting classes fishing expeditions would you humor an old man and tell me whats running through that agile mind of yours pitt picked up a glass of water and swilled the lucid contents a black airplane he said quietly a black airplane resting beneath a watery death shroud chapter they found pier twelve at about ten in the morning and were passed through the entrance barrier by a tali swarthy fyrie guard sandecker dressed in old rumpled clothes a floppy soiled hat carrying a tackle box and fishing rod tidi in slacks and knotted blouse warmly covered by a mans windbreaker she held a sketching pad under one arm and a satchelsized handbag under the other both hands jammed deeply in the windbreakers pockets the guard did a classic doubletake at pitt who brought up the rear moving along the pier in a short sissyish gait if sandecker and tidi looked and dressed like a pair of fishermen pitt came on like the queen of the may he wore red suede pullon boots multicolored striped duck pants so tight the seams were strained beyond endurance supported by a twoinchwide tapestry belt and a stretched purple sweater trimmed at the collar by a yellow neckerchief his eyes blinked rapidly behind a pair of ben franklin glasses and his head was covered by a tasseled knit cap the guards mouth slowly drifted agape hi sweetie pitt said smiling slyly is our boat ready the guards mouth remained agape his eyes blank and unable to communicate to the brain the apparition they were focusing on come come pitt said miss fyrie has generously loaned us the use of one of her boats which one is it pitt stared fixedly at the guards crotch the guard jerked alive as if he had been kicked the stunned look on his face quickly turning to one of abject disgust without a word he led them down the pier stopping in a hundred feet and pointing down at a gleaming thirtytwofoot chris craft cruiser pitt leaped aboard and disappeared below in a minute he was back on the pier no no this wont do at all too mundane too ostentatious to create properly i must have a creative atmosphere he looked accross the pier there how about that one before the guard could reply pitt trotted the width of the pier and dropped to the deck of a fortyfoot fishing boat he explored it briefly then popped his head through a hatchway this is perfect it has character a crude uniqueness well take this one the guard hesitated for a moment finally with that twitch of the shoulders that indicated a shrug he nodded and left them walking along the pier back to the entrance throwing a backward look at pitt every so often and shaking his head when he was out of earshot tidi said why this old dirty tub why not that nice yacht dirk knows what hes doing sandecker set the rod and tackle box down on the worn deck planking and looked at pitt does it have a fathometer a fleming sixten the top of the line extrasensitive frequencies for detecting fish at different depths pitt motioned down a narrow companionway this boat was a lucky choice let me show you the engine room admiral you mean we ignored that beautiful chris craft simply because it doesnt have a fathometer tidi asked disappointingly thats right pitt answered a fathometer is our only hope of finding the black plane pitt turned and led sandecker through the companionway down into the engine room the stale air and the dank smell of oil and bilge immediately filled their nostrils making them gasp at the drastic change from the diamondpure atmosphere above there was another odor sandecker looked at pitt questioningly gas fumes pitt nodded take a look at the engines a diesel engine is the most efficient means of propelling a small boat particularly a fishing boat heavy low revolutionsperminute slow but cheap to run and reliable the diesel is used in nearly every workboat on the sea that doesnt rely on sails for power that is except this boat sitting side by side their propeller shafts vanishing into the bilge a pair of sterling hp gasfed engines gleamed in the dim light of the engine room like sleeping giants awaiting the starting switch to goad them into thunderous action what in hell would a scow like this be doing with all this power sandecker queried quietly unless i miss my guess pitt murmured the guard goofed meaning on a shelf in the main cabin i found a pennant with an albatross on it pitt ran a hand over one of the sterlings intake manifolds it was clean enough to pass a naval inspection this boat belongs to rondheim not fyrie sandecker thought for a moment miss fyrie instructed us to see her dockmaster for some unknown reason he was absent and the pier was left in charge of that grizzled character with the tobaccostained mustache it makes one wonder if we werent set up i dont think so pitt said rondheim will undoubtedly keep a tight eye on us but weve given him no cause to be suspicious of our actionsnot yet at any rate the guard made an honest mistake without special instructions he probably figured we were given permission to select any boat on the pier so he quite naturally showed us the best of the lot first there was nothing in the script that said we would pick this little gem what is it doing here rondheim surely cant be hard up for dock space who cares pitt said a wide grin stretching his features as long as the keys are in the ignition i suggest we take it and run before the guard changes his mind the admiral needed no persuasion when it came to indulging in devious games to achievein his mindan honest purpose he was sneaky to a fault squaring his battered hat he lost no time in issuing the first order of his new command cast off the lines major im anxious to see what these sterlings can do precisely one minute later the guard came running down the pier waving his arms like a crazy man it was too late pitt stood on the deck and waved back good naturedly as sandecker happy as a child with a new toy gunned the engines and steered the deceptivelooking boat out into reykjavik harbor the boat was named the grimsi and her tiny squared wheelhouse perched just five feet from the stern made her look as though she rode in the opposite direction than her builder had intended when he laid her keel she was a very old boatas old as the antique compass mounted beside the helm her mahogany deck planks were worn smooth but still lay strong and true and smelled strongly of the sea at the pier she had looked an old ungainly bathtub from her broadbeamed stubby shape but when the mighty sterlings mumbled through their exhaust her bow lifted from the water like a sea gull soaring into the wind she seemed to delight in being carried along without effort or trouble in a buoyant sort of way sandecker eased the throttles back a notch above idle and took the grimsi on a slow leisurely tour of reykjavik harbor the admiral might have been standing on the bridge of a battle cruiser from the regulation smile on his face he was back in his element and he was enjoying every minute of it to an interested observer his passengers looked like ordinary tourists on a chartered cruisetidi sunning herself and aiming a camera at everything in sight and pitt drawing furiously on a sketch pad before leaving the harbor they tied up at a bait boat and purchased two buckets of herring then after an animated conversation with the bait fishermen they cast off and headed toward the sea as soon as they rounded a rocky point and lost sight of the harbor sandecker eased open the throttles and slowly pushed the grimsi to knots it was a strange sight indeed to see the ungainly hull skipping over the waves like a gold cup hydroplane the waves began to melt together as the grimsi increased speed and lost them behind her swirling wake pitt found a chart of the coast and laid it on a small shelf beside sandecker its right about here pitt tapped a spot on the map with a pencil twenty miles southeast of keflavik sandecker nodded an hour and a half no more not the way she moves take a look the throttles are still a good two inches from their stops the weather looks perfect i hope it holds no clouds in any direction its usually calm around the southern end of iceland this time of year the worst we can look forward to is meeting a bit of fog it usually rolls in during the late afternoon pitt sat down propped his feet on the doorway and gazed out at the rocky coastline at least we dont have to worry about fuel what do the gauges read about twothirds full sandeckers mind clicked like a burroughs adding machine ample for our purpose no reason to conserve particularly since rondheim is footing the bill with a smug satisfied expression on his face he jammed the throttles against their stops the grimsi sat down on her stern and took off across the blue wrinkled sea her bow splitting two giant sheets of spray sandeckers timing left something to be desired tidi was cautiously climbing the ladder from the galley balancing a tray laden with three cups of coffee when the admiral opened up the sterlings the sudden acceleration caught her totally off guard and the tray flew into the air and she vanished into the galley as though jerked backward by an invisible hand neither pitt nor sandecker caught the vaudevillian fall thirty seconds later she reappeared in the wheelhouse her head thrown back in anger her hair stringy with dampness her blouse stained brown by coffee admiral james sandecker she shouted the highpitched voice drowning out the roar of the sterlings when we get back to our hotel you can just add the cost of a new blouse and a trip to the hairdresser on your expense account sandecker and pitt stared at tidi and then at each other in utter uncomprehension i could have scalded myself into a hospital tidi continued if you want me to act as your stewardess on this voyage i suggest you show a little more consideration with that she whirled and disappeared into the galley sandeckers eyebrows came together what in hell was that all about pitt shrugged women rarely offer an explanation shes too young for menopause sandecker mumbled must be on her period mentally applauding pitt said either way its going to cost you a blouse and a tidis hairdo it took tidi ten minutes to make another small pot of coffee considering the dip of the grimsis keel as it soared over and smacked the crests of the swells it was a professional feat of dexterity that she managed to climb into the wheelhouse without spilling a drop from the three cups she clutched with dogged determination pitt couldnt help smiling as he sipped the coffee and watched the indigo blue water pass under the old boat then he thought of hunnewell of fyrie of matajic of oriley and he wasnt smiting any longer he still wasnt smiling as he watched the stylus the fathometers graph zigzag across the paper measuring the sea floor the bottom showed at one hundred and thirty feet he wasnt smiling now because somewhere down there in the depths was an airplane with a dead crew and he had to find it if luck played into his hands the fathometer would register an irregular hump on its chart he took his cross bearings on the cliffs and hoped for the best are you sure of your search pattern sandecker asked twenty percent certain eighty percent guesswork pitt answered i could have lowered the odds if i had the ulysses as a checkpoint sorry i didnt know yesterday what you had in mind my formal request for salvage was acted upon only a few hours after you crashed the air force airsea rescue squadron on keflavik picked your craft out of the surf with one of their giant helicopters you have to give them credit theyre an efficient lot their eagerness is going to cost us pitt said sandecker paused to make a course change have you checked the diving gear yes its all accounted for remind me to buy those state department people at the consulate a drink when we get back dressing up and playing bait fishermen took a bit of doing on such short notice to anyone gawking through a pair of navy binoculars it could have only looked like an innocent encounter the diving gear was slipped on board so smoothly and inconspicuously while you were going through the routine of bait buying that i almost missed detecting the transfer from ten feet away i dont like the action diving alone invites danger and danger invites death ill have you know im not in the habit of going against my own orders and allowing one of my men to dive in unknown waters without the proper precautions sandecker shifted from one foot to the other he was going against his better judgment and the discomfort showed clearly in his expression what do you hope to find down there besides a broken airplane and bloated bodies how do you know someone hasnt already beaten us to it there is an outside chance that the bodies may carry identification that might point to the man behind this screwedup enigma this factor alone makes it worth an attempt to find the remains whats more important is the aircraft itself all identifying numbers and insignia were hidden under black paint leaving nothing recognizable at a distance except a silhouette that plane admiral is the only positive lead we have to hunnewells and matajics murderer the one thing black paint cant cover is the serial number of an engine at least not on the turbine casing under the cowling if we find the plane and if i can retrieve the digits it then becomes a simple matter to contact the manufacturer trace the engine to the plane and from there to the owner pitt hesitated a moment to make an adjustment on the fathometer the answer to your second question he went on is no way you seem damned sure of yourself sandecker said mechanically as much as i hate the murderous sonofabitch i still give him credit for brains hed have already searched for his missing plane knowing that the wreckage could give him away true he would have made a surface search but this timefor the first timewe have the advantage nobody witnessed the fight the children who found hunnewell and me on the beach said they investigated only after they noticed the ulysses laying in the surfnot before and the fact that our friendly assassins didnt kill us when they had an ideal opportunity instead of arriving at the doctors house much later proves they werent ground observers to sum up im the only survivor who knows where to look pitt broke off suddenly his eyes concentrating on the graph and stylus the black lines began widening from a thin waver back and forth across the paper to a small mountainlike sweep that indicated a sudden rise of eight to ten feet above the flat sandy sea floor i think weve found it pitt said calmly circle to port and cross our wake on course oneeightfive admiral sandecker spun the helm and made a twohundredandseventydegree swing to the south causing the grimsi to rock gently as it passed over the waves of its own wake this time the stylus took lonszer to sweep to a height of ten feet before tapering back tozero what depth sandecker asked one hundred and fortyfive feet pitt replied judging from the indication we just passed over her from wing tip to wing tip minutes later the grimsi was moored over the reading on the fathometer the shore was nearly a mile away the great cliffs showing off their gray vertical rock more distinctly than ever under the northern sun at the same time a slight breeze sprang up and began to ruffle the surface of the rolling water it was a mild warning a signal foretelling the beginning of rougher weather to come with the breeze a state of chilling apprehension raised the hairs on pitts neck for the first time he began to wonder what he would find beneath the cold atlantic waters chapter the brilliant blue sky free of clouds allowed the sun to beat down and turn pitts black neoprene wet suit into a skintight sauna bath as he checked the old singlehose us divers deepstar regulator he would have preferred a newer model but beggars couldnt be choosy he considered himself lucky that one of the young consulate members made a sport of diving and had the equipment on hand he attached the regulator to the valve of an air bottle two single tanks were all he could scrounge enough for fifteen minutes diving and even that was stretching precious time for dives to one hundred and forty feet his only consolation was that he wouldnt be down long enough to worry about decompression his last look of the grimsis deck before the bluegreen water closed over his face mask was of admiral sandecker sitting sleepily with fishing pole gripped in both hands and tidi dressed in pitts outlandish clothes brown hair encased in the knit cap studiously sketching the icelandic shoreline shielded from anyone watching from the cliffs pitt slipped over the side behind the wheelhouse and became a part of the seas vastness his body was tense without a diving companion there was no margin for error the shock of the icy water against his sweaty body nearly made him pass out using the anchor line as a guide he followed along its vanishing outline leaving his air bubbles to swirl and rise lazily to the surface as he sank deeper and deeper the light diminished and the visibility shortened he checked his two vital references the depth gauge read ninety feet and the orange dial on the doxa diving watch notified him that he had been down two minutes the bottom gradually came into view he automatically popped his ears for the third time and was struck by the color of the sanda pure black unlike most areas of the world where the bottom sand was white the volcanic activity of iceland had left a carpet of soft ebony grains he slowed his movement spellbound by the strangeness of the dark color beneath the vast shroud of bluegreen water visibility was about forty feetquite good considering the depth instinctively he swung around in a threehundredandsixtydegree circle nothing was in sight he looked up and vaguely saw a shldow pass over him it was a small school of cod foraging near the bottom for their favorite diet of shrimp and crab he watched a moment as they slowly slipped overhead their slightly flattened bodies tinted a dark olive and spotted with hundreds of small brown dots too bad the admiral cant hook one he thought the smallest weighed no less than fifteen pounds pitt began swimming in everwidening circles around the anchor line dragging a fin in the sadd to mark his trail underwater he often saw fantasy at deep depths his perception was distorted danger magnified beyond clear thinking after five circuits he saw a dim form through the blue haze quickly kicking his fins he swam toward it thirty seconds later his hopes were broken and discarded the form proved to be a large jagged rock poking up from the bottom like some forgotten and crumbling outpost in the middle of a desert effortlessly he slipped around the currentworn sides his mind blurred struggling for control this couldnt be the readine on the fathometer he thought the peak was too conical to match that of an aircraft fuselage then he saw something lying in the sand just five feet away the black paint on the broken and bent door blended against the black sand almost to the point of invisibility he swam forward and turned it over recoiling in surprise for an instant as a large lobster scurried from its new home there were no markings anywhere on the inside paneling pitt had to move quickly now the plane had to be very close but he was due to pull the valve for his reserve air and that only left a few minutes of extra breathingbarely enough to get him to the surface it didnt take him long to find it the aircraft was resting on its belly broke in two evidence of the impact from the crash his breathing became harder now signaling him that it was time to go on reserve he pulled the valve and headed for the top the watery ceiling over his head slowly became brighter as he rose along with his air bubbles at thirty feet he stopped and searched for the grimsis keel it was important that he break water out of sight from shore she sat like a fat duck with her props tucked into her bottom rolling drunkenly with the swells he stared upward at the sun to get a direction the grimsi had drifted around her anchor lirie on a hundredandeightydegree arc so that her starboard side now faced the coast he pulled himself over the port freeboard and dropping his air tank crawled across the deck into the wheelhouse sandecker without looking up slowly placed his rod against the railing and just as slowly walked over and leaned in the doorway i hope youve had better luck than i have shes lying a hundred and fifty feet off the starboard beam pitt said i didnt have time to search the interior my air was scraping bottom better get out of that suit and have a cup of coffee your face is as blue as a windmill on a delftware saucer keep the coffee hot ill relax as soon as weve got what we came for pitt started for the door sandeckers eyes were set youre not going anywhere for the next hour and a half we still have plenty of time the day is young its senseless to overdo your physical resources you know the repetitive dive charts as well as any diver alive two dives to one hundred and forty feet within thirty minutes invites a case of the bends he paused then drove the point home youve seen men scream their lungs out from the agony of pain you know the ones who lived and the ones who were paralyzed for life even if i pushed this old scow to the hilt i couldnt get you to reykjavik before two hours then add another five hours on a jet to london and the nearest decompression chamber no way my friend you go below and rest up ill tell you when you can go down again no contest admiral you win pitt unzipped the front of his wet suit however i think it would be wiser to sack out above deck so that all three of us are in view whos to see the coast is deserted and we havent another boat since we left the harbor the coast isnt deserted we have an observer sandecker turned and gazed across the water toward the cliffs i may be getting old but i dont need glasses yet damned if i can detect any obvious glitters off to the right just beyond that rock that projects from the water cant see crap from this distance he stared sideways at the point pitt described itd be like looking through a keyhole and seeing another eye if i picked up the binoculars and stared back how can you be sure there was a reflection the sun flashed on something for a moment probably a pair of lenses let them gawk if anybody should ask why only two of us were on deck tidi was seasick and in misery on a bunk below thats as good an excuse as any pitt said smiling so long as they cant tell the difference between tidi and me in that wild set of duds sandecker laughed through binoculars from a nine away your own mother couldnt tell the difference im not sure how i should take that sandecker turned and stared into pitts eyes his lips twisting from the laugh to a wry smile dont try just get your ass below its nappy time ill send tidi down with a cup of coffee and no hankypanky i know how horny you get after a hard days dive an eerie yellowgray light showed through the hatch when sandecker shook pitt awake he woke slowly mind blurred more groggy from a catnap than from an eighthour sleep pitt could feel the drop in the wave action the grimsi was barely rocking even in the low even swells there was no hint of a breeze the air was damp and heavy a change in the weather admiral a fog bankrolling in from the south how long fifteen maybe twenty minutes not much time enough enough for a quick dive minutes later pitt had slipped into his gear and dropped over the side down again into a world where there is no sound no wind down where air is not known he cleared his ears and kicked his fins hard and descended his muscles cold and aching his brain still sluggish from sleep he swam silently effortlessly as though suspended by a wire through the great fluid backdrop he swam through the darkening colors the bluegreen now changing slowly to a soft gray he swam with no sense of direction save for what his instinct and the landmarks on the bottom told him then he found it his heart began pounding like a bass drum as he approached the plane cautiously knowing from experience that once he entered the tangled wreckage every movement would be a menace he flippered around to the shattered opening of the fuselage eight feet aft of the wings and was greeted by a small rosefish no more than six inches long its orancered scales contrasted vividly with the dark background and fluoresced in the dim light like a tiny christmas tree ornament it stared at pitt for a moment from one beady eye set solidly under a spiny head then began darting back and forth in front of his face mask as he entered the plane as soon as his eyes adjusted to the darkness they met with a jumbled mess of seats broken from their moorings on the floor and wooden boxes floating in confusion against the ceiling tugging two of the boxes toward the opening he pushed them out and watched until they lifted free on their way toward the surface then he spied a glove with its finger sockets still encasing a mans hand the body attached by a greenish arm to the hand was jammed between the seats in the lower corner of the main cabin pitt pulled the corpse out and searched its clothing he must have been the one who fired the machine gun from the doorway pitt reasoned the head wasnt a pretty sight it had been smashed to semiliquid paste the gray matter and skull fragments straggling in reddish tentacles away from the center mass and swaying in unison with the current the pockets of the torn black overalls covering the remains held nothing but a screwdriver pitt shoved the screwdriver under his weigbtbelt then half swimming half gliding he entered the cockpit except for a broken windshield on the copilots side the heart of the aircraft appeared empty and undamaged but then he happened to look up at his air bubbles rising to the overhead panel and traveliny like a shyer snake in search of an escape exit they eventually ran together and clustered in one corner encircling another corpse pushed up there by internal gases expanding under the decomposing flesh the dead pilot wore the same type of black overalls a quick search revealed nothing the pockets were empty the little rosefish wiggled past pitt and begin nibbling on the bulging right eye of the pilot panting heavily pitt pushed the body upward out of the way he fought an urge to vomit into his mouthpiece and waited until he regained control of his breathing again he glanced at the doxa watch he had only been down for nine minutes not the ninety his imagination suggested there was little time left quickly he groped around the small enclosure looking for a log book a maintenance or checkout list anything with printing on it the cockpit kept its secret well there was no record of any kind not even a sticker with the aircrafts call letters adhering to the face of the radio transmitter it was like leavin the womb being born again when he emerged from the plane the open water was darker now than when he had entered after checking the tail section he kicked over to the starboard engine no hope here it was almost totally buried in the bottom silt he got lucky on the port engine not only was it easily accessible but the cowling had broken off leaving the turbine casing bare for inspection but fate wasnt playing the game he discovered the area where the identification plate should have been it was gone only the four little brass screws that once held it remained neatly set in their threads pitt slammed his fist against the casing in frustration it was useless to look further he knew all identifying marks on instruments electrical components and other mechanical units on the plane would be erased silently he cursed the brim behind the thoroughness it seemed uncanny that one man could have considered and planned for every conceivable contingency in spite of the near freezing water trickles of sweat rolled down his face under the mask his mind was turning aimlessly posing problems and questions but impotert to come up with solutions without thinking without controlled effort his eyes began following the antics of the rosefish it had trailed him from the cockpit and was cavorting around a silver object a few feet beyond the bow of the plane pitt kept his eyes on the little fish for nearly thirty seconds aware of nothing except the sound of his exhaust bubbles before he finally reacted and recognized the long silver tube as the hydraulic shock absorber of the nose wheel swiftly he was over it studying the cylinder carefully the crash had torn it from the support strut and together with the tire and wheel had thrown the assembly out from under the nose section it was the same story the manufacturers serial number had been filed from the aluminum housing then as he was about to head toward the surface he threw a last quick look down on the end section of the housing where the hydraulic tubing had pulled from its connection pitt spotted a small marking two roughly gouged letters in the metalsc taking the screwdriver from his weightbelt he etched his initials next to the other marking the depth of his dp matched that of the sc okay no sense in hanging around he reasoned his air was becoming difficult to inhalethe signal that his tank was getting low he pulled his reserve valve and moved upward the rosefish followed him until he turned and waved his hand in its path sending the little marine creature scurrying behind a friendly rock pitt smiled and nodded his playful companion would have to find a new friend pitt arched on his back at fifty feet looking directly up at where the surface should have been trying to get his bearings in relation to the grimsi the light was equal in all directions only his ascending bubbles indicated the direction of his native element it slowly began to get lighter but it was still much darker than when he dropped off the grimsis side pitts anxious head broke water to be engulfed by a thick cloak of fog god he thought this soup makes it impossible to find the boat to strike out for shore would have been at best a fourtoone gamble pitt unshouldered his airtank harness tied it to his already unhooked weightbelt and let them fall together to the bottom now he could float comfortably thanks to the buoyancy of his rubber wet suit he lay quietly barely breathing listening for a sound through the dense gray blanket at first he could hear only the water lapping around his body then his ears picked up a faint gravelly voice a voice singing a flat version of my bonnie lies over the ocean pitt cupped his ears amplifying the sound determining the direction he struck out with an easy energysaving breast stroke fifty feet and then stopped the offkey signaling had increased in volume five minutes later he touched the seaworn hull of the grimsi and pulled himself on board have a nice swim sandecker asked conversationally hardly enjoyable and barely profitible pitt unzipped the wet suit top revealing a dense mat of black chest hair he grinned at the admiral funny thing i could swear i heard a fog horn that was no fog horn that was a former baritone of the annapolis glee club class of you were never in better voice admiral pitt looked sandecker in the eye thanks sandecker smiled dont thank me thank tidi she had to sit through ten choruses she materialized out of the mist and hugged him thank god youre safe she clung to him the dampness trickling down her face her hair falling in matted tendrils its nice to know ive been missed she stood back missed thats putting it mildly admiral sandecker and i were beginning to come unglued speak for yourself miss royal sandecker said sternly you didnt fool me for a second admiral you were worried concerned is the word sandecker corrected i take it as a personal insult when any of my men get themselves killed he turned his gaze to pitt did you find anything of value two bodies and little else somebody went to a hell of a lot of work to remove the planes identification every serial number on every piece of equipment had been removed before the crash the only markings were two letters scratched on the nose gears hydraulic cylinder he gratefully accepted a towel from tidi the boxes i sent up did you retrieve them it wasnt easy sandecker said they broke surface about forty feet away twenty tries lateri havent cast with a pole in earsi managed to reel them in you opened them pitt probed yes theyre miniature models of buildings like dollhouses pitt straightened dollhouses you mean threedimensional architectural exhibits call them what you want sandecker paused to flip a cigar stub overboard damned fine craftsmanship the detab on each structure is amazing they even break away by floors so you can study the interior lets take a look we carried them to the galley sandecker said its as good a place as any to get you into some dry clothes and a cup of hot coffee into your stomach tidi had already changed back into her own blouse and slacks she demurely turned her back as pitt finished stripping off the wet suit before he donned his colorful mod outfit he smiled while she busied herself over the galley stove did you keep them warm for me he asked your gay threads she turned and stared at him her face showing the beginning signs of a blush are you kidding youre at least eight inches taller and you outweigh me by nearly sixty pounds i literally swam in the damn things it was as if i was wearing a tent the cold air swept up my legs and out my neck and arms like a hurricane i sincerely hope it didnt cause any critical damage to your vital parts if youre referring to my future sex life i fear the worst my sympathies miss royal sandecker didnt sound very convincing he lifted the boxes onto the table and pulled off the lids ok here they are including furniture and draperies pitt looked into the first box no indications of water damage they were watertight sandecker offered each packed so carefully the crash left them entirely intact to say the models were simply masterpieces of difficult art would have been a gross understatement the admiral was right the detail was amazing every brick every windowpane was precise in scale and placement pitt lifted off the roof he had seen model exhibits before in museums but never workmanship like this nothing had been overlooked paintings on the walls were exacting in color and design the furniture had liny designs printed on the fabric telephones on desks had receivers that could be picked up connected to wires that led into the walls as a crowning touch the bathrooms even possessed toilet paper rolls that unraveled to the touch the first model building consisted of four floors and a basement pitt carefully lifted them off one at a time studied the contents and just as carefully replaced them then he inspected the second model i know this one pitt said quietly sandecker looked up are you sure positive its pink you dont often forget a structure built of pink marble it was about six years ago when i entered those walls my father was on an economic survey mission for the president conferring with the heads of finance of latin american governments i took a thirtyday leave from the air force and acted as his aide and pilot during the trip yes i remember it well especially this exotic blackeyed little secretary spare us your erotic escapades sandecker said impatiently where is it located in el salvador this model is a perfect scaleddown replica of the dominican republic capitol building he gestured toward the first model judging from the design the other model also represents the legislative offices of another south or central american country great sandecker said unenthusiastically weve come up with a character who collects miniature capitols it doesnt tell us a hell of a lot tidi handed pitt a cup of coffee and he sipped it thoughtfully except that the black jet was doing double duty sandecker met his stare you mean it was delivering these models when it changed course to shoot down you and hunnewell exactly one of rondheims fishing trawlers probably spotted our helicopter approaching iceland and diverted the jet by radio so it would be waiting for us when we reached the coast why rondheim i see nothing tangible that ties him in with any of this any port in a storm pitt shrugged i admit im groping and at that im not completely sold on implicating rondheim myself hes like the butler in an old movie mystery every piece of circumstantial evidence every finger of doubt points to him making him the most obvious suspect but in the end our friendly butler turns out to be an undercover policeman and the least obvious character turns out to be the guilty party somehow i cant picture rondheim as an undercover cop sandecker crossed the cabin and poured himself another cup of coffee but hes just enough of a prick for me to fervently wish that in some form or manner hes behind fyries and hunnewells death so we could zero in on the bastard and nail him to the floor it wouldnt be easy hes in a pretty solid position if you ask me tidi interjected you two schemers are jealous of rondheim because of his hold over miss fyrie pitt laughed you have to be in love to be jealous sandecker grinned at her your forked tongue is showing lady im not being catty out of spite i like kirsti fyrie i suppose you like oskar rondheim too pitt said i wouldnt like that snake if he was general of the salvation army she said but you have to give the devil his due hes got kirsti and fyrie limited tucked neatly in his pocket why answer that pitt said speculatively how can kirsti love him if shes terrified of him tidi shook her head i dont know i still see the pain in her eyes when he squeezed her neck maybe shes a masochist and rondheims a sadist sandecker said if rondheim is masterminding these terrible murders you must turn everything you know over to the proper authorities tidi pleaded if you persist in pushing this thing too far both of you might be killed pitt made a sad face its shameful admiral your own secretary is vastly underestimating her two favorite people he turned and looked dolefully at tidi how could you sandecker sighed its almost impossible to find loyalty in an employee these days loyalty tidi looked at them as if they had gone mad what other girl would let herself be dragged over half the world in uncomfortable military cargo planes frozen on smelly old boats in the middle of the north atlantic and be subjected to constant male harassment for the meager salary im paid if that isnt loyalty id like to know what you typical inconsiderate men call it crap thats what i call it sandecker said he put his hands on her shoulders and looked warmly into her eyes believe me tidi i value your friendship and your concern for my welfare very highly and im certain dirk prizes you just as highly but you must understand a close friend and three of my people have been murdered and an attempt made on dirk here im not the kind of guy who hides under a mattress and calls a cop by god this whole bungtwisting mess was pushed on us by persons unknown when we find out who they arethen and only thenwill i stand back and let the law and its enforcers take over are you with me the surprise of sandeckers sudden display of affection held then slowly passed from tidis face and big tears began to well in her eyes she pressed her head against the admirals chest i feel such a monkey she murmured im always shooting off my mouth next time it runs away from me please stuff a gag in it you can count on it he said more softly than pitt had ever heard him sandecker held tidi another minute before he released her okay lets up anchor and get the hell back to reykjavik the old familiar gravel tone was back i could use a nice hot toddy pitt suddenly stiffened held up a hand for silence and stepped to the wheelhouse doorway and listened intently it was very faint but it was there through the blanket of mist it came as a steady drone the sound of an engine running at very high rpms chapter do you hear it admiral i hear it sandecker was at his shoulder about three miles coming fast he concentrated for a few seconds i make it dead ahead pitt nodded coming straight toward us he stared unseeing into the fog sounds strange almost like the whine of an aircraft engine they must have radar no helmsman with half a brain would run at full speed in this weather they know were here then tidi whispered as though someone beyond the railing would hear yes they know were here pitt acquiesced unless im much mistaken theyre coming to investigate us an innocent passing stranger would give us a wide berth the minute our blip showed on his scope this one is hunting for trouble i suggest we provide them with a little sport like three rabbits waiting to play games with a pack of wolves sandecker said theyll outman us ten to one and he added softly theyre undoubtedly armed to the teeth our best bet is the sterlings once were under way our visitors stand as much chance of catching us as a cocker spaniel after a greyhoud in heat dont bet on it admiral if they know were here they also know what boat weve got and how fast it will go to even consider boarding us theyd have to have a craft that could outrace the grimsi im banking on the hunch theyve got it a hydrofoil is that it sandecker asked slowly exactly pitt answered which means their top speed could be anywhere between fortyfive and sixty knots not good sandecker said quietly not bad either pitt returned weve got at least two advantages in our favor quickly he outlined his plan tidi sitting on a bench in the wheelhouse felt her body go numb knew that her face beneath the makeup was paperwhite she couldnt believe what she was hearing she began to tremble until even her voice became unsteady you you cant mean what you say if i dont pitt said were going to have bigger trouble than river city he paused looking at the pale uncomprehending face the hands twisting nervously at the knotted blouse but youre planning a coldblooded murder for a moment her mouth mumbled soundless words then she forced herself on you just cant kill people without warning innocent people you dont even know that will do sandecker snapped sharply we havent got time to explain the facts of life to a frightened female he stared at her his eyes understanding but his voice commanding please get below and take cover behind something thatll stop bullets he turned to pitt use the fire ax and chop the anchor line give me a signal when you want full power pitt herded tidi down the galley steps never argue with the captain of a ship he swatted her on the bottom and dont fret if the natives are friendly you have nothing to worry about he was just lifting the ax into the air when the sterlings rumbled to life good thing we didnt lay out a damage deposit he murmured vaguely to himself as the ax sliced cleanly through the rope into the wooden railing as the rope slid noiselessly into the sea and sending the anchor forever to the black sandy bottom the unseen ship was almost upon them now the roar of its engine died to a muted throb as the helmsman eased back the throttles in preparation for coming alongside the grimsii from where he lay on the bow clenching and unclenching his hands around the ax handle pitt could hear the hull splash into the waves as the diminishing speed pushed the hydrofoil deeper in the water he raised himself carefully narrowing his eyes and trying vainly to pierce the heavy fog for a sign of movement the area round the bow was in near darkness visibility was no more than twenty feet then a shadowy bulk slowly came into view showing its port glow pitt could barely make out several dim forms standing on the forward deck a glow behind them that pitt knew would be the wheelhouse it was like a specter ship whose crew appeared as dim ghosts the erieform arose menacingly and towered above the grimsi the stranger had a length of a hundred feet or better pitt guessed he could see the other men clearly now leaning over the bulwarks saying nothing crouched as if ready to jump the automatic rifles in their hands told pitt all he needed to know coolly and precisely no more than eight feet from the gun barrels on the specter ship pitt made three movements so rapidly they almost seemed simultaneous swinging the ax head sideways e brought the flat face down loudly on an iron capstanthe signal to sandecker then in the same swinging motion he hurled the ax through the air and saw the pick part of the head bury itself in the chest of a man who was in the act of jumping down on the grimsis deck they met in midair a ghastly scream reaching from the mans throat as he and the ax fell against the railing he hung there for an instant the bloodless nuckles of one hand clenched over the wooden molding and then dropped into the gray water even before the sea closed over the mans head pitt had hurled himself on the worn planks of the deck and the grimsi leaped ahead like a frightened impala chased by a storm of shells that swept across the deck and into the wheelhouse before the old boat had vanished into the mist staying below the gunwale pitt crawled aft and across the threshold of the wheelhouse doorway the floor was littered with glass and wood splinters any hits sandecker asked conversationally his voice hardly audible above the exhaust of the sterling engines no holes in me how about you the bastards aim was above my head add to that the fact that i was able to make myself three feet high and you have a fortunate combination he turned and looked thoughtful i thought i heard a scream just before all hell broke loose pitt grinned i cannot tell a lie i did it with my little ax sandecker shook his head thirty years in the navy and thats the first time any crew of mine every had to repel boarders the problem now is to prevent a repeat performance it wont be easy were running blind their goddamned radar knows our every move our biggest fear is ramming with a tentotwentyknot edge theyre an oddson favorite to win at blindmans buff i cant avoid the inevitable if their helmsman is hallway on the dime hell use his superior speed to pass and then cut a ninetydegree angle and catch us amidships pitt considered a moment lets hope their helmsman is righthanded sandecker frowned uncomprehendingly youre not getting through lefties are a minority the percentages favor a righthander when the hydrofoil begins to close in againits bow is probably no more than four hundred yards behind our ass end this secondthe helmsman will have an instinctive tendency to swing out to his starboard before he cuts in to ram us this will give us an opportunity to use one of our two advantages sandecker looked at him i cant think of one much less two a hydrofoil boat depends on its high speed to sustain its weight the foils travel through the water the same as the wings of an aircraft travel through air its greatest asset is speed but its greatest limitation is maneuverability in simple english a hydrofoil cant turn worth a damn and we can is that it sandecker probed the grimsi can cut two circles inside their one sandecker lifted his hands from the spokes of the wheel and flexed his fingers sounds great as far as it goes except we wont know when they start their arc pitt sighed we listen sandecker looked at him shut down our engines pitt nodded when sandeckers hands went back on the wheel they were whiteknuckled his mouth tight and drawn what youre suggesting is one hell of a gamble all one of those sterlings had to do is balk at the starter button and were a sitting duck he nodded toward the galley are you thinking of her im thinking of all of us stand or run the chances are we get deepsixed anyway the last dollar bet of the gamblerall it what you wul but however remote its a chance sandecker cast a searching stare at the tall man standing in the doorway he could see that the eyes were determined and the chin set you mentioned two advantages the unexpected pitt said quietly we know what theyre out to do they may have radar but they cant read our minds that is our second and most important advantagethe unexpected move pitt looked at his doxa watch onethirty still early in the afternoon sandecker had cut the engines and pitt had to fight to stay alertthe sudden silence and the calm of the fog began a creeping course to dull his mind above the sun was a faded white disc that brightened and dimmed as the uneven layers of mist rolled overhead pitt inhaled slowly and evenly to keep a sensation of wet and chill from penetrating his lungs he shivered in his clothes turned damp from the fine sparkling drops bunched in clusters on the material he sat there on the forward hatch cover waiting until his ears lost the roar of the sterlings waiting until his hearing picked up the engines of the hydroplane he didnt have to wait long he soon tuned in the steady beat of the hydroplane as the explosions through its exhaust manifolds increased in volume everything had to go perfect the first time there could be no second chance the radar operator on the hydroplane was probably at this instant reacting to the fact that the blip on his scope had lost headway and had stopped dead in the water by the time he notified his commander and a decision was reached it would be too late for a course change the hydroplanes superior speed would have put its bow almost on top of the grimsi pitt rechecked the containers lying in a neat row beside him for perhaps the tenth time it had to be the poorest excuse for an arsenal ever concocted he mused one of the containers was a gallon glass jar tidi had scrounged from the galley the other three were battered and rusty gas cans in various sizes that pitt had found in a locker aft of the engine room except for their contents the cloth wicks protruding from the cap openings and the holes punched through the top of the cans the four vessels had little in common the hydroplane was close nowvery close pitt turned to the wheelhouse and shouted now then he lit the wick of the glass jar with his lighter and braced himself for the sudden surge of acceleration he prayed would come sandecker pushed the starter button the lip sterlings coughed once twice then burst into rpms with a roar he swung the wheel over to starboard hard and jammed the throttles forward the grimsi took off over the water like a racehorse with an arrow imbedded in its rectum the admiral held on grimly clutching the wheel and expecting to collide with the hydroplane bow on then suddenly as a spoke flew off the wheel and clattered against the compass he became aware that bullets were striking the wheelhouse he could still see nothing but he knew the crew of the hydroplane were firing blindly through the fog guided only by the commands of the radar operator to pitt the tension was unbearable his gaze alternated from the wall of fog in front of the bow to the jar in his hand the flame on the wick was getting dangerously close to the tapered neck and the gasoline sloshing behind the glass five seconds no more then he would have to heave the jar over the side he began counting five came and went six seven he cocked his arm eight then the hydroplane leaped from the mist on an opposite course passing no more than ten feet from the grimsis railing pitt hurled the jar the next instant stayed etched in pitts memory the rest of his days the frightful image of a tall yellowhaired man in a leather windbreaker gripping the bridge railing watching in shocked fascination that deathly thing sailing through the damp air toward him then the jar burst on the bulkhead beside him and he vanished in a blast of searing bright flame pitt saw no more the two boats had raced past each other and the hydroplane was gone pitt had no time to reflect quickly he lit the wick on one of the gas cans as sandecker swept the grimsi on a hardaport hundredandeightydegree swing into the hydroplanes wake the worm had turned the hydroplane had slowed and a pulsating yellowishred glow could be easily seen through the gray mist the admiral headed straight for it he was standing straight as a ramrod now it was certain that anybody who might have been shooting at the grimsi thirty seconds ago would not be standing on a flaming deck in the hope of drilling an old scow full of holes nor was there now any possibility of the hydroplane ramming anything until the fire was out hit em again he yelled to pitt through the shattered forward window of the wheelhouse give the bastards a taste of their own medicine pitt didnt answer he barely had time to throw the flaming can before sandecker spun the wheel and turnedacross the hydroplanes bow for a third running attack twice more they raced from the fog and twice more pitt lobbed his dented cans of searing destruction until his makeshift arsenal was used up and then it hit the grimsi a thunderous shock wave that knocked pitt to the deck and blew out what glass was left in the windows around sandecker the hydroplane had erupted in a volcanic roar of fire and flaming debris instantly becoming a blazing inferno from end to end the echoes had returned from the cliffs on shore and left again when pitt pushed himself shakily to his feet and stared incredulously at the hydroplane what had once been a superbly designed boat was now a shambles and burning furiously down to the waters edge he staggered to the wheelhousehis sense of balance temporarily crippled by the ringing in his ears from the concussionas sandecker slowed the grimsi and drifted past the fiery wreck see any survivors sandecker asked he had a thin slice on one cheek that trickled blood pitt shook his head theyve had it he said callously even if any of the crew made it to the water alive theyd die of exposure before we could find them in this soup tidi entered the wheelhouse one hand nursing a purplish bruise on her forehead her expression one of total bewilderment what what happened was all she could stamner it wasnt the fuel tanks sandecker said of that much im certain i agree pitt said grimly they must have had explosives lying above decks that got in the way of my last homemade firebomb rather careless of them sandeckers voice was almost cheerful the unexpected move thats what you said and you were right it never occurred to the dumb bastards that cornered mice would fight like tigers at least we evened up the score a bit pitt should have felt sick but his conscience didnt trouble him revengehe and sandecker had acted out of desire for selfpreservation and revenge they had made a down payment to avenge hunnewell and the others but the final accounting was a long way off strange he thought how easy it was to kill men you didnt know whose lives you knew nothing about your concern for life i fear will be your defeat dr jonsson had said i beg you my friend do not hesitate when the moment arrives pitt felt a grim satisfaction the moment had arrived and he hadnt hesitated hed had no time even to think about the pain and death he was inflicting he wondered to himself if this subconscious toleration of killing a total stranger was the factor that made wars acceptable to the human race tidis hushed voice broke his thoughts theyre dead theyre all dead she began to sob her hands pressed tightly to her face her body shaking from side to side you murdered them burned them to death in cold blood i beg your pardon lady pitt said coldly open your eyes take a good look around you these holes in the woodwork werent caused by woodpeckers to quote from appropriate cliches from every western movie ever madethey drew first or we had no choice marshal it was them or us youve got the script all wrong dearheart were the good guys it was their intention to coldbloodedly murder us she looked up into the lean determined face saw the green eyes full of understanding and suddenly she felt ashamed you two were warned i told you to gag me the next time i went hysterical and shot off my mouth pitt met her gaze the admiral and i have tolerated you this far as long as you keep us in coffee we wont complain to the management she reached up and kissed pitt gently her face wet with tears and mist two coffees coming up she brushed hereyes with her fingers and go rinse your face he said grinning your eye makeup goo is halfway to your chin obediently she turned and climbed down into the galley pitt looked at sandecker and winked the admiral nodded back in masculine understanding and turned back to the blazing boat the hydroplane was going down by the stern sinking rapidly the sea crowded over the gunwales and swamped the flames hissing in a cloud of steam and the hydroplane was gone in seconds only a swirling welter of oily bubbles unidentifiable bits of flotsam and dirty creaming foam remained to mark the grave it was as though the boat had been nothing but a nebulous nightmare that vanished with the passing of night with an extra effort of willpower pitt pulled his mind back to practical reality no sense in hanging around i suggest we head back to reykjavik as fast as we dare through this fog the quicker and the farther we high tail it out of this area before the weather clears the better for all concerned sandecker glanced at his watch it was now one fortyfive the entire action had barely lasted fifteen minutes a hot toddy is looking better all the time he said stand by the fathometer when the bottom rises above a hundred feet well at least know were running too close to shore three hours later and twenty miles southwest of reykjavik they rounded the tip of the keflavik peninsula and broke out of the fog icelands seemingly eternal sun greeted them in a dazzling brilliance a pan american jet arising from the runway of the keflavik international airport soared over them its polished aluminum skin reflecting the solar glare before making a great circle toward the east and london pitt watched it wistfully and idly wished he were at the controls chasing the clouds instead of standing on the deck of a rolling old scow his thoughts were interrupted by sandecker i cant begin to tell you how sad i feel about returning rondheims boat in such shabby condition a sly devilish smile cut a swath across sandeckers face your solicitude is touching pitt returned sarcastically what the hell rondheim can afford it sandecker took a hand off the wheel and waved it around the shattered wheelhouse a little wood putty a little paint new glass and itll be good as new rondheim might well laugh away the damage to the grimsi but he wont exactly roll in the aisle laughing when he learns the fate of his hydroplane and crew sandecker faced pitt how can you possibly connect rondheim with the hydroplane the connection is the boat were standing on youll have to do better than that sandecker said impatiently pitt sat down on a bench over a life preserver locker and lit a cigarette the best plans of mice and men rondheim planned well but he overlooked the thousandtoone chance that we would swipe his boat we wondered why the grimsi was tied to the fyrie dock it was there to follow us shortly after we were to cast off and begin cruising the harbor in the luxury of the cabin cruiser his crew would have appeared on the dock and eased this nondescript fishing boat into our wake to keep an eye on us if we had acted suspiciously once we were at sea thered have been no way to shake them the cabin cruisers top speed probably stands near twenty knots we know the grimsis to be closer to forty the expressions on a few faces must have been priceless sandecker said smiling panic undoubtedly reigned for a while pitt agreed until rondheim could figure out an alternate plan i give him credit hes a smart bastard hes been more suspicious of our actions than we thought still he wasnt completely sure of what we were up to the clincher came when we borrowed the wrong boat quite by accident after the shock wore off he guessed mistakenly that we were wise to him and took it on purpose to screw him up but he now knew where we were headed the black jet sandecker said positively feed us to the fish after we pinpointed its exact position that was the idea pitt shook his head i dont think it was his original intention to eliminate us we had him fooled on the diving equipment he assumed we would try to find the wreck from the surface and then come back later for the underwater recovery what changed his mind the lookout on the beach but where did he pop from reykjavik by car pitt inhaled and held the smoke before letting it out and continuing having us tailed by air was no problem except that eventually losing us in an icelandic fog bank was a foregone conclusion he simply ordered one of his men to drive across the keflavik peninsula and wait for us to show when we obliged the lookout followed us along the coast road and stopped when we anchored everything looked innocent enough through his binoculars but like rondheim we took too much for granted and overlooked one minor point we couldnt have sandecker protested every precaution was considered whoever was watching would have needed the mount palomar telescope to tell tidi was masquerading in your clothes true but if the sun caught them where they broke surface any japanese seven by fifty glasses could have picked up my air bubbles damn sandecker snapped theyre hardly noticeable close up but at a distance in a calm sea with the sun just right he hesitated the lookout then contacted rondheim by radiophone in his car most likelyand told him we were diving on the wreck rondheims back was to the wall now we had to be stopped before we discovered something vital to his game he had to lay his hands on a boat capable of matching the grimsis speed and then some enter the hydroplane and the something vital to his game sandecker probed we know now it wasnt the aircraft or its crew all trace of identity was erased that leaves the cargo the models the models pitt repeated they represent more than just a hobby they have a definite purpose and how do you intend to find out what in hell theyre good for simple pitt grinned cunningly rondheim will tell us we drop them off with the consulate boys on the bait boat and then we sail right up to the fyrie dock as if nothing happened rondheim will be so hungry to know if weve discovered anything im counting on him to make a careless move then well shove it to him where it hurts most it was four oclock when they tied up to the fyrie dock the ramp was deserted the dockmaster and the guard obvious by their absence pitt and sandecker werent fooled they knew their every move had been studied the second the grimsi rounded the harbor breakwater before he followed tidi and sandecker away from the forlorn and battered little boat pitt left a note on the helm sorry about the mess we were attacked by a swarm of rednecked fuzzworts put the repairs on our tab he signed it admiral james sandecker twenty minutes later they reached the consulate the young staff members who played such professional roles as bait fishermen beat them by five minutes and had already locked the two models away in the consuls vault sandecker thanked them warmly and promised to replace the diving gear pitt had been forced to jettison with the best that us divers manufactured pitt then quickly showered and changed clothes and took a taxi to the airport at keflavik his black volvo cab soon left the smokeless city behind its meter humming headed onto the narrow asphalt belt that was the coastal road to the keflavik airport to his right stretched the atlantic at this moment as blue as the aegean waters of the grecian isles the wind was rising off the sea and he could see a small fleet of fishing boats running for the harbor pushed by the relentless swells his left side took in the green countryside rolling in an uneven furrowed pattern dotted by grazing cattle and icelands famous longmaned ponies as the beauty of the scenery flashed by pitt began to think about the vikings those dirty harddrinking loveafight men who ravaged every civilized shore they set foot on and who had been romanticized beyond all exaggeration and embellishment in legends handed down through the centuries they had landed in iceland flourished and then disappeared but the tradition of the norsemen was not forgotten in iceland where the hard seatoughened men went out every day in storm or fog to harvest the fish that fed the nation and its economy pitts thoughts were soon jolted back to reality by the voice of the cab driver as they passed through the gates of the airport do you wish to go to the main terminal sir no the maintenance hangars the driver thought a moment sorry sir they are on the edge of the field beyond the passenger terminal only authorized cars are permitted on the flight line there was something about the cab drivers accent that intrigued pitt then it came to him there was an unmistakable american midwestern quality about it lets give it a try shall we the driver shrugged and pulled the cab up to the flight line gate and stopped where a tall thin grayhaired man in a blue uniform stepped from the same austere whitepainted guard shack that seemed to sit by gates everywhere he touched his fingers to his cap brim in a friendly salute pitt rolled down the window leaned out and showed his air force id major dirk pitt he snapped in an official tone introducing himself im on urgent business for the united states government and must get to the commercial maintenance hangar for nonscheduled aircraft the guard looked at him blankly undl he bed and then smiling dumbly shrugged the cab driver stepped from behind the steering wheel he doesnt understand english major allow me to translate for you without waiting for an acknowledgment the driver put an arm around the guard and gently walked him away from the car toward the gate tag rapidly but gesturing gracefully as he rattled off a flow of words in icelandic it was the first chance that pitt had a good look at his helpmate the driver was medium height just under six foot not more than twentysix or twentyseven years old with strawcolored hair and the light skin that usually goes with it if pitt had passed him on the street he would have pegged him as a jor assistant executive three years out of university eager to make his mark in his fatherinlaws bank finally the two men broke out laughing and shook hands then the driver climbed back behind the wheel and winked at pitt as the still smiling guard opened the gate and waved them through pitt said you seem to have a way with security guards a necessity of the trade a cab driver wouldnt be worth his salt if he couldnt talk his way past a gate guard or a policeman on a barricaded street its apparent youve mastered the knack i work at it any particular hangar sir there are several one for every major airline general maintenancethe one that handles transient nonscheduled aircraft the glare of the sun bounced off the white cement taxiway and made pitt squint he slipped a pair of sunglasses from a breast pocket and put them on several huge jetliners were parked in even rows displaying the emblems and color schemes of twa pan american tceltnclic and boac while crews of whitciled mechanics buried themselves under engines and crawled over the wings with fuel hoses on the other side of the field a good two miles away pitt could make out aircraft of the us air force undoubtedly going through the same rituals here we are the driver announced permit me to offer you my services as a translator that wont be necessary keep the meter running ill only be a few minutes pitt got out and walked through the side door of the hangar a sterile giant of a building that covered nearly two acres five small private planes were scattered around the floor like a handful of spectators in an otherwise empty auditorium but it was the sixth that caught pitts eye it was an old ford trimotor known as the tin goose the corrugated aluminum skin that covered the framework and the three motors one perched on the nose directly in front of the cockpit the other two suspended in space by an ungainly network of wires and struts combined to make it look to the unknowing eye a thing too awkward to fly with any degree of control or for that matter lift its wheels from the ground but the old pioneering pilots swore by it to them it was a flying son of a bitch pitt patted the ancient washboard sides idly wished he could testfly it someday and then walked on toward the offices in the rear of the hangar he opened a door and moved into what appeared to be a combination locker room and rest area wrinkling his nose from the pungent heavy smell of sweat cigarette smoke and coffee except for the coffee the aroma bore a marked resemblance to a high school gym he stood there a moment looking at a group of five men clustered around a large europeanstyle ceramic coffee urn laughing goodnaturedly at a recently told joke they were all dressed in white coveralls some spotlessly clean others decorated with heavy splotches of black oil pitt sauntered easily toward them smiling pardon me gentlemen any of you speak english a shaggy longhaired mechanic sitting nearest the urn looked up and drawled yeah i speak american if thatll do that will do fine pitt laughed im looking for a man with the initials sc hes probably a hydraulic specialist the mechanic eyed him uneasily who wants to know pitt forced a friendly smile and pulled out his id again pitt major dirk pitt for a full five seconds the mechanic sat immobile expressionless except for the stunned widening of his eyes then he threw his hands in the air helplessly and then let them fall limply to his sides ya got your man major ah knew it were too good to last the voice reached from somewhere deep in oklahoma it was pitts turn to become expressionless like whats too good to last mah moonlightin lak this he drawled morosely working as a hydraulic specialist for civilian airlines during mah offduty hours he stared forlornly into his coffee cup ah knew it was against us air force regulations but the money was too good to pass up ah guess ah can kiss mah stripes goodby pitt looked at him i know of no air force regulations that prevent an enlisted man or an officer for that matter from icking up a few dollars when he isnt on duty nuthin wrong with air force rules major its keflavik base policy set by colonel nagel the co on our side of the field he feels we should work on squadron aircraft during our time off instead of helpin out the feather merchants tryin to make a name for himself with the pentagon brass ah guess but ya wouldnt be here if you didnt know all that thatll do pitt said sharply his gaze swung left and right until it came back to the air force mechanic then his eyes grew suddenly cold when you talk to a superior officer airman you stamd up i dont have to kiss your ass major you aint got no uniform on two seconds was all it took with a nonchalant ease pitt bent over clasped the front two legs of the mechanics chair and flipped him over on his back and put his foot over the mans throat in one deceptive movement the other maintenance men stood there in stunned immobility for a few seconds then their senses returned and they began to circle pitt menacingly call off your flunkies or i break your neck pitt said grinning pleasantly into the fearfilled eyes the mechanic unable to talk with the heel of pitts shoe pushing against his windpipe gestured wildly with both hands the men stopped and moved back a step retreating not so much from their friends muted pleas as from the icecold grin on pitts face thats a good group pitt said he turned and looked down at the helpless mechanic and lifted his foot just enough to allow his prisoner to speak now then name rank and serial number lets have it sam sam cashman he choked sergeant air force that wasnt so bad now was it sam pitt bent and helped cashman to his feet ahim sorry sir ah figured that as long as ya were gonna courtmartial me anyway youre lousy at figuring pitt interrupted next time keep your mouth shut you admitted guilt when you didnt have to are ya still gonna bust me to begin with i dont give a rats ass whether you moonlight or not since im not stationed at keflavik air force base i could care less about the policieschicken shit as they areof your colonel nagel therefore i wont be the one to bust you all i want is the answers to a few simple questions pitt stared cashman in the eye and smiled warmly now how about it will you help me the expression on cashmans face displayed genuine awe christ almighty what ah wouldnt give to serve under an officer like you he extended his hand ask away major pitt returned cashmans grip first question do you usually scratch your initials in the equipment you repair yeah its kind of a trademark ya might say ah do good work an ahim proud of it serves a purpose too if ah work on the hydraulic system of an aircraft and it comes back with a malfunction ah know the trouble lays where ah didnt work it saves a lot of time have you ever repaired the nose gear of a twelvepassenger british jet cashman thought for a moment yeah about a month ago one of those new executive twin turbine ulyssesa hell of a machine was it painted black ah couldnt see paint markins it was dark about onethirty in the mornin when ah got the call he shook his head wasnt black though ahim positive any distinguishing features or anything unusual about the repair that you can recall cashman laughed the only distinguishin features were the two weirdos who were flyin it he held up a cup offering pitt some coffee pitt shook his head well these guys were in a terrible hurry kept standin around tryin to push me pissed me off plenty seems they made a rough landin somewhere and busted a seal in the shock cylinder they were damned lucky that ah found a spare over at the boac hangars did you get a look inside hell no youd have thought they had the president on board the way they guarded the loadin door any idea where they came from or where they were headed no way they were tightlipped bastards talked about nothin but the repair must have been on a local flight though they didnt refuel you aint flyin far in a loreleinot from iceland anyhowwithout full tanks the pilot must have signed a maintenance order nope he refused said he was behind schedule and would catch me next time paid me though twice what the job was worth cashman was silent for a moment he tried to read something in the man standing before him but pitts face was as impenetrable as a granite statue whats behind these questions major mind lettin me in on your secret no secret pitt said slowly a lorelei crashed a couple of days ago and nothing except a portion of the nose gear was left to identify im trying to trace it thats all wasnt it reported as missin i wouldnt be here if it was ah knew there was something fishy about them guys thats why ah went ahead and filled out a maintenance report pitt leaned over his eyes boring into cashmans what good was a report if you couldnt identify the aircraft a shrewd smile split cashmans lips ah may be a country boy but mah momma didnt drop me outta her bottom this mornin he stood up and tilted his head toward a side door major ahim gonna make your day he led pitt into a small dingy office furnished with only a battered desk that was decorated with at least fifty cigarette burn marks two equally battered chairs and a huge metal filing cabinet cashman walked straight to the cabinet and pulled out a drawer rummaged for a moment found what he was looking for and handed pitt a folder soiled with greasy fingerprints ah wasnt kidding ya major when ah said it was too dark to make out any paint markins near as ah could tell the plane had never been touch by a brush or spraygun the aluminum skin was is shiny as the day it let the factory pitt opened the folder and scanned the maintenance report cashmans handwritin left much to be desired but there was no mistaking the notation under aircraft identification lorelei mark vb how did you get it pitt asked compliments of a limey inspector at the lorelei factory cashman answered sitting on a corner of the desk after replacin the seal on the nose gear ah took a flashlight and checked out the main landin gear for damage or leakage and there it was stuck away under the right strut as pretty as you please a green tag sayin that this here aircrafts landin gear had been examined and okayed by master inspector clarence devonshire of lorelei aircraft limited the planes serial number was typed on the tag pitt threw the folder on the desk sergeant cashman he snapped stunned at the brusque tone cashman jumped erect sir your squadron eightyseventh air transport squadron sir good enough pitts cold expression slowly worked into a huge grin and he slapped cashman on the shoulder youre absolutely right sam you truly made my day wish ah could say the same cashman sighed visibly relieved but thats twice in the last ten minutes ya scared the crap outta me whyd ya want mah squadron so id know where to send a case of jack daniels i take it you enjoy good whiskey a look of wonder suddenly came over cashmans face by gawd major youre sumthin else ya know that i try already pitt was plotting how to explain a case of expensive whiskey on his expense account what the hell screw sandecker he thought the tab was worth the consequences screw the word bounded out of his mind and caused him to remember something he reached inside his pocket by the way have you ever seen this before he handed cashman the screwdriver hed found on the black lorelei well waal fancy that believe it or not major this here screwtwister is mine bought it through the catalog of a tool specialty house in chicago its the only one of its kind on the island whered you come across it in the wreck so thats where it went he said angry those dirty bastards stole it ah should a known they were up to sumthin illegal ya just tell me when their trial is and ahfl be happier than a rejected hog at a packin plant to testify against them save your leave time for a worthwbhe escapade your friends wont be showing for a trial they bought the farm killed in the wreck it was more statement than question pitt nodded ah suppose ah could go on about crime not payin but why bother if they had it coming they had it coming thats all there is to it as a philosopher you make a great hydraulic specialist sam pitt shook cashmans hand once more goodby and thank you im grateful for your help glad to do it major here keep the screwdriver for a souvenir already ordered a new one so wont be needin it thanks again pitt shoved the screwdriver back in his pocket turned and left the office pitt relaxed in the cab and stuck a cigarette between his lips without lighting the end obtaining the mysterious black jets serial number had been a shot in the dark that paid off in spades he really hadnt expected to find out anything staring through the window at the passing green pastures he saw nothing with his eyes idly wondering if the plane could now be tied directly to rondheim this was still worrying over the possibility when b the view impression that the countryside looked different than before the fields were empty of cattle and ponies the rolling hills flattened into a vast carpet of uneven tundra he swung around and gazed out the other window the sea was not where it should have been instead it lay to the rear of the cab slowly disappearing over a long low rise in the road he leaned over the front seat do you have a date with the farmers daughter or are you taking the scenic route to run up the meter the driver applied pressure to the brake and slowed the cab stopping at the side of the road privacy is the word major merely a slight detour so we can have a little chat the drivers voice froze into nothingness and for good reason pitt had jammed the tip of the screwdriver half an inch into the cavity of his ear keep your hands on the wheel and get this hack back on the road to reykjavik pitt said quietly or your right ear will get screwed into your left pitt watched the drivers face closely in the rearview mirror studying the blue eyes knowing they would signal any sudden attempt at resistance no shadow of an expression touched the boyish features not even a flicker of fear then slowly very slowly the face in the mirror began to smile the smile transforming into a gentle laugh major pitt you are a very suspicious man if you had three attempts on your life in the last three days youd develop a suspicious nature too the laugh stopped abruptly and the bush brows bunched together three attempts im aware of only two pitt cut him off by pushing the screwdriver another eighth of an inch deeper into his ear youre a lucky man friend i could try and make you contribute a few choice items about your boss and his operation but russian kgbstyle interrogation is way out of my line instead of reykjavik suppose you drive nice and easy back to keflavik only this time to the united states air force side of the field where you can join a couple of your buddies and play charades with national intelligence agents youll like them theyre experts at taking wanflower and turning him into a babbling life of the party that might prove embarrassing thats your problem the smile was back in the rearview mirror not entirely major it would indeed be a moment worth remembering to see your face when you discover you brought in a nia agent for questioning pitts pressure on the screwdriver didnt relax very secondrate he said id expect a better story from a high school freshman caught smoking pot in the boys room admiral sandecker said you wouldnt be an easy man to talk to the door was open now and pitt had the opportunity to slam it when did you talk to the admiral in his office at numa headquarters ten minutes after commander koski radioed that you and dr hunnewell had landed safely aboard the catawaba to be precise the door stayed open the drivers answer tallied with what pitt knew the nia had not contacted sandecker since he had arrived in iceland pitt glanced around the car there was no sign of life no sign of an ambush by possible accomplices he started to relax caught himself and then clenched the screwdriver until his fingers ached okay be my guest pitt said casually but i strongly urge you to make your pitch without so much as a tic no sweat major just put your mind at ease and lift my cap lift your cap pitt repeated blankly he hesitated a moment then slowly using his free left hand removed the drivers cap inside taped to the underside of the top the drivers voice was soft yet commanding there is a twentyfive caliber colt derringer take it and get that damned screwdriver out of my ear still using one hand pitt opened the breech of the derringer rubbed his thumb over the primers of the two tiny cartridges to make sure the chambers were loaded and then reclosed the breech and cocked the hammer so far so good now ease out of the car and keep your hands where i can see them he loosened his grip on the screwdriver and withdrew it from the drivers ear cavity the driver slid from behind the wheel walked to the front of the car and propped himself lazily against a fender he lifted his right hand and massaged his ear wincing a clever tactic major it didnt come out of any book i know you should read more pitt said ramming an icepick through the eardrum into the brain of an unsuspecting victim is an old trick used by paid killers in gang wars long before either you or i were born a rather painful lesson im not likely to forget pitt got out and pushed the front door of the car open to its stop and stood behind the interior panel using it for a shield the gun in his hand trained on the drivers heart you said you talked to admiral sandecker in washington describe him size hair mannerisms layout of his officeeverything the driver needed no further coaxing he talked for several minutes and ended up by mentioning a few of sandeckers pet slang terms your memory is goodnearly letterperfect i have a photographic memory major my description of admiral sandecker could have easily come from a file take a rundown of yourself for example major dirk eric pitt born exactly thirtytwo years four months and twelve days ago at the hogg hospital in newport beach california mothers name barbara father george pitt senior united states senator from your home state the driver droned on as if he might have been repeating a memorized spiel as indeed he was no sense in going on about your three rows of combat ribbons which you never wear or your formidable reputation if you like i can give you a complete accountt of your actions since you left washington pitt waved the gun that will do im impressed of course mrah lillie jerome p lillie the fourth im your contact jerome p pitt made a good try but couldnt sulpress an incredulous laugh youve got to be kidding lillie gestured helplessly laugh if you will major but the lillie name has been highly esteemed in st louis for nearly a hundred years pitt thought for a moment then it came to him lillie beer of course thats it lillie beer whats the slogan brewed for the gourmets table proof that it pays to advertise lillie said i take it youre another one of our satisfied customers no i prefer budweiser i can see youre going to be a hard man to get along with lillie moaned not really pitt released the derringers hammer and threw the tiny gun to lillie be my guest you couldnt possibly be one of the bad guys and come up with a story that wild lillie fielded the gun your trust is warranted major i told you the truth youre a long way from the brewery or is that another story very dull and very timeconsuming some other time perhaps ill pour out my biography over a glass of dads product he calmly retaped the gun to the inside of his cap as if it was an everyday occurrence now then you mentioned a third attempt on your life you offered to give me a detailed hourbyhour account of my actions since i left washington you tell me nobodys perfect major i lost you for two hours today pitt did some fast mental arithmetic where were you around noon on the southern shore of the island doing what lillie turned away and looked across the barren fields his face empty of all expression at exactly ten minutes after twelve this afternoon i was pushing a knife into another mans throat then there were two of you keeping an eye on the grimsi the grimsi ah of coursethe name of your old boat yes i stumbled into the other guy quite by accident after you and the admiral and miss royal took off toward the southeast i had a hunch your anchor would drop in the area where you and dr hunnewell crashed i drove across the peninsula and arrived too latethat damned old scow was faster than i thoughtyou were already sketching up a storm while admiral sandecker was playing the role of izaak walton the very picture of your contentment had me fooled completely but not your competitor his binoculars were stronger lillie shook his head a telescope one hundred and seventyfive power mounted on a tripod no less then the glint i saw from the boat was from the reflecting mirror if the sun caught it right a visible flash would be the obvious giveaway pitt was silent for a moment as he lit a cigarette the click of the lighter seemed strangely loud in the open of the barren landscape he exhaled and looked at lillie you say you knifed him yes it was unfortunate but he left me no choice lillie leaned over the hood of the volvo and rubbed a palm over his forehead seemingly at ease with his inner self hei dont know his name as there was no identificationwas bent over the telescope talking into a portable transmitter when i crept around an outcropping of rock and literally bumped into him his attention and mine had been focused on your boat he didnt expect me and i didnt expect him to his final reret he acted firstand without forethought pulled a switchblade knife from a sleeverather oldfashioned reallyand leaped lillie made a helpless shrug the poor guy tried to stab instead of slashthe sure sign of an amateur i should have taken him alive for questioning but i got carried away during the heat of the moment and turned his knife against him too bad you didnt get to him five minutes sooner pitt said why is that hed already radioed our position so his buddies could close in for the kill lillie stared at pitt questioningly for what purpose merely to steal a few sketches or a bucket of trash something much more important a jet aircraft i know your mysterious black jet the thought had occurred that you might go looking for it when i guessed your destination but your report failed to pinpoint the exact pitt interrupted his voice deceptively friendly i know for certain that admiral sandecker has had no contact with you or your agency since he left washington he and i are the only ones who know whats in that report pitt paused suddenly remembering except except the secretary at the consulate who typed it lillie finished smiling my compliments your commentary was well written lillie didnt bother to explain how the consulate secretary passed him a copy and pitt didnt bother to ask him tell me major how do you go about dredging for a sunken aircraft with nothing but a sketch pad and a fishing pole your victim knew the answer he detected my air bubbles through his telescope lillies eyes narrowed you had diving equipment he asked flatly how i watched you leave the dock and saw nothing i studied you and the admiral from the shore and neither of you left the deck for more than three minutes after that i lost visibility when the fog rolled in the nia doesnt have a monopoly on sneaky underhanded plots pitt said shooting lillie down in flames lets sit in the car and make ourselves comfortable and ill tetl you about another ordinary garden variety day in the life of dirk pitt so pitt slouched in the rear seat with his feet propped on the backrest of the front and told lillie what had happened from the time the grimsi left the fyrie dock until it had returned he told what he knew for certain and what he didnt everything that is except for one little indefinable thought that kept itching in his minda thought that concerned kirsti fyrie chapter so youve selected oskar rondheim as your villain lillie murmured you havent convinced me with any solid proof i agree its all circumstantial pitt said rondheim has the most to gain therefore rondheim has the motive he murdered to get his hands on the undersea probe and hes murdered to cover his tracks youll have to do better than that pitt looked at lillie okay come up with a better one as an agent in good standing with the nia im embarrassed to admit that im a bit confused youre confused pitt shook his head in mock sadness i cant say i find it too comforting knowing our nations security rests in your hands lillie smiled faintly it is you who has provided the confusion major it is you who has broken the chain what chain pitt said or am i supposed to guess lillie hesitated a moment before answering finally he looked directly at pitt during the last eighteen months a chain of strange circumstances has been forged by country by country from the southernmost tip of chile to the northern border of guatemala secretly through a complex series of clandestine maneuvers the great mining companies of south america have slowly merged into one giant syndicate outwardly its business as usual but behind the locked and barred doors of their respective administrations the policies governing their operations come directly from a single unknown voice pitt shook his head not possible i can name at least five countries that have nationalized their mining cartels theres no way they could tie in with a private company beyond their borders none the less its a documented fact where the mines have been nationalized the management is controlled by an outside organization the parnagusjanios highgrade iron ore pits of brazil the domingo bauxite mines of the dominican republic the government silver mines of honduras they all take their directives from thesame person or persons how did you gather your information we have many sources lillie said some within the mining companies themselves unfortunately our contacts have not infiltrated toplevel management pitt mashed his cigarette into an ashtray recessed within the car door nothing mysterious about someone attempting to gain a monopoly if they have the guts to pull it off more power to them a monopoly is bad enough lillie said the names of the men weve been able to uncover who are high on the totem pole include twelve of the wealthiest men in the western worldall possessing vast financial powers in mineral exploitation and each with tentacles so long that they reach out and control over two hundred industrial corporations lillie paused staring at pitt once they gain a monopoly they can force the prices of copper aluminum zinc and several other commercial ores halfway to the moon the resulting inflation would devastate the economies of at least thirty nations the united states of course being one of the first to go to its knees it doesnt necessarily follow pitt said if that happens they and their financial empires would be sucked down too lillie smiled and nodded thats the catch these men f james kelly of the us sir eric marks of great britain roger dupuy of france hans von hummel of germany than mahani of iran and otherseach worth close to ten figuresare all loyal to their respective countries any one of them might chisel and cheat on taxes but none of them would willingly send his government over the brink of economic disaster then wheres the profit motive we dont know and rondheims connection none except his relationship with kirsti fyrie and her offshore mining interests there was a long silence then pitt said slowly the burning question then is where do you fit in what does the takeover of latin american mining syndicates have to do with iceland the nia didnt send you up here to play cab driver just to learn the local highway system while your brother agents are lurking behind potted plants watching kelly marks dupuy and the others your assignment is to keep an eye on another member of the money boys group shall i mention the name or would you like it written on paper and sealed in an envelope by price waterhouse lillie stared at him for a moment considering youre shooting in the dark am i pitt was homing in now okay lets drag out the suspense and digress for a moment admiral sandecker said he checked every port authority between buenos aires and goose bay and found twelve that recorded the entry and departure of an icelandic fishing trawler matching the remodeled lax what he should have said was that he had them checked someone else did the actual work for him and that someone was the nia nothing out of the ordinary in that lillie said flatly records are sometimes easier for us to obtain than a government agency concerned with marine life except you already had the information before sandecker requested it lillie said nothing he didnt have to his grim expression was all the motivation pitt needed to continue one evening a couple of months ago i ran into an army communications officer in a bar it was a slow night and neither of us felt like partying or chasing girls so we just sat around and drank together until closing time he had just finished a tour of duty at the smytheford radiocommunications station on hudson bay canadaa complex of two hundred radio masts forming a huge dish on a thousandacre site dont ask me what his name and rank were so you can turn him in for divulging military secrets ive forgotten them anyway pitt hesitated a moment to shift his feet to a more comfortable position before he went on he was proud of the installation especially so since he was one of the engineers who helped design and construct it the sophisticated equipment he said was capable of electronically monitoring every radio transmission north of new york london and moscow after the installation was completed he and his crew of army engineers were politely ordered to leave for duty elsewhere its only guesswork on his part of course but he was certain that its currently being operated by the national intelligence agency which specializes in undercover eavesdropping on behalf of the department of defense and the central intelligence agency a rather interesting assumption when you consider that smytheford is advertised as a satellite tracking station lillie leaned forward just where is all this leading to to two gentlemen named matajic and oriley both deceased you think i knew them lillie asked curiously only by name i see little reason to explain who they were you already know your people at smytheford monitored matajics message to sandecker identic lying the longlost lax it must have meant little to your intelligence analysts at the time but their electronic ears undoubtedly pricked up when they received the pilots last message seconds before the black jet blasted all three men into the sea at this point the plot thickens admiral sandecker played it cagy and handed the coast guard a phony story about missing equipment requesting airsea search in the area numas plane disappeared nothing was found or at least nothing was reported the coast guard struck out but the nia didntthey had the lax and its mysterious crew pinpointed right from the start every time the ship radioed its home base in iceland the smytheford computers plotted its exact position now the experts at your headquarters in washington began to smell a connection between the lost undersea probe and the mining operations takeover in south america so they backtracked and traced the ships movements up and down the atlantic coast when sandecker asked for the same information they discreetly waited a few days and then fighting to keep a straight face handed him a previously prepared copy this do you honestly expect me to admit to any of i dont much give a damn what you admit to pitt said wearily im merely pointing out a few facts of life put them all together and they spell the name of the man you have under surveillance here in iceland how do you know it isnt a woman lillie probed because youve reached the same conclusions i havekirsti fyrie may control fyrie limited but oskar rondheim controls kirsti fyrie so were back to rondheim did we really ever leave clever clever deduction major pitt lillie murmured care to fill in any gaps until i receive orders to the contrary i cant fully brief an outsider on all the details of our operation lillies voice carried an official tone that didnt quite come off i can however acknowledge your conclusions you are quite correct in everything youve said yes the nia picked up matajics message yes we tracked the lax yes we feel rondheim is in some way connected with the mining syndicate beyond that there is little i can officially tell you that you dont already know since weve become such close friends pitt said grinning why dont you call me dirk lillie was gracious in defeat have it your way but dont you dare call me jeromeits jerry he held out his hand okay partner dont make me sorry i took you into the firm pitt returned the grip stick with the kid here and youll go places thats what im afraid of lillie sighed and gazed over the barren countryside for a moment as if weighing the turn of events finally he broke his thoughts and looked at his watch wed better head back to reykjavik no thanks to you ive got a busy night ahead of me whats on your agenda first i want to contact headquarters as soon as possible and pass on the serial number of the black jet with a bit of luck they should be able to run a make and have the owners name back to us by morning for your sake after all the trouble you went to i hope it provides an important lead second im going to poke around and see where that hydroplane was moored somebody has got to know something you cant keep a craft like that a secret on an island this small and third the two scaled replicas of south american capitol buildings im afraid you threw us a weird twist when you fished them from the briny deep they must have a functional purpose they may be vital to whoever built them or they may not just to play safe id better request washington to fly in an expert on miniatures and have every square inch of those models thoroughly examined efficient industrious professional keep it up i may slowly become impressed ill try to do my best lillie said sarcastically would you like an extra hand pitt asked im free for the evening lillie smiled a smile that made pitt feel a twinge of uneasiness your plans are already made dirk i wish i could trade places with you but duty calls im afraid to ask whats on your nasty little mind pitt said dryly a party you lucky dog youre going to a poetry reading party youve got to be kidding no im serious by special invitation from oskar rondheim himself though i suspect it was miss fyries idea pitts eyebrows came together over his penetrating green eyes how do you know this how could you know this no invitation arrived before you picked me up at the consulate a trade secret we do manage to pull a rabbit out of the hat occasionally okay ill concede a point and stick a gold star on your chart for the day it was beginning to get chilly so pitt rolled up his window a poetry reading he said disgustedly god that ought to be a winner chapter it is debated among icelanders whether the great house sprawling over the crest of the highest hill above reykjavik is even more elegant than the presidents mansion at bessastadir this could be argued until both structures crumbled to dust mostly because there is no real case for comparison the president of icelands residence is a model of classic simplicity while oskar rondheims modern edifice looked as if it had been spawned by the unleashed imagination of frank lloyd wright the entire block in front of the ornate grille doors was lined with limousines representing every expensive auto manufacturer of every country rousroyce lincoln mercedesbenz cadillac even a russianbuilt zis stood temporarily in the circular driveway unloading its cargo of formally dressed passengers beyond the entryway eighty to ninety guests drifted in and out of the mairl salon and the terrace conversing in a spectrum of different languages the sun which had been hidden off and on by a stray cloud shone brightly through the windows even though it was just past nine oclock in the evening at the far end of the great salon kirsti fyrie and oskar rondheim anchored the receining line under a massive crest bearing the red albatross and greeted each arriving guest kirsti was radiantly beautiful gowned in white silk with gold trim her blond hair elegantly wound grecian style rondheim tall and hawklike towered beside her his thin lips cracking in a smile only when politeness required he was just greeting the russian guests and smartly steering them toward a long table set with even rows of caviar and salmon and embellished by a huge silver punch bowl when his eyes widened a fraction and the forced smile froze kirsti stiffened suddenly as the murmur of the guests died to a strange stillness pitt swept into the room with all the flourish of a matinee idol whose grandiose entrances were his stockintrade at the head of the stairway he stopped and took the handle of a lorgnette hanging around his neck by a small gold chain and held the tiny single lens up to his right eye and surveyed the startled audience who unabashedly stared back at him no one could reoly blame them even an authority on etiquette pitts outfit looked like a cross between a louis xi court costume and god knew what the red jacket sported ruffles on the collar and sleeves while a pair of brocaded yellow breeches tapered and disappeared into the red suede boots around his waist he wore a brown shk sash whose tasseled end hung to within inches of his knees if pitt had been searching for an eyeshattering effect he achieved his purpose with honors after building the scene to its peak he daintily walked down the stairway and approached kirsti and rondheim good evening miss fyrie mr rondheim how good of you to invite me poetry readings are absolutely my favorite soirees i wouldnt miss one for all the lace in china she gazed at pitt fascinated her lips parted she said huskily oskar and i are happy you could come yes its good to see you again major the words stuck in rondheims throat as he forgot and grasped pitts deadfish handshake kirsti as if sensing an embarrassing situation in the making quickly asked youre not wearing your uniform tonight pitt casually swung the lorgnette around on its chain heavens no uniforms are so drab dont you think i thought it would be amusing if i came in mufti this evening so no one would recognize me he laughed loudly at his own lefthanded joke turning every head within hearing distance to pitts extreme pleasure rondheim visibly forced himself to smile courteously we had hoped admiral sandecker and miss royal might also attend miss royal wig be along shortly pitt said staring across the room through his eyeglass but im afraid the admiral isnt feeling well he decided to retire early poor fellow i cant blame him after what happened this afternoon nothing serious i hope rondheims voice betrayed a lack of concern for sandeckers health that was as obvious as his sudden interest in the reason behind the admirals incapacity fortunately no the admiral only suffered a few cuts and bruises an accident kirsti asked dreadful simply dreadful pitt said dramatically after you were so kind to offer us the loan of a boat we cruised to the south side of the island where i sketched the coastline while the admiral fished about one oclock we found ourselves enveloped by a nasty fog just as we were about to return to reykjavik a horrible explosion occurred somewhere in the mist the blast blew out the windows in the wheelhouse causing a few small cuts about the admirals head an explosion rondheims voice was low and hoarse do you have any idea as to the cause afraid i havent pitt said couldnt see a thing we investigated of course but with visibility no more than twenty feet we found nothing rondheims face was expressionless very strange you are sure you saw nothing major absolutely pitt said youre probably thinking along the same lines as admiral sandecker a ship might have hit an old world war two mine or possibly a fire broke out and touched off its fuel tanks we notified the local coastal patrol they have nothing to do now but wait and see what vessel is reported as missing all in all a terrifying experience pitt broke off as tidi approached ah tidi here you are rondheim turned on the smile again miss royal he bowed and kissed her hand major pitt has been telling us of your harrowing experience this afternoon the bastard pitt thought he cant wait to pump answers out of her tidi looked cute and frisky in a blue fulllength dress her fawn hair falling straight and natural down her back pitt hung his arm loosely around her waist letting the hand slip down out of sight and pinched her soft bottom he smiled as he looked down into those wide brown eyeseyes that possessed a wise knowing quality i missed most of it im afraid she reached behind her back and clutching pitts hand discreetly twisted his little finger until he gave in and just as discreetly removed his arm from her waist the blast knocked me against a cupboard in the galley she touched a small swelling on her forehead the purplish bruise neatly covered by makeup i was pretty much out of it for the next hour and a half poor dirk here trembled and threw up all the way back to reykjavik pitt could have kissed her tidi had picked up the situation without the bat of an eye and come through like a trooper i think its time we mingled he said taking her by the arm and whisking her off toward the punch bowl he passed her a cup of punch and they helped themselves to the hors doeuvres pitt had to fight from yawning as he and tidi drifted from one group to another an experienced partygoer pitt usually mixed with ease but this time he couldnt seem to make a beachhead there was an odd atmosphere about this function he couldnt put his finger on it yet there was something definitely out of place the usual subdivisions were presentbores the drunks snobs and the backslappers everyone they joined who could speak english was quite polite no antiamerican sentimentsa favorite ploy during most conversations involving guests of other nationscame to the surface to all outward appearances it seemed like the common middleoftheroad gettogether then suddenly he had it he bent down and whispered in tidis ear do you get the feeling were persona non grata tidi looked at him curiously no everyone seems friendly enough sure theyre sociable and polite but its forced how can you be certain i know a warm sincere smile when i see one were not getting any its as though were in a cage feed and talk to the animals but dont touch thats silly you cant really blame them for being uneasy when they talk to someone whos dressed the way you are thats the catch the oddball is always without fail the center of attraction if i wasnt dead sure id say this was a wake she looked up at pitt with a sly smile youre just nervous because youre way out of your league he smiled back care for an explanation see those two men over there she nodded her head sideways to her right standing by the piano pitt casually rolled a slow glance in the direction tidi indicated a small rotund lively little man with a bald head was gesturing animatedly as he spoke in rapid bursts into a wiry thick white beard no more than ten inches from his nose the beard belonged to a thin distinguishedlooking man with silver hair that fell well below his collar giving him the appearance of a harvard professor pitt turned back to tidi and shrugged so you dont recognize them should i you dont read the society pages of the new york times playboy is the only publication i bother with she threw him a typical feminine disgustedwiththemaleofthespecies expression and said its a pretty sid state of affairs when the son of a united states senator cant identify two of the richest men in the world pitt was only half listening to tidi it took a few seconds for her words to sink in but then they slowly began to register and he turned his head and brazenly stared at the two men who were still heavily involved in conversation then he swung back and gripped tidis arm so hard she winced their names her eyes flew wide in surprise the baldheaded fat man is hans von hummel the distinguishedlooking one is f james kelly you could be mistaken maybe no im positive i saw kelly once at the presidents inaugural ball look around the room recognize anyone else tidi quickly did as she was told scanning the main salon for a familiar face her gaze stopped not once but three times the old fellow with the funnylooking glasses sitting on the settee thats sir eric marks and the attractive brunette next to him is dorothy howard the british actress never mind her concentrate on the men the only other who looks vaguely familiar is the one who just came in talking to kirsti fyrie im pretty sure hes jack boyle the australian coal tycoon how come youre such an authority on millionaires tidi gave a cute shrug a favorite pastime for a lot of unmarried girls you never know when you might meet one so you prepare for the occasion even if it only comes off in your imagination for once your daydreams paid off i dont understand neither do i except this is beginning to look like a meeting of the clan pitt pulled tidi out on the terrace and slowly walked her to a corner away from the mainstream of the crowd he watched the small groups of guests milling about the expansive double doors catching them looking his way and then turning back not in embarrassment but rather as if they were scientists observing an experiment and discussing its probable outcome he began to get the uneasy feeling that coming into rondheims lair was a mistake he was just in the process of thinking up an excuse to leave when kirsti fyrie spied them and came alongside would you care to be seated in the study were almost ready to begin who is giving the reading tidi asked kirstis face brightened why oskar of course oh dear god pitt mumbled under his breath like a lamb to slaughter he let kirsti lead him to the study with tidi tagging behind by the time they reached the study and found a seat among the long circular rows of plush armchairs grouped around a raised dais the room was nearly brimming to capacity it was small consolation but pitt considered he and tidi fortunate to sit in the last row near the doorway offering a possible means of unnoticed departure when the opportunity arose then his hopes went up in smokea servant closed and bolted the doors after a few moments the servant turned a rheostat and dimmed the lights throwing the study into solid darkness then kirsti climbed the dais and two soft pink spotlights came on giving her the aura of a sculptured greek goddess standing serenely on her pedestal in the louvre pitt mentally undressed her trying to imagine what an awesome picture she would have made in that revealing condition he stole a glance at tidi the enraptured quality of her expression made him wonder if it were possible that her thoughts were similar to his he groped for her hand found it and squeezed the fingers tightly tidi was so absorbed with the vision on the dais she didnt even notice or respond to pitts touch standing there motionless soaking up the stares from an audience still invisible beyond the glare of the spotlight fyrie smiled confidently with that inner glow of selfassurance that only a woman truly secure in her loveliness can possess she bowed her head toward the hushed bodies in the darkness and began to speak ladies and gentlemen distinguished guests tonight our host mr oskar rondheim will offer for your enjoyment his latest work this he will read in our native icelandic tongue then since most of you understand english he will read selected verses from the marvelous new contemporary irish poet sean magee pitt turned and whispered to tidi i should have fortified myself with at least ten more cups of that punch he couldnt see tidis face he didnt have tohe felt her elbow jab him sharply in the ribs when he turned back to kirsti she had disappeared and rondheim hid taken her place it might have been said that pitt suffered the agonies of the damned for the next hour and a half but he didnt five minutes after rondheim began delivering his icelandic saga in a rolling monotone pitt was sound asleep content in the fact that no one would notice his lack of poetry appreciation in the darkened surroundings no sooner had the first wave of unconsciousness swept over him than pitt found himself back on the beach for the hundredth time cradling dr hunnewells head in his arms over and over he watched helplessly as hunnewell stared vacantly into pitts eyes trying to speak fighting desperately to make himself understood then finally barely uttering those three words that seemingly had no meaning a cloud passed over his tired old features and he was dead the strange phenomenon of the dream wasnt its actual recurrence but rather the fact that no two sequences were exactly the same each time that hunnewell died something was different in one dream the children would be present on the beach as they had been in reality in the next they would be missing nowhere in sight once the black jet circled overhead dipping its wings in an unexpected salute even sandecker appeared in one scene standing over pitt and hunnewell and sadly shaking his head the weather the layout of the beach the color of the seathey all differed from fantasy to fantasy only one small detail always remained faithfullyhunnewells last words the audiences applause woke pitt up he stared at nothing in particular stupidly gathering his thoughts the lights had come on and he spent several moments blinking and getting his eyes accustomed to the glare rondheim was still on the dais smugly accepting the generous acclaim he held up his hands for silence as most of you know my favorite diversion is memorizing verse with all due modesty i must honestly state that my acquired knowledge is quite formidable i would at this time like to put my reputation on the block and invite any of you in the audience to begin a line of any verse that comes to your mind if i cannot finish the stanza that follows or complete the poem to your total satisfaction i shall personally donate fifty thousand dollars to your favorite charity he waited until the murmur of excited voices tapered to silence once more shall we begin who will be first to challenge my memory sir eric marks stood should the guardian friend or mother try that one for an introduction oskar rondheim nodded tell the woes of wilful waste scorn their counsel scorn their pother you can hang or drown at last he paused for effect one and twenty by samuel johnson marks bowed in acknowledgment absolutely correct f james kelly rose next finish this one if you can and name the author now all my days are trances and all my nightly dreams rondheim hardly skipped a beat are where thy grey eye glances and where thy footstep gleamsin what ethereal dances by what eternal streams the tine in paradise and it was written by edgar allan poe my compliments oskar kelly was visibly impressed you rate an a plus rondheim looked about the room a smile slowly spreading across his chiseled face as a familiar figure rose in the back do you wish to try your luck major pitt pitt looked at rondheim somberly i can only offer you three words i accept the challenge rondheim said confidently please state them god save thee pitt said very slowly almost as if he were skeptical of any additional tines rondheim laughed elementary major youve done me the kindness of allowing me to quote from my favorite verse the contempt in rondheims voice was there everyone in the room could feel it god save thee ancient mariner from the fiends that plague thee thus why lookst thou so with my crossbow i shot the albitross the sun now rose upon the right out on the sea came he still hid in mist and on the left went cionn into the sea and the good south wind still blew behind but no sweet bird did follow nor any day for lomid or dlay came to the mariners hollo and i had done a hellish time and it would work em woe for all averred i had killed the bird that made the breeze to blow then suddenly rondheim stopped looking at pitt curiously theres little need to continue its obvious to all present that you have asked me to quote the rime of the ancient mariner by samuel taylor coleridge pitt began to breathe a little easier the light suddenly became brighter at the end of the tunnel he knew something that he hadnt known before it wasnt over yet but things were looking up he was glad now that he had played the proverbial long shot the gamble had paid off in unexpected answers the nightmare of hunnewells death would never trouble his sleep again a satisfied smile touched his lips thank you mr rondheim your memory serves you well there was something about pitts tone that made rondheim uneasy the pleasure is mine major he didnt like the smile on pitts facehe didnt like it at all chapter pitt suffered for another half hour as rondheim continued to awe the audience with his vast repertoire of verse at last the program was over the doors were opened and the crowded room drained into the main salon the women escorted onto the terrace to engage in small talk and sip a sweet alcoholic concoction passed about by the servants the men directed to the trophy room for cigars and one hundredyearold rouche brandy the cigars were carried into the room within a sterling silver case and presented for everyones selection except pitt he was blithely ignored after the lighting ritual each man holding his cigar over a candle warming it to the desired temperature the servants passed around the rouche brandy the heavy yellowbrown fluid in exotically designed snifter glasses again pitt was left emptyhanded apart from himself and oskar rondheim pitt counted thirtytwo men gathered around the flames crackling in the immense fireplace at the end of the trophy room the reaction to pitts presence as expressed by the faces was interesting no one even noticed him for a fleeting moment he pictured himself a ghost with no substance that had just walked through the wall and was waiting for a sance to begin so that he could put a spiritual appearance or so he thought he could have imagined all sorts of strange scenes but there was no imagining the blunt circular gun barrel that was pressing into his spine he didnt bother to see whose hand held the gun it would have made little difference rondheim answered any doubt kirsti rondheim stared behind pitt you are early i didnt expect you for another twenty minutes von hummel produced a handkerchief mopped a brow that soaked the monogrammed linen and asked the girl he arrived with has she been readied miss royal has been made quite comfortable kirsti said staring right through pitt there was something in her tone that left him with a feeling of doubt rondheim came over and took the gun from her hand as though he was a concerned parent guns and beauty do not go together he scolded you must allow a man to guard the major oh i rather enjoyed it she said in a throaty tone its been so long since ive held one i see no reason to delay any further jack boyle said our timing is complex we must proceed at once there is time rondheim said tersely a russian a short stocky man with thinning hair brown eyes and a limping gait stood and faced rondheim i believe you owe us an explanation mr rondheim why is this man he nodded in pitts direction being treated like a criminal you told myself and the other gentlemen here he is a newspaperman and that it would not be wise to speak too freely with him yet that is the fourth or fifth time tonight you have referred to him as major rondheim studied the man before him then set down his glass and pushed the button on a telephone he didnt lift the receiver or talk into it only picked up his glass and sipped at the remaining contents before your questions are answered comrade tamareztov i suggest you look behind you the russian called tamaretov swung around everyone swung around and looked to their rear not pitt he didnt have to he kept his eyes straight ahead at a mirror that betrayed severalbarlooking expressionless men in black coveralls who suddenly materialized at the opposite end of the room all automatic rifles braced in the firing position a roundshouldered heavy character in his middle seventies with blue knifing eyes deep set in a wizened face grasped f james kelly by the arm you invited me to join you tonight james i think you know what this is all about yes i do when kelly spoke the pained look in his eyes was plainly visible then he turned away slowly very slowly almost unnoticed kelly rondheim von hummel marks and eight other men had grouped themselves on one side of the fireplace leaving pitt and the remaining guests standing opposite the flames in utter bewilderment pitt noted with a touch of uneasiness that all the guns were aimed at his group im waiting james the old blueeyed man said his voice commanding kelly hedged looked rather sadly at von hummel and marks he waited expectantly they finally nodded back assuring him of their approval have any of you heard of hermit limited the silence in the room became intense nobody spoke nobody answered pitt was coolly calculating the chances of escape he gave up unable to bring the odds of success below fifty to one hermit limited kelly went on is international in scope but you wont find it on any stock exchange because it is vastly different in administration from any business youre familiar with i dont have time to go into all the details of its operation so just let me say that hermits main goal is to achieve control and take possession of south and of central america thats impossible shouted a tall ravenhaired man with a pronounced french accent absolutely unthinkable its also good business to do the impossible kelly said what youve suggested is not business but political power madness kelly shook his head madness maybe but political power with selfish and inhuman motives no he searched the faces on the other side of the fireplace they were all blank with disbelief i am f james kelly he said softly in my lifetime i have amassed over two billion dollars in assets no one present doubted him whenever the wall street journal listed the one hundred wealthiest men in the world kellys name always stood at the top being wealthy carries tremendous responsibilities as many as two hundred thousand people depend on me for their living if i was to fail financially tomorrow it would cause a recession that would be felt from one end of the united states to the other not to mention the many countries around the world that depend upon my subsidiary companies for a high percentage of their local economies yet as these gentlemen around me can testify riches do not guarantee immortality very few of the rich are remembered in the history books kelly looked almost ill as he paused no one in the room did anything but breathe until he continued two years ago i began thinking about what i would leave after i was gone a financial empire fought over by parasitic business associates and relatives who had only counted the days till my funeral so they could grab the spoils believe me gentlemen it was a pretty dismal thought so i considered methods to distribute my assets in ways that would benefit mankind but how andrew carnegie built libraries john d rockefeller set up foundations for science and education what would do the most good for the peoples of the world regardless of white black yellow red or brown skins regardless of nationalities if i had listened to my human emotions it would have been an easy decision to use my money to assist the cancer crusade the red cross the salvation army or any one of the thousand medical centers or universities around the country but was it really enough somehow it sounded too easy i decided upon a different directionone that would have a lasting impact on miwons of people for hundreds of years so you plotted to use your resources to become the selfproclaimed messiah of the povertystricken latin nations pitt said kelly offered pitt a condescending smile no youre quite mistaken majorah pitt rondheim provided major dirk pitt kelly gazed at pitt thoughtfully are you by chance any relation to senator george pitt his errant son pitt acknowledged kelly stood like a wax statue for a moment he turned to rondheim but only received a stone face in return your father is a good friend he said woodenly was pitt said coldly kelly fought to keep his composure it was apparent that the man was deeply troubled by his conscience he downed his brandy took a second to collect his thoughts and went on it has never been my intention to play god whatever path i chose had to come from a means far more calculating far less emotional than the human mind computers the word fell from the lips of kellys elderly friend hermit limited was the project you programmed into the computers at our data processing division nearly two years ago i remember it well james you closed down the entire complex for three months gave everyone a vacation with paya display of generosity that youve seldom demonstrated before or since loaned the use of the equipment you said to the government for a top secret military project i was afraid even then you might have guessed my intentions sam it was the first time kelly had called the old gentleman by name but systems analysis provided the only efficient solution to the problem i presented myself the concept could hardly be classed as revolutionary every government has its think tanks the space systems devised for our rocketry and moon projects have been utilized for everything from diagnosing crime reports to improving surgical procedures programming a computer to select a country or geographic location that is ripe for a controlled and developed utopian atmosphere and the method to achieve that goal is not as farfetched as any of you might think its sheet science fiction in this day and age we all deal in science fiction do we not kelly answered consider this gentlemen of all the nations of the world the nations of latin america are the most vulnerable to outside penetration primarily because they have not had to face foreign encroachment in well over a hundred years they were protected by a wall a wall built by the united states and called the monroe doctrine the american government will take a very dim view of your grandiose scheme said a tall man with white hair white eyebrows and solemn eye by the time their agents have penetrated hermit limiteds organization we will have proven our intentions with solid accomplishments kelly said they will not bother us in fact i predict they will discreetly give us a green light and provide whatever aid they consider possible without international repercussion i take it you dont intend to go it alone pitt probed no kelly tersely answered after i satisfied myself that the program was sound and had every chance to succeed i approached marks von hummel boyle and the other gentlemen you see here who possessed the financial means to make it a reality they thought as i did money is to be used for the common good of all why die and leave nothing but a large bank account or a few corporations that soon forget who planted their seed and nourished them to financial maturity we then met and formed hermit limited each of us owns equal shares of stock and has an equal voice on the board of directors how do you know one or more of your partners in crime wont get greedy pitt smiled faintly they may swindle a couple or two for themselves the computer hose well kelly said undaunted look at us no one is under the age of sixtyfive what do we have left one two maybe with luck ten years we are all childless therefore no heirs what does any one of us have to gain by excessive avarice the answer is simple nothing the russian shook his head incredulously your scheme is absurd even my own government would never consider such drastic and reckless action no government would kelly said in patient explanation but there lies the difference you think only in political terms in the history of man no nation or civilization has ever fallen except by internal revolution or by foreign invasion i intend to write a new chapter by accomplishing the impossible by adhering to strict business principles i cant say as i recall murder being taught as a required course in business administration school pitt said easily lighting a cigarette an unfortunate but necessary part of the plan returned kelly methodical assassination is perhaps a more fitting term he turned to the russian you should have your kgb agents read the ismailians comrade tamareztov it goes into great detail concerning the methods used by a persian sect of fanatics that spread terror through the mohammedan world in ad the word assassin is their dark memorial to the ages youre as mad as they were the frenchman said severely if you believe that kelly said slowly youre very naive the frenchman looked dazed i do not understand how can you how can my associates here and i take over an entire continent kelly finished basically its elementary purely a problem of economics we start with an impoverished country gain control of its monetary resources discreetly eliminate its key leaders and buy it out you wax lyrical james said the old man youll have to do better there is genius in simplicity sam take for example bolivia a country whose people are close to starvation in many cases the income per family barely exceeding twenty dollars a year its whole economy is based on the peroza copper mines gain control of the mines and you gain control of the country i should think bolivias army will have something to say about a foreigninspired takeover pitt said pouring a glass to the brim with brandy quite right major pitts kelly smiled then said briskly but armies have to be paid each has its price particularly its generals if they refuse to be bought it is then a simple matter of elimination again a business principle in order to build a more efficient organization you discard the deadwood and replace it with hardworking dedicated individuals he paused a moment unconsciously smoothing his beard after hermit limited assumes the administration of the government the army shall be gradually disbanded and why not it is only a drain on the economy again you could compare an army to a company that is losing money the obvious solution is to close the doors and write it off as a tax loss have you forgotten the people james it was sam who spoke do you truly expect them to stand idly while you turn their country upside down like any going concern we have an advertising and marketing department as with a new product about to be introduced on the market we have a detailed promotional campaign all worked out people only know what they see and hear in the media to which they have access one of our first steps was to purchase under a local citizens name of course whatever newspapers radio and television stations that were available pitt said i assume you dont envision a free press in your shangrila a free press is pushing a form of permissiveness kelly said impatiently look what it has done to the united states print anything so long as its filthy scandalous sensationalanything to sell more papers in order to obtain more paid advertising the socalled free press in america has stripped every moral fiber from a once great nation and left nothing but a stagnant pile of garbage in the closets of the peoples minds granted the american press isnt perfect pitt said but they at least make an effort to get at the truth and expose autocrats like yourself pitt quickly fell silent surprised at himself for making a speech he had come close to falling out of character he knew now that if there was a slight thread of hope for escape it lay in his continued masquerade as one of the gay boys goodness i didnt mean to get carried away frowning baffled kelly lifted his eyes to look again at rondheim his silent question was answered with a disgusted shrug the old man called sam broke the silence after you buy out one country james how do you intend to take over the rest even you and your associates as you call them havent the capital to gain financial control of the entire continent in one fell swoop true sam even our combined resources can only go so far but we can make bolivia for example into an orcanized and fruitful society try and imagine it with no corruption at the administrative level the military except for a token force eliminated the agriculture and the industry all geared toward providing a better life for the people the consumers the intensity in kellys voice began to rise again business principle sink every nickel and dime into growth none goes to profit then when bolivia is established as the utopian prototype the envy of all the peoples on the continent then we shall annex her neighboring countries one by one the poor and the hungry waiting breathlessly to be swept into paradise the frenchman said contemptuously is that it you think you exaggerate kelly said indifferently but you hit the truth closer than you intended yes the poor and the hungry will be eager to snatch at any straw that guarantees an immensely higher standard of living the domino theory impelled by noble thoughts pitt added kelly nodded as you say noble thoughts and why not western civilization has a constant history of rebirths impregnated by noble thoughts we businessmen as perhaps the largest and most powerful influence of the last two hundred years now have a golden opportunity to determine whether another brilliant rebirth shall occur or whether a civilization that lies in the gutter shall remain there and stop breathing forever at this point i must admit to being a stickinthemud i hold a number of doctrines that have been poohpoohed by the best academic minds of higher learning i entertain the thought that organization is better than confusion i prefer profit to loss strong means to gentle persuasion to accomplish a goal and im dead certain that sound business rules are more valuable than political ideologies your grand design has a flaw pitt said helping himself to another brandy a deviation that could easily screw up the works kelly stared at pitt speculatively your brain against the most advanced techniques of computer science come now major weve spent months programming every possibility every abnormality youre merely playing games am i pitt downed the brandy as if it were water and said to kelly how do you explain rondheim and miss fyrie they hardly pass the age requirements for executive material of hermit limited rondheim is short by twenty years miss fyrie well ah she doesnt even come close ness fyries brother kristjan was an idealist like myself a man who was searching for a way to raise people from the mud of poverty and misery his acts of generosity in africa and other parts of the world where his business transpired led us to make an exception unlike most hardheaded businessmen he used his wealth for the common good when he tragically lost his life we the board of directors of hermit limited he bowed to the men seated around him voted to elect miss fyrie in his place and rondheim a fortunate contingency we had hoped for but not counted on enough his extensive fishing faculties appeared an enticing asset toward developing the fishing industry of south america it was his hidden talents and useful connections that swung the pendulum in his favor the superintendent of your liquidation department pitt said grimly the leader of your private sect of ismailians the men around kelly looked at each other then at pitt they looked in silence with curiosity written on their faces von hummel wiped his brow for the fiftieth time and sir eric marks rubbed his hand across his lips and nodded at kelly a movement that did not go unnoticed by pitt swinging the sash around his waist semicomily pitt walked over to the table and poured himself another glass of the rouche a last drink for the road because he knew kelly never meant for him to leave the house through the front door you guessed that kelly said in an even voice hardly pitt said after youve had three attempts on your life you kind of get to know these things the hydroplane rondheim snapped savagely you know what happened to it pitt sat down and sipped the brandy if he had to die at least he had the satisfaction of knowing he held the stage at the end terribly sloppy of you my dear oskar or should i say the late captain of your last boat you should have seen the look on his face just before my molotov cocktail hit him you damned queer rondheim said his voice shaking with fury you lying faggot sticks and stones my dear oskar pitt said carelessly think what you may one thing is certain due to your negligence youll never see your hydroplane and crew again cant you see what hes trying to do rondheim took a step toward pitt hes trying to turn us against each other that will do kellys tone was cold his eyes commanding please go on major youre very kind pitt downed his brandy and poured another what the hell he thought might as well deaden whatever pain that was coming poor oskar also bumbled the second attempt i dont have to go into the sorry details but im sure youre aware that his two feeblebrained assassins are talking like women on a party line right this minute to agents of the national intelligence agency damn kelly spun around to rondheim is that true my men never talk rondheim glared at pitt they know what will happen to their relatives if they do besides they know nothing let us hope youre right kelly said heavily he came and stood over pitt staring with a strangely expressionless gaze that was more disturbing than any display of animosity could ever have been this game has gone far enough major too bad i was just getting warmed up just getting to the good part it isnt necessary neither was killing dr hunnewell pitt said his voice was unnaturally calm a terrible terrible mistake a sad miscalculation doubly so since the good doctor was a key member of hermit limited chapter for perhaps ten shocked incredulous seconds pitt let his words soak in as he sat nonchalantly in an armchair cigarette in one hand glass in the other the very picture of relaxed boredom not so rondheim and the other members of hermit limited their faces were as uncomprehending as if each had just come home and found his wife in bed with another man kellys eyes widened and his breath seemed to stop then slowly he began to gain control again calm quiet the professional businessman saying nothing until the right words formed in his mind your computers must have blown a fuse pitt continued admiral sandecker and i were on to dr hunnewell right from the start pitt lied knowing there was no way kelly or rondheim could prove otherwise you wouldnt be interested in how or why you are mistaken major kelly said impatiently we would be most interested pitt took a deep breath and made the plunge actually our first tipoff came when dr len matajic was rescued no that cannot be rondheim gasped pitt gave silent thanks to sandecker for his wild plan to resurrect the ghosts of matajic and oriley the opportunity was handed to him on a silver platter and he could see no reason not to use it to kill time pick up the phone and ask the overseas operator for room at walter reed general hospital in washington i suggest you request persontoperson your call will go through faster that will not be necessary kelly said i have no reason to doubt you suit yourself pitt said carelessly fighting to keep a straight face laying his bluff successfully as i started to say when dr matajic was rescued he described the lax and its crew in vivid detail he wasnt fooled for a minute by the alterations to the superstructure but of course you know all this your people monitored his message to admiral sandecker and then dont you see the rest was simple deduction thanks to matajics description it didnt take any great effort to trace the ships whereabouts from the time it disappeared with kristjan fyrie to when it moored on the iceberg where matajic had his research station pitt smiled because of dr matajics powers of observationthe crews suntans hardly spelled a fishing trip in north atlantic watersadmiral sandecker was able to figure the laxs previous course along the south american coast he then began to suspect dr hunnewell rather clever of the admiral now that i look back on it go on go on kelly urged well obviously the lax had been utilizing the undersea probe to find new mineral deposits and just as obviously with fyrie and his engineers dead dr hunnewell the coinventor of the probe was the only one around who knew how to operate it you are exceedingly well informed kelly said wryly but that hardly constitutes proof pitt was on tricky ground so far he had been able to skirt around the national intelligence agencys involvement in hermit limited and kelly had yet to be baited into offering any further information its time he amusedly told himself to tell the truth proof okay will you accept the words of a dying man straight from the horses mouth the man in question is dr hunnewell himself i dont believe it his last words before he died in my arms were god save thee what are you talking about rondheim shouted what are you trying to do i meant to thank you for that oskar pitt said coldly hunnewell knew who his murderer wasthe man who gave the order for his death he tried to quote from the rime of the ancient mariner it was all there wasnt it you quoted it yourself why lookst thou so with my crossbow i shot the albatross your trademark oskar the red albatross thats what hunnewell meant for all averrd i had killd the bird that made the breeze to blow you killed the man who helped you probe the sea floor pitt was feeling cocky now the warmth from the brandy was spreading comfortingly through his body i cant match your memory for quoting the verse verbatim but if my memory serves me correctly the ancient mariner and his ship of ghosts were met by a hermit near the endanother tiein yes it was all in the verse hunnewell pointed the finger of guilt with his dying breath and you oskar stood up and unwittingly pleaded guilty you sent your arrow in the right direction major pitt kelly idly stared at the smoke from his cigar but you aimed at the wrong man i gave the order for dr hunnewells death oskar merely carried it through for what purpose dr hunnewell was beginning to have second thoughts about hermit limiteds methods of operationquite oldfashioned thoughts really thou shall not kill and all that he threatened to expose our entire organization unless we closed down our assassination department a condition that was impossible to accept if we were to have any chance for ultimate success therefore dr hunnewell had to be discharged from the firm another business principle of course kelly smiled is that an i had to be swept under the carpet because i was a witness pitt said as if answering a question kelly simply nodded but the undersea probe pitt asked with hunnewell and fyriethe goose who laid the golden egg is dead who is left with the knowledge to build a secondgeneration model the confident look was back in kellys eyes no one he answered softly but then no one is required you see our computers have now been programmed with the necessary information with proper analysis of the data we should have a working model of the probe within ninety days for a brief moment pitt stood silent caught unprepared by the unexpected disclosure then he quickly shook off his surprise at kellys statement the brandy was beginning to get to him now but his mind was still running with the smoothness of a generator then hunnewell no longer served a useful purpose your dataproceszing brains discovered the secret of producing celtinium i compliment you major pitt you possess a penetrating discernment kelly glanced impatiently at his watch and nodded to rondheim then he turned and said im sorry but im afraid the time has come gentlemen the party is over what do you intend on doing with us james sams eyes burned into kellys until the billionaire turned and avoided the stare its obvious you told us your secrets as a courtesy to our curiosity its also obvious you can never let us walk from this house with those secrets in our heads its true kelly looked at the men standing opposite the fireplace none of you can be permitted to tell what you heard here tonight but why old sam asked philosophically why expose us to your clandestine operation and thereby seal our death warrants kelly tiredly rubbed his eyes and leaned back in a large overstuffed leather chair the moment of truth the denouement he sadly searched the faces across the room they were pale with shock and disbelief it is now eleven oclock in exactly fortytwo hours and ten minutes hermit limited will open its doors for business twentyfour hours later we will be running the affairs of our first client or country if you prefer in order to make this historical event as inauspicious as possible we need a diversion a disaster that will attract headlines and cause anxious concern among the leaders of world governments while our plan is carried off practically unnoticed and we are your diversion said the tall white haired man with the solemn eyes after a long wordless stare kelly simply said yes the innocent victims of a disaster spawned by computers to make headlines god its barbaric yes kelly repeated but necessary in your own ways to your own countries you are important men you represent the industry government and science of five different nations your combined loss will be considered a worldwide tragedy this must be some sort of insane joke tamareztov shouted you cannot simply shoot two dozen men and their wives down like animals your wives will be returned to your lodgings safe and unharmed and unknowing kelly set his glass on the mantel we have no intention of shooting anyone we intend to rely on mother nature to do the job with a little help of course after all shootings can be traced accidents merely regretted rondheim motioned the black coveralled men with the guns to move in closer if you please gentlemen roll up one of your sleeves as if on cue kirsti left the room and quickly returned carrying a small tray set with bottles and hypodermic syringes she set the tray down and began filling the syringes ill be damned if youll stick a needle in my arm one of the men in pitts group exploded shoot me now and get it over his eyes went glassy as a guards rifle butt caught him behind the ear and he slumped to the floor let us have no further arguments rondheim said grimly he turned to pitt come into the next room major in your instance i shall deal with you on a personal basis he waved the gun he had taken from kirsti toward a doorway rondheim followed by two of his guards escorted pitt along a wide hall down a circular flight of stairs into another hall then shoved roughly through the second of several doorways lining both sides of the serond passageway pitt letting himself go loose stumbled awkwardly fell to the floor then scanned the room it was an immense room painted stark white a large pad lay in the middle of the floor surrounded by an array of bodybuilding equipment brightly lit by long rows of fluorescent light fixtures the room was a gymnasium better and more expensively equipped than any pitt had ever seen the walls were decorated with at least fifty posters depicting the many karate movements pitt silently acknowledged a wellconceived and laidout training room rondheim passed the small automatic to one of the guards i must leave you for a moment major he said dryly please make yourself comfortable until i return perhaps you would care to loosen up your muscles may i suggest the parallel bars with that he laughed loudly and left the room pitt stayed where he was on the floor and studied the two guards one was a tall icefaced and hardeyed giant nearly six feet four the dark hair circling his prematurely bald head made him look like a monk an illusion shattered by the semiautomatic rifle cradled in a pair of huge hairy hands he returned pitts stare with a look that dared pitt to try and escape a possibility made one hundred percent hopeless by the second guard he stood and filled up the door to the hallway his shoulders coming within an inch of touching both sides of the vertical framework except for a big red face heavily moustached he could have passed inspection with an army of apes he let his rifle hang loosely in a hand that came nearly to his knees five minutes passefive minutes during which pitt carefully planned his next move five minutes in which the guards hard eyes never left him then suddenly the door on the far side of the gym opened and rondheim walked in he had changed from his dinner jacket into the white loosefitting attire of a karate disciple clothing that pitt knew was called a gi rondheim stood there for a moment an assured confident smile taut on his thin lips then he walked softly across the floor on bare feet and stepped onto the heavy mat facing pitt tell me major are you familiar with karate or kungfu pitt uneasily eyed the narrow black belt that was knotted around rondheims waist and fervently prayed that the warm glow of the brandy would ease the beating he felt certain was coming he simply shook his head perhaps judo no i abhor physical violence a pity i had hoped for a more worthy opponent but it is no less than i suspected he idly fingered the japanese characters embroidered on his belt i have my doubts about your masculinity yet kirsti thinks you are more manly than you act we shall soon see pitt forced back the hate and projected a quaver of fear leave me alone leave me alone his voice was highpitched now almost a screech why do you want to hurt me ive done nothing to you his mouth was working in short jerks from a contorted face i lied to you about blowing up your boat i never saw it through the fogi swear you must believe the two guards looked at each other and exchanged sickened expressions but rondheims face went far beyond mere revulsionhe looked positively nauseated enough he shouted commandingly stop this drivel i never believed for a moment you had the courage to attack and destroy my boat and crew pitt stared wildly about him a look of blind stupid terror in his eyes that might have been painted there you have no reason to kill me ill tell no one anything please you can trust me he started to move toward rondheim his hands upturned pleading stand where you are pitt froze his planned act was working he could only hope now that rondheim would quickly tire of a victim who put up no defense no resistance at all a major in the united states air force rondheim grimaced ill wager you are nothing but a spineless homosexual who used your fathers influence to acquire rankthe lowest form of vermin living off your own excretion soon you will know what it is to feel pain from the hands and feet of another man a shame you will not enjoy the time to look back and reflect onyour most punishing lesson in the art of selfdefense pitt stood there like a panicfrozen elk about to be brought down by the hounds he stood there mumbling incoherently as rondheim moved to the middle of the mat and assumed one of the many opening stances of karate no wait pitt choked the words off in his throat threw back his head and spun sideways in one convulsive movement he had caught the tiny shift in rondheims eyes the beginning of the lightning thrust as the icelander came in with a reverse punch that connected on pitts cheekbone a halfsolid blow that would have caused much more damage than a bruised swelling if pitt hadnt rolled with the impact he reeled back two steps and stood there as if stunned swaying dazedly to and fro as rondheim advanced slowly the trace of a sadistic smile in the thin chiseled features pitt had made a mistake by ducking had almost given himself away by revealing his quick reflexes he had to fight to keep his mind turned on the rules it wasnt easy no normal man who knows how to take care of himself enjoys standing idle while being beaten to a pulp he gritted his teeth and waited holding his body low to absorb the blows from rondheims next attack he didnt wait but a few seconds rondheim scored with a roundhouse kick to the head that rammed pitt full in the face knocking him off the mat against a row of horizontal exercise bars set into the wall pitt lay on the floor in silence tasting the blood from his crushed lips and feeling his loosened teeth come come major rondheim spoke soothingly tauntingly up on your feet the lessons barely begun pitt pushed himself groggily to his feet and stumbled drunkenly onto the mat the urge to counterpunch rondheim was stronger than ever now but he knew his only course was to play out his role rondheim lost no time in working on him again a quick combination of sledgehammer blows to the head that never seemed to end followed by a front kick to the exposed rib area and pitt felt rather than heard one of his ribs snap as if in slow motion pitt sunk to his knees and slowly slumped forward onto his face so badly injured that blood and vomit mingled freely in his mouth and flowed onto the mat in an everwidening pool he didnt need a mirror to know he was being worked over fearfully his face distorted in grotesque mutilation both eyes rapidly closing lips ballooned in a purplish mass of torn meat one nostril of his nose split open the daggerlike pain in his chest and the agony of his torn face rose in giant waves and pounded him to the verge of blackness yet he was surprised to find his mind was still functioning normally instead of allowing the painless oblivion of unconsciousness to swoop in he willed himself to fake it setting his teeth against a groan that would have given his deception away rondheim was infuriated im not through with this slimy faggot he motioned to one of the guards revive him the one with the bald head walked to a nearby bathroom soaked a towel and none too gently wiped the blood from pitts face and then compressed the now reddened cloth behind his neck when pitt didnt respond the guard left again and returned with a small vial of smellin salts pitt coughed once twice then spit a gob of blood on the guards boot taking grim satisfaction that it was no accident he rolled over onto his side and looked up at rondheim looming over him rondheim laughed softly you seem to have difficulty staying awake in class major perhaps you are becoming bored his voice suddenly chilled stand up you have yet to finish yourahcourse of instruction course instruction pitts words came blurred semiintelligibly through his bloated broken lips i dont get what you mean rondheim answered by lifting his heel and jamming it in pitts groin pitts whole body shuddered and he groaned the agony tearing him apart rondheim spat on him i said stand up i i cant and then rondheim leaned down and struck pitt with a shuto blow to the back of the neck there was no fighting it no faking it this time pitt blacked out for real bring him around again rondheim yelled insanely i want him on his feet the guards stared uncomprehendingly even they were beginning to tire of rondheims bloody game but they had little choice except to work over pitt like a couple of trainers over a punchdrunk boxer until he emitted the barest signs of consciousness it didnt take a medical specialist to determine that pitt could have never stood unaided so the guards each with one arm held pitt up his body sagging between them with the dead weight of a wet bag of portland cement rondheim pounded the defenseless battered body until his gi was soaked through with sweat the front splotched with blood pitt in those tortured moments between light and darkness found himself losing his grip of any emotion of all intelligence even the pain was beginning to fade into one massive dull throb thank god for the brandy he thought hed never have been able to survive up to this point taking so much brutality from rondheims hands without reacting if it hadnt been for the alcohols numbing effects now he didnt need it his physical resources were nearly gone his mind was slipping from control losing contact with reality and the most terrible part was that he could do nothing about it rondheim threw a particularly vicious and accurately aimed kick to pitts stomach as the light passed from pitts eyes for the sixth time and the guards released their grip letting his limp body drop to the mat the sadistic lust on rondheims face slowly faded he stared vacantly at his bloody and swollen knuckles his chest heaving as his breath came in quick pants from the exertion he dropped to his knees grabbed pitt by the hair turning the head so that the throat was exposed and then he lifted his right hand palm open in preparation to deliver the finishing stroke the coup de grdce a killing judo chop that would snap pitts head backward breaking his neck no rondheim kept the hand poised and slowly turned kirsti fyrie stood in the doorway a look of fear and horror on her face no she said please no you cant rondheim kept the hand poised what does he mean to you nothing but he is a human being and deserves better you are cruel and ruthless oskar not altogether unbecoming qualities in a man but they should be tempered with courage beating a defenseless and halfdead man is little different from torturing a helpless child there is no courage in that you disappoint me rondheims hand slowly dropped he rose swaying tiredly and staggered to kirsti tearing the clothing from the upper part of her body he slapped her viciously across the breasts you warped whore he grasped i warned you never to interfere you who have no right to criticize me or anyone else its easy for you to sit by on your pretty ass and watch while i do the dirty work she lifted a hand to strike him her beautiful features contorted in hatred and anger he caught her wrist and held it twisting until she uttered a cry the basic difference between a man and a woman my dove is physical strength he laughed at her helplessness you seem to have forgotten that rondheim roughly pushed her out the door and turned to the guards throw that queer bastard in with the others he ordered if he is fortunate and opens his eyes once more he can have the satisfaction of knowing he died among friends chapter somewhere in the black pit of unconsciousness pitt began to see light it was vague dim like the bulb of a flashlight whose batteries were gasping out their last breath of energy he struggled toward it desperately he reached out once twice making several agonizing attempts to touch the yellow glow he knew was his window to the conscious world outside his mind but each time he thought it was within his grasp it moved further away and he knew he was slipping backward into the void of nothingness once more dead he thought vaguely im dead then he became aware of another force a sensation that shouldnt have been there it was coming through the void becoming stronger more intensified with each passing moment then he had it and he knew he was still among the living pain glorious tormenting pain it burst upon him in one crushing agonizing wave and he moaned oh thank you god thank you for bringing him back the voice it sounded miles away he pushed his mind into second gear and then it came again dirk its tidi there was a seconds silence a second in which pitt became increasingly aware of the brightening light and the stinging smell of pure fresh air and a soft arm tenderly cradled around his head his vision was blurred and distorted he could vaguely distinguish a dim form leaning over him he tried to speak but could do no more than groan mumble a few incoherent words and stare at the shadowy figure above it seems our major pitt is about to be reborn pitt could barely make out the words the voice wasnt from tidis lips that much he was certain the tone was too deep too masculine they worked him over pretty thoroughly said the unidentified voice better hed died without rezonaining consciousness judging from the looks of things none of us will live to see hell make it it was tidi again hes got to hes just got to dirk is our only hope hope hope pitt whispered dated a girl named hope once the agony in his side stabbed and twisted like whitehot iron but strangely his face felt nothing the tortured flesh was numb then he knew why knew why he saw only shadows his sight or at least thirty percent of it returned as tidi lifted a piece of thin damp fabric the nylon of her pantyhose from his face pitts torn and swollen features felt nothing because tidi had been constantly soaking the cuts and bruises in ice water from a nearby mud puddle to relieve the intense swelling the mere fact that pitt could see anything at all through the tiny slits around his bloated eyes attested to her successful efforts pitt focused his eyes with difficulty tidi was gazing down at him her long fawncolored hair framing a pale and anxious face then the other voice spoke and the tone was no longer strange did you get the license number of the truck major or was it a bulldozer that mashed your already ugly profile pitt turned his head and looked into the smiling but tightmuscled face of jerome p lillie would you believe a giant with muscles like tree trunks i suppose lillie said expectantly your next words will beif you think i look bad you should see the other guy youd be disappointed i didnt lay so much as a fingertip on him you didnt fight back i didnt fight back lillie showed pure astonishment you stood there and took took this terrible beating and did nothing oh will you two shut up tidis voice held a mixture of irritation and distress if any of us are to survive we must get dirk on his feet we cant just sit here and gossip pitt pulled himself to a sitting position and gazed in agony through a red haze of pain as his broken rib cried in protest the unthinking sudden movement made his side feel as if someone had squeezed his chest between a giant pair of pliers and twisted carefully gently he eased himself forward until he could see around him the sight that met his eyes looked like something out of a nightmare for a long moment he stared at the unreal scene and then at tidi and lillie his face a study of bewildered incomprehension then a shred of understanding crept into his head and with it some certainty of where he was he reached out a hand to steady himself and muttered to no one in particular my god its not possible for maybe ten seconds maybe twenty in one of those silences they refer to as pregnant pitt sat there as still and unmoving as a dead man staring at the broken helicopter a scant ten yards away the jagged remains of the hulk lay half sunk in mud at the bottom of a deep ravine whose walls rose in sharp sloping angles to seemingly come together and meet a hundred feet toward the iceland sky he noted that the shattered craft was large probably one of the titan class capable of carrying thirty passengers whatever colors or markings the copter may have been painted originally it was impossible to recognize them now most of the fuselage back of the cockpit was crumpled like a bellows the remaining framework a myriad of twisted metal pitts first frightful impression the one that ruled his confused mind was that no one from the crash could have survived but there they were pitt tidi lillie and scattered about the steep slopes of the ravine in unnatural paincontorted positions the same group of men who had stood beside pitt in rondheims trophy room the same group who had opposed f james kelly and hermit limited they all appeared to be alive but most were badly injured the grotesque angles of their arms and legs revealed a terrible array of smashed and broken bones sorry to ask the inescapable question pitt mumbled his voice hoarse though now under control but what in hell happened not what you think lillie replied what then its obvious rondheim was abducting all of us somewhere when the aircraft crashed we didnt crash lillie said the wreck has been here for days maybe even weeks pitt stared incredulously at lillie who seemed to be lying comfortably on the damp ground oblivious of the wetness soaking through his clothing youd better fill me in what happened to these people how did you come to be here everything not too much to my story lillie said quietly rondheims men caught me snooping around the albatross docks before i had a chance to uncover anything they hustled me off to rondheims house and threw me in with these other gentlemen pitt made a move toward lillie youre in pretty rough shape lets have a look impatiently lillie waved him back hear me out then get the hell away from here and get help no one is in immediate danger of dying from their injuriesrondheim saw to that our primary peril is exposure the temperature is under forty degrees now in another few hours it will be freezing after that the cold and the shock will take the first of us by morning there will be nothing in this goddamn ravine but frozen bodies rondheim saw to that im afraid you dont get it youre slow on the trigger major pitt its obvious the carnage you see here was never caused by accident immediately after our sadistic friend rondheim beat you to a pulp we were each given a heavy dose of nembutal and then very coldly and methodically he and his men took us one at a time and fractured whatever bones they thought were necessary to make it appear as though we were all injured in the crash of the helicopter pitt stared at lillie but said nothing totally off balance his mind was in a whirlpool of disbelief his thought desperately seeking to sort out a set of circumstances that defied comprehension the way he felt he would have been prepared to believe anything but lillies words were too macabre too monstrous to consider my god its not possible pitt screwed his eyes shut and shook his head in slow frustration it has to be some kind of insane nightmare nothing insane about the reason lillie assured him there is a method to kellys and rondheims madness how can you be sure im surei was the last one they put under the drugi overheard kelly explaining to sir eric marks how this whole unreal tragedy was conceived by hermit limiteds computers but for what purpose why the savagery kelly could have simply put us on another aircraft and dropped it over the ocean without a trace with no chance for survivors computers are a hard lot they only deal in cold facts lillie murmured wearily to their respective governments the men suffering around us are important figures you were at rondheims little party you heard kelly explain why they had to dietheir deaths are meant to be a diversion to buy time and to grab headlines and the attention of world leaders while hermit limited pulls off its coup without international interference pitts eyes narrowed that doesnt explain away the sadistic cruelty no it doesnt lillie admitted however in kellys eyes the end justifies the means a disappearance at sea was probably fed into the computers banks but undoubtedly rejected in favor of a sounder plan like producing the bodies at an opportune time in a sense yes lillie said slowly world focus on a disappearance at sea would have faded in a week or ten daysthe search would have obviously been called off since no one could live long floating in the frigid north atlantic of course pitt nodded the vanishing act of the lax was an ideal example exactly kelly and his rich friends need all the time they can buy to become entrenched in whatever country it is they intend to take over the longer our state department is diverted by the loss of highranking diplomats the harder it will be when they get around to putting the screws on hermit limiteds operations this way kelly can have the advantage of an extended search pitts voice was quiet but positive and when hope begins to grow dim he can arrange for an icelander to stumble accidentally on the crash site and the bodies and kelly can reap the advantage of an extra two weeks while the world mourns and government leaders are concentrating on speeches at the funeral processions every alternative was neatly considered we were all supposedly on a flight to rondheims northern estate for a day of salmon fishing his group the hermit limited bunch were going to come on the next flight at least thats the story that will be handed out whats to stop someone from accidentally discovering us at any moment tidi asked gently dabbing a trickle of blood from pitts swollen mouth its fairly obvious pitt said thoughtfully surveying the immediate surroundings we cant be seen unless that someone is standing practically on top of us add to that the fact were probably in the most uninhabited area of iceland and the odds of being found begin to stretch to infinity now you can clearly see the picture lillie said the helicopter had to be placed in the narrow confines of the ravine and then destroyed because it could not have been purposely crashed with any degree of accuracya perfect undetectable location a search plane directly overhead could have no more than a second to spot the debris a milliontoone chance at best the next step was to scatter our bodies around the area then after two or three weeks of decomposition the most a competent coroner could determine is that some of us died from injuries sustained from the phony crash and the rest from exposure and shock am i the only one who can walk pitt asked harshly his broken ribs ached like a thousand sores but the hopeful stares the miserable bit of optimism in the eyes of the men who knew death was only a few hours away forced him to ignore the pain a few can walk lillie answered but with broken arms theyll never make it to the top of the ravine then i guess im elected youre elected lillie smiled faintly if its any consolation you have the satisfaction of knowing rondheim is up against a tougher man than his computers projected the encouragement in lillies eyes became the extra impetus pitt needed he rose unsteadily to his feet and looked down at the figure lying stiffly on the ground where did rondheim bust you both shoulders andim guessingmy pelvis lillies tone was as calm as if he were describing the fractured surface of the moon kind of makes you wish you were back in st louis running the brewery doesnt it not really dear old dad never had much confidence in his only son if i if im not alive and kicking when you come back tell him read him the riot act yourself besides my heart wouldnt be in it pitt had to fight to keep his voice from faltering i never liked lillie beer anyway he turned away and knelt over tidi where did they hurt you dearheart my ankles are a little off center she smiled gamely nothing serious im just lucky i guess im sorry pitt said you wouldnt be lying here if it wasnt for my bungling she took his hand and squeezed it its more exciting than taking dictation and typing the admirals letters pitt bent over and lifted her in his arms and carried her tenderly a few feet and laid her beside lillie heres your big chance you little gold digger a real live millionaire and for the next few hours hes a captive audience mr jerome p lillie may i present miss tidi royal the darling of the national underwater marine agency may you both live happily ever after pitt kissed her lightly on the forehead stumbled awkwardly once more to his feet and walked unsteadily over the watersoaked ground to the old man he knew simply as sam he thought of the distinguished manner the warm piercing eyes he had seen in the trophy room as he stared down and saw the legs twisted outwards like the crooked branches of an oak tree the blue eyes dulled by pain and he forced himself to smile a confident hopeful smile hang in there sam pitt leaned over and gently grasped the old mans shoulder ill be back with the prettiest nurse in iceland before lunchtime sams lips gave the barest hint of a grin to a man my age a cigar would prove much more practical a cigar it is pitt leaned over and shook sams hand the blue eyes suddenly came to life and the old man raised up gripping pitts outstretched hand with an intensity that pitt didnt think was possible and the lines of the tired drawn face lightened into determined hardness he must be stopped major pitt the voice was low almost an insistent whisper james must not be allowed to go through with this terrible thing his purpose glories in goodness but the people he has surrounded himself with glory only in greed and power pitt only nodded without speaking i forgive james for what he has done sam was talking almost rambling to himself tell him his brother forgives my god pitts shock showed in his face youre brothers yes james is my younger brother i remained in the background these many years handling the financial details and problems that plague a giant multinational corporation james a master at wheeling and dealing enjoyed the center of attraction until now we were a pretty successful combination sam kelly bowed his head in a barely perceptible sign of farewell god bring you luck and then a smile slowly stretched across his face dont forget my cigar you can count on it pitt murmured he turned away his mind swirling with conflicting images and emotions then slowly clearing and settling on one permanent irresistible purpose that held his mental processes in a viselike grip the driving force the hatred that had been smoldering within him since rondheim lashed out with the first crippling blow now exploded into an intense burning flame that consumed his mind to the expulsion of all else but then his thoughts were pulled back to reality by the low voice of the russian diplomat tamareztov the heart of a good communist goes with you major pitt pitt barely paused to reply im honored its not often a communist has to rely on a capitalist to save his life it is not an easy pill to swallow pitt stopped and looked down at tamareztov in slow speculation noting the arms lying limply on the ground the unnatural angle of the left leg then his face softened if you promise not to hold any party indoctrination lectures while im gone ill bring you back a bottle of vodka tamareztov stared back at pitt curiously a display of yankee humor major but i think you really mean what you say about the vodka a grin touched the corners of pitts lips dont misread my intentions since im already taking a short walk to the corner liquor store i merely thought id save you the trip then before the uncomprehending russian could reply pitt turned and began climbing the embankment toward the top of the ravine cautiously at first a few inches at a time trying to move at a pace that favored his cracked ribs pitt clawed at the soft slippery earth and pulled himself upward without looking in any direction except straight ahead the first twenty feet were easy then the slope steepened and the soil became more firm making it difficult to dig the shallow hand and toeholds which afforded his only source of support the climb itself became a purgatory unctuated by the agony of his injuries all emotion had drained away his movements became mechanical dig and pull dig and pull he tried to keep count of each foot gained but lost track after thirty his mind totally void of all mental function he was like a blind man moving through the daylight in a blind world and the only sense he still possessed was the sense of touch then for the first time fear came to himnot fear of falling or fear of injury but the honest cold fear of failing over twenty people whose lives depended on his reaching that line between earth and sky that seemed so far above him minutes passed that seemed like hours how many he didnt know would never know time as a means of measurement no longer existed his body was simply a robot going through repeated motions without the benefit of constant commands from the mind he began counting again only this time he stopped at ten then one minute of rest he told himself no more and he began again his breath was coming in heaving gulps now his fingers were raw the ends of the nails jagged and spotted with blood his arm muscles aching from the continuous efforta sure sign his body was about spent sweat trickled down his face but the irritating tickle could not be felt through his agonized flesh he paused and looked up seeing little through the swollen slits that were his eyes the edge of the ravine blended into a nebulous line of angles and shadowy profiles that defied any judgment of distance and then suddenly almost with a sense of surprise pitts hands found the soft crumbling edge of the slope with strength he didnt think was possible he pulled himself up onto flat ground and rolled over on his back laying inert and to all appearances dead for nearly five minutes pitt lay rigid only his chest moving with the pulsating rise and fall of his breath slowly as the waves of total exhaustion receded to a level of sufferable tolerance he pulled himself to his feet and peered into the bottom of the narrow chasm at the tiny figures below he cupped his hands to yell then decided against it there were no words he could think of to shout that had any meaning any encouragement all the people below could see was his head and shoulders over the level of the steep cliff then with a wave of the hand he was gone chapter pitt stood like a solitary tree on a great empty plain a dark green mosslike vegetation spread in every direction as far as he could see edged on one horizon by a range of high hills and cloaked by a sunwhitened mist on two others except for a few small rises dotting the desolate landscape most of the ground was nearly flat at first he thought he was completely alone but then he saw a tiny snipe that soared across the sky like a dart in search of an unseen target it came closer and from a height of two hundred feet it circled and looked down at pitt as if curiously inspecting the strange animal that stood out so vividly in red and yellow plumage against the center of the unending green carpet after three cursory sweeps the little birds inquisitiveness waned and it fluttered its wings against the air and continued on its seeming flight to nowhere as if perceiving the birds thoughts pitt stared down at his offbeat clothing and murmured vaguely to himself ive heard of being all dressed up with no place to go but this is ridiculous the sound of his voice suddenly woke him up to the fact that his mind was working again he felt the relief that was due from overcoming the exhausting climb from the ravine the high elation of being alive and the hope of finding help before the people below died from the nearfreezing temperatures jubilantly he struck out across the tundra toward the distant hills fifty feet no further that was as far as pitt got when it abruptly hit him he was lost the sun was high above the skyline there were no stars to guide him north south east and west were words that meant nothing had no definition in terms of measurement or accuracy once he entered the mist that was crawling across the land toward him he would have no guideline no landmarks to take a sight on he was lost adrift without any sense of direction for once that cold damp morning he didnt feel the grip of fear it wasnt that he knew fear would cloud his thoughts confuse his reasoning he was consumed with sharp anger that he should have been so beautifully tricked into complacency so ignorantly unaware that he was stumbling to his death every contingency the computers of hermit limited his archenemy had mechanically figured on every contingency the stakes were too high in the murderous game that kelly rondheim and their group of incredibly ruthless business associates were playing but he swore to himself that he wasnt going to be forced to land on boardwalk and pay a rent he couldnt afford without passing go he stopped sat down and took stock it didnt take any great ingenious deduction to determine that he was sitting somewhere in the middle of the uninhabited part of iceland he tried to remember what little he had learned about the eden of the north atlantic what few facts he bad absorbed when studying the flight maps on board the catawaba the island stretched one hundred ninety miles from north to south he recalled and nearly three hundred miles from east to west since the shortest distance between two points was north and south the other two directions were eliminated if he traveled south there was every possibility that he would run onto the vatnajbkull ice mass not only icelands but europes largest glacier a great frozen wall that would have signaled the end of every thing north it was he decided the logic behind his decision bordered on the primitive but there was another reason a compelling urge to outsmart the computers by traveling in the direction least expected a direction that offered the least obvious chance of success the average man in similar circumstances would have probably headed toward reykjavik the largest sprawl of civilization far to the west and south that is undoubtedly he hoped what the computers had been programmed forthe average man now he had an answer but it was only half an answer which way was north even if he knew for certain he had no means to follow it along a straight line the accepted fact that a man who was righthanded would eventually make a great arc to his right without any landmarks to guide him came back to haunt pitts thoughts the whine of the jet engines interrupted his reverie and he looked up holding his hand to shield his eyes from the glare of the cobalt blue sky sighting a commercial airliner cruising serenely ahead of its long white contrails pitt could only wonder at the aircrafts course it could have been heading anywhere west to reykjavik east to norway southeast to london there was no way to tell for certain unless he had a compass a compass the word lingered in his mind savored like the thought of an icecold beer by a man dying of thirst in the middle of the mojave desert a compass a simple piece of magnetic iron mounted on a pivot and floating in a mixture of glycerin and water then a light suddenly clicked on deep in the recesses of his brain a longforgotten bit of outdoor lore hed learned many years before during a fourday hike in the sierras with his old boy scout troop began to break through the fogshrouded barrier of time it took him nearly ten minutes of searching before he found a small pool of water trapped in a shallow depression beneath a domeshaped hill quickly as dexterously as his raw and bleeding fingers would allow pitt unclasped the brown sash and tore off the pin that held it in place wrapping one end of the long silk material around his knee he knelt and pulled it taut with his left hand and with his right began stroking the pin from head to tip in a single direction against the silk building friction and magnetizing the tiny piece of metal the cold was increasing now creeping into hissweatsoaked clothes and forcing a spasm of shivers to grip his body the pin slipped through his fingers and he spent useless minutes probing the mossy ground cover until he discovered the little silver sliver by accidentally running it a quarter of an inch under a fingernail he was almost thankful for the pain as it meant there was still feeling in his hands he kept pushing the pin back and forth across the silk careful not to let it slip through his fingers again when he felt satisfied that further friction would add nothing more he rubbed the pin over his forehead and nose covering it with as much skin oil as it could hold then he took two slender bits of thread from the lining of his red jacket and doubled them loosely around the pin the tricky part of the operation was yet to come so pitt relaxed for a moment flexing his fingers and massaging them much like a piano player preparing to tackle chopins minute waltz feeling he was ready he gingerly picked up the two loops and with painstaking slowness lowered the pin into the calm little pond holding a deep breath pitt watched the water bend under the weight of the metal then ever so gently his fingers cautiously slid the threads apart until the pin swam by itself kept afloat by the oil and the surface tension of the water only a child at christmastime staring wideeyed at an array of gifts under the tree could have experienced the same feeling of wonder that pitt did that moment as he sat entranced and watched that crazy little pin swing leisurely in a half circle until its head pointed toward magnetic north he sat there unmoving for a full three minutes staring at his makeshift compass almost afraid that if he blinked his eyes it would sink and disappear lets see your goddamned computer come up with that one pitt murmured to the empty air a tenderfoot might have impatiently started running in the direction the pin pointed mistaken in the assumption that a compass always faithfully aims its point toward true north pitt knew that the only place where a compass would unerringly indicate the north pole was a small area in the great lakes between the united states and canada where by chance the north and magnetic poles come into line as an experienced navigator he was also aware that the magnetic pole lay somewhere beneath prince of wales island above hudson bay approximately one thousand miles below the arctic pole and only a few hundred miles above iceland that meant that the pin was pointing a few degrees north of west pitt figured his compass declination at about eighty degrees a rough guess at best but at least he was certain that north now stood at a near right angle to the head of the pin pitt took his bearing and picked the rudimentary compass needle out of the water and started walking into the mist he hadnt covered a hundred yards when he could taste the blood springing from the open cuts on his inner lips the teeth loosened in his gums and with all he had already suffered the pain inaugurated by rondheims kick to the groin which made it impossible for him to walk without a heavy limping gait he forced himself to keep going to cling tenaciously to the thread of consciousness the ground was rough and uneven and he soon lost count of the number of times he stumbled and fell wrapping his arms around his chest in a vain attempt to deaden the torture from the cracked ribs luck stayed with him and the mist disappeared after an hour and a half offering him a chance to take advantage of the many hot springs he passed and orient his bearings with the compass pin now he could line up a landmark to the north and keep shifting from one landmark to the next until he was sure he was straying then he would stop and take another compass reading and begin the process over again two hours became three three hours became four each minute was an infinite unit of misery and suffering of aching cold of intense burning pain of fighting for control of his mind time melted into an eternity which pitt knew might not end until he fell against the soft damp grass for the last time in spite of his determination he began to have doubts that he would live through the next few hours one step in front of the other an endless cycle that slowly pushed pitt further and further into total exhaustion his thoughts had no room now for anything but the next landmark and when he reached it he concentrated every ounce of his sinking energy on the next one logic was nearly nonexistent only when he heard a muted alarm going off somewhere in the dim corners of his brain warning him that he was straying off course did he stop at a steaming sulfur pool to regain a heading with his compass even twelve hours ago to pitt seemed like twelve years then his reflexes had been razoredged honed and pointed for any necessary mental command but now as he set the pin in the water his trembling hands failed him and the ingenious little compass supped beneath the surface and shot to the bottom of the deep crystalclear pool pitt had time to grab it before it sank out of reach but he could only sit there and stare transfixed for wasted seconds before he reacted to the setback then it was too late far too late for his hope for finding his way out of icelands barren island plateau was lost his puffed eyes were almost totally closed his legs cramped from exhaustion and his breath coming in agonized gasps that broke the clear still air but he struggled to his feet and stumbled forward urged on by an inner strength he didnt know existed for the next two hours he blundered along in a void all of his own then in the middle of climbing a small eightfoot embankment his body turned off the switch to consciousness and collapsed like a deflated balloon just inches from the top of the ridge pitt knew he had crossed over the threshold from physical sensibility to the inertness of twilight sleep but something didnt quite jell his body was dead all pain was gone all feeling even human emotion seemingly had died yet he could still see though his total panorama consisted only of grasscovered ground no more than a few inches in front of his eyes and he could hear his ears relayed a throbbing sound to a numbed brain that refused to relay any explanation as to the cause or the distance from which the strange coughing beat came then suddenly there was silence the sound had died away leaving only the vision of green blades wavering slightly in a whispering breeze something in the desolation over which he had stumbled was out of context the superhuman courageous effort had been wasted the responsibility to the people back in the freezing ravine now evaporated into the empty atmosphere pitt was past caring or knowing or sensing now he could relinquish his hold on life and peacefully die under the cold norse sun it would have been so easy to let go and fall into the black pit of no return except for something that didnt belong in the picture an illusion that shattered the whole conception of death a pair of boots two worn leather boots standing in front of pitts unseeing eyes where only a moment before was an empty plot of wild grass and then phantom hands rolled him over on his back and he became aware of a face framed by the vacant skya stern face with seablue eyes gray hair flowed around a broad forehead like the helmet on a warrior in a flemish painting an old man aged somewhere beyond seventy years wearing a worn turtleneck sweater bent and touched pitts face then without saying a word with surprising strength for a man of his years he lifted pitt up and carried him over the rise through the cobwebs of his mind pitt began to wonder at the sheer coincidence the miracle which indeed it was that led to his discovery no more than one easy stride over the small summit lay a road he had fallen within spitting distance of a small dirt road that paralleled a tumbling glacial river of white froth rushing swiftly through a narrow gorge of black lava rock yet the sound pitts ears had detected came not from the roar of the falling water but from the exhaust of an engine belonging to a battered dustcovered britishmade jeep like a child placing a doll in a highchair the old icelander set pitt in the front passenger seat of the jeep then he climbed behind the wheel and steered the rugged little vehicle over the winding road stopping every so often to open a closed cattle gate an operation that became routine as they entered a section of rolling hills divided by lush green meadows bursting with plovers that clouded the sky at the approach of the jeep they stopped in front of a small farmhouse with white sideboards and a red roof pitt shrugged off the supporting hands and staggered into the living room of the comfortable little house a telephone quickly i need a telephone the blue eyes narrowed you are english the icelander asked slowly in a heavy nordic accent american pitt answered impatiently there are two dozen seriously injured people out there who will die if we dont get help to them soon there are others on the plateau there was no concealing the astonishment yes yes pitt nodded his head violently god man the phone where do you keep it the icelander shrugged helplessly the nearest telephone lines are forty kilometers away a great tidal wave of despair swept over pitt only to ebb and vanish at the strangers next words however i have a radio transmitter he motioned to a side room please this way pitt followed him into a small welllit but spartan room the three primary pieces of furniture being a chair a cabinet and an ancient handcarved table holding a gleaming transmitter not more than a few months from manufacture pitt could only marvel at the latest equipment being used in an isolated farmhouse the icelander crossed hurriedly to the transmitter sat down and began twisting the array of dials and knobs he switched the radio to send selected the frequency and picked up the microphone he spoke a few words rapidly in icelandic and waited nothing came back over the speaker he shifted the transmitting frequency fractionally and spoke again this time a voice answered almost immediately the pressure of the race against death made pitt as tense as a guy wire in a hurricane gale and in total indifference to his pain and fatigue he paced the floor while his benefactor conversed with the reykjavik authorities after ten minutes of explanation and translation pitt requested and received a call from the american embassy where in the goddamned hell have you been sandeckers voice exploded over the speaker so loudly that it might have come from the doorway waiting for a streetcar walking in the park pitt snapped back it makes no difference how soon before a team of medics can be assembled and in the air there was a tense silence before the admiral answered there was he knew a tone of urgent insistence in pitts voice a tone sandecker had seldom heard from pitts lips i can have a team of air force paramedics ready to load in thirty minutes he said slowly would you mind telling me the reason behind your request for a medical unit pitt didnt answer immediately his thoughts were barely able to focus he nodded thankfully as the icelander offered him the chair every minute we waste with explanations someone may die for gods sake admiral pitt implored contact the air force and get their paramedics loaded on helicopters and supplied to aid victims of an air disaster then while theres time i can fill you in on the details understood sandecker said without wasting a word stand by pitt nodded again this time to himself and slumped dejectedly in the chair it wont be long now he thought if only theyre in time he felt a hand on his shoulder half turned and managed a crooked smile up at the warmeyed icelander ive been a rude guest he said quietly i havent introduced myself or thanked you for saving my life the old man offered a long weathered hand golfur andursson he said i am chief guide for the rarfur river pitt gritped andurssons hand and introduced himself and then asked a chief guide yes a guide is also the river warden we act as guides for fishermen and watch over the ecology of the river much like a conservationist in your own country who protects the natural resoarces of your inland water grounds it must be lonely work pitts mouth stopped working and he gasped as a sharp pain in his chest nearly carried him into blackness he clutched the table fighting to remain conscious come andursson said you must let me tend to your injuries no pitt answered firmly i must stay by the radio im not leaving this chair andursson hesitated then he shook his head and said nothing he disappeared from the room and returned in less than two minutes carrying a large firstaid case and a bottle you are lucky he said smiling one of your countrymen fished the river just last month and left this with me he held up and proudly displayed a fifth of seagrams vo canadian whiskey pitt noticed that the seal on the cap had not been broken pitt was on his fourth healthy swig and the old river warden had just finished binding his chest when the radio crackled and sandeckers gravel voice broke into the room again major pitt do you read me pitt lifted the microphone and pressed the transmitting switch pitt here i read you admiral the paramedics are mustering at keflavik and icelands civilian search and rescue units are standing by ill maintain radio contact and coordinate their efforts there was a momentary silence you have a lot of worried people here keflavik has no report of a missing plane either military or commercial rondheim wasnt taking any chances pitt thought the bastard was taking his own sweet time about reporting his overdue and missing guests pitt breathed deeply and took another shot of the vo then he replied notification isnt scheduled yet total uncomprehension broke in sandeckers voice come again please repeat trust me admiral i cant even begin to answer a tenth of the questions that must be running through everyones mind especially over the radio repeatespecially over the radio somehow pitt thought the names of the internationally known men back in the ravine had to be kept from the news services for at least the next thirtysix hours time enough to stop kelly rondheim and hermit limited before they could be warned and go underground he had to give the admiral credit sandecker caught pitts implication of the need for secrecy almost immediately your message is understood can you give me the location use your reverse coordination map sorry i know of no such dammit sandecker shouted turning the speaker into a thunderbolt of distorted static do as youre ordered pitt sat and stared dumbly at the radios speaker for nearly thirty seconds before sandeckers hidden meaning began to register in his weary mind the admiral was offering him a chance to answer questions without giving away valid information by replying in the contrary he mentally kicked himself for letting sandecker outdo him in the verbal gymnastics pitt flicked off the mike switch and turned to andursson how far is the nearest town and in what direction andursson vaguely pointed out the window sodafoss we are exactly fifty kilometers south of its town square pitt quickly added to the icelanders figure to allow for the distance he had stumbled across the plateau back to the radio the aircraft came down approximately eighty kilometers north of sodafoss i repeat eighty kilometers north of sodafoss was the aircraft civilian or military military how many survivors cant say for certain two maybe four pitt could only hope the admiral would grasp the total number of twentyfour the feisty old oceanographer didnt fail him let us hope we can have them safe and sound by this time tomorrow sandeckers intimation of twentyfour hours quickly settled any doubt he paused and then his voice came through low quiet with a strong inflection of concern is miss royal with you yes sandecker didnt reply immediately pitt could almost see the sudden paling almost hear the sudden intake of breath then the admiral said has she has she given you any trouble pitt thought a moment trying to piece together the right words you know how women are admiral always complaining first it was an imaginary ache in her ankles now she claims shes freezing to death ill be eternally grateful if you use all haste in taking this griping female off my hands will do all possible at this end to grant your request the gravellike tone was back now stand by pitt hummed softly to himself this was taking too much time each minute was precious each second irreplaceable he looked at his watch exactly one oclockseven hours since he crawled out of the ravine he felt a sudden chill and took another swallow from the bottle the radio crackled again major pitt come in admiral we have a problem here every helicopter on the island is grounded the paramedics will have to be airdropped from a transport do you understand it is imperative that helicopters be used the survivors must be airlifted out and most important admiral i must lead the searchrepeati must lead the search the crash site is invisible from the air your rescue party could search for days and never find it pitt could sense the gloom at the other end sandecker took a long time in answering then he spoke wearily defeated as if he were delivering the last rites which indeed he very nearly was negative to your request there are seven copters on the island three belong to the air force four to the icelandic search and rescue department all are grounded due to maintenance problems sandecker paused then went on slowly the possibility seems remote but our people and the government authorities smell sabotage oh christ pitt murmured and suddenly his blood ran cold every contingency the term came back to haunt him again and again kellys computers had built the wau ever higher against hope of rescue rondheims coldly efficient gang of killers had carried out the mechanical commands to the letter do you have enough flat ground for a light plane to land and pick you up sandecker probed expectantly if affirmative you could direct a rescue drop from the air a small plane might make it pitt said i have a level meadow here the length of a football field outside unnoticed by pitt the sun a perfect orange disk in the northern latitudes was being rapidly overtaken by great rolling black clouds that soon surrounded and cut off its bright glow a chilling breeze had sprung up and was bending the grass in the meadows and hills pitt became aware of andurssons hand on his shoulder and the sudden dimming light in the room at the same time a storm from the north andursson said solemnly it will snow withiin the hour pitt threw back the chair and hurriedly crossed the room to a small double window he stared through the glass his eyes unbelieving and he struck his fist against the wall in despair god no he whispered it would be suicidal for the paramedics to parachute through a blinding snowstorm nor could a light plane fly through the turbulence andursson said i have seen the coming of many northerns and have known their ferocity this will be a bad one pitt weaved drunkenly back to the radio and collapsed in the chair he held his cut and swollen face in his hands and muttered softly god save them god save all of them now hopeless hopeless sandecker came over the radio but pitt sat unhearing your exact position major can you give me your exact position andursson reached over pitt and took the microphone one minute admiral sandecker he said firmly please stand by he took pitts right hand and gripped it hard major pitt you must control your mind he looked down his eyes bright with compassion the knot of death though it be bound like stone may be unravelled by he who knows the frail strand pitt slowly looked up into andurssons eyes so i have another poet on my hands andursson simply nodded his head shyly this has certainly been my week for poets pitt sighed then he swore softly to himself he had already spent far too much time in needless talk and useless pity and time was running short he needed a plan a device a gimmick to reach those who put their trust in him computers make mistakes he told himself those cold electronic monsters can make an erroran error that may be infinitesimal but none the less the possibility exists there is no emotion built into their wiring no sentiment no room for nostalgia nostalgia pitt said out loud rolling the word on his tongue savoring every syllable repeating it at least three more times andursson stared at him strangely i do not understand youll soon see pitt said im not waiting to find the frail strand in your poetic knot of death iming to cut it with blades the old man looked more lost than ever blades yes propeller blades three of them to be exact chapter there are many wondrous sights to behold in this world but to pitt nothing not even a thirtystory rocket blasting into outer space or a needlenosed supersonic transport streaking across the sky at twice the speed of sound could ever look half as incredibly beautiful as that old ford trimotor the famed tin goose pitching and rolling awkwardly in the fitful wind curtained by the black folds of giant menacing clouds braced against the increasing gale he watched intently as the ancient aircraft graceful in its ugliness circled andurssons farm once before the pilot eased back on the throttles skimmed less than ten feet over a fence and set it down in the meadow where the wideset landing wheels rolled to a complete stop in less than two hundred feet from touchdown pitt turned to andursson well goodby golfur thank you for all youve done for me for all of us golfur andursson shook pitts hand it is i who thank you major for the honor and opportunity to help my fellow brother god go with you pitt couldnt run his cracked ribs wouldnt permit that but he covered the distance to the trimotor in less than thirty seconds just as he reached the right side of the fuselage the door flew open and a strong arm reached down and pulled him into the cramped narrow cabin are you major pitt pitt looked into the face of a great bull of a man tanfaced with long blond sideburns yes im pitt welcome back to the roaring twenties major this is a helluva idea using this old flying fossil for a rescue mission he held out his hand im captain ben hull pitt took the massive paw and said best we move out if we expect to beat the snow right you are hull boomed briskly no sense in getting ticketed for overparking if hull was mildly shocked at pitts damaged face or his strangelooking clothes he concealed it well we ranthis trip without a copilot a reserved seat in your name major figured youd want front row balcony to lead us to the wreck before i signed off i asked admiral sandecker for a couple of items got news for you major that old sea dog carries a big mean stick seems he pulled every plug to get them on board before we took off he pulled a package from his parka and raised an inquiring eyebrow beats the hell out of me why youd want a bottle of russian vodka and a box of cigars at a moment like its for a couple of friends pitt said sniffing he turned and made his way past ten men ranged in various relaxed positions along the floor of the cabinlarge quiet purposefullooking men dressed in arctic weather gear they were men who were ed in scuba diving parachute jumping survival and nearly every phase of emergency medicine except surgery a wave of confidence surged through pitt just from observing them ducking his head to clear the low cockpit door pitt moved into the cramped confines and eased his sore body into the worn and cracked leather bucket seat sitting vacant on the copilots side as soon as he was safely strapped in he turned and found himself staring into the grinning face of sergeant sam cashman howdy major cashmans eyes widened god amighty who stomped on your face tell you over a drink sometime pitt glanced at the instrument panel quickly familiarizing himself with the oldfashioned gauges im a bit surprised to see to see a sergeant flyin this mission instead of a genuine flight officer cashman bed you got no choice major ahim the only one on the whole island whos checked out on this old bus aint she a winner shell take off and land on a dollar bill and give you change okay sergeant youre in command now lets swing this bird into the wind and get her up bear due west along the river until i tell you to cut south cashman merely nodded deftly he jockeyed the tin goose on a hundredandeightydegree turn until it faced into the wind at the far side of the meadow then he shoved the three throttles forward and sent the lumbering old airliner bouncing and shuddering on its way ever closer to the fence on the opposite end of the field no more than three hundred feet away as they lurched past the front of golfur andurssons little house with the planes tail wheel still glued to the ground pitt began to have a vague idea of what charles lindberghs thoughts must have been when he urged his heavily laden spirit of st louis off the muddy runway of roosevelt field back in it seemed impossible to pitt that any aircraft short of a helicopter or light twoseater could leave the earth in so small a space he shot a fast look at cashman and saw only icy calmness and total relaxation cashman was indifferently whistling a tune but pitt couldnt quite make out the melody above the roar of the trio of twohundredhorsepower engines there was no doubt pitt reflected cashman certainly displayed the image of a man who knew how to handle a plane especially this one with twothirds of the meadow gone cashman eased the control column forward and lifted the tail wheel and then pulled back floating the plane a few feet above the turf then to pitts horror cashman suddenly dropped the trimotor back hard on the ground no more than fifty feet in front of the fence pitts horror turned to amazement as cashman jerked the controls back against his chest and literally bounced the old tin goose over the fence and threw it into the air where in hell did you learn that little trick pitt said exhaling a great sigh of relief it was then he recognized the tune cashman was whistling as the theme from the old movie those magnificent men in their flying machines used to be a crop duster in oklahoma cashman replied how did you wind up as a mechanic in the air force one day the junker ah was flyin developed a nasty cough plowed up a farmers pasture and butchered his champion beef sire years before its time everybody in the county was out to sue me ah was flat broke so ah split the scene and enlisted pitt couldnt help smiling as he peered through the windshield at the river two hundred feet below from that height he could easily spot the sloping ridge where andursson had found him he saw something now he didnt expect to find almost imperceptibly he became aware of a long even line against the landscape that trailed off toward the south he pushed open the little side window and looked again it was there all right the dark shade of green against the lighter tinted tundra his footprints where they had sunk into the soft vegetation had left a path that was easy to follow as the white line down the center of a highway pitt caught cashmans eye and motioned earthward to the south follow that dark trail to the south cashman banked the plane and stared for a moment out the side window then he cocked his head in acknowledgment and turned the nose of the trimotor southward fifteen minutes later he could only wonder at the unerring trail pitt had made during his trek to the river except for a few occasional deviations around rough or uneven ground the manmade mark on the earth was almost as straight as a plumb line fifteen minutes that was all the old antique needed to cover the same distance that had taken pitt several hours i have it now pit shouted there that cracklike depression where my path ends where do you want me to set her down major parallel to the ran of the ravine theres a flat area running about five hundred feet east and west the sky was darkening by the momentdarkening with the mist of falling snow even as cashman made his landing approach the first flakes began dotting the windshield streaking to the edges of the glass before being blown into the sky by the airstream pitts race had been won but only by the barest of margines cashman made a safe landing a smooth landing considering the rugged terrain and the difficult wind conditions he timed his run so that the cabin door of the trimotor ended up within ten yards of the steep dropoff the wheels had hardly rolled to a halt when pitt leaped from the plane and was stumbling sliding to the bottom of the ravine behind him hulls men began methodically unloading supplies and arranging them on the dampening ground two of the paramedics uncoiled ropes and threw them down the slopes in preparation of bringing up the survivors pitt ignored all this he had one driving desire to be the first into that chilling pit of hell he came upon lillie still stretched out on his back with tidi huddled over him his head cradled in her arms she was talking to lillie saying words pitt couldnt understand her voice no more than a weak hoarse whisper she seemed to be trying her best to smile but her lips barely curved in a pitiful grimace and there was little pleasantry in either the voice or the eyes pitt walked up behind her and gently touched her wetstreaked hair it seems you two have become rather close friends tidi twisted around and stared dazedly at the figure standing over her good lord youve come back she reached out and touched his hand i thought i heard an airplane oh god this is wonderful youve come back yes pitt smiled faintly then nodded at lillie how is he i dont know she said wearily i just dont know he slipped into unconsciousness about half an hour ago pitt knelt down and listened to lillies breathing it was slow and steady hell make it this guy has guts ten miles long the big question is whether hell ever walk again tidi pressed her face against pitts hand and began to sob her breath coming in convulsive shudders the shock the pain and the relief washing over her in rolling waves he held her tightly saying nothing he was still holding her shivering body and stroking her hair as the would a little girl when captain huh approached take the girl first pitt said her ankles are broken my men have set up an aid tent above the slopes theres a stove warming in it now shell be comfortable there until the icelandic search and rescue team can transport her to reykjavik hull wiped his eyes tiredly their crosscountry vehicles are homing in on our radio signals now cant you airlift her out hull shook his head sorry major that old trimotor can only carry eight stretcher cases on one trip im afraid the first load will have to be the most critically injured this is one occasion where the ladies will have to go last he nodded down at lillie how bad is this one fractured shoulders and pelvis two of hulls men appeared carrying an aluminum basket stretcher take the man first he ordered and see that you handle him gently this one is a back injury the paramedics carefully eased lillies inert form into the stretcher and attached the ropes for the ascent to the treacherous ravine pitt couldnt help but be impressed and thankful for the efficiency and smoothness of the lifting lines just three minutes later hull had returned for tidi okay major ill take the little lady handle her with care captain she happens to be admiral sandeckers private secretary apparently nothing startled hull for long the surprise only flickered in his eyes for an instant well well he boomed in that case ill escort the lady myself hull tenderly picked tidi up in his massive arms and carried her to a waiting basket then true to his word he climbed along beside her all the way to the top of the slope and saw her comfortably bedded down inside the warm tent before he returned to direct the rescue operation pitt pulled the package from under his arm and moved slowly across the broken bottom of the ravine until he stood over the russian diplomat mr tamareztov how are you getting along a russian relishes the cold major pitt he cupped a small handful of snow that had fallen across his chest moscow would not be moscow without a season of snow to me it is the same as desert sand to an arab a curse that is part of ones very existence are you in pain an old bolshevik never admits to pain a pity pitt said a pity tainareztov repeated he looked at pitt suspiciously yes i was about to offer you a little something thats guaranteed to relieve discomfort caused by hay fever headache and indigestion more yankee humor major pitt let a slight grin touch his face yankee sarcasm he said the prime reason why were so often misunderstood by people of other countries the average american has a sarcastic streak down his back that defies intellicent comprehension he sat down next to tamareztov and produced the bottle of vodka for example you before you the fruits of my trip to the corner liquor store tamareztov could only stare incredulously a promise made is a promise kept pit cradled the injured russians head and tilted the bottle to the mans lips here drink some of this tamareztov easily drained a quarter of the bottle before pitt eased it away he nodded his head and mumbled his thanks then his eyes took on a warm penetrating expression domestic true soviet domestic how in the world did you manage that he asked pitt tucked the bottle in tamareztovs armpitit was on sale he said then he rose and turned to leave major pitt yes thank you tamareztov said simply he was white with snow lying there vacantly staring at the clouds when pitt found him his face calm and serene had the expression of a man untouched by pain a man who was happy and content and at last at peace with himself a medic was bending over examining him heart pitt asked softly somehow afraid he might wake him considering his age thats as safe a bet as any sir the medic turned and motioned to hull who was standing but a few feet away shall we evacuate him now captain leave him lay hull said its our job to save the living this man is dead as long as there is a chance to keep any one of these people from joining him our attention must go to them youre right of course pitt said wearily this is your show captain hulls tone softened you know this man sir i wish i had known him better his name is sam kelly the name obviously meant nothing to hull y dont you let us take you topside major youre in a pretty bad way yourself pitt reached over no ill stay with sam here and gently closed kellys eyes for the final time and lightly brushed the snowflakes from the old wrinkled face then he took a cigar he recognized as sandeckers special brand from the box and slipped it into kellys breast pocket hull stood unmoving for nearly a minute groping for words he started to say something but thought better of it and instead simply nodded his head in silent understanding then he turned and plunged back to work sandecker closed the file and put it down and leaned forward as if he were about to spring if youre asking for my permission the answer is an unequivocal no you plac me in an awkward position admiral the words came from a man who sat facing sandecker he was short and seemed almost as broad as the chair he wore a nondescript black suit with a white shirt decorated by a black silk tie unconsciously every so often he ran his hand over a bald head as if searching for hair that once might have existed and he peered through gray eyes that never blinked under sandeckers blazing stare i had sincerely hoped we would have no disagreement however since that is not to be i must inform you that my presence here is purely an act of courtesy i already possess the orders for major pitts reassignment by whose authority sandecker asked they were signed by the secretary of defense the other man replied matteroffactly you wouldnt mind showing me the orders sandecker said he was playing his last pawn and he knew it very well his opponent sighed he reached into his briefcase and pulled out a set of papers and handed them to sandecker silently the admiral read the orders then his lips twisted in a wry smile i didnt really stand a chance did i no you didnt sandecker looked down at the papers in his hands again and shook his head youre asking too much too much i dont enjoy this sort of thing but time is a commodity we cant afford this whole scheme a naive scheme spawned by hermit limited is totally impractical i admit it sounds inspiring and all that save the world build a paradise who knows maybe f james kelly has the answer for the future but at the moment he is the leader of a gang of maniacs who have murdered nearly thirty people and exactly ten hours from now he plans to assassinate two heads of state our course is determined by one elementary facthe must be stopped and major pitt is the only one who is physically capable of recognizing kellys hired killers sandecker threw the papers on the desk physically capable nothing but goddamned words that have no feeling he pushed himself from the chair and began pacing the room youre asking me to order a man who has been like a son to me a man who has been beaten within an inch of death to get up from a hospital bed and track down a gang of vicious killers six thousand miles from here sandecker shook his head you dont know the half of what youre demanding from human flesh and blood there are limits to a mans courage dirk has already done far more than was expected of him granted that courage is reduced by expenditure and i agree that the major has done more than was thought humanly possible god knows there are few if any of my men who could have pulled that rescue off it could be were arguing over nothing sandecker said pitt may not be in any condition to leave the hospital im afraid your fears or should i say your hopes are groundless the bald man checked through a brown folder i have here a few observations from my agents who by the way have been guarding the major he paused reading then went on excellent physique constitution like a bull unique rapport with ah the nurses fourteen hours of rest intensive care and massive vitamin injections plus the finest muscle therapy known by the top doctors in iceland he has been stitched massaged and taped fortunately the only major damage was to his ribs and at that the fractures were minor all in all hes a sorry mess but i cant be particular id take him if they were lowerin him into a coffin sandeckers face was cold and blank he turned as one of the embassy secretaries poked her head around a door major pitt is here sir sandecker glared at the fat man surprise edged into his voice you bastard you knew all along he would do it the fat man shrugged and said nothing sandecker stiffened his eyes looked resentfully into the fat mans okay send him in pitt came through the door and shut it behind him he moved stiffly across the room to a vacant sofa and very slowly eased into the soft cushions his entire face was swathed in bandages only the slits for his eyes and nose plus the top opening for a patch of black hair gave any indication of life beneath the rolls of white gauze sandecker tried to look behind the bandages the deep green eyes that were visible never seemed to flicker sandecker sat down behind the desk and clasped his hand behind his head do the doctors at the hospital know where you are pitt smiled i suspect theyll wonder in another half hour i believe youve met this gentleman sandecker motioned to the fat man weve talked over the telephone pitt answered we havent been formally introduced at least not with proper names the fat man walked quickly around the desk and offered pitt his hand kippmann dean kippmann pitt took the hand it was a fooler there was nothing weak and fat about the grip dean kippmann pitt repeated the chief of the national intelligence agency theres nothing like playing with the big leaguers we deeply appreciate your help kippmann said warmly do you feel up to a little air travel after iceland a little south american sun couldnt hurt youll enjoy the sun all right kippmann stroked the skin on his head again particularly the southern california variety southern california by four oclock this afternoon by four oclock this afternoon at disneyland at disneyland sandecker said patiently im well aware that your destination isnt exactly what you had in mind but we can do without the echo with respects sir none of this figures until an hour ago those were our words precisely kippmann said just what have you got in mind pitt asked this kippmann pulled more papers from his seemingly bottomless briefcase and studied them briefly until we were able to question you and the other survivors who were physically up to it we had only a sketchy idea at best as to the purpose behind hermit limited we knew it existed and we were fortunate to ferrett out a small percentage of their business dealings but their ultimate goal the brains the money behind the entire operation remained a mystery pitt broke in guardedly but you had a lead you suspected dr hunnewell im glad you didnt tumble sooner major yes the nia was trailing dr hunnewell no concrete evidence of course thats why we set him in the hope he would lead us to the men at the top of the organization oh god it was a setup it wasnt easy to combine a sour exclamation and an anguished moan in the same breath but pitt pulled it off the whole goddamned scene on that iceberg was a setup yes hunnewell came to our attention when he so thoughtfully provided all the right solutions for fyrie limiteds undersea probe but offered absolutely nothing toward the efforts under development in his own country then emtombing the lax was a neat little piece of deception pitt said that was your drawing card hunnewell was bound to come forward as an investigator when the admiral here asked him out of what hunnewell probably couldnt seemed sheer coincidence believe his luck he immediately volunteered not to see what happened to his old friend kristjan fyriehed already guessed thator to inspect the strange phenomenon of a ship locked in ice but rather to discover what had become of his precious undersea probe again yes major kippmann handed pitt several glossy photographs here are pictures taken from the submarine that kept a watch on the lax for almost three weeks they show an unusual feature about the crew pitt ignored him and looked up at sandecker evenly and steadily the truth comes out at last the lax was found by the search fleet and then tailed until it burned sandecker shrugged mr kippmann took the trouble to notify me of that interesting little fact only last night the tight grin on his griffineke features hardly indicated friendliness toward kippmann reproach us if you will kippmann said seriously but it was vital that you both were kept on the sidelines as much as possible if kelly or rondheim or particularly hunnewell had smelled your connection with us our whole operation would have bombed he stared at pitt his voice low major you were simply to act as pilot for hunnewell while he inspected the lax you then were to fly him to reykjavik where we would have again taken over our observation of his movements it didnt quite work out that way did it we underestimated the other side kippmann said candidly pitt inhaled on a cigarette and idly watched the smoke curl toward the ceilng you havent explained how the lax came to be in the iceberg nor have you shed any light on what happened to the pirate crew or given a hint as to how fyrie and his crew and scientists could disappear for over a year and then suddenly hove their charred bodies turn up on the ship again the answer to both questions is simple kippmann said fyries crew never left the ship sandecker took his hands from behind his head and slowly leaned forward placing them palms down on the desk in front of him his eyes were rockhard matajic reported a crew of arabs not fairhaired scandinavians thats true kippmann agreed i think if you gentlemen will oblige me by glancing at these photographs youll see what i mean about the crew he passed the prints to sandecker and extra copies to pitt he then sat down in a chair and lit a cigarette after inserting it in a long holder kippmann was totally relaxed pitt was beginning to think the man would have yawned if hed been stabbed in the crotch please note photo number one kippmann said it was taken with a very sharp telephoto lens through a periscope as you can see it clearly shows ten crew members going about their duties on various parts of the ship there isnt a darkskinned man in the bunch coincidence sandecker said guardedly the arabs matajic reported seeing might have been below a slim possibility admiral providing we stopped at one picture however the other photos were taken at different times and on different days by comparing them all together we get a count of approximately fourteen men not one of arab ancestry surely gentlemen if there were even one arab on that ship he would have had to make an appearance during a threeweek period kippmann broke in and tapped his cigarette holder against the rim of an ashtray also we have definitely identified the faces in the photographs as the same people who set sail on the lax shortly before it vanished and what of matajic sandecker asked probing he was a top scientist trained in accurate observation surely he was positive of what he saw matajic saw men who were made up to look like other nationalities kippmann said the crew should have been masters at disguise by the time he stumbled onto themremember they had visited a number of ports they took no chances of recognition its only guesswork of course well never know for certain but its fairly safe to say the crew caught oriley watching them and slipped into their phony pose before matajic came on board for supper i see pitt said mildly and then what you can guess the rest if you dont already know it kippmann toyed with his cigarette holder a moment and then continued somehow its not difficult to imagine the celtinium ignited and transformed the lax into a floating incinerator our submarine could only stand by and watch helplesslyit happened so quickly there were no survivors fortunately the navy had put a fastthinking skipper in command of the sub a storm was approaching and he knew it was only a question of time before the redhot plates on the laxs hull cooled and contracted bursting their seams and letting the sea water flood in and sink her a finale further speeded by the force eight storm building on the horizon so he turned a twentymilliondollar submarine into a tugboat and nudged the burning hulk against a convenient iceberg until it melted its way inside pitt sat there looking at kippmann his expression pleasant your theory is quite correct major kippmann said thinly not my theory pitt smiled dr hunnewells it was he who came up with the hot poker in ice proposal i see kippmann said but he didnt the next question that interests me directly pitt hesitated mashing out his cigaretteis why did you send hunnewell and me chasing all over the north atlantic hunting down a particular iceberg after you erased all of its distinguishable markings why did you set hunnewell up to find the lax and then deliberately try to hide it impassively kippmann stared at pitt thanks to you major my men were forced to work their asses off in freezing temperatures chipping the coast guards red dye marker from the iceberg simply because you showed up two days ahead of schedule you were going over the lax with a finetoothed comb and hadnt finished when hunnewell and i appeared on the scene is that it precisely kippmann said nobody expected you to fly a helicopter through the aftermath of the seasons worst storm then your men were there pitt broke off looked at kippmann for a long speculative moment then went on quietly your agents were concealed on the berg the entire time hunnewell and i explored the lax kippmann shrugged you didnt give us a chance to pull them off pitt half rose from the couch you mean they stood by and did nothing when hunnewell and i damned near fell from the berg into the sea no rope no help no encouraging word nothing in our business we have to be ruthless kippmann offered a tired smile we dont like it but we have to its just that its the nature of the game a game pitt said a fantasy of intrigue a sport of makebelieve dog eat dog youre in a rotten occupation a neverending cycle my friend kippmann said acidly we didnt start out to be this way america has always been the good guy but you cant play knit when the other side uses every dirty rule in the book granted were the land of suckers always believing that good never fails to triumph over evil but where does that leave us back in disneyland ill come to that in due time kippmann said with restraint now then from what you and the others in the hospital reported hermit limited intends to make their move approximately nine hours and fortyfive minutes from now their first step will be to assassinate the leader of the latin american country that they plan to take over am i correct thats what the man said pitt nodded beginning with bolivia you shouldnt believe all you hear major kelly only used bolivia as an example he and his group arent strong enough for a country that size hes too much of a businessman to make a grab until he is ninety percent sure of a profit the target could be any one of half a dozen countries said sandecker how in hell can you be sure which one it is we have computers too kippmann said with some satisfaction the processed data narrowed the choice down to four major pitt helpfully narrowed it down to two youve lost me pitt said how could i the models you dredged from the sea kippmann cut in quickly one is the exact repleca of the capitol building of the dominican republic the other is the government legislative chambers of french guiana a fiftyfifty chance at best sandecker said slowly not really kippmann said its the honored opinion of the nia that kelly and his little troop will try for a doubleheader both countries at once sandecker looked at kippmann inquiringly you cant be serious yes were serious and if youll pardon the expression were deadly serious what can kelly hope to gain by splitting his efforts pitt asked trying for the dominican republic and french guiana at the same time isnt the gamble it seems kippmann pulled a map from the folder and smoothed it on sandeckers desk on the northern coast of south america you have venezuela and british dutch and french guiana further north a days passage by boat a few hours flight by plane the island that contains haiti and the dominican republic strategically its a beautiful situation in what way suppose kippmann said thoughtfully just suppose a dictator who ruled cuba also ruled florida as well sandecker looked at kippmann his face set and intense by god it is a beautiful situation it would only be a matter of time before hermit limited operating on the same island strangled haitis economy and took over yes then using the island as a base they could slowly spread into the central latin countries and absorb them one by one pitts voice was impassive history recalls that fidel castro tried to infiltrate the mainland countries and failed on every occasion yes kippmann repeated but kelly and hermit limited have the one thing castro lackeda foothold kelly will have french guiana he paused in reflection a moment a foothold as sure and as firm as the allies had in when they invaded france at normandy pitt shook his head slowly and i thought kelly was insane the bastard just might do it he just might pull his fantastic scheme off kippmann nodded let us say considering all facts at the present time the odd makers would probably lay their bets in favor of kelly and hermit limited maybe we should let him do it sandecker said maybe he was somehow meant to have his utopia no it is not meant to be kippmann said calmly it can never happen you seem pretty certain pitt said kippmann stared at him and grinned thinly didnt i tell you one of the birds that tried to kill you in that doctors office decided to cooperate he told us quite a story it seems there are a number of things you forgot to tell us sandecker grunted acidly kippmann went on kellys glorious enterprise is doomed to failure i have it on the best authority he paused his grin broadening as soon as hermit limited is entrenched in the dominican republic and french guiana there will be a proxy fight among the board of directors major pitts passing acquaintance mr oskar rondheim intends to emate kelly marks von hummel and the rest and take over as chairman of the board sad to say mr rondheims future intentions will hardly be classed as honorable and benevolent tidi was sitting prettily in a wheelchair beside lillies bed when pitt entered the hospital room followed by sandecker and kippmann the doctors tell me youll both live pitt said smiling just thought id ah offer my farewells drop by and youre leaving tidi asked sadly afraid so someone has to identify rondheims triggermen yoube careful she stammered after all you went through to save us we dont want to lose you now lillie raised his head stiffly why didnt you say something out there in the ravine he asked seriously god i had no idea your ribs were kicked in it made no difference i was the only one who could walk besides i never fail to get carried away when i have a good audience lillie smiled you had the best pitt asked hows your back ill be in this miserable body cast longer than i care to think about but at least ill be able to dance again when it comes off pitt stared down at tidi her face was pale and tears were beginning to well in her eyes and pitt understood when the big day arrives pitt said forcing a grin well celebrate with a party even if it means i have to drink your old mans beer that ill have to see sandecker cleared his throat ah i take it that miss royal is as good a nurse as she is a secretary lillie grasped tidis hand id break a bone every day of the week if it always meant meeting someone like her there was a short pause i think we should be leaving kippmann said our air force transportation is waiting even now pitt leaned down and kissed tidi and then shook lillies hand look after yourselves ill be expecting an invitation to that party soon he turned his palms upward and shrugged helplessly god only knows where ill be able to find a date whod be seen in public with a battered face like this tidi laughed at that he squeezed her shoulder and then turned and left the room in the car on the way to the air base pitt stared out the window his eyes unseeing his mind back in the hospital hell never walk again will he kippmann shook his head sadly its doubtful very doubtful fifteen minutes later without a further word being spoken they arrived at the keilavik air field to find an air force b reconnaissance bomber waiting by the terminal another ten minutes and the supersonic jet was speeding down the runway soaring out over the ocean sandecker alone in the terminal watched the plane lifting into the azure sky his eyes following it until it disappeared into the distance of the cloudless horizon then wearily he walked back to the car chapter because of the sevenhour time gain in flying from east to west and the twelvehundredmileperhourplus speed of the jet bomber it was still on the morning of the same day he left iceland when a blearyeyed pitt yawned stretched in the confined limitations of the tiny cabin and looking idly out the navigators side window watched the tiny shadow of the aircraft dart across the green slopes of the sierra madre mountains and what now pitt smiled wryly back at his reflection in the tiass as the bomber now swung out of the foothills and across the smogblanketed san gabriel valley gazing down at the pacific ocean as it came into view he cleared his mind of the past and directed it on the immediate future he didnt know how nor did he have even a remote scrap for a plan but he knew no matter the obstacles he knew he was going to kill oskar rondheim his mind abruptly returned to the present as the landing gear thumped down and locked into place at the same moment that dean kippmann nudged him on the arm have a nice nap slept like the dead the b touched down and the engines screamed as the pilot threw the thrust into reverse the day outside looked warm and comfortable and the california sun gleamed blindingly on the long rows of military jets parked along the taxiways pitt read the twelvefoothigh letters painted across a giant hangar welcome to el toro marine air station the bombers engines slowly died and an automobile sped over the apron as pitt kippmann and the air force crew climbed down a narrow ladder to the concrete two men unreeled from a blue ford stationwagon and approached kippmann greetings and handshakes were exchanged then they all walked back to the car pitt left standing with nothing to do followed them beside an open car door the three men huddled together and conversed in undertones while pitt stood several feet away and enjoyed a cigarette finally kippmann turned and came over it seems were about to crash a family reunion meaning theyre all here kelly marks rondheim the whole lot here in california pitt asked incredulously yes we had them traced as soon as they left iceland the serial number you found on that black jet came home a winner hermit limited purchased six of the same model with consecutive numbers from the factory we have every one of the remaining five planes under surveillance at this moment im impressed that was fast work kippmann dropped a smile not all that tough it might have been if the planes had been scattered around the globe but as it is theyre all sitting neatly side by side exactly eight miles from here at the orange county airport then kellys headquarters must be nearby in the hills behind laguna beach a fiftyacre complex kippmann said pointing in a southwesterly direction incidentally hermit limited has over three hundred employees on the payroll who theyre doir classified political anaivsis for their own government where do we go from here kippmann motioned pitt into the car disney land he said solemnly to stop a double murder they pulled onto the santa ana freeway and headed north weaving in and out of the light morning traffic as they passed the newport beach tumor pitt couldnt help wondering if the beautiful redhead he had met on the beach just a few days ago would still be there waiting at the new porter inn kippmann produced two photographs and shoved them in front of pitt here are the men were trying to save pitt tapped the face in one of the photos this is pablo castile president of the dominican republic kippmann nodded a brilliant economist and one of the leading members of the latin american right since his inauguration he has begun an ambitious program of reforms for the first time the people of his country are projecting an atmosphere of confidence and optimism our state department would hate like hell to see kelly screw things ut just when theres hope of the dominican republic becoming economically stable pitt held up the other photo i cant place him juan de croix kippmann said a highly successful doctor of east indian ancestry leader of the peoples progressive partywon the election only six months ago now president of french guiana if i remember my current events hes got problems hes got problems all right kippmann agreed french guiana is less prosperous than the british or dutch guianas a movement for independence developed five years ago but it was only under the threat of a revolution that the french permitted a new constitution and a general election de croix of course walked off with the votes and oroclaimed total independence hes got an uphill battle his country suffers from tropical diseases of every type and from chronic shortages of domestic food i dont envy him no one does de croixs government is vulnerable aid pitt thoughtfully but what of catdes cabinet arent his ministers strong enough to survive his death with the people maybe but the dominican army isnt too faithful a military junta would no doubt take over except in this case kelly has obviously bought off the generals how is it both of these men are at the same place at the same time if youd read the papers youd know the leaders of the western hemisphere have just finished a conference in san francisco for the alliance of economic and agricultural progress de croix castile and several other latin leaders are doing a little sightseeing on the way home its that simple why didnt you stop them from entering the park i tried but by the time our internal security forces could act it was too late de croix and castile have already been in the park for two hours and both refuse to leave we can only keep our fingers crossed that rondheims killers stick to their time schedule cutting it a bit fine arent you pitt said slowly kippmann shrugged indifferently some things you can control others you can only stand by and watch the car turned off the freeway onto harbor boulevard and soon pulled up to the employees gate and while the driver showed his credentials and asked directions from the guard pitt leaned out the window and watched the monorail train pass overhead they were at the north end of the park and all he could see over the landscaped mounds that surrounded the buildings was the top half of the matterhorn and the turrets on the fantasyland castle the gate was pushed open and they were passed in by the time pitt walked down the underground hallway to the park security offices he was beginning to think how good that hospital bed in reykjavik had felt and wondered how soon he could fall into a replacement he wasnt sure what he expected to find in the park security offices but he had hardly envisioned what he stepped into the main conference room was huge it looked like a scaleddown version of the war room at the pentagon the main table ran for at least fifty feet and was circled by over twenty people there was a radio in one corner and the operator was busily pointing out locations to a marker who stood on a ramp beneath a map that must have stretched ten feet high and covered half the facing wall pitt walked slowly around the table and stood under the beautifully contoured and painted map of disneyland he was studying the many colored lights and the trail of blue fluorescent tape the marker was laying throulh the park traffic areas when kippmann tapped him on the shoulder ready to go to work my body is still running on iceland time its past five oclock there i could stand a little bracer im sorry sir the words came from a big man a tall pipesmoking man whose eyes stared out at pitt from behind fashionable rimless glasses alcohol has never been permitted in any area of the park since we opened and we intend to keep it that way sorry about that pitt said goodnaturedly he looked at kippmann expectantly kippmann took the cue major dirk pitt allow me to introduce mr dan lazard chief of park security lazards grip was firm mr kippmann has filled me in concerning your injuries do you think youre up to this i can handle it pitt said somberly but well have to do something about my bandaged profileits a bit conspicuous lazards eyes a glint of amusement came into lazards eye think we can fix it so no one will notice your bandagesnot even the nurse who taped them later pitt stoed in front of the fulllength mirror and struck a menacing pose he was torn between uttering laughter or a stream of fourlettered words from embarrassment as he stared at the lifesized figure of the big bad wolf who politely stared back at him youve got to admit kippmann said fighting back a chuckle your own mother wouldnt recognize you in that rig i suppose it is in keeping with my character pitt said he removed the wolfs head sat down in a chair and sighed how much time have we left another hour and forty minutes to go before kellys deadline dont you think i should be sent in the game now youre not leaving me much time to spot the killers if i can spot them between my men the park security staff and agents from the fbi there must be close to forty people concentrating every effort on stopping the assassination im saving you for when we come down to the wire scraping the bottom of the barrel for a lastditch attempt pitt leaned back and relaxed i cant say i agree with your tactics youre not working with amateurs major every one of those people out there are pros some are dressed in costumes like you some are walking hand in hand like lovers on a holiday some are playing the part of families enjoying the rides others have taken over as attendants we even have men stationed on roofs and in the dummy secondstory offices with telescopes and binoculars kippmanns voice was soft but it carried total conviction the killers will be found and stopped before they do their dirty work the odds weve stacked against kelly meeting his goal and deade are staggering tell that to oskar rondheim pitt said theres the flaw that knocks the hell out of your good intentionsyou dont know your adversary the silence lay heavy in the small room kippmann rubbed his palms across his face then shook his head slowly as if he were about to do something he intensely disliked he picked up the everpresent briefcase and handed pitt a folder marked simply granted i havent met him face to face but he is no stranger to me kippmann read from the folder oskar rondheim alias max rolland alias hugo von klausen alias chatford marazan real name carzo butera born in brooklyn new york july i could go on for hours about his arrests his convictions he was pretty big along the new york waterfront organized the fishermens union got muscled out by the syndicate and dropped from sight over the past few years we kept close tabs on mr rondheim and his albatross industries we finally put two and two together and came up with carzo butera a sly grin crept across pitts face youve made your point it would be interesting to see what your scandal sheet has to say about me i have it right here kippmann said matching pitts grin care to see it no thanks it couldnt tell me anything that i dont already know pitt said flatly i would be interested though in seeing what you have on kirsti fyrie kippmanns expression went blank and he looked as if he had been shot i was hoping you wouldnt get around to her you have her file also it was more statement than question yes kippmann answered briefly he saw there was no way out no argument that would stand he sighed with uneasiness and handed pitt rue number pitt reached out and took the folder for ten minutes he examined the contents leafing very slowly almost reluctantly from documents to photos from reports to letters then finally like a man in a dream he closed the folder and gave it back to kippmann i cant believe it its ridiculous i wont believe it im afraid what you read is true all of it kippmanns voice was quiet even pitt pulled the back of his hand across his eyes never never in a thousand years would i have his voice faded away it threw us out of gear too our first hint came when we could find no trace of her on new guinea i know id already pegged her for a phony on that score you knew but how when we had dinner together in reykjavik i described a recipe that called for shark meat wrapped in a seaweed known as echidna miss fyrie accepted it rather strange behavior from a missionary who spent years in the jungles of new guinea dont you think how the hell should i know kippmann shrugged i dont have the vaguest notion as to what an echidna is an echidna pitt said is an egglaying spiny anteater a mammal very common to the landscape of new guinea i cant say i blame her for missing the catch how would you react if i said i was going to barbecue a new york cut steak wrapped in porcupine quills id say something youve got the idea kippmann stared at pitt with an admiring look what put you on to her in the first place you wouldnt have tricked her without a nudge without a suspicious hint her tan pitt answered it was shallownot burned deep like one acquired after years and months spent in a tropic jungle you sir are very observant kippmann murmured thoughtfully but why why bother to trip up someone you barely knew partly for the same reason im standing here in this ridiculous wolf suit pitt said grimly i volunteered for your little manhunt for two reasons one ive got a score to even with rondheim and kelly no more no less second im still special projects director for numa and as such my primary duty is to obtain the plans for fyries undersea mineral probe thats why i conned kirstishe knows where the blueprints are hidden boy something i shouldnt have it gave me a wedge to her kippmann nodded now i understand he sat on a desk and toyed with a letter opener i have kelly and his group in custody ill r to you and admiral sandecker for quesgood enough pitt snapped if you want my cooperation as an identifying witness then promise me a few minutes alone with rondheimand full and complete custody of kirsti fyrie impossible what does rondheims future physical condition mean to you if i turned my back so you could kick him in the teeth i couldnt let you have kirsti fyrie you could pitt said positively mostly because she isnt yours to give if youre lucky you might pin an accomplice charge on her but that might strain our relations with iceland in event that wouldnt make our state department exactly jump for joy youre wasting your breath kippmann said impatiently she will be convicted of murder along with all the rest yours is not to convict yours is to apprehend and arrest kippmann shook his head you dont understand he broke off as the door opened wide lazard stood framed in the doorway his face ashen kippmann stared at him curiously dan what is it lazard wiped his brow and slumped into an empty chair de croix and castile have suddenly changed their planned excursion theyve shaken their escort and disappeared somewhere in the park god only knows what can happen before we find them frowning baffled kippmanns face expressed a moment of utter uncomprehension christ he exploded how could it happen how could you lose them with half the federal agents in the state guarding their party there are twenty thousand people out there in the park right this minute lazard tone it doesnt take any great magician to replace two of them feat of cleverness to croix and castile bitched he shrugged helplessly deal about our heavy security precautions from the second they stepped through the main gate they went to the john together and gave us the slip by ducking out a side window just like a pair of kids pitt stood up quickly do you have their tour and scheduled stops lazard stared at him for a moment yes here each amusement and exhibit and their time schedules he handed pitt a xeroxed sheet of paper pitt rapidly glanced at the schedule then a slow grin cut his face as he turned to kippmann youd better send me into the game coachy major kippmann said unhappily i have the feeling im about to be blackmailed as they say during campus riots why wont you meet our demands the slump of kippmanns shoulders displayed as sure a sign of defeat as if hed waved a white flag he stared at pitt the eyes that stared back were disconcertingly steady kippmann nodded rondheim and miss fyrie are yours theyre staying in the disneyland hotel across the street adjoining rooms and and kelly marks von hummel and the rest theyre all there hermit limited reserved the entire sixth floor kippmann rubbed his face uncomfortably just what do you have in mind rest easy five minutes with rondheim then you can have him kirsti fyrie i keep call her a little bonus from the nia too kippmann gave up completely you win now where are de croix and castile the obvious pitt smiled at kippmann and lazard the most obvious place where any two men who passed their childhood near the spanish main would head god youve hit it lazard said almost bitterly the last stop on the schedulethe pirates of the caribbean next to the cleverly engineered apparitions in the disneyland haunted house the pirates of the caribbean is the most popular attraction in the worldfamous park constructed on two underground levels that occupy nearly two acres the quarterofamile boat ride carries awed passengers through a maze of tunnels and vast rooms decorated as roving pirate ships and pillaged seaside towns manned by almost a hundred lifelike figures that not only match the best of madame tussauds but who also sing dance and loot pitt was the last one up the entrance ramp to the landing where the attendants assist the paying customers into the boats at the start of the fifteenminute excursion the fifty or sixty people waiting in line waved to pitt and made smiling remarks about his costume as he made his way behind kippmann and lazard he waved back wondering what the expressions on their faces would be if he were to suddenly whip off his wolfs mask and display his bandaged face he could see at least ten small children who would never again want the three little pigs read at bedtime lazard grasped the managing attendant by the arm quickly you must stop the boats the attendant a blond lanky boy no more than twenty years of age simply stood there in mute uncomprehension lazard obviously a man who disliked wasted conversation moved hurriedly across the landing to the controls disengaged the underwater traction chain that pulled the excursion boats set the handbrake and turned to face the stunned boy again two men two men together have they taken the ride dont know for sure sir there theres been so many i cant recall them all kippmann stepped in front of lazard and showed the boy the photographs of castile and de croix do you recognize these men the boys eyes widened yes sir now i remember then a frown spread across his youthful face but they werent alone there were two other men with them four kippmann shouted turning about thirty heads are you sure yes sir the boy nodded his head violently im positive the boat holds eight people the first four seats held a man and woman with two kids the men in the photographs took the rear seats with two other men pitt arrived just then his breath coming in short pants his hand clutching the handrail as he fought off the pain and exhaustion was one of them a big guy with a bald head hairy hands and the other redfaced with a huge mustache and shgulders like an ape the boy stared dumbly for a moment at pitts disguise then his expression took on a half smile you hit them exactly a real pair like toughlooking mutt and jeff characters pitt turned to kippmann and lazard gentlemen he said his voice slightly muffled under the rubber wolfs head i think weve just missed our boat for gods sake kippmann murmured in exasperation we cant just stand here no lazard shook his head we cant do that he nodded at the boy call extension tell whoever answers that lazard has relocated the missing party in the pirates of the caribbean tell them its a red situationthe hunters are in there too he turned back to kippmann and pitt the three of us can work along the catwalks and the backdrops until we reach them and only hope were not too late how many boats ago did they board pitt asked the boy the dazed boy could only stammer i ten maybe twelve they should be sitting about between the building and this way lazard almost snapped the words he disappeared through a doorway at the end of the landing marked employees only as they moved into the blackness that cloaked the mechanical workings of the pirates the sound of voices from the passengers of the stalled boats could be beard murmuring throughout the cavernous amusement ride castile and de croix as well as their assassins pitt reflected could have little suspicion as to the delay but even so it didnt seem to matter there was every possibility that kellys and rondheims scheme had already been carried out he fought off the ache in his chest and followed the squat dim form of kippmann past a storyland setting of five pirates burying a treasure chest the figures seemed so lifelike it was difficult for pitt to believe they were only electronically controlled mannequins he was so engrossed in the simulated reality of the scene that he rammed into kippmann who had stopped abruptly easy easy kippmann protested lazard motioned to them to stay where they were as he moved catlike along a narrow corridor and leaned over the railing of a workmans gallery running over the canal that supported the boats then he waved pitt and kippmann forward we got lucky for a change he said take a look pitt his eyes not yet accustomed to the dark stared below at a sight that never wasa wild fantasy night scene containing a band of at least thirty pirates burning and looting what seemed to be a replica of a miniature port royal or panama city flames were shooting out of several buildings while silhouettes of laughing buccaneers chased screaming makebelieve girls around and around the backlighted windows boisterous singing was reverberating out of hidden speakers giving the illusion that rape and pillage were merely good clean fun the canal the boats circuited through cut between the town buildings lifting the viewers eyes from a pair of pirates trying vainly to get a mule to pull a wagonload of their loot on the left to a trio of their shipmates drinking on a pile of wildly swaying wine barrels on the right but it was the center of the canal that drew pitts attention there in a boat almost directly under a bridge that ran over the water were castile and de croix happily pointing out details of the wondrous scene like two schoolboys playing hookey at a friday matinee and sitting ominously like disinterested statues on the seat directly in back of the south american presidents pitt could make out the two men who had held his arms while rondheim bad battered him to a pulp only two days before in reykjavik pitt glanced at the luminous dial of the orange faced doxa watch on his wrist stan an hour and twenty minutes before kellys countdown too early far too early yet there were two of rondheims killers sitting not three feet from their intended victims a very large piece was missing from the puzzle he had no doubt that kelly told the truth about his timetable and that rondheim would stick to it but would he if rondheim meant to take over hermit limited it stood to reason that he just might make a change in plans this is your show dan kippmann spoke softly to the security director how do we take them no guns lazard said the last thing we want is a stray shot killing a child maybe wed better wait for reinforcements kippmann said no time lazard said weve kept the boats stopped too long already everyone is starting to get edgy including those two characters in back of castile and de croix then well have to take a risk kippmann wiped a handkerchief across his damp brow get the boats moving again then as soon as the one with our friends begins to cross under the bridge well take them okay lazard agreed the bridge will give us cover to close within fifteen feet ill work around and come out of that doorway under the gunshop sign kippmann you hide behind the mule and wagon need an extra hand pitt asked sorry major lazard gave pitt a cool stare youre hardly in shape for handtohand combat he paused and gripped pitts shoulder you could play a vital role though say the word by standing on the bridge in your wolf costume and miming with the pirates you could distract those two in the boat long enough to give kippmann and myself a few more seconds of insurance i guess it beats hell out of matching wits with the three little pigs pitt said as soon as lazard found a call phone and ordered the attendant to start the canal boats moving in two minutes he and kippmann dropped into the burning village behind the realisticlooking burning fronts and took their positions after he stumbled over the stuffed body of a pirate who supposedly had passed out from too much wine pitt reached down and relieved the mannequin of its cutlass and was surprised to find that it was a steel replica of the real thing even at close range he could only marvel at the truetolife appearance of the mechanical pirates the glass eyes set in brown wax faces stared unerringly in whatever direction the head was set and the eyebrows raised up and down in unison with the lips as the strains of sixteen men on a dead mans chest boomed from speakers concealed within their aluminumframe bodies pitt moved to the center of the arched bridge over the canal and joined in the singing amid three merry buccaneers who sat with their legs dangling over the fake stone parapet swirling their cutlasses around in circles in time with the songfest pitt in his big bad wolf suit and the frolicking pirates presented a strange sight to the people in the boat as they waved and sang the famous old seafaring ditty the children a girl about ten and a boy pitt guessed no more than sevenoon recognized him as the threedimensional cartoon character and began waving back castile and de croix also laughed and then saluted him in spanish pointing and joking to themselves while the tall bald assassin and his accomplice the broadshouldered brute sat stonyfaced unmoved by the performance it occurred to pitt that he was on thin ice on which not merely a false move but the tiniest miscalculation of any detail could spell death to the men woman and children who sat innocently enjoying his antics then he saw the boat move the bow was just passing under his feet when the shadowy figures of kippmann and lazard leaped from their cover sprinted through the mass of animated figures and dropped into the rear of the boat the surprise was complete but pitt hadnt noticed no fuss no elaborate flourish no token words of warning he coldly and efficiently shoved the blade of his cutlass under the armpit and into the chest cavity of the pirate sitting nearest him a curious thing happened the pirate dropped his cutlass his lips contorted into a soundless oval eyes registering astonishment and shock a shock almost immediately replaced by a final awareness then the eyes turned up in the head and he fell forward splashing into the now empty canal beneath the bridge the second pirate failed to react in the split second when he might have parried pitts swing he started to say something then with cutlass still dripping red pitt put all his strength into a backhand slash that bit into the base of the pirates neck at the left shoulder blade the man grunted and flung up the opposite arm made as if to roll clear but his feet slipped on the uneven flooring of the bridge and he came down on both knees falling over sideways in a rubbery heap blood pulsing from his halfopened mouth pitt had one fleeting glimpse of a flashing metallic glint in the fiery light and the instinctive slight inclination of his head saved his life as the third pirates cutlass sliced through the crooked top hat that was perched on the wolf mask too fir pitt had pushed his luck too far he had caught two of rondheims men before they knew what was happening but the third had gained sufficient time to counter pitts attack and catch him off balance blindly fending off the lunging thrusts staggering backward under the fury of the other mans assault pitt hurled himself convulsively sideways and over the parapet and plunged into the cool water of the canal even as he dived pitt had heard the swish of the pirates blade as it hissed through the empty air where his body had stood only an instant before and then there was the sudden shock as his shoulder collided with vicious force against the shallow bottom of the canal the pain exploded in him and everything seemed to dissolve and stop t yo ho ho sixteen men on a dead mans chest god pitt thought through the haze why dont those mechanical bastards sing something else like a diagnostic specialist he carefully explored his bruised bodythe areas of pain the position of his arms and legs in the flamesparkled water his ribs felt as if they were burning inside his chest the fire spreading into his back and shoulders pulling himself onto the landing pitt stood up unsteadily swayed and only kept erect by using the cutlass as a cane somewhat bewildered to find the hilt still imbedded tightly in his right hand he crouched on one knee fighting to catch his breath waiting for his heart to slow down to a reasonably nominal rate and scanned the makebelieve set his eyes trying desperately to pierce the darkness beyond the flaming half light the bridge was empty the third pirate was gone and the boat was just disappearing around a curve into the next gallery he turned in the opposite direction just in time to see another sightseeing boat approaching up the canal all these things he noted mechanically without consciously classifying their significance all he could think of was that a killer was somewhere close by disguised as one of the pirates he felt helpless the mannequins all began to look alike and the action on the bridge had happened with such speed that he hadnt been able to perceive any details of the mans costume almost frantically he tried to plan the next step there was no more chance in the world for surprise on his partthe human pirate knew what pitt looked like while he was helpless to detect the real from the fake and had now lost the opportunity to move first even as these thoughts flashed through pitts mind he knew he must act a second later he was half running half stumbling along the quay gasping at every step as waves of pain shot through every tendon of his body he burst through a black curtain and into the next stage set it had a huge domed chamber dimly lit for a nighttime scene built into the far wall a scaleddown version of a pirates corsair ship complete with dummy crew and jolly roger rippling in a breeze urged on by a hidden electric fan fired stimulated broadsides from replica cannon across fifty feet of water and over the heads of the people in the excursion boat at a miniature fortress sitting high atop a jagged cliff on the opposite side of the cavernous chamber it was too dark to make out any details on the excursion boat pitt could detect no movement at the stern and he felt certain that kippmann and lazard had everything under their command everything that is that was within their reach as his eye began to penetrate the heavy darkness of the simulated nighttime harbor between the ship and the fortress he saw that the bodies in the boat were all huddled below the sides of the hull he was about halfway up the maintenance ramp to the deck of the corsair ship when he knew why when he heard a strange sound the almost silent thump of a gun with a silencer and then suddenly he was standing in back of a form in a pirate costume who was holding something in his hand and pointing it at the little boat in the water pitt looked at him curiously with only a detached sort of interest he raised the cutlass and brought the flat side of the blade down on the pirates wrist the gun dropped from the mans wristover the railing and into the water below the pirate swung around the white hair falling from under a scarlet bandanna that was knotted around his head the cold bluegray eyes flashing with anger and frustration the lines about the mouth deeply etched he searched the comical figure that had so coolly killed two of his comrades his voice was hard and metallic it seems i am your prisoner pitt wasnt fooled for an instant the words were only a stall a curtain to shield the lighg move that would surely come the man behind the voice was dangerous and he was playing for high stakes but pitt had more than an edged weaponhe had a newly found strength that was suddenly coursing through his body like a gathering tidal wave he began to smile ahso it is you oskar pitt paused significantly watching rondheim like a cat holding hermit limiteds chief executioner on the end of the cutlass pitt pulled off the rubber wolfs head rondheims face was still set and hard but the eyes betrayed total incomprehension pitt dropped the mask bracing himself for the moment he had planned for but never really believed would happen slowly he unwrapped the bandages with one hand letting the gauze fall to the deck in little unraveled piles building the suspense when he finished he gazed steadily at rondheim and stood back rondheims lips began to work in a halfformed question and dazed expression spread across his features sorry you cant recall the face oskar pitt said quietly but you didnt leave a great deal to recognize rondheim stared at the swollen eyes the bruised and puffed lips the sutures that laced the cheekbones and eyebrows and then his mouth fell open and in a whisper he breathed pitt pitt nodded its not possible rondheim gasped pitt laughed i apologize for ruining your day but it just goes to prove that you cant always trust a computer rondheim looked at pitt long and searchingly and the others with one exception theyre all alive and mending the broken bones you so generously dispensed pitt focused his gaze beyond rondheims shoulder and saw that the excursion boat was safely entering the next gallery then its back to you and me again major under conditions more favorable to you than those i enjoyed in the gym but dont get your hopes up a sort of smile twisted the tight lips fairies are no match for men i agree pitt returned he hurled the cutlass over rondheims head into the water and stood back he looked down and examined his hands they would have to do the job he took several slow deep breaths ran his hands through his wet hair rubbed them roughly on the sides of his costume and then gave a final flex to his fingers he was ready i misled you oskar round one was an unequal contest you had the numbers the planning and the initiative from the beginning how are you alone oskar without your paid help to prop your victims how are you when youre on strange ground you still have time to escape nothing stands between you and a chance for freedom except me but theres the rub oskar you have to get by me rondheims teeth showed i dont need anyone to break you pitt my only regret is that i dont have the time to stretch out your next lesson in pain okay oskar so much for the psychological bullshit pitt said calmly he knew exactly what he was going to do true he was still weak and dead tired but that was more than canceled out by the selfdetermination the invisible figures of lillie tidi sam kelly hunnewell and the rest who stood at his side giving him strength he could have never possessed alone an uncertain smile came to rondheims mouth as he crouched in a karate stance the smile didnt last pitt hit him he hit rondheim with a right cross a perfectly timed punch that jerked rondheims head sideways and staggered him into the ships main mast deep down pitt had known that he had little chance of taking rondheim in a prolonged fight that he couldnt hold the other man off for more than a few minutes but he had schemed and timed for the element of surprise the one advantage that played on his side before the karate blows could lash his face again as it turned out the advantage was a small one rondheim was incredibly tough he had taken a hard blow yet he was already recovering he sprang from the mast and threw a kick to pitts head missing by a scant inch as pitt ducked easily away the ill timing cost him pitt caught rondheim with a series of left jabs and another short hard right that sent him to his knees on the deck holding a hand to a broken bleeding nose youve improved rondheim whispered through the streaming blood i said i misled you pitt was hanging back tensed in a half boxing half judo position waiting for rondheims next move in reality im about as queer as carzo butera with the sound of his true name rondheim could see deaths fingers reaching out to touch him but he kept his voice under iron control his bleeding face an expressionless mask it seems i underestimated you major you were an easy man to lead astray oskar or should i call you by the name on your birth certificate no matter your run has played out mouthing a string of curses through bloodspeck lips his face now frozen in insane hate rondheim flung himself at pitt he hadnt taken a second step when pitt brought an uppercut from the deck and rammed it as solidly as a sledgehammer into rondheims teeth pitt had given it everything he had thrown his shoulder and body into it with such force that his ribs screamed in agony and he knew even as he did it that he could never marshal the strength to do it again there came a dull squish sound mingled with a muffled cracking noise rondheims teeth were jerked from their sockets and imbedded in torn lips as pitts wrist snapped for two or three seconds rondheim seemed to straighten and stand there poised like a frame frozen in a movie projector then with the unbelievably slow irrevocable finality of a falling tree he crumbled to the deck and lay still pitt stood and panted through clenched teeth his right wrist hanging limply at his side he stared up at the little lights flashing from the makebelieve cannon on the fortress and then he noticed that the next excursion boat was passing through the chamber he blinked his eyes to focus more clearly and the sweat ran into them and stung there was something he had to do at first the thought repulsed him but he shook it aside determined that there could be no other way he stepped over the sprawling legs of the unconscious man and bent down propping one of rondheims arms against the deck and the bottom base of the railing then riising one of his feet he stomped on it shuddering inwardly as the bone broke a few inches below the elbow rondheim stirred sluggishly and moaned thats for jerome lillie pitt said his voice bitter he repeated the process with rondheims other arm noting with grim satisfaction that his victims eyes had opened and were staring vacantly pupils enlarged in a glassy state of physical shock score that one ior tidi royal pitt moved automatically as he turned rondheims body so that the legs were pointing in the opposite direction propped as the arms had been on the deck and trained the thinking emotional part of pitts mind was c no longer part of his brain it floated outside its cranial vault keeping enouph contact to pull the strings that made the hands and feet work inside the bruised cut and in some places deserted shelter the machine was quietly smoothly ticking over the deadly exhaustion and pain were pushed into the background forgotten for the moment until his mind regained full control there he jumped on rondheims left leg mark that up for sam kelly rondheim screamed a scream that died in his throat the glazed bluegray eyes stared upward intg pitts kill me he whispered why dont you kill me if you lived for a thousand years pitt said grimly you could never make up for all the pain and misery youve caused i want you to know what its like feel the agony as your bones part the helplessness of lying there and watching it happen i should break your spine like you did lillies watch you rot your life away in a wheelchair but that would be wishful thinking oskar your trial might last a few weeks even months but there isnt a jury in the world that wont hand you a death sentence without leaving the box no id be doing you a favor by killing you and that would never do this one is for willie hunnewell there was no grin on pitts face no gleam of anticipation in the deep green eyes he leaped for the fourth and final time and the hoarse horrible scream of pain rolled over the ships decks echoed through the chamber then slowly faded and died with a feeling of emptiness almost sadness pitt sat there on a hatch cover and stared down at the broken figure of rondheim it wasnt a pretty sight the fury within him had found its outlet and now he felt totally drained as he waited for his lungs and heart to slow back to normal he was sitting there like that when kippmann and lazard came charging across the deck followed by a small army of security men they said nothing there was nothing they could say at least not for a full sixty seconds not until the full significance of what pitt had done became clear to them finally kippmann broke the silence a little rough on him werent you hes oskar rondheim pitt said vaguely are you sure i seldom forget a face pitt said especially when it belongs to a man who kicked the hell out of me lazard turled to look at him his lips twisted in a wry smile what was it i said about you hardly being in shape for handtohand combat sorry i couldnt get to rondheim before he started popping away with his silencer pitt said did he hit anyone castile was nicked in the arm lazard said after we coldcocked those two clowns in the stern seat i turned and saw you playing errol flynn on the bridge i knew then we werent out of the woods yet so i threw myself over the family up front and forced them to the bottom of the boat likewise with our visitors from latin america kippmann smiled and rubbed a bruise on his forehead they thought i was crazy and gave me a rough go for a minute what happens to kelly and hermit limited pitt asked well arrest mr kelly along with his internationally wealthy partners of course but the chances of convicting men of their stature are almost impossible i should imagine the governments involved will hurt them where it hurts them mostin the pocketbook the fines theyll probably have to pay should build the navy a new aircraft carrier thats a small price to pay for the suffering theyve caused pitt said wearily none the less it is a price kippmann murmured yes yes it is that thank god they were stopped kippmann nodded to pitt we have you to thank major pitt for blowing the whistle on hermit limited lazard smbed suddenly and id like to be the first to express my gratitude for your horatiusatthebridge act kippmann and i couldnt be standing here now if you hadnt taken the cue when you did he put his hand on pitts shoulder tell me something im curious about what how did you know those pirates on the bridge were real flesh and blood as the man once said pitt said casually there we were just sitting on the bridge eyeball to eyeball and i could swear i saw the other guys blink epilogue it was a pleasant southern california evening the days smog had cleared away and a cool breeze from the west carried the strong clean smell of the pacific ocean through the center garden of the disneyland hotel soothing the soreness of pitts injuries and tranquilizing his mind for the task ahead he stood silent waiting for the glassenclosed elevator to descend along the exterior of the building the elevator hummed and stopped and the doors slid open he scratched an imaginary itch in his eye and lowered his head shielding his face as a young man and woman arm in arm laughing gaily to themselves stepped past him without noticing his worseforwear features or the arm enclosed in a plaster cast and supported by a black cloth sling he entered and pushed the button marked six the elevator rose swiftly and he turned and looked through the windows at the skyline of orange county he took a deep breath and slowly exhaled watching the sparkling carpet of lights spread and widen toward the dark horizon as the first three floors slid by the lights blinked in the crystal air reminding him of a jewel box it hardly seemed like two hours since the park doctor had set his wrist and pitt had showered and shaved and eaten his first solid meal since leaving iceland the doctor was quite definite that he go to a hospital but pitt wouldnt hear of it the doctor had said sternly youre a fool youre damn near dead on your feet you should have given up and collapsed hours ago if you dont get your butt between the sheets of a hospital bed youre going to experience a firstclass breakdown thanks pitt had said shortly im grateful for your professional concern but theres one more act to play out two hoursno morethen ill dedicate whats left of my body to medical science the elevator slowed and stopped the door opened and pitt stepped onto the soft red carpet of the sixth floor foyer he abruptly halted in midstep to keep from colliding with three men who were waiting to go down two of the men he took to be kippmanns agents of the third man the one slumped head downward in the middle there was no doubt it was f james kelly pitt stood there blocking their way kelly slowly lifted his head and stared at pitt vacantly unrecognizing finally pitt broke the uneasy silence im almost sorry your grand scheme failed kelly in theory it was glorious in execution it was impossible kellys eyes widened by slow degrees and the color drained from his face my god is that you major pitt but no youre supposed to be dead pitt finished as if it no longer mattered too much except to himself oskar swore he killed you i managed to leave the party early pitt said coldly kelly shook his head back and forth now i understand why my plan failed it seems major that fate cast you in the role of my avenging nemesis purely a matter of my being at the wrong place at the wrong time kelly smiled thinly and nodded to the two agents the three of them entered the waiting elevator pitt stood aside then suddenly said sam left you a message kelly took seconds to recover is sam sam died out on the tundra pitt finished near the end he wanted you to know he forgave you oh god oh cod kelly moan in agony his fingers covering his eyes for many years afterward pitt carried the mental picture of kellys face just before the elevator door closed the stricken lines the dull lifeless eyes the ashen skin it was the face of a man who looked as if he was strangling pitt tried the door with the numerals it was locked he walked to the door of and twisted the knob it opened he quietly stepped over the threshold and eased the door closed the room was cool and dark the smell of stale cigar butts invaded his nostrils before he passed through the entry hall the odor was all he needed to know it was rondheims room moonlight filtered through the drapes casting long shapeless shadows as he searched through the bedroom nothing but rondheims clothes and luggage was undisturbed kippmann had kept his word his men had been careful not to alert kirsti fyrie or give her the slightest warning of rondheims fate or the sudden demise of hermit limited he moved toward a shaft of yellow light that split the halfopen door to the adjoining room he entered treading softly noiselessly like a night animal ready to spring it could hardly be called a room a plush suite would have been a fairer description it consisted of a hall a living room with an amply stocked bar a bathroom and a bedroom edged on one side by a large sliding glass door that led to a small balcony all the rooms were empty except the bathroom the sound of running water told him that kirsti was in the shower pitt walked over to the bar casually poured himself a scotch on the rocks and just as casually eased into a long comfortable sofa twenty minutes and two drinks later kirsti emerged from the bathroom she was wearing a green silk kimono loosely sashed at the waist her golden hair danced around her head like a silvercolored halo she looked incredibly fresh and lovely she walked through the bedroom into the living room and was in the midst of mixing herself a drink when she saw pitts reflection in the mirror behind the bar she stood there as if suddenly struck by paralysis very pale with an expression of uncertainty on her face i suppose pitt said quietly the appropriate thing for a gentleman to say when a beautiful woman leaves her bath is behold venus arises from the waves she turned and the look of uncertainty slowly turned to one of curiosity do i know you weve met she clutched the edge of the bar silent her eyes searching him dirk she whispered softly its you its really you thank god youre still alive your concern for my welfare comes a little late they stared at each other green eyes locked on violet elsa koch bonny parker and lucretia borgia he said all could have taken lessons from you on how to kill friends and influence enemies i had to do what ive done she said faintly but i swear to you i have killed no one i was unwillingly pulled into the vortex by oskar i never dreamed that his association with kelly would lead to death for so many you say youve killed no one yes youre lying she gazed at him oddly what are you talking about you killed kristjan fyrie she looked at him now as if hed gone mad her lips were trembling and her eyesthose lovely violet eyeswere dark with fear you cant mean what youre saying she gasped kristjan died on the lax he was burned burned to death the time had come pitt told himself to settle the account balance the entries tally the final score he leaned forward kristjan fyrie didnt die a fiery death on a ship in the north atlantiche died under a surgeons scalpel on an operating table in veracruz mexico pitt let it sink in he took a couple of sips of his drink and lit a cigarette the words were not easy for him he watched her without speaking kirstis mouth had fallen open she closed it quickly and numbly searched for something to say she was on the verge of tears that would never come then she lowered her head and covered her face with her hands i have it on good authority pitt continued the operation took place at the sau de sol hospital and the surgeon was a dr jesus ybarra she looked up with an expression of agony then you know everything almost there are still a couple of loose ends why do you torture me by beating around the bush why dont you come out and say it pitt spoke calmly say what that youre really kristjan fyrie that there never was a sister that kristjan died at the exact moment you were born he shook his head what difference would it make as kristjan you werent willing to accept the sex your body had given you so you undertook sex conversion surgery and became kirsti you came into this world a transsexual your genes crossed you up you werent satisfied with the hand nature dealt you so you made a change what more is there she came from behind the bar and leaned against the leatherpadded surface you can never know dirk you can never know what it is to lead a frustrating and complicated existence playing the strong virile male adventurer on the outside while inside you are a woman longing to be free so you escaped the shell pitt said slipped away to mexico to a surgeon who specializes in conversions you took hormone injections and silicone implants for your ah chest then you soaked up the sun on a veracruz beach getting a tan while your incision healed later at the appropriate time you showed up in iceland claiming to be your longlost sister from new guinea what astonishing confidence you must have had to think you could get away with it pitt continued ive met a few slick operators in my short life span but by god kirsti or kristjan or whoever youve got to be the shrewdest bastard or rather bitch that ever came down the pike you took everyone you conned admiral sandecker into thinking you were going to turn the undersea probe over to our government you faked a thousand men and their ships and aircraft into a wildgoose chase searching for a ship that was never missing you beguiled dr hunnewell an old friend into identifying a charred body as your own you used fyrie limiteds personneland they died carrying out your orders you used rondheim you used kelly and you even tried to use me in the hope i might erase oskar too bad the bubble had to burst the first step to all frauds is to cheat oneself at that you were a raving success kirsti had moved slowly around to a small traveling case on an end table lifted out a tiny colt twentyfive automatic and leveled it on pitts chest your accusations are not nearly as neat and organized as you think youre groping dirk youre groping in the dark like a blind man pitt glanced at the gun and then nonchalantly turned away and ignored it suppose you show me the light she looked uncertainly at pitt but she still held the gun as steady as a statue i had every intention of turning the undersea probe over to your country my original plan was to put my scientists and engineers on board the lax and send them to washington for the presentation ceremonies then on the voyage across the north atlantic kristjan fyrie was to have been lost overboard in the meantime you had flown to mexico for the operation yes kirsti answered softly but the totally unexpected and unforeseen coincidence spelled disaster to the new life i had so carefully planned dr jesus ybarra was a memberof hermit limited so he blew the whistle and informed rondheim kirsti nodded from that moment on i was oskars slave he threatened to expose my transition to the world if i didnt turn my business resources over to him and kelly i had no choice if my secret had become known the resulting scandal would have wrecked fyne limited and shattered the economy of my country why the masquerade with the lax now that oskar and kelly controlled me they were not about to let the sea probe out of their hands so they created a fraudulent story about the laxs disappearance you must admit it was an efficient situation to the world the sea probe was lost on the bottom of the sea and so was kristjan fyrie yes it also served my purpose that doesnt explain the alteration to the laxs superstructure pitt persisted y wasnt the sea probe simply removed and installed on another ship for the first time she smiled the sea probe is a complicated piece of equipment a ship must literally be designed around it to have taken it from the lax and reinstalled it in a nondescript fishing trawler would have taken months while everyone was searching for her the lax was secretly being facelifted in a cove on the eastern coast of greenland and dr hunnewell how did he figure in the picture he worked with me in developing the probe i know but why you why not with someone in his own country she looked at him and studied his face for a long moment i paid for the research and development with no strings attached the technological corporations m the united states wanted to tie up his services and all his experimental results dr hunnewell despised doing anything that reeked of commercial profit yet he became associated with kelly and hermit limited when the lax was prospecting the sea floor off greenland the probe malfunctioned dr hunnewell was the only one with the technical knowledge to suggest a quick repair kelly flew him there from california a very persuasive talker that f james kelly he sold dr hunnewell on jog hermit limited to save the world the doctor couldnt resist he was always what you americans call a dogooder a pained expression crossed kirstis face he came to regret his decision and he died for it that explains the fire on the ship pitt said thoughtfully you underestimated dr hunnewell he didnt fall under the spell of kelly he saw through the whole dirty scheme he didnt like what he saw on the laxrondheims crew holding your scientists prisoners its even likely your people on the ship slipped him the facts on dr matajics and his assistants deaths hunnewell knew then he had to do something to stop kelly so he wired the probe timing it to selfdestruct after he was in the air and on his way back to the states only he made a mistake something even he didnt understand about the reactive elements of celtinium caused it to ignite and not only destroy the probe but the entire ship and the crew as well i was there when he set foot on the lax again i saw the stunned expression on his face when he realized what hed done it was my fault kirsti said shakuy i am to blame i should have never divulged dr hunnewells name to oskar and kelly kelly guessed what had happened and ordered rondheim to silence hunnewell he was my oldest friend kirsti moaned softly and i signed his death warrant did he know about you no oskar simply told him i was in the hospital recuperating from another illness he was a better friend than you knew pitt said he falsely identified a body on the lax as yours dr hunnewell did it so that kristjan fyrie he knew wouldnt be implicated when he went to the authorities and spilled the damning facts about hermit limited unfortunately evil triumphed over good rondheim got to him first pitt shook his head sadly and sighed then enter dirk pitt stage left kirsti shivered visibly thats why i insisted on meeting you i had to express my gratitude for your attempt to save his life i am still in your debt pitt rolled the cool glass over his forehead too late it makes little difference now he said wearily it does to me thats why i saved you from being beaten to pieces by oskar her voice began to tremble but i i cant save you a second time i must protect myself dirk i am sorry please do not move and make me pull the trigger you must wait until oskar arrives pitt shook his head again dont look for oskar to come bounding in here to rescue you at this moment your exslavemaster is lying unconscious encased in half a ton of plaster in a hospital bed surrounded i might add by a bevy of national intelligence agents they may have to push him to the gallows in a wheelchair but walk or ride he will surely swing the gun wavered a hair what do you mean its done over with youre free hermit limited and its management just went belly up strangely kirsti didnt accuse pitt of insanity i want to believe you but how can i pick up the phone and call kelly marks von hummel or your friend rondheim or better yet search every room on the sixth floor and what do you expect me to find nothing nothing at all theyve all been arrested pitt finished the drink and set it down you and i are the only ones left courtesy of the nia youre my bonusa little side giftfor services rendered love it or hate it your soul has passed from rondheim to me the room swayed around kirsti as the truth of pitts words took hold she had wondered why rondheim hael not contacted her why kelly had not visited her as he had promised why there had been no ring of the phone no knock at the door for nearly two hours she steadied herself quickly accepting the realization of what had taken place but what of me am i to be arrested also no the nia knows of your new status they put two and two together and figured that rondheim was blackmailing you they considered taking you in as an accomplice but i talked them out of it the gun was gently laid on the end table an awkward silence descended finally kirsti stared at pitt and said there is a price there always has to be a price its cheap enough considering your past mistakes mistakes you can never buy back even with your fortune but you can clean the slate and make a new life without outside intrusion all i want is your guarantee for close and continued cooperation between fyrie limited and numa and the memory banks in kellys computers contain enough data to build a new undersea probe i speak for aden sandecker when i say he would like you to head up the project thats all nothing more she asked incredulously i said the price was cheap she gazed levelly at him tomorrow next week the coming year how can i be sure you will not decide to raise the interest rate pitts eyes turned cold and his voice was like ice dont put me in the same league with your other playmates mass murder and extortion have never turned me on your secret is safe with me and its even safer with the niatheyll see to it that rondheim kelly and ybirra will never get within fifty feet of a press reporter she hesitated im sorry truly sorry what else can i say he didnt answer just looked at her she turned and gazed out the window at the park the turrets of the magic castile were lit lip like a birthday cake the lanilies were gone now the young couples had taken over and were strolling along the park walkways and streets hand in hand breathing in the makebelieve romantic atmosphere and where do you go from here she asked after a short vacation ill go back to numa headquarters in washington and begin work on a new project she turned to look at him and if i asked you to come to iceland with me and become a member of my board of directors im not the boardofdirector type there must be some other way for me to show my gratefulness she came toward pitt and stood in front of him a knowing smile curled her lips the doelike eyes grew soft and there seemed to be faint signs of dampness on her forehead all will be as you ask she said slowly she raised her hand and her fingers lightly touched his battered face tomorrow i will see admiral sandecker and affirm out mutual efforts she hesitated and stood back from him i must however extract a small cost in return and that is she loosened the sash and shrugged the kimono from her shoulders to the floor standing there in the relaxed classical pose of the nude under the light from the lamp she was like a sunbronzed figure crafted to exacting satin smoothness by the patient hands of a master sculptor the full rounded lips were slightly open with excitement and impatience the soft violet eyes gave forth a silent invitation her features and body could only be described as magnificent a perfectly constructed monument to the miracle of medical science if its any compliment she said in a throaty voice i never for a minute believed your gay act it takes one to know one she turned pale what i became is not the same what you became is a cold shrewd calculating witch no kristjan fyrie was a warm honest lover of humanity your change was emotional as well as physical people to you are only to be used to be thrown away when their usefulness ends youre cold and youre sick she shook her head no no ive changed yes but im not cold not cold she held out her arms let me prove it they stood in the center of the room facing each other silently and then she saw the expression forming on pitts face and her arms slowly dropped to her sides she looked dazed those exotic eyes were stricken she stared at his face with a strange paralyzed intentness pitts features were coldly menacing the purplish bruises the swollen flesh the jagged cuts all worked together in one terrible mask of disgust his eyes no longer saw her loveliness he could only see the unidentifiable ashes of what had once been men he saw hunnewell dying on a lonely beach he remembered the face of the captain of the hydroplane before he disappeared in flames he knew the pain of lillie tidi and sam kelly and he knew kirsti fyrie was partly responsible for their suffering and for sometheir deaths kirsti paled and backed away a step dirk whats the matter god save thee he said he turned and opened the door the first few steps toward the elevator were the hardest then it got easier by the time he reached the main floor walked to the curb and hailed a cab the old confident relaxed composure was back the driver opened the door and dropped the flag where to sir pitt sat there a moment in silence then suddenly he knew where he had to go he had no choice he was what he was the newport inn and a compassionate redhead i hope
