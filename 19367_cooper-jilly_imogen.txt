jilly cooper imogen for lyn adams with love authors note the idea for imogen first came to me in i wrote it as a long short story called the holiday makers and it appeared in serial form in in i took the story and completely rewrote it and the result is imogen chapter one the little west riding town of pikelyindarrowdale clings to the side of the hillside like a grey squirrel above stretches the moor and below in the valley where the river darrow meanders through bright green water meadows lies pikely tennis club in the high street stands the public library it was a saturday afternoon in may miss nugent the senior librarian put down the mauve openwork jumper she was knitting and helped herself to another lincoln cream ive never known it so slack she said to the pretty girl beside her who was dreamily sorting books into piles of fiction and nonfiction and putting them on a trolley everyone must be down at the tournament are you going imogen the girl nodded for an hour or two my sisters raving about one of the players some wimbledon star i promised id go and look at him im sorry you had to work this afternoon said miss nugent youre always standing in for gloria i wonder if she really was struck down by shellfish im going to ring up in a minute and see how she is oh i wouldnt do that said imogen hastily knowing perfectly well that gloria had sloped off to morecambe for the weekend with a boyfriend the er telephone in her digs is in the hall and im sure shes feeling far too weak to stagger down two flights of stairs to answer it feeling herself blushing at such a lie she busied about stacking up leaflets entitled your rights as a ratepayer and what to do in pikely bugger all gloria always said in answer to the latter miss nugent burrowed inside her cream rayon blouse and hauled up a bra strap decided where to go for your holiday yet not really answered imogen wishing some reader would come in and distract miss nugents attention my fathers swapping with a vicar in whitby in september i might go with him she dreaded discussing holidays everyone else in the library seemed to have planned trips to exotic places months ago and talked about nothing else she extracted a romantic novel called a kiss in tangier from books destined for the travel section and put it on top of the fiction pile on the front was a picture of a beautiful couple embracing against a background of amethyst ocean and pale pink minarets oh dear thought imogen sadly if only i could go to tangier and be swept off my size seven feet by a man with a haughty face and long legs the library was certainly quiet for a saturday in the lefthand corner where easy chairs were grouped round low tables an old lady had fallen asleep over lloyd georges letters a youth in a leather jacket was browsing through a biography of kevin keegan his lips moving as he read and little mr hargreaves was finishing another chapter of the pornographic novel he didnt dare take home for fear of his large wifes disapproval apart from an earnest young man with a beard and sandals flipping through the volumes of sociology and a coloured girl who got through four romances a day desperately trying to find one she hadnt read the place was deserted suddenly the door opened and two middleaged women came in redfaced from the hairdressers opposite smelling of lacquer and grumbling about the wind messing their new hairdos imogen took money for a fine from one and assured the other that catherine cookson really hadnt written another book yet authors have to write at their own pace you know said miss nugent reprovingly imogen watched the two women stopping to browse through the novels on the returned books trolley funny she thought wistfully how people tended to look there first rather than at the shelves how a book that appeared to be going out a lot was more likely to be in demand just like gloria three boys had been in asking for her already that day and had all looked sceptical on being told the shellfish story but imogen knew theyd all be back again asking for her next week you learnt a lot about the locals working in a library only this morning mr barraclough who unknown to his wife was having a walkout with the local nymphomaniac had taken out a book called how to live with a bad back then mr york reputed to have the most untroubled marriage in pikely had with much puffing and blowing rung in and asked imogen to reserve masters and johnson on sexual inadequacy and after lunch mrs bottomley one of her fathers newest parish workers and due to do the flowers for the first time in church next week had crept in and surreptitiously chosen four books on flower arrangement vivien leighs going well said miss nugent and youd better put david niven aside for repair before he falls to pieces when youve shelved that lot you can push off its nearly four oclock but next minute imogen had been accosted by a dotty old woman with darned stockings asking if they had any dustbin bags which led to a long explanation about how the old womans dog had been put down and she wanted to throw its basket and rubber toys away as soon as possible the dustmen dont come till wednesday and ill be reminded of him everytime i see them int dustbin imogens eyes brimmed with tears oh im so sorry she said after devoting five minutes to the old woman she turned to two small boys who came up to the desk looking very pink any books about life asked the eldest whose life said imogen biographies are over there you know factsa life babies and things said the boy his companion started to giggle imogen tried to hide a smile well the biology sections on the right she said dont be daft snapped miss nugent run along you lads and try the childrens library next door and hurry up and shelve those books imogen she watched the girl pushing the squeaking trolley across the library she was a nice child despite her timidity and tried very hard but she was so willing to listen to other peoples problems she always got behind with her own work imogen picked up a pile of alphabetically arranged books in her left hand so high that she could only just see over them and started to replace them in the shelves the collected editions were landmarks which made putting back easier sons and lovers was replaced at the end of a milky green row of d h lawrence return to jalna slotted into the coral pink edition of mazo de la roche even working in a library for two years had not lessened her love of reading there was frenchmans creek she stopped for a second remembering the glamour of the frenchman if only a man like that would come into the library but if he did hed be bound to fall in love with gloria a commotion at the issue desk woke her out of her reverie a man with a moustache and a purple face wearing a blazer was agitatedly waving a copy of molly parkins latest novel its filth he roared sheer filth i just came in here to tell you im going to burn it well youll have to pay for it then said miss nugent a lot of other readers have requested it filth and written by a woman roared the man in the blazer dont know how anyone dare publish it everyone in the library was listening now pretending to study the books on the shelves but brightening perceptibly at the prospect of a good row imogen returned the age of innocence to its right place and rolled the trolley back to the issue desk let me read you this bit madam shouted the man in the blazer run along now imogen said miss nugent hastily imogen hesitated embarrassed but longing to hear the outcome of the row go on said miss nugent firmly youll miss the tennis i wont be in on monday im going to florries funeral so ill see you on tuesday now sir she turned to the man in the blazer why do i always miss all the fun thought imogen going into the back office where miss illingworth was clucking over the legal action file ive written to the mayor five times about returning the hite report she said crossly youd think a man in his position maybe he thinks hes grand enough to keep books as long as he likes said imogen unlocking her locker and taking out her bag twentyone days is the limit and rules is rules my girl whether youre the queen of england have you seen mr cloths pc its a scream imogen picked up the postcard of blue sea and orange sand and turned it over i wouldnt like to live here the deputy librarian who was holidaying in sardinia had written but its a horrible place for a holiday the pillows are like bags of blue circle cement wish you were here but not queer b c imogen giggled then sighed inwardly not only had one to find somewhere smart to go on holiday but had to write witty things about it when you got there she went into the ladies to comb her hair and wash the violet ink from the date stamp off her hands she scowled at her reflection in the cracked mirror huge grey eyes rosy cheeks too many freckles a snub nose soft full lips long hair the colour of wet sand which had a maddening tendency to kink at the first sight of rain why do i look so young she thought crossly and why am i so fat she removed the mirror from the wall examining the full breasts wide hips and sturdy legs which went purple and mottled in cold weather and which fortunately today were hidden by black boots its a typical north country figure she thought gloomily built to withstand howling winds and an arctic climate during her last year at school she had been unceasingly ragged for weighing eleven stone now two years later she had lost over two stone but still felt herself to be fat and unattractive her younger sister juliet was waiting for her as she came out of the library far more fashionconscious than imogen she was wearing drainpipe pedal pushers brilliant coloured glove socks and a papier mâché ice cream cornet pinned to her huge sloppy pink sweater a tiny leather purse swung from her neck and her blonde curls blew in the wind as she circled round and round on her bicycle like a vulture there you are imogen for goodness sake hurry beresfords on court already and hes bound to win in straight sets did you bring fanny hill blast i forgot said imogen turning back oh leave it said juliet it doesnt matter and she set off down the cobbled streets pedalling briskly whats his name again said imogen panting beside her ive told you a million times beresford n beresford i hope the n doesnt stand for norman or anything ghastly mind you he could get away with it ive never seen anyone so divine last week imogen reflected juliet had been distraught with love for rod stewart the week before for georgie best although a pallid sun was shining afternoon shoppers muffled in scarves and sheepskin coats scuttled down the street heads down against the wind imogen and juliet arrived at the tennis club to find most of the spectators huddled for warmth around court one i cant see i cant see said juliet in a shrill voice let the little girl through said the crowd indulgently and in a few seconds juliet dragging a reluctant imogen by the hand had pummelled her way through to the front theres beresford she whispered pressing her face against the wire serving this end he was tall and slim with long legs smooth and brown as a conker and black curly hair his shoulder muscles rippled as he served his opponent didnt even see the ball a crackle of applause ran round the court game and first set to beresford said the umpire he plays tennis champion said a man in the crowd isnt he the end sighed juliet he looks ok from the back said imogen cautiously but as beresford turned round and sauntered back to the baseline for the next game she caught her breath with his lean brown features eyes bluer than delphiniums and glossy black moustache above a smooth curling sulky mouth he was the embodiment of all the romantic heroes shed ever dreamed of you win she muttered to juliet hes devastating in a daze she watched him cruise through the next three games without conceding a point then she could never remember afterwards exactly how it happened he was strolling back to the wire netting to retrieve a ball when suddenly he looked up and smiled at her he just stood there smiling his brilliant blue eyes burning holes in the netting the crowd was becoming restless beresford to serve snapped the umpire for the third time beresford shook himself picked up the ball and went back to the baseline he served a double fault at the first sight they have changed eyes crowed juliet who was doing the tempest for o level oh imogen did you see him look at you and he keeps on looking oh its too unfair why oh why arent i you imogen wondered if she had dreamed what had happened she glanced round to see if some beautiful girl the real object of beresfords attentions was standing behind her but there was only a fat woman in a purple trilby and two men his game had certainly gone to pieces he missed several easy shots and every time he changed ends he grinned at her hed better stop fooling about said juliet or hes going to lose this set as if by telepathy beresford seemed to pull himself together crouching like a tiger he played four games of rampaging brilliance to take the match without dropping a set how the crowd particularly imogen thundered their approval beresford put on a pale blue blazer and gathered up his four rackets as he came off court he stared straight at imogen suddenly she felt frightened as though the tiger shed been admiring at the zoo had just escaped from its cage lets go and find daddy she said are you mad said juliet stay put and beresfordll know where to find you but imogen seeing beresford pause to satisfy the demands of a group of autograph hunters had already bolted into the tea tent they found their father talking to the club secretary hullo he said have some tea and went back to his conversation a savage example of the church militant the reverend stephen brocklehurst had one great secular passion sport he was now giving the club secretary a blow by blow account of why beresford had played so badly the boy was overconfident of course thought he had the whole thing sewn up juliet giggled and applied herself to the cucumber sandwiches imogen sat in a dream until juliet nudged her beresfords just walked in she hissed imogen choked over her tea everyone was hailing him from all corners hes seen you whispered juliet hes working his way in this direction hullo nicky said the club secretary whatever happened to you beresford laughed showing very white teeth i saw something i fancied on the other side of the netting he said looking at imogen you ought to play in blinkers said the club secretary come and join us have you met our vicar mr brocklehurst and his daughters imogen and juliet no i havent said beresford shaking hands and holding imogens hand far longer than necessary before he sat down between her and the vicar brocklehurst he said reflectively as he dropped four lumps of sugar into his tea brocklehurst werent you capped for england just after the war mr brocklehurst melted like butter in a heatwave yes indeed clever of you to remember that after talking to the vicar about rugger for five minutes and having wangled himself an invitation to lunch next day beresford turned his attention to imogen well you certainly threw me he said softly its a good thing there werent any davis cup selectors about im so pleased you won stammered imogen and im pleased he looked straight into her eyes that youre even more beautiful close up so was he thought imogen far more beautiful with dark smudges under his eyes and damp tendrils curling round his forehead his voice was low and confiding as though she were the only person in the world he wanted to talk to and although he asked the usual questions what did she do for a living did she enjoy it did she ever come to london his smoky voice and the way his eyes wandered over her body and her face made even those familiar phrases sound significant a pale youth with long mousy hair wearing a vnecked sweater with reindeers round the border came up and cleared his throat nicky looked up without enthusiasm yes im from yorkshire television said the youth i wonder if we could have a few words with you when said nicky well now im busy it wont take long ill talk to you after the doubles now beat it said nicky curtly and turned back to imogen she gazed at him bewildered by such perfection perhaps it was the black rim round the iris or the thickness of the lashes that gave his blue eyes their intensity his suntan was so even it looked painted on and hed actually called her beautiful later that night she would bring out the remark like an iced cake saved from tea murmuring it over and over to herself trying to remember exactly the husky smouldering overtones of his voice where dyou play next she asked the thought of him going away was already unbearable nicky grinned rome on monday paris the week after then edinburgh wimbledon gstaad kitzbühel and then the north american circuit washington indianapolis toronto finally forest hills if i dont die of exhaustion imogen gasped scotland was the most abroad shed ever been to oh how lovely she said think of the postcards one could send nicky laughed i could face it if you came with me he said lowering his voice imogen blushed and gazed into her tea cup nicky watched her for a second trying to read the tealeaves theyre telling you that a tall dark tennis player has just come into your life he said hi said a voice behind them i see youve got yourself stuck in as usual nicky they had been so engrossed they hadnt noticed the arrival of a stocky grinning young man he was chewing gum and wearing a gold earring a pale blue tracksuit top and a blue towelling headband to keep his blond hair from flying about i came to see the reason you dropped three games in the singles he said this is it said nicky once more imogen felt herself colouring painfully congratulations said the young man giving imogen a comprehensive onceover and shifting his gum to the other side of his face you always had good taste nicky this is charlie painter said nicky my doubles partner fancies himself as a tough guy i dont take anything lying down except pretty girls said painter winking at juliet look if you can bear to tear yourself away were on court in a minute i cant said nicky turning his steady knowing smile on imogen again you dont need me you can thrash those two creeps with your hands behind your back the lights terrible its going to be like playing in a coal cellar said painter peering out of the tent well appeal against it said nicky you know im frightened of the dark and i want to go on chatting up miss brocklehurst imogen shot a fearful glance at her father but happily he was still nose to nose with the club secretary rhapsodising over hancocks try the loudspeaker hiccupped and announced the finals of the mens doubles reluctantly nicky got to his feet theres a party here this evening i wonder if you and your sister of course he added smiling at juliet would like to come oh yes please began imogen but the vicar promptly looked round good of you to ask them he said blandly but im afraid theyve already been booked to help at the mothers union whist drive we shall look forward to seeing you at lunch tomorrow any time after half past twelve both imogen and juliet opened their mouths in protest then shut them again they knew their father just for a second nickys eyes narrowed then he smiled i shall look forward to it too he said and followed painter out of the tent sod the mothers union muttered juliet i know you like them below the age of consent said painter as they walked towards the no court but isnt she a bit wet behind the ears older than she looks left school two years ago said nicky pausing to sign a couple of autographs and very nice dont you think sweet agreed painter signing them too and entirely untouched by human hand said nicky which makes a change we were the first that ever burst into that sunless sea said painter and laughed all the same youll never get your spoon into that pudding bet the old rev locks them both in chastity belts every night hes asked me to lunch so what hell still never let you get near enough to pull her want to bet said nicky taking a racket out of its press and making a few swipes with it bugger my shoulders playing up again a fiver said painter taking off his blue jacket make it a tenner said nicky flexing his shoulder all right youre on as he and painter took the first set nicky was aware of the vicar and his daughters watching him he was glad his first serve went in each time and for once volleys smashes lobs drop shots everything worked he was getting to the ball so quickly he had time to examine it for bugs before he hit it this was the kind of barnstorming form hed got to maintain for the rest of the season he flashed his teeth at imogen and saw she was about to go nicky had reached the age of twentysix without ever falling seriously in love he had had affairs by the score there were endless temptations on the tennis circuit if you were superbly fit you didnt just go to bed and read a book in the evenings if you won you wanted to celebrate if you lost you needed cheering up but on the whole his heart was more resilient than his self respect from broken affairs he recovered rapidly without any need of convalescence they left no scars and no regrets and sometimes he was sorry they didnt thinking he was missing out on something other people had and seemed to value although it caused them anguish at the time recently too he had felt a vague dissastisfaction with his life there had been trouble about his knocking off another players wife a mexican beauty whose insanely jealous husband had rumbled them the reason nicky was playing in pikely this week rather than hamburg was in the hope that the whole thing might blow over then last week an offer of an advertising commercial which would have brought him in several thousand a year had suddenly gone instead to another british player who although less glamorous than nicky had reached the finals of the big tournaments more often than nicky had the preceding year finally the night before hed driven up to pikely his coach had taken him out to dinner what are you playing at nicky boy he had asked after the second bottle with his usual mixture of bluntness and concern youve got everything going for you but youre not getting any younger and youll never make it really big unless you cut out the birds and the booze and the late nights havent you ever thought of settling down nicky had replied that he had too much trouble settling up in life to think of any permanent commitment his debts were crippling at the moment he said and they had both laughed but the coachs remarks had stung and nicky had not forgotten them as the crowd clapped approvingly at the end of the set mr brocklehurst dragged his protesting daughters away saying they mustnt be late for the whist drive nicky had looked so sensational on court that imogen could hardly believe their têteàtête in the tea tent had ever taken place but as she left he had waved his racket at her so it must be true as they drove home to the vicarage with juliets bike perched precariously on the roof rack they passed a school friend of juliets riding home from a gymkhana festooned with rosettes who gave them a lordly wave with her whip just showing off silly bitch muttered juliet p in the swear box reproached the vicar but mildly because he doted on his younger daughter as he crossed the river darrow and took the road up to the moors he too felt a faint dissatisfaction with life watching beresford today had reminded him of his youth on the rugger field he had been good looking too and had experienced the same adulation from women and heroworship from men having achieved the ultimate glory of playing rugger for england said an unkind fellow clergyman steve brocklehurst spent the rest of his life in exhausted mediocrity mr brocklehurst was also only too aware that another great athlete david shepherd had made bishop but no such promotion had come his way no doubt he would be left to moulder away the rest of his life in pikely where the adoration of the spinsters of the parish was no substitute for the stands rising at twickenham in his more gloomy moments the vicar thought there was a great deal to be said for an athlete dying young cut off in his prime rather than growing paunchy and rheumaticky life however had its compensations he was well respected in the district no local committee was complete without him he loved his garden and his games of golf and his vague charming wife probably in that order his two sons both at boarding school and costing the earth were shaping up as excellent athletes michael was already in the fifteen juliet adorable insouciant the baby of the family could twist him round her little finger but as a man of god it had always nagged his conscience like a bit of apple core wedged in ones teeth that his elder daughter imogen got on his nerves in the beginning hed resented her not being a boy as she grew up he was irritated by her clumsiness her dreaminess her slowness her tender heart how easily he could reduce her to tears her inability to stand up to him and her complete lack of athleticism he still remembered a humiliating gym display at her school a few years ago when imogen had been the only one in her class who totally failed to get over any of the apparatus he had also been deeply ashamed of her lumpiness but at least shed slimmed down a bit lately and shed kept her job in the library which helped out with the housekeeping money was very tight with three children still at school but why did she have to agree with everything he said like one of those nodding doggies in the back of cars there was no doubt though that young beresford seemed taken with her and needed keeping an eye on the vicar might not love his elder daughter but he wouldnt let her come to any harm he had been a bit of a lad himself in his day and like most reformed rakes he veered towards repressive puritanism where his daughters were concerned he was only too aware of the lusts of young players after too much beer next moment he caught sight of his curate on his shiny new red racing bicycle with its drop handlebars which the vicar thought both undignified and far too young for him he waited until they were only a few yards behind the curate then sounded his horn loudly which made the poor young man nearly ride into the ditch the vicar chuckled to himself and turned up the drive the vicarage was one of those draughty victorian houses made only slightly less forbidding by the creepers and rambler roses surging up its dark grey walls and the wallflowers and purple irises in the front flower beds at the back of the house was a lawn long enough for a cricket pitch where imogen bowled endlessly to her younger brothers when they were home on either side were herbaceous borders and at the end long grass and bluebells growing round the trunks of an ancient orchard as they opened the front door homer the golden retriever his eyes screwed up from sleep greeted them singing with pleasure looking frantically round for something to bring them and settling for a pair of socks lying on the floor going through the hall with its old coats hanging on a row of pegs and a pile of parish magazines waiting to be delivered imogen found her mother in the drawingroom looking rather pious and virtuously sewing buttons on one of her fathers shirts she knew perfectly well that her mother had been reading a novel and had shoved it under the shirt the moment she heard wheels on the gravel hullo darling she said vaguely had a nice time at the tennis yes thank you said imogen kissing her she knew there was no point in saying any more her mother wouldnt listen to the answer i suppose we ought to get changed for the whist drive said mrs brocklehurst with a sigh what time does it begin eight oclock said the vicar coming through the door hullo darling just time for me to plant out my antirrhinums well of all the blooming cheats said juliet to his departing back as he went out of the french windows we could have stayed and watched the last set after all i hope his rotten snapdragons never come up the whist drive seemed to last an eternity but eventually the final chair had been stacked in the church hall and the last volauvent crumb swept away dont you sometimes wish daddy had been an engineer said juliet as she and imogen trailed home yes said imogen listening to the lambs bleating in the field behind the house and praying that nicky wasnt enjoying his party too much i say juliet she felt herself blushing it did happen didnt it this afternoon i mean course it did said juliet even daddy got the wind up and whisked you home normally hed never leave in the middle of a match when she got home imogen washed her hair undressed and got into bed then she filled the rest of may and the whole of june in her diary ecstatically describing her meeting with nicky shivering with excitement and wonder at the imperious way hed dismissed yorkshire television and told his partner to appeal against the light to give him more time with her why me why me she kept saying over and over again burying her hot face in her pillow and squirming with delight she must get some sleep or shed look terrible in the morning but it only seemed a few seconds later that she was woken by homer barking at the paper boy and the church bell tolling for holy communion and the sunday morning panic of her father calling from the depth of the hot cupboard that he couldnt find a clean shirt chapter two imogen sat clutching a cup of black coffee at breakfast the vicar mopping up egg yolk with fried bread was deep in the sports pages of the sunday times while juliet who was eating toast and marmalade peered across at the headlines what a dreadful world she sighed i dont think i shall ever live to see twentyone what are we having for lunch asked imogen macaroni cheese plum tart and custard and then i suppose more cheese said her mother vaguely but we cant give him that said juliet aghast i mean hes famous cant we have a joint im afraid the shops arent open on sunday said her mother ill try and persuade daddy to open a bottle of wine imogen wondered how on earth she could last through the morning but in the end there seemed to be lots to do frantic hoovering and dusting bashing lilac stems and arranging them with irises in a big bowl in the drawingroom laying the table trying and failing to find matching wine glasses making a crumble top to liven up the plums mixing a dressing for the salad and praying that the vicar who disapproved of frivolous culinary refinements wouldnt notice the addition of garlic then she had to go to matins it was a beautiful day the cuckoo was calling from the beech wood beyond the churchyard and the trees were putting out acid green leaves against a heavy navy blue sky which promised rain later defend us with thy mighty power and grant that this day we run into no sin prayed the vicar addressing the congregation in a ringing voice juliet grinned and nudged imogen who went pink and gazed straight in front of her she had already prayed fervently to god to grant her nicky but only she added hastily if he thought it was all right her father was getting to his feet a hymn and a sermon and another hymn thought imogen thankfully and they would be out in the sunshine again she mustnt forget to pick up the cream for the crumble from the farm then she gave a gasp of horror for she saw that her father with what seemed a suspiciously malicious glance at their pew was walking over to the litany desk oh no groaned juliet we had the litany last week beresford will have come and gone by the time we get out of here and what about my pie in the oven muttered mrs connolly their daily woman who was sitting in the pew behind the congregation knelt down sulkily never had imogen found it more difficult to concentrate on her imperfections from fornication and all other deadly sin and from all the deceits of the world the flesh and the devil intoned the vicar good lord deliver us imogen chorused listlessly with the rest of the congregation oh why hadnt she had a bath beforehand from lightning and tempest from plague pestilence and the sun was shining outside the church but inside it was freezing the vicar who never felt the cold insisted on turning off the radiators in april it was twenty past twelve by the time she got home and nicky was due at a quarter to one to warm herself up she had far too hot a bath having tried on every dress in her wardrobe and hating them all she settled for a black sweater and skirt which at least slimmed her down a bit her legs looked red and fat through her pale stockings if only shed got out of the bath sooner there was no doubt she thought sadly if there was less of you people thought more of you going out of her room she nearly fell over juliet who was lying on the floor in the passage pulling up the zip on her jeans how do i look said juliet scrambling to her feet familiar said imogen thats my shirt juliet looked her over critically you look nice but i think you should tone down some of that rouge its not rouge sighed imogen its me it was five to one imogen checked that everything was all right in the kitchen and went into the drawingroom to wait she picked up the colour magazine there was a long piece on katherine mansfield which she vowed to read later but knew she never would she had read the report of a tournament in hamburg three times at breakfast particularly the bit about the british contribution being severely weakened by the absence of beresford who was playing at pikely where he triumphed in the singles doubles and mixed doubles as was to be expected nicky was so illustrious it was as though the sun was coming to lunch once more she got her compact out of her bag and powdered her pink cheeks with more energy than success oh to have been born pale and interesting it was five past one now perhaps he wasnt coming after all perhaps after all that winning hed forgotten or met someone at the party last night she put down the magazine and wandered nervously round the room rearranging the lilac plumping cushions straightening juliets music which was littered over the top of the piano the clock that had dawdled all morning suddenly started to gallop it was edging towards a quarter past one now her father always kicked up a fuss if lunch was late it was quite obvious nicky wasnt coming i cant bear it she thought in anguish then suddenly she heard the rattle of a car on the sheep track and homer barking next minute her hands went to her face in terror and excitement then frantically she smoothed her hair pulled down her sweater and put on more scent most of which went over the carpet in a panic she rushed into the hall and locked herself into the downstairs lavatory next moment juliet was shaking the door come out quickly nickys just rolled up in a porsche looking too fantastic for words go and let him in i cant squeaked imogen you go im putting on the broccoli and mummys still tarting up go on hes your lover imogen came out wiping her sweating hands on her skirt she could see a mans figure through the bubbly glass panel of the front door the bell rang anyone for tennis players cried juliet oh shut up said imogen go on hell think weve forgotten and go away with a trembling hand imogen opened the door nicky was bending down to pat homer who was wagging his blond plumy tail and carrying a stick youre not much of a watchdog said nicky rubbing his ears hullo angel he straightened up and smiled at her sorry im late i took a wrong turning and got stuck behind a convoy of sunday motorists doesnt matter its lovely to see you said imogen she had wondered if hed look less glamorous out of tennis things like sailors out of uniform but he looked even better wearing a scarlet shirt which set off his suntan and jeans which clung to his lean muscular hips even more tightly than juliets come in here she muttered going towards the drawingroom nicky stepped forward to open the door for her reaching the handle the same time as she did letting his hand linger on hers far longer than necessary would you like a glass of sherry she said its quite dry id prefer beer if youve got some im supposed to be in training ill go and get it wont be a second dont be ill miss you said nicky picking up the paper and turning to the sports page imogen rushed into the kitchen fortunately there were six long life in the fridge hows it going said juliet dropping broccoli spears into boiling water i dont know said imogen rushing out nearly falling over homer promise you wont leave me alone with him too long what i like about this house is its relaxed atmosphere said juliet nastase won at hamburg said nicky putting down the paper and taking the can and a glass from imogen do you know him yes hes a great mate of mine he walked over to the french windows this is a lovely house its a bit scruffy said imogen acutely aware of the worn carpets the catshredded armchairs and the faded red cutains which had shrunk in the wash and hung three inches above the window ledge nicky however used to the impersonality of hotel bedrooms only noticed the booklined walls the friendly dog the fat tabby cat asleep on the piles of music on top of the piano the church times scrumpled up under the logs in the fireplace waiting to be lit on a cold night and the apple trees snowed under with blossom at the end of the garden its a family house he said my father was in the army so i spent my childhood being humped from one married quarter to another i always longed for a real home he glanced across at imogen gazing at him with such compassion he had also seen how deeply moved and delighted shed been when he arrived he was touched he liked this solemn little girl with the huge eyes you smell marvellous he said moving towards her its not me its the carpet confessed imogen there was a pause what could she say next if only she had the badinage and readymade phrases like juliet or gloria lunch wont be long she stammered as nicky sat down on the sofa would you like some peanuts no thank you said nicky softly i want five minutes alone with you come and sit beside me he patted the sofa imogen sat down there was another pause she stared at her hands aware that he was watching her then they both jumped out of their skin as the large tabby cat leapt off the beethoven sonatas on to the treble keys of the piano and proceeded to plink plonk his way down to the bass clef and walk with dignity out of the french windows they both burst out laughing it broke the ice was it a nice party last night asked imogen how could it be you werent there said nicky i drank too much cheap wine and nearly came and broke up your whist drive i wish you had said imogen wistfully when dyou go to rome tonight im driving straight to heathrow from here might reach the quarter finals this year ive got an easy draw and a friend of nastases too thought imogen doesnt it frighten you so much success so early she asked nicky laughed softly with pleasure shed fed him the right cue i dont frighten easily he said taking her hand and spreading the fingers out on his thigh she heard a step outside and terrified it might be her father snatched her hand away but it was only her mother in a crumpled flowered dress smelling faintly of mothballs which shed obviously just got out of the drawer there was also too much powder on one side of her nose mr beresford how nice to see you she said teetering forward on uncomfortable and unfamiliar high heels has imogen given you a drink shes awfully forgetful oh god thought imogen i do hope shes not going to be too embarrassing shes looked after me beautifully said nicky as mrs brocklehurst helped herself to a glass of sherry and i love your house she was followed by juliet who sat on the piano stool patting homer and grinning at nicky hi she said thats a nice dog said nicky whats his name homer said juliet short for homersexual hes always mounting male dogs really darling thats not true said mrs brocklehurst mildly who plays the piano asked nicky i do said juliet im thinking of taking up the cello as my second instrument and next moment she was bombarding nicky with questions about tennis stars was nastase as difficult as everyone made out and stan smith as deadpan as he looked and did borg have lots of girls to have a better look at nicky mrs brocklehurst removed her spectacles leaving a red mark on the bridge of her nose goodness she thought he really is a very good looking young man and he seems nice too whats connors like said juliet darling poor nicky remonstrated her mother give him a chance and go and mash the potatoes daddyll be in in a minute when did you first decide to become a tennis player she said to nicky when i was a child i used to go down to the courts at seven oclock in the morning hanging around hoping for a chance to play every time i seemed to get a rapport with a coach my father was posted somewhere else i used to spend hours playing imaginary matches with myself hitting a ball against the garage door how splendid i suppose if one wants to do anything badly enough in life one usually does i like to think so said nicky shooting an unashamedly undressing glance in imogens direction and rubbing his foot against hers behind the safety of an occasional table the vicar came in rubbing his hands and looking quite benevolent spectacles on his nose ah good morning nicholas lunch not ready yet preachings thirsty work you know it wont be a minute said his wife soothingly juliets just doing the potatoes is there time for a quick look round the garden asked nicky of course said the vicar with alacrity bring your drink out what a nice young man said her mother unbelievable sighed imogen there was an embarrassing moment before lunch i expect youd like a wash said the vicar pointing to the door of the downstairs lavatory he always liked male visitors in particular to go in there so they could admire his old england and harlequin rugger groups hanging on the wall im not sure theres any loo paper said mrs brocklehurst there wasnt said juliet crossing the hall with the macaroni cheese so i tore some pages out of the parish mag lunch however was a success nicky had two helpings of macaroni cheese which pleased mrs brocklehurst talked at length to the vicar about the british lions and regaled them with gossip about tennis players and the various celebrities hed bumped into on the circuit im afraid im talking too much he said no no said mrs brocklehurst eagerly we lead such sheltered lives in pikely fancy virginia wade reading henry james between matches have you really met rod stewart sighed juliet the vicar surprisingly opened a second bottle of wine i wish we could have wine at the mothers union said mrs brocklehurst it would make things so much less sticky what about hash rock cakes said juliet taking a slug of wine eat up imogen snapped the vicar she was still struggling with her first helping the food seemed to choke her picking away like a sparrow went on the vicar his voice taking on a bullying tone or more like a crow in that colour i do wish young people wouldnt wear black imogen bit her lip bastard thought nicky he turned to the vicar how dyou think englandll do against the west indies that should keep the old bugger gassing for a few minutes out of the corner of his eye he examined imogen mentally undressing her he would take her later in the heather and be very gentle and reassuring he was certain she was a virgin they ought to bring back dexter the vicar was saying dont bother to finish imogen whispered her mother i should clear if i were you thankfully imogen gathered up the macaroni cheese and the plates as she took nickys he stroked the back of her leg the one farthest away from the vicar she went into the kitchen and licking macaroni cheese off her fingers dumped the plates in the sink she picked up a dryingup cloth bent down and opened the oven door as she was just easing out the plum crumble she heard a step behind her isnt he the most utterly fantastic man youve ever seen she murmured from the depths of the oven glad you think so said a husky voice behind her appalled she swung round nicky holding a vegetable dish in each hand was standing laughing in the doorway the crumble was burning her through the dryingup cloth she shoved it down on the kitchen table nicky put down the dishes and ran a finger caressingly down her cheek sweetheart you must learn not to blush its terribly pretty but itll give you away to your unspeakable father imogen terrified hed try and kiss her when she tasted of macaroni cheese hastily handed him the plates we must go back but nicky waited in the doorway holding the plates and still grinning at her imogen stared fixedly at the door hinge where generations had cracked the paint screwing off the tops of refractory bottles itll get cold she stammered i wont though said nicky and brushed her cheek with his lips as she scuttled past him youve forgotten the plates snapped her father ive got them said nicky must say im dying to sample imogens er pudding he winked at juliet who giggled dont you get nervous before a big match she said no he shot a glance in imogens direction the suspense turns me on whats goolagong like asked juliet sweet much prettier in the flesh nicky poured cream thickly over his crumble always humming to herself and laughing if she does a good shot she never knows what the score is he then told them a story about one of the linesmen falling asleep in a big match hed had too good a lunch he went on the crowd were quite hysterical with laughter his eyes are as dark as pansies now thought imogen trying to memorise every feature of his face his hands were beautiful too so brown and longfingered she suddenly felt quite weak with longing then she felt a gentle pressure against her ankle it must be homer rubbing against her but he only begged during the meat courses he was now stretched out in the sun under the window twitching fluffy yellow paws in his sleep nicky continued to talk quite calmly to her father but the pressure against her ankle became more insistent good congregation he asked draining his wine glass pretty good said the vicar he looks sensational in those jeans thought imogen in spite of their tightness and although he was sitting down not an ounce of spare flesh billowed over the top her mind misted over she didnt even hear nicky asking her father what he had preached his sermon about or her father replying ask imogen she was there what was it about asked nicky smiling wickedly at imogen what sorry she said startled wake up said her father im sorry i was thinking about something else nicky wants to know what my er sermon was about there was a distinct edge to the vicars voice she felt the blood rushing to her face they were all looking at her now nicodemus muttered juliet oh yes stammered imogen gratefully the wind blowing where it listeth and people who believe in god having everlasting life with a shaking hand she reached out for her wine praying the storm was over nicky looked at his watch good god its nearly quarter to three ive missed gardeners question time said the vicar i hope i havent gone on too much said nicky modestly in the sure knowledge that he hadnt if you care about something you tend to bang on about it oh no said mrs brocklehurst its been fascinating hasnt it stephen we shall all enjoy wimbledon so much more having met you i must drive back to london soon said nicky but i wouldnt mind a walk on the moor first he increased the pressure of his foot on imogens ankle i must write my evensong sermon said the vicar regretfully and someones coming at four to borrow a dog collar for the dramatic societys play i must bath homer said juliet imogen will take you said mrs brocklehurst thats what i hoped said nicky smiling at imogen why has imogen painted her eyelids bright green to go walking on the moors asked the vicar as he helped his wife with the washingup im afraid shes fallen in love said mrs brocklehurst shes for the moors and martyrdom muttered juliet the wind had dropped since yesterday and as they climbed up the moor the hot sun had set the larks singing and was drawing them up the sky the bracken uncurled pale green fingers lambs ran races and bleated for their mothers bit of a sod to you your pa isnt he said nicky he was disappointed i wasnt a boy said imogen jesus im bloody glad youre not he slid an arm round her about six inches above the waist very very glad he repeated as his fingers encountered the underside of her breast imogen leapt away they could still be seen from the house dont know if youre more frightened of me or him said nicky oh i dont feel at all the same way about you protested imogen its just that ive never met a famous person before nicky laughed ill introduce you to lots more if you promise not to fancy them imogen not nearly as fit as nicky was soon puffing fortunately he did most of the talking its a lonely life being a tennis player here today gone tomorrow thousands of acquaintances very few friends never in one place long enough to establish a proper relationship he gave a deep sigh imogen her perceptions a little blunted by wine at lunch did not smile she looked at him sympathetically will you think of me occasionally when youre beavering away in your little library oh yes all the time thats nice he said taking her hand and pulling her down beside him in the heather close to she smelt of toothpaste and clean shining hair rather like his little nieces when they came downstairs after their baths to say goodnight thought nicky sentimentally he raised imogens hand to his lips across the valley the khaki hillside was latticed with stone walls the fells glowed a misty violet you could just see the mill chimneys a dingy shadow in the distance isnt it beautiful said imogen desperately trying to remain calm not nearly as beautiful as you are said nicky and your pulse my darling he added feeling her wrist is going like the charge of the light brigade do you believe in love at first sight i dont know stammered imogen truthfully well i do the moment i saw you yesterday pow it happened as though id been struck by a thunderbolt i dont know what it is about you but its something indefinable quite apart from being beautiful he put his arm round her holding her tightly so she couldnt wriggle free after a minute she ceased to resist and lay back all the sky seemed concentrated in those blue eyes and as he kissed her she felt the stalks of the heather sticking into her back it was all so smooth so practised so different from the grabbing and fumbling of the few local boys who had made passes at her that it was a few seconds before imogen realised what was happening suddenly his hand had crept under her sweater and snapped open her bra and her left breast fell warm and heavy into his other hand no no nicky we mustnt why not sweetheart dont you like it oh yes yes i do but well hush then he was kissing her again and his free hand was inching up her thigh paralysis seemed to have set into her limbs she was powerless to fight against him then suddenly a tremendous crashing in the bracken made them jump out of their skins rescue had appeared in the form of a large black labrador which stood lolling its pink tongue its tail beating frantically heavens said imogen in a strangled voice its dorothy whos dorothy the churchwardens dog which means the churchwarden must be in the vicinity said nicky smoothing his hair the dog charged back into the bracken horrified imogen wriggled back into her bra which had ridden up giving her four bosoms like a cow and went and sat on a mosscovered rock a few yards away gazing down into the valley beneath them the churchwarden was taking his afternoon stroll far below she could see her father walking back and forth in the orchard memorising his sermon i must be crazy she said and buried her face in her hands nicky came over and put his arms round her its all right love all my fault i just want you too much and you want me dont you she nodded dumbly but not in front of the whole parish eh well have to find somewhere more secluded next time he looked at his watch i must go now you will write to me wont you he said as he slid into his sleek silver car imogen didnt know if she could bear so much happiness and unhappiness in one day against the joy of his wanting her was the utter misery of his going away look thy last on all things lovely she thought her eyes filling with tears nicky rummaged about in the glove compartment ive got something for you he handed her a small box and watched her bowed head and the incredulous smile on her pale lips as she opened it she took out a red enamel bracelet painted with yellow blue and green flowers but its beautiful she gasped sliding it on to her wrist you shouldnt i cant believe no ones ever given me ill never take it off except in the bath its like a gipsy caravan she added moving her wrist so the painted flowers flashed in the sunshine thats because its a present from a gipsy said nicky turning on the ignition see you when i get back from paris and kissing her lightly on the lips he drove off with a roar of exhaust which set the cat leaping in horror out of its comfortable bed of catmint on the edge of the drive imogen nicky reflected without a flicker of conscience as he headed for the a had been far more delighted with the bracelet than his mexican beauty who after a few shrieks of pleasure had asked nicky to keep the trinket for her in case her husband noticed it and kicked up a fuss chapter three imogen couldnt wait to get to the library next morning and tell gloria all about nicky fortunately miss nugent had gone to the funeral mr clough her deputy was still on holiday and the only other senior mr cornelius was busy making a display of fishing rods nets and flies in the main entrance to encourage readers to take out some of the new sporting books so gloria and imogen more or less had the place to themselves this is him said imogen opening the world of tennis annual and showing gloria a photograph of nicky stretching up muscles rippling to take a smash and here he is again coming off court after beating mark cox oh i know him said gloria peering at the book seen him on telly playing at wimbledon wasnt there some row because he threw his racket at a linesman she turned the book round to the light hes certainly fantastic looking but so much better in the flesh said imogen dreamily putting a pile of romances on the nonfiction pile hes got this way of looking at you and the husky way he drops his voice and says things that no one but you can hear and then we went for this heavenly walk on the moors and he said when he saw me it was like being struck down by a thunderbolt did he try anything said gloria imogen blushed well he couldnt do much because the churchwarden suddenly came round the corner walking his dog gloria looked at the photograph again and then incredulously at imogen who was so unsophisticated how could a man like nicky possibly fancy her she felt slightly irritated too she gloria was the one who had the adventures imogen the one who listened in awed amazement she wasnt too keen on such role reversal when are you going to see him again she said picking out a catherine cookson novel and putting it aside to be repaired well hes playing in tournaments most of the summer but he said itd be soon and in a more secluded place this time said imogen fingering her red bracelet she was disappointed that gloria wasnt more enthusiastic then she added humbly but just think gloria if you hadnt gone to morecambe she looked round nervously i mean been struck down by shellfish youd have come down to the tennis club with me and it would have been you hed have fallen for instead she suddenly felt faint with horror at the thought dont talk so daft said gloria patting her curls and cheering up because secretly she agreed with imogen anyway hes promised to write to me sighed imogen oh gloria youve no idea how beautiful he is in fact nicky proved an extremely bad correspondent he sent her one postcard from rome saying he wished she were there imogen wrote back by return of post a long passionate letter which took her hours to compose pouring her heart out with the aid of the oxford dictionary of quotations the rome tournament ended and imogen glowed with pride as she read in the paper that nicky had reached the quarter finals and then only been knocked out after a terrific fight then he moved on to paris working his way steadily down the singles draw and even reaching the semifinals of the mens doubles every paper commented on his improved game but no letters arrived hell ring you when he gets back to england said juliet soothingly but imogen was in despair it had all been a dream probably her last letter had been too soppy and put him off what right anyway had anyone as dull and fat as she to expect nicky to fancy her she couldnt eat she couldnt sleep and mooned around in her room playing the gramophone and reading love poems nicky had turned out her heart as one might scrabble through an old chest of drawers throwing everything into confusion on the third monday after their first meeting imogen walked to work in despair there had been no letter on saturday and after an interminable hours wait no letter this morning she darent ring up home to see if anything had arrived midmorning in case she got her father yet again she was on until eight this evening she wondered how shed ever get through the day her black gloom if anything was intensified by the beauty of the day a slight breeze had set the new grass waving and catching the light cow parsley frothed along the verges white candles still lit the darkening chestnuts and the hawthorns exploding like rockets gave off a soapy sexy smell in the warm sun it was all so bridal rioting and voluptuous she was glad to reach the narrow streets of pikely with their blackened houses and dingy mill chimneys and escape into the cool gloom of the library she was met by miss nugent in a maroon dress and a foul temper youre ten minutes late theres two trolleys of books to be shelved you didnt finish half those withdrawal forms on saturday and you sent the mayor an overdue notice when he returned the books weeks ago its not good enough you know there are plenty of others whod like your job cant say i know any muttered gloria whisking up in yellow shorts and a tight chocolate brown sweater and dumping a pile of books on the trolley the old bags on the warpath this morning she whispered to imogen no one can do a thing right old cornelius should have been back from his holiday but he sent her a cable saying stranded in gib i expect hes fallen for one of the monkeys did you get a letter imogen shook her head thats a shame said gloria with all the enthusiasm of the secretly relieved dont fret all men are lousy letter writers i went to a terrific party on saturday night tony lightband was there he really fancies you he wants me to fix up a foursome thats nice said imogen failing to sound enthusiastic tony lightband was five foot three wore spectacles thick as the bottom of beer bottles and was inflated with his own importance cloughs back from his hols looks lovely and brown said gloria will you girls stop gossiping snapped miss nugent bustling out of the inside office and turn off the lights imogen or mr brighouse will be over in a flash complaining about his rates the day got progressively worse imogen didnt seem to be able to do a thing right even the sky began to cloud over it was early afternoon imogen was on the request desk answering queries finding books for people miss nugent had also given her the least favourite task in the library of chasing up unreturned books lady jacinthas had the new dick francis six weeks she said handing imogen the list and brigadier simmonds has still got the slim biography and you must get on to mrs heseltine at once shes got twelve books out including the wombles in danger and andy pandy i want the whole lot dealt with today tick them off as you telephone yes miss nugent said imogen listlessly miss nugent relented a little the last thing she wanted was to bully imogen into giving in her notice i only keep on at you because i think youre worth taking trouble with she said offering imogen a polo theres no point bothering with gloria shell just go off and get married but youve got the makings of a good librarian have you thought any more about taking the library diploma youll miss it this year if you dont sign on soon its always a good idea to have a training if you cant bank on finding a hubby imogen knew miss nugent meant it kindly but it only made her feel more depressed hows it going said gloria half an hour later awful said imogen brigadier simmonds would like to courtmartial me mrs heseltine keeps pretending to be the spanish au pair and not understanding and lady jacinthas butler obviously has no intention of passing on the message nugent always gives you the lousy jobs look why dont we go to the pictures tomorrow night this was a great concession imogen realised gloria didnt believe in wasting evenings on girlfriends i cant ive got to go to my first aid class she said gloomily dont say nugents pressganged you into that imogen nodded were doing the kiss of life tomorrow i do hope mr blount doesnt use me as the model finish me off altogether i say said gloria lowering her voice judy brighouses just been in and taken out understanding cystitis she only came back from her honeymoon last night bet theyve been at it all the time oo look hes back a goodlooking man in a green velvet jacket came through the swing doors and up to the desk i think i left richard strauss behind he said you did said gloria giving him the book and the benefit of one of her hot stripping glances which sent him crashing back against the doors nearly falling over the fire bucket on the way it says pull not push said gloria smirking at the effect shed had on him wish hed try and pull me hes lovely no good to you lass said mr clough on his way to a nalgo meeting hes on his third marriage and hes already got four children to support he turned to imogen tell your dad ive just got that gardening book in if hed like a quick look before we put it into circulation he can keep it until wednesday theres something rather attractive about cloughie said gloria shoving a couple of requested books into a side shelf heres just the thing for you imogen how to stop feeling depressed and inadequate i am inadequate sighed imogen oh come on said gloria do cheer up we dont want you dripping over everyone like a chinese water torture all week a man in dungarees came reeling up to the desk where can i find books on starting ones own business he said over there said gloria adding in an undertone absolutely reeked of drink didnt he expect hes just been fired said imogen oh look mr passmores fallen asleep over the financial times no ones allowed to sleep in a library said gloria its in the bylaws go and wake him up telephone gloria said miss nugent bustling up reader with a query its come through in my office can you go and man the issue desk imogen miss hockneys gone to tea and theres a queue waiting gathering up her papers imogen went and sat down at the desk at the entrance of the library and began to check peoples books in once shed dealt with the queue she went back to her overdue list susan bridges had kept colloquial german and scaling the matterhorn out since february when she met that austrian ski instructor she picked up the telephone and dialled miss bridgess number but there was no answer probably at work she looked at the pile of cards in front of her if you have returned the books in the last few days please ignore this letter the words blurred before her eyes outside the sky was darkening oh nicky nicky she thought desperately will i ever see you again she looked at the red bracelet on her wrist tracing the pattern of the flowers with her finger shivering at the memory of that day on the moor thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter in sleep a king but waking no such matter she whispered sadly nicky was the black rowntrees fruit gum everyone wanted how ridiculous to think that he could ever have fancied her for more than a moment she was so deep in thought she didnt see a large badtempered woman in a trilby with a snarling boxer on a lead until theyd come pounding through the door imogen steeled herself for a fight im terribly sorry you cant bring dogs in here where am i supposed to leave him snapped the woman there are dog hooks provided outside the door you could tie him to one of those hed howl the place down and break his lead its not safe in this traffic ive come all the way from skipton ill only take five minutes im sorry said imogen nervously shall i hold him for you she advanced towards the dog which bared its teeth and growled ominously she backed away have your hand off said its owner now are you going to let me in or do you want me to go over your head imogen had a lunatic vision of the woman and dog taking off and flying over her head through the room im sorry dogs simply arent allowed she repeated i need the books for my work ill complain to the council ive got fines on all these books imogen looked hopelessly round for help miss nugent had disappeared gloria was on the telephone miss hockney was surreptitiously making wedding lists on the request desk if we allowed one dog in wed have to let the whole lot she said firmly thats whats wrong with this country snapped the woman straightening her trilby and storming through the doors bloody civil servant she shouted back at imogen i must not cry said imogen gritting her teeth i must not drip like a chinese water torture i say said gloria rushing up and patting her hair that richard strauss man in the velvet jackets just phoned up from a call box and asked me out goodness whats up with you a woman with a boxer just called me a bloody civil servant old cow shes not allowed to swear in a library its in the bylaws too and anyway were not civil servants were local government officers she switched back to the richard strauss man he didnt even know my name just asked for the glamorous one she said squinting at her reflection in the glass door didnt think i was looking very good today either imogen went wearily back to her overdue postcards laboriously filling in the computer number of each book i say breathed gloria get a load of him dont bother me said imogen ive got to finish these beastly things anyway im not interested in men any more youll be interested in this said gloria faintly no i wont ever again my life is over said imogen then a familiar husky voice said very softly have you got a book called would the assistant like to come out to lunch imogen looked up and gave an unbelieving cry for there resplendent in a white suit and dark blue shirt was nicky she gave a whimper and a gasp and getting clumsily to her feet ran round her desk and crashed into him burying her face in his shoulder i cant believe it she said her voice thick with tears hey hey said nicky lifting her chin with his finger and smiling down at her theres no need to cry little one i said id come back didnt i i didnt think id ever see you again didnt you get my postcard yes i did it was lovely nicky shook his head oh ye of little faith he said gently and well aware that there was now a gaping audience including miss nugent watching him he bent his head and kissed her lingeringly but what are you doing here said imogen wiping away her tears with the back of her hand i thought you were in edinburgh got a walkover chap im playing pulled a muscle wants to rest it for wimbledon i dont have to play till tomorrow afternoon can i have a bed for the night preferably yours imogen laughed joyfully of course you can ill ring mummy the only problem is the boys have been home for half term so the placell be in a bit of a shambles nicky was stroking her face now tenderly smoothing away a smudge of mascara with his thumb can you get out for some lunch now he said softly imogen eyed a disapproving and approaching miss nugent not really ive already eaten and im on till eight oh isnt it a drag well that works out quite well said nicky ill go and have a workout down at the club and then ive got to do a short interview for yorkshire television this afternoon seemed a good opportunity ill be through by eight ill come and pick you up and well go and have dinner somewhere but im not dressed for it wailed imogen conscious of her old grey sweater and jeans you look beautiful said nicky who only noticed how her grey eyes shone at the sight of him and how the stitches of the old sweater gaped over her bosom and how with no makeup on she looked about fourteen you could never look anything else there was a disapproving cough behind them nicky turned a dazzling smile on miss nugent you must be imogens boss he said ive heard so much about you he was so lovely to everyone thought imogen as she introduced him miss nugent was now patting her crenellated curls and simpering like a schoolgirl even miss hockney had put down her shopping list gloria was smouldering so hard shed burst into flames any minute would you like a cup of tea she said nicky shook his head i must get down to the club outside the swing doors he kissed imogen again its been a very long three weeks he said im glad youre still wearing my bracelet funny he thought as he drove down the high street how pleased he was to see her if painter hadnt nagged him about not winning his bet he doubted if hed have bothered to look her up again but now he had he was glad he felt all the satisfaction of a dog with a number of bones buried round the garden who suddenly unearths one unexpectedly and discovers its matured much better than he had hoped hed liked to have taken her straight up on to the moors and screwed her now but he didnt particularly want to cover his new suit with grass stains before the interview anyway thered be plenty of time tonight and itd be more of a turn on pulling her under the old vicars nose it was quite an achievement washing oneself from top to toe with gritty soap and a face towel in the ladies at the library but imogen managed it she also nipped across the road and bought a new pair of black pants which cut into her and now she was sitting in the dog and duck enveloped in a cloud of glorias babe being eyed by pikely locals drinking champagne with nicky and wondering if shed ever been happier in her life this is the first champagne ive had this year she said then you must wish said nicky imogen shut her eyes and took a gulp oh please she wished silently give me nicky nicky laughed and kissed her cheek youll get me if you play your cards right he said how did you know what i was wishing youre totally transparent thats what i like about you did you think gloria was pretty said imogen wistfully whos she the sexy one in yellow shorts who offered you a cup of tea didnt notice her but then i only have eyes for you he filled up her glass as they worked their way down the bottle he told her about rome and paris but she was so longing and longing to have his arms round her again and yet panicking where it would all lead to she could hardly concentrate and what have you been up to he said ordering another bottle nothing really she told him about juliet having to write out the rd psalm ten times for saying bugger but she didnt really think hed be very interested in hearing about the secondhand book stall she had to organise for the church fête in aid of a new spire and even spires seemed so phallic at the moment how is your dear father still on the one day week said nicky imogen giggled and knew she shouldnt oh come on darling you know hes a pig only to me said imogen nicky emptied the remains of the first bottle into her glass whos at home this evening he said carefully no one said imogen without thinking juliets staying the night with a friend and mummy and daddy are taking the boys back and stopping for dinner with the vicar of long preston nicky picked up the unopened bottle of champagne lets go then outside it was pouring with rain street lamp reflections quivering in the cobbled streets people huddled in the dorway of the fish shop the smell of frying fat wafted towards them are you hungry asked nicky no said imogen the powerful headlamps of his car lit up the cow parsley flattened by the deluge the rain rattled against the windscreen in the light from the dashboard she could see nickys profile i went for that drop shot at the right moment he was saying i was beginning to get the right length and make friends with the ball again a vast pile of unopened letters and cables were scattered on the back seat goodness you get a lot of post said imogen its last weeks fan mail said nicky as he swung up the moorland road leading to the vicarage he put his hand on her thigh caressing her through the thick stiff material she lifted her legs slightly off the seat hoping to make them seem thinner the house was dark and empty except for homer who welcomed them ecstatically charging off upstairs and returning with a pair of old grey pants imogen had been wearing yesterday deposited them at nickys feet extraordinary pants said nicky not yours are they goodness no lied imogen theyre probably jumble look as though they belonged to your grandmother said nicky go and get a couple of glasses sweetheart as imogen threw the offending pants into the dustbin she heard the champagne cork pop she felt like a gas fire that had been left on unlit for too long nickys touch would be like a lit match making her explode in a great gushing blue flame singeing everything around including homers eyebrows they sat drinking on the sofa nicky had turned off all the lights except one lamp in the corner she was shaking with nerves again quite unable to meet his eye its been awfully wet the last few weeks she said its been awfully dry abroad said nicky picking up the bottle no squeaked imogen putting her hand over her glass dont be silly said nicky so the champagne trickled through her fingers and spilled icy cold down her sleeve meeting the rivulets of sweat that were coming the other way desperate for something to do she drained her glass and felt slightly dizzy lets get down to business said nicky and took her in his arms you like me dont you oh yes she stammered i havent thought about anything else for a single minute since we met she was achingly aware of him his mouth over hers his hands in her hair come on he whispered lets go upstairs much more comfortable weve got hours of time homer will bark if anyone comes not at daddy and mummy he wont they wont even have started dinner yet imogen gazed up at nicky with huge troubled eyes itd kill my father hooray said nicky ill come and sell tickets at his funeral imogen tried and failed to look shocked he put his hands round her waist she came towards him dissolving into him he moved his hand under her sweater and closed it over her breast imogen started to struggle itd be so awful she muttered if i got pregnant youre not fixed up he asked sharply when are you due imogen swallowed shed never discussed things like this with a man tomorrow or the next day no problem said nicky relaxing launching into the attack again thats why your tits are so fantastic at the moment she was glad to be able to hide her embarrassment in his shoulder now she felt his hand on her back shed never known anyone with such warm hands next moment hed slipped it under her jeans and was stroking her bottom you must stop gasped imogen as he pushed her back on the sofa and removed her sweater ive never done it with anybody before she said emerging from the fluff im not just anybody said nicky and you cant stop sweetheart any more than i can oh help thought imogen whats happening to me but next minute she froze with horror as the back door opened and homer bounded out with a crash yoo hoo said a voice anyone at home kerist said nicky then with incredible presence of mind he seized imogens sweater turned it rightway out and pulled it over her head keep cool he murmured kicking her bra under the sofa and tucking in his shirt were in here he called hullo nicky said her mother walking into the room carrying a large marrow hullo darling what a beastly night isnt it a shame poor mrs westleys got shingles they tried to ring us but wed already left we didnt stop to dinner and came straight home they gave us this she waved the marrow daddys putting the car away well have some champagne to cheer you up said nicky imogen rushed off to get more glasses her heart hammering feeling quite faint with horror just think if her father had found her and nicky at it on the floor in front of homer too she thought with an hysterical giggle thank god it was her mother whod come in first as she went back into the drawingroom she heard her mother asking nicky do you think theres any hope of virginia woolf winning wimbledon the rest of nickys visit was disastrous theyd all gone to bed early and nicky had whispered to imogen on the stairs courage ma brave as soon as alls quiet on the west riding front ill creep along to your room but alas the vicar suffering from one of his periodic bouts of insomnia had decided to sleep or rather not sleep in his dressingroom which was equidistant between imogens room and the spare room there he lay with the light on and the door ajar pretending to read donnes sermons but actually brooding on former glories a row of silver cups on the chest of drawers and framed pictures of muscular men with folded arms round the wall imogen lay shivering with terror in bed and every time nicky tried to steal down the passage the vicar who had ears on elastic called out is that you my dear so nicky had to bolt into the lavatory by one oclock mindful that he might rot up his chances in the scottish open tomorrow he gave up and fell into a dreamless sleep imogen who didnt sleep at all could hardly bear to look at his sulky face next morning well that was a lead balloon wasnt it he said getting into his car tears filled imogens eyes this was obviously goodbye for good then noticing the violet shadows under the brimming eyes nicky relented it wasnt her fault if the vicar hadnt come home unexpectedly shed have dropped like a ripe plum into his hands you couldnt help it i shall be much freer once the american opens over would your parents ever let you come away for a weekend imogen shook her head i doubt it have you got any holiday left a fortnight in september anything planned no nothing really how few girls would have admitted it thought nicky taking her hand she was as transparent and as wholesome as pears soap well the only answers to go on holiday together then all heaven seemed to open oh how lovely gasped imogen then it closed again but my father would never allow it hm well see about that chapter four a fortnight later during wimbledon week nicky had a drink with his friend matthew oconnor in fleet street he had known oconnor on and off for a number of years they bumped into each other abroad nicky playing in tournaments oconnor covering stories and they had got drunk together and been slung out of more foreign nightclubs than they cared to remember are you going to france this year said nicky in september why any room in your car the big irishman looked at him shrewdly depends who you want to bring nicky grinned well i met this bird in yorkshire whats she like got a pair of knockers you can get lost in what else well shes adorable like a puppy you want to pick her up and cuddle her all the time but terribly naïve dads a vicar and a bloody tartar like that mr barrett of walpole street oconnor grinned and you see yourself as robert browning well something of the sort anyway i cant get within necking distance on home ground green is she so you fancy an away fixture an away fixture is what i fancy oconnor ordered another round of drinks ive always believed he said that if a birds worth doing shes worth doing well but a fortnights a hell of a long time dont you think you better take her away for a weekend first ive got tournaments every weekend for the next two months besides i doubt if the old vicar would let her well hes not likely to let her go on holiday is he he might i can say were going in a large party parents seem to have some totally mistaken idea that theres safety in numbers will she fight with cable asked oconnor youve never allowed me to meet cable no more i havent come and have a drink with us this evening the next day nicky wrote to imogens parents he was planning to go to france for a fortnight in september with a couple of friends who were engaged and there would also be another married couple in the party taking their own car hed thought imogen was looking tired last time hed stayed she needed a holiday could she join their party to imogens joy and amazement her parents agreed even her mother had noticed how down she was and her father who was looking forward to his three weeks exchange stint in the north riding in september the golf course was excellent there had no desire to have his elder daughter slopping around with a february face spoiling the fun ill never never be unhappy again vowed imogen she dialled nickys number in london to give him the good news all the same it was a very trying summer wimbledon fortnight came and imogen and gloria spent most of it with the transistor on or with a pair of binoculars surreptitiously trained on the television in the radio rentals shop opposite the library nicky was in coruscating form reaching the last eight of the singles and only being knocked out after a marathon match and the semifinals of the doubles with charlie painter everyone commented on his improved game and whenever he appeared on the television screen clothed in white tennis clothes mystic wonderful whether he was uncoiling like a whiplash when serving or jumping from foot to foot as though the court were red hot beneath his feet waiting to whistle back a shot he seemed a god infinitely beyond imogens reach she had also seen him in the players stand laughing with some of the more beautiful wives nor could she miss the way the tennis groupies pert little girls with snake hips and avid eyes made every match he played a onesided affair by screaming with joy whenever he did a good shot even cheering his opponents double faults and mobbing him every time he came off court could this really be the man whod eaten her mothers macaroni cheese and wrestled with her on the sofa after wimbledon he moved on to ritzy places all over the world and imogen found that a diet of almost illiterate postcards and occasional crackling telephone calls was not really enough to sustain her oh ye of little faith she kept telling herself sternly but found herself increasingly suffering from moodiness and then feeling desperately ashamed of herself even worse everyone at work having glimpsed nicky and learnt they were going on holiday together had turned the affair into a sort of office crossroads not a day passed without someone asking her if shed heard from him or how long was it until her holiday or how was he getting on in indianapolis glorias attitude was ambiguous too on the one hand she liked to boast when out of how her greatest friend imogen was going out with a tennis star and let slip crumbs of tennis gossip passed on by imogen but on the other she was wildly jealous particularly when the word got round and several of the local wolves started coming into the library asking imogen for dates they ought to provide wolf hooks as well as dog hooks outside gloria said with a slight edge to her voice then they wouldnt be able to come in here pestering you stung by glorias sniping you shouldnt put all your eggs in one basket i bet nickys playing round with all those foreign birds imogen gritted her teeth and went out with one or two of the wolves but when the evening ended remembering nickys beautiful curling mouth and the caressing deftness of his touch she couldnt even bear to let them kiss her then felt mean when they stormed off into the night finally the weather had been terrible throughout july august and early september it deluged without stopping the river darrow flooded the water meadows and the tennis courts and endangered the lives of several flocks of sheep imogens hair crinkled depressingly and she had absolutely no chance to brown her pallid body before her holiday and the vicar whose garden and golf had been almost washed away was in a permanently foul mood and vented most of his rage on imogen at last september arrived by scrimping every penny shed managed to save a hundred pounds nicky had told her not to worry about money that hed take care of everything but she knew france was terribly expensive and she wanted to pay her way as most of her wages went towards the housekeeping it didnt leave much for her wardrobe what am i going to do about beach clothes she said you wont need much in a small fishing village said her mother which reminds me lady jacintha sent a lovely red bathing dress for jumble reds in this year isnt it its perfect except for a bit of moth in the seat the jumble was also deprived of two of lady jacinthas widebottomed cotton trousers which didnt really fit but imogen thought she could pull long sweaters over them her mother bought her two kaftans in a sale in leeds this phrase book isnt much good said juliet lounging on imogens bed the night before she left my coachman has been struck by lightning please ask the chambermaid to bring some more candles i ask you imogen wasnt listening she was trying on lady js red bathing dress for the hundredth time and wondering if it would do my legs are like the bottom half of a twinset and pearls she sighed you ought to get a bikini bet its topless down there said juliet i think mummy and daddy are so funny why said imogen folding up a dress thinking youll be safe because youve got a married couple in the party to chaperone you ha ha to egg you on more likely i hope youre on the pill what on earth do you mean snapped imogen well you wont be able to hold off a man like nicky once he gets you in france dont be ridiculous said imogen storming out of the room but it was all too near the knuckle nickys last letter the only one he hadnt written on a postcard had ended and darling for goodness sake go and get yourself fitted up we dont want to spoil the whole fortnight worrying about you getting pregnant time and again during the past month imogen had walked up and down in front of dr meadows surgery and each time she had funked it dr meadows was one of her fathers oldest friends and well over sixty how could she ask him in the end once more egged on by gloria she had gone to a family planning clinic in leeds on the pretext of looking for holiday clothes unfortunately her two brothers michael and sam still home for the holidays had insisted on coming with her in the hope of catching a gillette cup match at headingley but this predictably had been rained off and imogen had great difficulty shaking them off even for a couple of hours ive got to buy lots of boring things like underwear she said well come too said sam who at fourteen had only recently become interested in girls we might be able to see into some of the changing rooms i dont like people hanging round when im buying clothes said imogen quickly it muddles me look heres a fiver why dont you go and see the new james bond ill meet you at the barrier at five oclock and blushing violently she charged through the glass doors of brown and muff rushing straight through and out the other side she set off at a trot towards the clinic wheres old imo really going said sam as they shuffled off to the cinema fpa said michael who was concentrating on lighting a cigarette in the rain blimey is she pregnant course not just getting fixed up before her holiday how dyou know left the address lying around in her bedroom he began to cough the cigarette went out hope to christ dad doesnt find it said sam fancy old imo getting round to sex at last just as well shes taking precautions theyre randy buggers these tennis players even worse than rugger players michaels cigarette sodden now obstinately refused to be lit i hope shell be all right wont get hurt i mean he went on throwing it into the gutter do her good to grow up said sam who was staring at a couple of giggling typists who under one umbrella were teetering by on high heels heading towards the pub i say shall we skip james bond and go and have a drink instead theyd never serve us its pretty dark in there youd pass for eighteen anywhere fancy old imo going on the pill buy anything good said sam innocently as imogen came rushing up to the barrier with only a few minutes to spare id forgotten the sales were on theres nothing nice in the shops stammered imogen failing to meet either of her brothers eyes got your ticket said michael waving his wed better step on it theyre closing the doors oh goodness said imogen ive got it somewhere and as she was nervously rummaging her shaking hands slipped and the entire contents of her bag including six months supply of the pill crashed on to the platform i wonder if scarlet women are called scarlet because they blush so much said sam bending down to help imogen pick everything up and now on the eve of her holiday the mauve packets of the pill were safely tucked into the pocket of her old school coat hanging at the back of her wardrobe shed been taking it for eight days now and she felt sick all the time but she wasnt sure if it was side effects or nervousness at the thought of seeing nicky it was such ages since their last meeting she felt shed almost burnt herself out with longing then she was worried about the sex side shed been taking surreptitious glances at the joy of sex when the library was quiet and the whole thing seemed terribly complicated did one have to stop talking during the performance like a tennis match and wouldnt nicky accustomed to lithe beautiful female tennis players find her much too fat she put her hot forehead against the bathroom window in the garden she could see her father talking to the cat and staking some yellow dahlias beaten down by the rain and wind thats what i need she thought wistfully ill never blossom properly in life unless im tied to a strong sturdy stake she wondered if nicky was really stake material her father was coming in now he looked tired hed been closeted with members of his flock all afternoon she went back to her room and found homer dispiritedly pulling her underwear out of her suitcase he hated people going away ill be back soon she said hugging him she also packed a pile of big paperbacks shed never got round to reading daniel deronda lark rise to candleford scott fitzgerald and tristram shandy on the bed lay a box of tissues they dont have the kind of loo paper you can take your makeup off with in france miss hockney had told her a cellophane bag of cotton wool balls and a matching set of goyas passport she had won in the church fête raffle they didnt look very inspiring as beauty aids she imagined nickys other girlfriends with the whole of helena rubinstein at their disposal there was a knock on the door it was her mother hullo darling how are you getting on daddy wants a quick word before he goes down to the jumble sale pricing committee as she went into the vicars study imogen started to shake he was sitting behind his huge desk lighting his pipe a few raindrops still gleaming on his thick grey hair all round him the shelves were filled with greek and theological books which the vicar never looked at and gardening and sporting works which were much more heavily thumbed on one ledge were neatly stacked volumes of the church times and the parish magazine on the wall the vicar allowed himself one modest photograph of himself surrounded by the england team on the desk was a large inkwell he despised biros now he was looking at her over his spectacles was his jaundiced air due to the fact shed been wearing the same skirt and sweater all week to save her best clothes for france or was he remembering all the countless times hed called her in to lecture her about inglorious reports or misbehaviour at home sit down he said are you looking forward to your holiday yes said imogen wish id been lucky enough to gallivant off to the sun when i was your age he went on heavily but times were harder then oh god thought imogen hes not going to start on that one but instead her father got to his feet and began to pace the room i dont think your mother and i have ever been oppressive parents weve always tried to guide you by example rather than coercion he gave her the chilly onoff smile he used for keeping his parishioners at a distance his flockoff smile michael and juliet always called it but i cant let you depart without a few words of advice you are going to a foreign country where there will be temptations i trust you follow me imogen yes she whispered we are letting you go because we trust you we know nicky is an attractive young man and a celebrity used to getting his own way in life but we still trust you he stopped by the window absentmindedly stripping yellow leaves off a geranium on the ledge testing its earth for sufficient moisture its been a trying afternoon he went on molly bates and her daughter jennifer were here for over an hour poor molly jennifer suddenly revealed she was three months pregnant and the young man concerned has disappeared of course every attempt will be made to trace him and persuade him to marry the girl but if not she will spend the next months in an unmarried mothers home not the most attractive of dwelling places but molly bates feels as a member of the parochial church council that jennifer cannot have the child at home whatever the outcome the girls life is ruined she is secondhand goods now poor jennifer thought imogen perhaps shell be sent off to the jumble sale when youre in the south of france said her father remember the fate of poor jennifer bates and remember youre a clergymans daughter and they like caesars wife must be above suspicion imogen had a momentary fantasy that the packets of purple pills must at this moment be burning a hole in her old coat pocket that her fathers outrage was like the sun on glass fortunately he construed her crimson face as embarrassment at the topic of conversation rather than guilt he sat down and moved the inkwell on the desk remember the words of milton he said in sepulchral tones she that has chastity is clad in complete steel imogen suddenly had a vision of herself clanking around the beach in the south of france in a steel suit of armour her father she decided must have been very much like milton she also suspected that he was rehearsing his sermon for next sunday she had a horrible feeling that he was going to make her kneel down and pray over her you are entering the school of life he said dropping his voice dramatically all i can do is pray for you night and day now go back to your packing and have a wonderful holiday in the sun i must away to the jumble pricing committee the contrast between her gadding sybaritic existence and his modest selfless toil was only too obvious imogen went out of the room closing the door quietly behind her she went upstairs feeling hopelessly depressed her father had brilliantly succeeded in taking all the excitement out of her holiday sex with nicky would be even more of a moral battlefield than ever whatever she did bed or not her father would be standing at the bottom of her bed in spirit shaking his finger at her oh hell it was time to have the pill lying in its little capsule like one of the lights round an actresss mirror she felt like persephone about to take her pomegranate seed and be condemned to an eternity in hades she shut her bedroom door and started groping through her halfempty wardrobe to find the thickness of her old tweed coat at the back she couldnt find it she pushed aside the rest of the clothes it wasnt there not even slid off its hanger on to the floor she burrowed frantically through the landing cupboard then ran downstairs her mother was peeling potatoes and reading a novel at the same time my old school coat its gone gasped imogen surely youre not taking that to france said her mother no but where is it i gave it to the jumble darling as wed taken out lady jacinthas bathing dress and those trousers i thought it was the least we could do but imogen had gone out of the house like a rocket belting down the garden path slipping on the wet pavement tearing along the moorland path bracken slapping against her stockings twigs scratching her face the coat had her name in it the pocket contained the pills and nickys last letter the one about getting fitted up and telling her most explicitly all the delicious things he was going to do to her when he got her to france visions of what her father would do swept over her hed stop her going suddenly the thought of not seeing nicky again filled her with such horror she thought shed faint her breath was coming in great sobs there was the church hall light laced with raindrops streaming from its uncurtained windows inside imogen found scenes of tremendous activity and was nearly knocked sideways by the smell of moth balls dust and none too clean clothes ladies of the parish in felt hats stood round laden trestle tables rooting through other peoples castoffs searching for possible bargains subtly pricing down garments they pretended they didnt know had been sent in by fellow sorters i dont think shes even bothered to launder these corsets said the butchers wife dropping them disdainfully into the nearest bin and this hostess gown is quite rotted under the armpits lady jacintha has sent in a fox fur without any tail said the local midwife rats rats she added waving it at the caretakers cat who giving her a wide berth leapt on to a pile of old books and records hullo imogen love said the butchers wife come to lend a hand i thought you were off on your holidays tomorrow i am said imogen frantically searching round for the piles of coats if youre looking for your dad hes over there imogen peered through the dusty gloom and froze with horror in the far corner in front of a long freckled mirror miss jarrold from the post office was trying on imogens school coat which came down to her ankles and being encouraged on either side by mrs connolly her mothers daily woman and the vicar theres still some wear in it miss jarrold was saying i could get my sister from malham to turn it up oh very becoming miss jarrold the vicar was saying jovially he had his hearty flockoff smile on again not sure about the colour elsie said mrs connolly it never did anything for miss imogen either im only going to use it for gardening and walks seems a bargain for p said miss jarrold and turning back to the mirror she adopted a model girls stance shoving her hands into the pockets oh look theres something inside imogen was across the room in a flash just as miss jarrold pulled the purple packets and nickys letter out of the pockets whatevers all this she went on theyre mine said imogen snatching them from her miss jarrold was so startled she stepped back with a resounding crack on some s of the mikado imogen thundered the vicar where are your manners and what have you got there nothing she muttered going as red as a gpo van love letters and photos said mrs connolly calmly who disliked the vicar intensely and had seen exactly what was inside the pocket no girl likes to lose those do they love oh look theres lady harris at the door i expect she wants to discuss the refreshments with you vicar ah yes indeed welcome welcome said mr brocklehurst in a ringing voice finishing off the mikado altogether as he went towards the door for a minute imogen and mrs connolly looked at each other thanks stammered imogen that was terribly kind better to be safe than sorry said mrs connolly my connies been on them things for years id beat it if i were you before your dad has second thoughts have a nice time spect youll come back brown as a berry seems in a hurry said miss jarrold innocently is she courting happen she is said mrs connolly who knew perfectly well miss jarrold read all the cards that came through the post office she hasnt told me owt about it at any rate the last few hours were a torment but at last imogen was on the train to london her small suitcase on the rack her mother juliet and homer drooping and looking gloomy stood on the platform suddenly imogen felt a great lump in her throat im sorry ive been so awful and boring the last few weeks ill make it up to you really i will she said leaning out of the window i wish you were coming too well all miss you said her mother dont forget to send me a card said juliet be careful about drinking the water said her mother remember chastity begins and ends at home said juliet heres something to read on the train handing her a parcel as the train drew out in it were copies of the kama sutra and the sun is my undoing gradually the dark stone walls the mill chimneys the blackgrimed houses the rows of washing and dirty white hens in the gardens were left behind she was on her way chapter five an hour and a half from london she started doing her face half an hour away she decided she looked awful and took all her makeup off and put it on again the new very cheap dress ivy green with a white collar which had looked so pretty when shed tried it on in the shop was now crumpled like an old dishcloth her new tights were making spiral staircases round her ankles the train drew into kings cross imogen was one of the first off pushing her way through the crowd radiant smile at the ready like a british railways ad she had lived this moment so often in her mind people rushed forward to kiss people and gather up their suitcases no one came forward to claim her the kissers dispersed and still no nicky she was sure shed told him she was arriving on the eightthirty train the station clock jerked agonisingly round to nineten two drunken sailors lurched up to her and lurched away when they saw the frozen expression on her face she struggled not to cry then like an angel of mercy loping aross the station in the same white suit and an orange shirt came nicky darling sweet love god im sorry what can i say theres the most godawful traffic jam in piccadilly are you all right has half london been trying to pick you up oh said imogen halflaughing halfcrying im so so pleased to see you as he kissed her he smelt of drink and she thought of scent perhaps it was her own scent new yesterday which she wasnt yet used to come on he said picking up her suitcase in the taxi he took her hand imogen was too besotted to realise the roads were quite clear were going straight to matt and cables the people were going to france with youll like them hes a lunatic irish journalist and shes a model a model imogen tugged surreptitiously at her wrinkled stockings she hoped she wasnt too glamorous then she remembered with relief oh but theyre the engaged couple well not engaged exactly just cohabiting but i had to bend the facts a bit to reassure your father they arrived at a huge block of flats imogen was disappointed nicky didnt kiss her there would have been plenty of time as the lift climbed to the tenth floor instead he smoothed his hair in the lift mirror there was no answer when he rang the door bell so he pushed open the door and shouted anyone at home footsteps came from the back of the flat a waft of scent flooded the hall darlings youve arrived said a girl in a light drawling voice how are you her red dress was slit to the thighs her lips were as crimson as her painted toe nails which peeped out of high black sandals she had delicate catlike features sly slanting eyes the colour of watercress and carefully tousled inkyblack hair snaking down her back except for her suntan she might have stepped out of a beardsley drawing there was something serpentine too in the way she coiled herself round nicky kissing him on the cheek and murmuring darling marvellous to see you imogen this is cable he said disengaging himself too slowly for imogens liking the girl stared at imogen incredulously for a minute and then a slow smile spread over her face welcome to london she said did you have a good journey ive been packing since dawn and im completely exhausted wheres your luggage nicky held up imogens dogeared suitcase heavens said cable is that all matt will adore you ive filled three suitcases already and hes griping about my taking a fourth come and have a drink can i go to the loo said imogen who didnt want to but was desperate to repair her face before nicky could compare her any more with this ravishing creature down the passage on the left said cable well be in here do you think five bikinis will be enough nicky what price lady js motheaten red bathing dress now thought imogen savagely as she combed the tangles out of her hair her face was all eyes in a foronce pale face she pinched some of cables rouge but it made her look like a clown so she rubbed it off again she found nicky and cable in a room where everything seemed scarlet carpet curtains and every inch of wall that wasnt covered by books and pictures even the piano was painted red and in one corner stood a huge stuffed bear wearing a scarlet regimental jacket oh what a heavenly room sighed imogen cable looked at her with surprise do you think so matts taste not mine hed been here a year when i moved in so the damage was done its hell to keep tidy she added pointing to the papers billowing out of the desk and the piles of books and magazines on every available surface in one chair sprawled a basset hound who thumped his tail but made no effort to get up and on the sofa snoring gently lay a very big very long man he was playing poker all night said cable sourly hes been lying there since he came in at halfpast eleven this morning she kicked him none too gently in the ribs come on sloblomov wake up the man groaned and pulled a cushion over his face he even sleeps standing up said cable ive seen him at parties propped on one leg like a horse patiently waiting to be led home to his stable the man removed the cushion and opened a bloodshot eye stop beefing for gods sake im on my holiday im entitled to kip if i want to not when weve got company said cable he opened the other eye hullo kids he said and yawned without bothering to put his hand over his mouth imogen was astounded that such a beautiful girl should go for such an ugly man he had battered features a very sallow skin dark heavylidded eyes that turned down at the corners and a streaky blond mane much in need of a cut he got up and shook himself like a dog beside nickys gleaming beauty he looked thoroughly seedy she also had a vague feeling shed seen him before how are you nicky boy he said he needs a drink said cable we all do well run along and get me some alka seltzer you do look a bit rough said nicky did you make a killing last night matt drew a large wad of notes out of his hip pocket itll buy us a few snails he said nicky grinned ill go and help cable with the ice bring the evening paper with you matt shouted after him i want to see what won the threethirty he turned to imogen looked her over lazily and gave her a surprisingly attractive smile just come from leeds and covered in coaldust are you i went there once a terrible dirty place it was i thought id been misrouted to hell imogen giggled the part where we live is very pretty i like your flat come and look at the view he went over to the window and drew back the curtains all london glittered before them theres big ben westminster abbey the shell building on a clear day you can see margaret thatcher he had a nice voice too thought imogen leisurely with a faint trace of irish perhaps he wasnt so ugly after all just differentlooking from other people she was still trying to work out where shed seen him before now what are you drinking beauty whisky gin anything you like oh whisky please with masses of water she sat on the arm of the dogs chair and stroked his ears whats his name basil never get a basset hound they rule your life you can say that again said cable coming in with nicky and the ice tray theres a ton of rump steak for him in the fridge while were away its not his stomach that bothers me said matt dropping five alka seltzers into a glass of water and watching them fizz its his soul i think ill get father omalley to visit him while were away did my proofs arrive he added to cable about an hour ago theyre over there on the table they said you could telephone any corrections through tonight matt halfemptied his glass and grimaced then he picked up some long narrow sheets of newsprint from the table and began to examine them whove you taken apart this week said nicky the medical profession said matt and theyre not going to like it he picked up a biro added one word and crossed a couple out suddenly imogen twigged youre not the matthew oconnor matt looked up im not entirely sure today but youre marvellous stammered imogen i loved your book on parnell theres still a waiting list at the library and i always read your pieces in the paper we all do even my father thinks youre funny and that really is saying something said nicky not given much to giggling is our vicar well that is nice said cable with a slight edge to her voice youve got a fan at last matt arent you lucky very said matt seeing imogen flush and giving her a reassuring smile its manna to my ears darling i suppose you twoll be rabbiting on about proust all the way to provence said cable itd make a nice change said matt imogen couldnt believe it nicky and matthew oconnor in the same party as her any moment she expected jackie kennedy or mick jagger to pop out of the grandfather clock what time do we leave tomorrow asked nicky the boat sails at eleven we ought to leave the house by eight said matt for a while they discussed arrangements then imogens stomach gave a great rumble and nicky said that he was hungry i could cook something said cable as though it were a rare occurrence im not having you slaving over a hot tin opener all night said matt who had picked up the evening paper he gave an exclamation of pleasure the little darling she won by three lengths romped all the way home like a child off to a party come on my angels on the strength of that ill buy you all dinner they piled into a large incredibly dirty white mercedes you might have had it cleaned before we left grumbled cable imogen found she was sitting on a bridle they ate in a little italian restaurant and drank a good deal of wine nicky talked about his tennis exploits grumbling how political the game was getting these days matt asked the questions he had a journalists ability to get an incredible amount of information out of people without their realising it every place nicky had played at cable seemed to have been there too filming or modelling which produced the inevitable questions about did you meet the soandsos and have they split up yet imogen didnt say much she was too busy taking it all in but there was a bad moment when nicky suddenly put his hand on her thigh and she jumped so much that her fork fell on to the floor taking most of her spaghetti with it nicky was insane with irritation but matt just laughed and ordered her some more he was very funny throughout dinner and imogen found herself liking him more and more cable she was less sure of sitting there picking at her food examining her reflection in her spoon looking at nicky with those sly green eyes sophia loren was in here last week she said just sitting over there wearing the most incredible plunging neckline i went to the gents fifteen times during dinner just so i could look down it said matt ill get the bill he said seeing imogen was nearly falling off her chair with exhaustion its only midnight said cable cant we have some brandy some of us who do a decent weeks work get tired on friday i work snapped cable i went to two cattle markets yesterday any good asked nicky second one might be theyre launching a new chewing gum the breads terrific my agents going to ring me in france and let me know matt handed the waiter what seemed an inordinate number of notes a cattle market is a models audition he explained to imogen very appropriate too when you see some of the cows that turn up come on lets go there was another bad moment when they got back to the flat cable had opened the door of one of the bedrooms and said you and nicky are in here oh my goodness thought imogen her mind racing like a weasel in a trap did matt see her expression of dismay five minutes before he had been yawning his head off now he suddenly asked nicky and cable if they wanted a nightcap i wouldnt mind said nicky he ruffled imogens hair go to bed love ill be with you in a minute but an hour and a bottle of brandy later when he went to bed he found imogen fast asleep with the light on tristram shandy still open on the pillow and basil sprawled beside her bloody dog he said trying to push basil off the dog gave an ominous growl foiled again said matt sympathetically youll never shift him now hes pitted down for the night ill give you an eiderdown and you can kip on the sofa chapter six a gale was lashing the rain against the windows when they woke next morning nicky was moaning about his hangover and the rotten night hed spent matt and cable were having a row next time you shave your legs with my razor for gods sake wash it out now for the fourth time may i take the cases down to the car im not ready snapped cable putting on a second layer of mascara look baby its ten past eight im leaving in five minutes with or without you oh dont go on said cable her voice rising have you hidden my jewellery yes in the window box well take these three cases down at least itll give you something to do the front door slammed nickee called cable yes love i cant shut my suitcase imogen who had been sitting about feeling spare for the last half hour wandered along to cables bedroom to see if she could help nicky and cable who was wearing the most ravishing pink suede suit were sitting side by side on the suitcase thats it said nicky leaning across cable and clicking the second flap down imogen froze in the doorway as she saw cable put her hand over nickys nicky looked up at cable and smiled youd better lock it he said slowly i wouldnt like you to lose anything valuable to anyone else im so glad youre coming with us purred cable it makes everything so much more well exciting imogen didnt know which of them jumped the most when matts voice behind her said a quick worker isnt she shell have you tied in knots if youre not careful nicky for a minute cable glared at matt and then to imogens amazement she burst out laughing darling sloblomov she said wrinkling her nose at him you dont let me get away with a thing do you in that pink suit thought imogen wistfully she was so lovely she could get away with murder matt grinned reluctantly picked up the long khaki scarf that was lying on the bed and wound it round cables neck pulling it tight and pretending to throttle her so sweet were neer so fatal he said come on circe lets go bloody english weather grumbled nicky at least it might wash the car said matt they had only been driving ten minutes when cable gave a shriek my night cream its still in the fridge well i expect basil will be having it on his strawberries said matt calmly dont be bloody silly snapped cable we must go back look baby youve kept us hanging about for twenty minutes already but my skin will dry up why dont you dry up imogen gazed in trepidation at cables rigid profile was nicky really keen on her or just flattered by her attentions as if in answer nicky put an arm round imogens shoulders all right sweetheart excited when he looked at her like that she was incapable of answering she just nodded and snuggled against him who are the couple were joining at dover he asked matt cables chums said matt i disclaim all responsibility very funny said cable darting a venomous glance at him actually theyre an awfully sweet couple which puts the kiss of death on them said matt will you shut up theyre called edgworth james and yvonne edgworth james is very straight and does something with shares in the city shes a very well known model youll recognise her face oh god sighed imogen another model i hope she doesnt run after nicky too the weather grew worse and worse the traffic was appalling too they nearly missed the ferry and were the last to drive into the vast cellar at the bottom of the boat which housed all the cars why are you looking so sour matt asked cable petulantly as we were last on we shall be last off and as were booked into an hotel a hundred miles south of paris youre unlikely to get any dinner tonight a sailor advanced on him waving a chamois leather no i dont want my car washed he said and stalked upstairs cable grinned at nicky were meeting james and yvonne in the bar she said unable to see in her dark glasses she stumbled over a step nicky caught her elbow stopping her falling and leaving his hand on her arm far too long for imogens liking god the english dress badly he said as they walked along the deck imogen pulled her sweater further down over her illfitting trousers cable darling shrieked a voice as they went into the bar yvonne angel we thought youd missed the boat we nearly did terrific hat fantastic shoes stunning suit youve changed your hair after screeching at each other for some minutes like a couple of parakeets they remembered the rest of the party yvonne imogen decided with relief wasnt half as dangerous as cable it must be the inspired ordinariness of her features china blue eyes curly red hair and dimples that made her such a success as a model she would automatically have the creamiest margarine the whitest wash and the steaming hot milk drink ever on the boil for the homecoming husband she was wearing a grey trouser suit and a spotless white blouse with an embroidered s couple tangoing over her bosom you must be matt she said flashing her teeth at nicky cables told me so much about you but she never said how goodlooking you were cable looked put out this is nicky beresford she said sharply of course giggled yvonne how silly of me ive seen you playing at wimbledon this is matt said cable oh said yvonne looking up at matt rather dubiously awfully pleased to meet you this is my jumbo james edgworth had the rosy complexion puffed out cheeks and curly hair of cherubs that blow the wind at the corner of old maps he was small plump and wore a yachting cap and a look of eager expectancy lets have a drink said nicky tomato juice for me said yvonne pity to waste it when its duty free said nicky giving her one of his hard sexy looks oh well if you twist my arm ill have a babycham said yvonne everyone else had double brandies this is jolly just like going on an away match said james edgworth how many bikinis did you bring cable asked yvonne nicky was busy converting english money into francs on the back of a sick bag youre going to need that bag said matt when you realise how low the rate of exchange is two giggling teenagers sidled up to nicky could we possibly have your autograph everyone was gaping at them not surprising thought imogen they were easily the noisiest most glamorous group on the boat she hoped she wasnt letting the side down i say said james happily its beginning to get choppy the boat having left the harbour was bucking like a bronco every few minutes the windows were entirely covered by angry grey water imogens stomach began to heave all the chairs in the bar she noticed were chained to the floor on her right james cable and nicky were talking about people she didnt know so she idly listened to yvonne attempting to chat up matt you write for the papers dont you rather fun i should think i was rather good at english at school they all said i should take up writing matt looked at her it would have been tragic to deprive the modelling world he said drily imogen suppressed a smile thats what i thought said yvonne now i just write jumbos speeches his speeches didnt you know she bared her teeth like the wolf in red riding hood james is prospective candidate for cockfosters hes awfully busy at the moment but if you ask him nicely im sure hed spare the time to give you an interview for your paper ill remember that said matt mind you said yvonne i do think the articles you write are rather well exaggerated in what way said matt his eyes narrowing well that piece last week on northern ireland i mean i didnt finish it and i know all journalists sensationalise things for the sake of circulation go on said matt an ominous note creeping into his voice well i do think its rather disloyal to write things like that disloyal to whom those men had been tortured one young boy committed suicide rather than take any more these things happen said yvonne but surely its better not to make too much fuss it only stirs up hatred and makes things difficult for the poor soldiers to be quite honest i cant stand the way you irish come over here and take our jobs and use our health service and then say beastly things about us whenever i come across atrocities i write beastly things about them snapped matt now you mustnt get uptight said yvonne reprovingly i bet you didnt have any breakfast why not have a matchstick she added producing a polythene bag of cut up carrots from her holdall veggies dont put on an ounce of weight do have one imogen didnt stay to hear matts reply i must get some air she gasped staggering across the bar it was better outside she clung to the rails and the spray lashed her face down below the sea was writhing and foaming two minutes later matt joined her his face was olive green god cable does pick them he groaned she thought she was bringing you out in a nervous rash most likely im sure shes awfully good as a model forces grey in you mean the only thing she could sell is packaged nausea are you all right asked imogen anxiously the olive green was now tinged with grey ill manage be back in a second and he practically hurled himself over the edge of the boat oh poor poor thing she said when he came back he grinned weakly there goes yesterdays dinner and tea at least ive ruined their rotten boat imogen was amazed at his stoicism particularly when he added a moment later you mustnt let cable upset you imogen flushed i wasnt i mean i like her very much shes only flirting with nicky to annoy me he said she does it with any attractive man who comes along but whatever for shes trying to pressure me to marry her dont you want to he shrugged his shoulders im a catholic if somewhat lapsed im supposed to try to marry for good i can put up with a free range mistress but not a free range wife shed probably settle down once you married her said imogen perhaps oh my god he muttered turning green again here goes yesterdays breakfast she had never known anyone could be so seasick each time he returned more white and shaking to her side in the middle cable had the gall to saunter up and put a proprietorial hand over his were going to have some lunch darling see you later isnt yvonne nice adorable said matt im just wondering how im going to kill her at last they sighted boulogne hanging in a mist of seagulls its cranes jabbing the sky they were now joined by the rest of the party bumptious from dutyfree drink and clutching their packets of dutyfree cigarettes hullo said cable you do look peaky darling do you like my new scent and she thrust her wrist under matts nose the skies were overcast as the boat drew in and it was still raining a few fat frenchmen in blue overalls and berets were waiting on the quay goodness they look very english thought imogen and the weathers just like yorkshire shall i drive asked nicky as they got back into the car matt shook his head itll take my mind off my stomach imogen looks rather grey shed better go in the front said cable nipping into the back beside nicky the mercedes was soon eating up the miles so this is france thought imogen great avenues of poplars cornfields stretching to infinity incredibly ugly towns with their peeling dubonnet posters and gaudy gardens like seed packets there was no one in the streets perhaps they were all making fantastic french love behind those closed shutters the first world war was fought all over here matt told her most of the old houses were razed to the ground thats why the villages are so new and hideous have you read goodbye to all that imogen shook her head marvellous book ive got a copy in my case ill lend it to you i couldnt get beyond the first page said cable too many long words for you said matt and no pictures oh dont be so effing superior snapped cable there are still plenty of unexploded bombs in the fields said matt ignoring her and plenty inside the car too thought imogen nicky and cable chattered away the names dropping like autumn leaves but finally even they fell quiet glancing round imogen saw that cable was asleep her head on nickys shoulder she looked away quickly trying desperately not to mind if matt saw anything through the driving mirror he took no notice the rain had stopped and a few stars were trying to peer through the veil of cloud as they reached their hotel it stood on the edge of a river festooned with bright pink geraniums and creepers trailing down into the water the attractive mademoiselle behind the desk seemed delighted to see matt again but she looked aghast when james and yvonne came through the door there was much handwaving and shouldershrugging and matt came over looking rueful sorry loves my crazy secretarys only booked two double rooms instead of three thats ok said cable were all whacked yvonne and imogen and i can shack down in one double bed you three can have the other matt looked relieved if thats all right with everyone else imogen nodded another days reprieve she wasnt up to a sexual marathon with nicky tonight rather a lark said james edgworth just like the dorm at school yvonnes face however was working like milk coming up to the boil but thats absurd jumbo and i are married we all know that baby said matt dont call me baby yvonne stamped her foot ive had an exhausting day i dont see why i should suffer merely because youve made a hash of things her eyes brimmed with tears james patted her shoulder gingerly dont cry dear matt would you mind awfully if we had one double room matt looked at nicky who nodded right you are james anything to oblige nicky and i can kip in the car dinner in quarter of an hour then im not going to change if ive got to use these clothes as pyjamas said nicky up in the bedroom cable got out her heated rollers i dont think matt and yvonne are going to hit it off she said happily do you know shes filled a whole suitcase with packets of allbran to keep james regular chapter seven imogen felt absolutely knackered she longed to soak in a hot bath and spend ages tarting up and putting on something sensational but she had nothing sensational to put on and she felt far too fat and cumbersome to undress and change in front of cable with all cables suitcases and bottles of makeup there wasnt really room enough for them both anyway besides if she got down early she might snatch a few moments alone with nicky so she contented herself with a quick wash and brushup if matts bellyaching tell him i wont be long said cable who was now wandering about the bedroom totally naked except for a green silk scarf holding her rollers in imogen averted her eyes and fled was modesty perhaps a question of fatness she wondered if she looked as marvellous as that perhaps shed wander around with no clothes on on the landing she found yvonne wearing a pink plastic cape round her shoulders to protect her clothes from makeup and brandishing a hairdryer at a nervous looking maid you speak english dont you oui madame then why dont you speak it instead of standing there talking in a foreign language i want the plug on this dryer exchanged at once imogen slunk past them no one was about in the hall she looked at the menu in the glass case her mouth watering the kitchen was wafting beguiling smells of garlic wine and herbs from its warm interior she went into the lounge and sat down with tristram shandy an english family nearby whispered as though they were at a funeral and gloomily lifted the brass hats on their café filtrés on her table a vase of mauve and salmon pink gladioli clashed horribly with each other and even worse with the tartan table cloth odd that the french who were supposed to be so chic should have so little colour sense she tried to read it was really awful the way her concentration had gone to the wind since she met nicky she gazed out of the window where an orange street lamp lit up the poster of a forthcoming circus were a bit like a travelling circus she thought james is one of those eager perky little dogs that jumps through hoops and yvonne is a trapeze artist tough but dainty tripping around with her feet turned out and nicky and cable were like sleek beautiful wild animals panthers or tigers who kept escaping from their cages and disrupting the local community and she was a small fat shaggy pony trying desperately to keep up with everyone she was just trying to work out what matt was something large and friendly when she jumped as she heard his voice saying youll never get yourself a drink that way sweetheart were in the bar what are you reading he picked up her book oh that never managed to get through it myself they found nicky sitting on a bar stool hullo pet what dyou want matt and i are drinking pernods thatd be lovely said imogen not having a clue what it was some kind of alcoholic pear juice perhaps matt ordered another round and dropped a packet of crisps into her lap you must be starving you looked bushed too said nicky pouring water into the pernod so it went cloudy like dettol probably a good thing youre going to get a decent nights sleep tonight but therell be no holding me tomorrow he added lowering his voice imogen went pink took a great slug of her drink and nearly spat it out it was unbelievably disgusting like distilled liquorice allsorts and she needed a drink so badly she took another cautious sip and almost threw up matt picked up a copy of le figaro that was lying on the bar i say said nicky have you heard the one about the irishman who tried to swim the channel no said matt not looking up he tried to swim it lenktways imogen giggled nicky put a warm hand over hers at least someone thinks im funny jesus said matt braganzis in marseilles only a few miles from where were staying with the duchess asked nicky so it says here never understand that said nicky peering at the paper beautiful classy bird throwing everything up to run off with a little wop runt like braganzi hush said matt looking round in mock alarm the mafia are everywhere anyway hes probably more enterprising in bed according to fleet street the old duke was a bit of a stately homo one pretty valet after another every valet shall be exalted said nicky didnt the duchess have braganzis baby asked imogen yeah said matt must be months now theyve been together nearly three years perhaps she enjoys living with a hood women are always turned on by power and braganzis got the whole of the midi sewn up nicky squinted at his reflection in the smoked lookingglass behind the bar all the same he is an oily little runt matt grinned once she hears youre in the area nicky baby shell promptly abandon braganzi ive never had a duchess mused nicky as though it was a matter of surprise to him cant you imagine her gliding downstairs in one of those red robes lined with ermine and nothing on underneath saying would you prefer the west wing or the east wing mr beresford then shed probably hand you over to the national trust said matt catching sight of imogens stricken face anyway youd just be getting down to business when the doord be flung open and youd have some guide showing a coachload of large ladies on a mothers union mystery tour all over you id like that said nicky im turned on by crowds imogen who was feeling quite sick at the thought of nicky and the duchess took another slug at her drink and felt even sicker and had to have three potato crisps to take the taste away hullo you chaps whats anyone going to drink said a jolly voice it was james wearing a pale blue corduroy coat his light brown curls smoothed flat to his head perhaps yvonne insisted on brushes a day like nanny its my round said nicky ill have whisky then a large white horse please un grand cheval blanc said james and giggled looking furtively round youd better make it snappy yvonne doesnt approve of spirits make it two said matt and picking up imogens pernod emptied it into his own glass youre not enjoying that much are you sweetheart oh thank you stammered imogen touched that hed noticed dyou know the story of the white horse going into a pub and sitting down on the bar stool and ordering a large whisky said james no said nicky who didnt like other people telling jokes the barman gave the horse his drink and said did you know theres a whisky named after you really said the white horse i didnt know there was a whisky called eric james laughed so hard that in the end everyone joined in hes really rather nice thought imogen taking a thankful gulp of her whisky the head waiter was hovering with a menu chat du jour at the ready were cable or your wife looking within a million years of being ready asked matt theyre getting a bit restless in the kitchen no said james cheerfully imogens stomach gave a thunderous rumble hear hear said matt ill keel over if i dont eat soon you chaps didnt have any lunch did you said james sympathetically jesus said nicky looking at the bill for the round of drinks its even gone up since i was here in may exactly said matt thats why were not staying in four star hotels well have to put imogen on the streets as it is they say vicars daughters are always the worst said james the whisky was making imogen perk up it was nice being just her and the three men the conversation moved on to northern ireland imogen ate her crisps and let the world flow over her nicky held her hand and occasionally stroked her hair james was caught redhanded buying another round of large drinks by the arrival of yvonne im not late am i yes said matt what dyou want to drink tomato juice please said yvonne no thanks imogen i wont have any of your crisps theyre so fattening and its more than my lifes worth to exceed my calorie count she looked rather disapprovingly at imogens thighs splayed out on the bar stool imogen blushed let the large crisp already in her mouth melt like a communion wafer and gazed at yvonne in admiration there wasnt a chip of varnish off the long coral nails nor a newly curled red hair out of place and the white silk blouse with the couple tangoing over the bosom was still spotless from that morning having got her way over the room yvonne was also prepared to be conciliatory the vibes sizzling between nicky and cable had not been lost on her cable mustnt be the only one with a holiday admirer yvonne decided to charm matt are you feeling better she asked mind you i always suspect seasickness is psychosomatic i agree said matt sos bloodymindedness the irony was quite lost on yvonne i do envy you coming from ireland she went on i did a butter commercial there once it was all so green and unspoilt where do you live matt in moone is it pretty well its very good hunting country i think huntings rather cruel said yvonne but i suppose people in the country have to occupy their time somehow indeed they have said matt the irish havent discovered the infinite possibilities of sexual intercourse yet the men in the moone always came too soon said nicky matt laughed yvonne hastily changed the subject i dont always agree with what you say but i do admire your ability to do it week in week out do what write your amusing articles where do you think up your ideas in the bog said matt im thinking of doing a piece on bitches next week oh i can help you with that said yvonne enthusiastically one meets so many in the modelling world its the price you have to pay for being at the top she added draining her tomato juice the head waiter was hovering again looking bootfaced where is cable said yvonne disapprovingly you havent trained her very well you know she knows peoplell wait for her said matt so inconsiderate to keep the kitchen staff waiting i must say i am looking forward to my meal you cant beat french cuisine yvonne retorted at that moment cable sauntered in looking quite unrepentant in khaki jeans and a tight olive green tshirt with im still a virgin printed in large letters across the front the colour gave a warm dusky glow to her brown face and neck and intensified the greenness of her eyes the barman nearly dropped the glass he was cleaning the head waiter stopped in midgrumble nickys hand slid out of imogens and his presence seemed to slip away from her too as he examined the lettering on cables bosom matts just been telling us the irish havent discovered sex yet here we have the proof he said youll get clobbered under the trade descriptions act said matt id better give it to imogen then said cable shes the only one entitled to wear it everyone glanced at imogen who blushed crimson and looked down at her hands speechless with embarrassment nicky must have told cable how could he sorry said cable that was below the belt your minds never anywhere else said matt sharply lets go and eat let me have one drink said cable smiling witchily at the head waiter surely weve got time the head waiter promptly melted and said there was all the time in the world and why didnt they have a round of drinks on the house i thought you werent going to change cable said yvonne no thank you garçon i wont have another drink and youve had enough jumbo she added to james who was still gaping at cable you know i hate you drinking spirits dont be silly said matt accepting large glasses of whisky and handing one to james never look a gift white horse in the mouth at last they went in to dinner most people had reached the coffee stage after a quick calculation imogen posted herself next to where she thought nicky would be but at the last moment cable sat down beyond matt and nicky moved in opposite her with yvonne next to him leaving james and imogen on the outside we can play footy footy said james his fat little legs would never reach me thought imogen at least she was next to matt which was a comfort he promptly began to guide her through the menu have that and that if youre starving he said this place really deserves every flicker of its three stars im going to have a large steak said nicky id better make some attempt at keeping fit oh good theyve got crudities can i have mine undressed said yvonne to the waiter undressed crudities thought imogen perhaps yvonne was going to whip off her clothes and tango naked on the snow white table cloth it must be all the whisky it was beginning to make her feel fuzzy and irresponsible everyone except cable and yvonne fell on the bread whats cervelles said james unpacking a square of butter brains said matt ugh shuddered yvonne i cant stand brains thats patently obvious said matt to imogen in an undertone shall we all drink red he added looking round the table i want white said yvonne much less fattening dont you agree cable what said cable who was smouldering at nicky oh yes im sure yvonne decided it was high time to break them up ive just been telling matt how much i love ireland cable its so wonderfully primitive youd enjoy our hovel then said matt taking another piece of bread chickens in the parlour me granny shacked up with the donkey in the best bedroom and my mither entertaining gentlemen friends while the pig waits at table now youre teasing me said yvonne her eyes crinkling i bet your family are charming arent they cable i havent been allowed to meet them snapped cable suddenly the temperature seemed to have dropped below zero im frightened she might go off me said matt lightly there was an awkward pause broken fortunately by the arrival of the wine james who was oblivious of any undercurrents started to tell a stockexchange joke waving a large radish around as he talked with his pale blue coat and his puffed out cheeks he suddenly reminded imogen of peter rabbit dont crunch jumbo said yvonne irritably you know how it gets on my nerves the service is awfully slow here a moan of greed escaped imogen at the sight of her first course a sort of chicken rissole stuffed with foie gras and surrounded by bright orange sauce flecked with black opposite her james was smacking his lips over smoked salmon and a shiny green sauce matt was eating snails yvonne was chewing grated carrot bites a mouthful nicky and cable had skipped a first course and were smoking the wine even to imogens uneducated palate was spectacular thick and sultry with grapes you can almost taste the peasants feet said matt what are the black bits she asked him as she used her fourth piece of bread to mop up the sauce truffles said matt bloody bad luck for pigs really they rootle round for days and the moment they find some marvellous delicacy its snatched from under their nose like nicky from me thought imogen wistfully cable and yvonne were talking shop they sacked her from a bikini feature because she was too fat said yvonne that pale lipstick makes her mouth look like a rubber tyre said cable its her own fault shes in wedgies or tramps every night and after all the client is buying your face not your ability to drink in the right places till four oclock in the morning who are they talking about muttered imogen obviously someone extremely successful said matt i got the weetabix commercial said yvonne patronisingly starting on strips of green pepper you were after it werent you cable the producer told me you were too overtly sexy for the part thats obviously why he tried to take me to bed snapped cable lighting one cigarette from another nicky suddenly glanced across at imogen his eyes swivelling from cable to yvonne then raising them to heaven imogen giggled with relief no more bread jumbo said yvonne still chewing everything times youve already had quite enough everyone else had finished except her the waiters were hovering to take the plates and putting silver dishes over blue flames i should go on matt told them we cant hang around all night imogens second course boeuf bourgignon rich dark aromatic and pulsating with herbs was almost better than the first ive never tasted anything so heavenly in my life she said to matt good he said filling her glass and looking across at cable who was picking imaginary bones out of her trout nice change to have someone around who enjoys eating these quenelles are very disappointing grumbled yvonne what dyou expect from upmarket fish cakes said nicky i always thought a quenelle was something the dog slept in said james and roared with laughter no more wine for you jumbo said yvonne sharply how long have you two been married asked matt fortyeight weeks exactly said yvonne with what she thought was an engaging smile we still count our marriage by weeks not months weekiversaries said matt drily how touching cable shot him a warning glance james started to tell imogen a long complicated joke about a parrot upon which she found it impossible to concentrate because at the same time yvonne turned to nicky saying how did you and imogen meet in yorkshire oh i love yorkshire its so unspoilt like imogen said nicky they tied a handkerchief over the parrots eyes said james have you been going out long said yvonne no said nicky and another one round its beak said james she looks awfully young im surprised her father let her go away with you so was i what does she do sits and dreams in a library and then they both got into bed said james thats nice said yvonne she and mattll be able to have a lot of good talks about books they already have said cable she put her hands behind her head and leant back against the wall her breasts jutting out dramatically the effect was not lost on a handsome frenchman drinking brandy with a plain wife at the next table he and cable exchanged a long lingering eyemeet the frenchman dropped his eyes first then after a furtive glance at his wife who was still spooning sugar into her coffee looked at cable again cable smirked and looked away even the cook had come out of the kitchen to have a look at her and was standing openmouthed in the doorway with a lobster in his hand suddenly imogen was brought back to reality by james roaring with laughter and saying and the parrot said kama sutra is a liar get it kama sutra is a liar imogen realising hed reached the punchline roared with rather forced laughter too matt filled up jamess glass yvonne glared at matt please dont i dont want him to have any more you wont be jogging every day in france you know jumbo have some more said matt ladling more beef and potatoes on to imogens plate oh i shouldnt you should do you good to have a blow out on your first night no one else will but us he went on emptying the casserole dish on to his own plate yvonne smiled at imogen brightly i hear you work in a library oh god thought imogen shes going to bring me out now yes she muttered with her mouth full i used to love reading yvonne went on but i dont get the time now i have to read a lot of papers from central office for james ive got an aunt who reads though four novels a day we all call her the book worm she then proceeded to launch into a long and unutterably boring description of her aunts reading habits and literary tastes someone ought to put a green baize cloth over her muttered matt as he leant across to fill imogens glass having finally exhausted her aunt yvonne said youre so lucky not having a job where you have to watch your figure imogen blushed and put down the potato she was about to eat id be very happy to watch imogens figure all the time said matt evenly me too leered james the head waiter came up and put his hands on matts shoulders everything all right monsieur oconnor formidable said matt breaking into fluent french my trout was simply delicious said cable whod left most of hers imogens waistband was biting into her stomach she wished she hadnt eaten so much the restaurant was empty except for their table matt ordered coffee not for me said yvonne it keeps me awake and weve got a long drive tomorrow id like an enormous brandy said james defiantly bravo said nicky mustnt squander all our money at once jumbo night night all said yvonne getting to her feet and dragging the reluctant james off to bed got to get her ugly sleep said matt god shes a bitch said nicky matt ordered marcs all round if you go away in a party he said its essential to have a holiday scapegoat so that everyone can gang up and work off their spleen bitching about her mrs edgworth fits the bill perfectly after dinner they wandered round the village the sky glimmered with stars now and down by the river the air was heavy with the musty scent of meadow sweet imogen and nicky dawdled behind the others lovely moon sighed imogen seen it before said nicky he put a protective arm round her shoulders she could feel the warmth of his body through her sweater suddenly he paused perhaps at last he might be going to whisk her off down some side road and the primrose path she felt weak with abandon but he was only pausing to read a poster giving details of a forthcoming tennis match they wanted me to play in that he said didnt offer enough bread though and the lta get very uptight if one does too many exhibition matches imogen felt overwhelmed with humility what right had she got to be here at all with such a star ahead of them matts blond hair gleamed in a street lamp how are you getting on with matt said nicky oh very well hes so nice he is isnt he shes a funny girl in what way said imogen carefully you never know what shell do next unlike you my angel who are totally predictable i do love you she murmured like a child touching wood well thats nice except that we seem to be frustrated at every turn never mind weve got a whole fortnight ahead of us he dropped a kiss on top of her head the night was really very warm imogen tried to suppress the thought that back in june when hed been mad to pull her hed certainly have whipped her off to some discreet corner of a foreign field and made passionate love to her and not given a damn about the others i have observed a faint neglect of late she thought sadly then felt furious with herself in yorkshire shed never stopped panicking and bellyaching because he was trying to pull her now she was in a state because he wasnt her father would be delighted by such circumspection anyway perhaps nicky was playing a waiting game so as not to frighten her in front she could see cables hips undulating languorously as she walked beside matt she wished she hadnt eaten so much she wished she was as tall and as slim as her shadow outside the hotel quite without selfconsciousness matt had taken cable into his arms and kissed her very thoroughly nicky had followed suit with imogen but when she opened her eyes in the middle he was gazing over her shoulder at cable and matt sweet dreams darling said matt reluctantly relinquishing her and id love to be away by ten weve got a long drive up in their room imogen undressed quickly and jumped into bed it was long after midnight but shed never known anyone take so long to get into bed as cable removing her makeup several times massaging skin food into her face brushing her hair touching up her nail varnish doing long complicated exercises and chattering all the time such a relief not to have matt beefing at me to hurry up she said rubbing vaseline into her eyelashes and because there were no men present giving imogen the benefit of her enchanting wicked smile in fact its rather a relief to have a night off sex as well imogen snuggling down in the coarse sheets fought sleep tried to concentrate on tristram shandy and not stare at cable too hard god the beds hard said cable finally getting in beside her i hope youre not finding this trip too alarming no its lovely said imogen timidly touched that cable should be concerned cable however immediately got the subject back to herself i remember the first time i came to france on an exchange scheme when i was fifteen i was absolutely terrified i travelled by train overnight rd class can you believe it and there was this repulsive man who had little finger nails longer than the rest and put on a blue hair net after he got into his couchette the moment we dimmed the lights he tried to fiddle with me and there were two nuns in the bottom couchettes i bit him so hard he nearly pulled the communication cord what dyou think of that she laughed to herself but before imogen could think up a suitable answer she realised cable had fallen asleep like a cat having fought sleep for so long imogen now felt wide awake thank goodness yvonne was not sharing the bed too or shed be a model sandwich every man in the hotel would give a million francs to be in my place she thought as petrified shed touch cable she perched on the edge of her side of the bed she hoped shed dream of nicky but she didnt chapter eight imogen went down to breakfast next morning and found nicky and matt dirty and unshaven like a couple of bandits matt smiled at her and asked her if she had slept well marvellously lied imogen im glad someone did said nicky sulkily the royal philharmonic of tomcats started caterwauling around five oclock we abandoned all hope of sleep and invented tortures for mrs edgworth said matt at that moment yvonne bustled in wearing a dress and a pink headscarf good morning she said briskly matt and nicky looked at her stonily i didnt sleep a wink she grumbled what with the cats and the clocks striking do remember to book rooms at the back in future matt and the beds were awful surprised you didnt use james as a mattress said matt why are you all done up like a dogs dinner said nicky yvonnes lips tightened as she pulled on white gloves im off to mass where you all should be she said the next stage of the journey was a disaster cable took so long to pack and get ready that she and matt had another blazing row they ought to hold sheepdog trials for people like me said matt as he finally rounded the three of them up into the car james and yvonne had already gone on ahead nicky and imogen sat in the front cable and matt in the back matt reading a french sunday paper cable looking stonily out of the window nicky whose turn it was to drive was determined to notch up more miles an hour than matt had yesterday but imogen spoilt everything by reading the map all wrong the countryside they passed through had been so beautiful old mills covered in reddening virginia creeper tender green poplar groves rising out of lush grass and huge golden chateaux at the end of long shining lakes then suddenly she realised to her horror that shed missed an important turning as a result nicky had to spend the next threequarters of an hour disentangling them from the tentacles of a large industrial town he got more and more angry which was not helped by imogen out of sheer nerves telling him he could overtake three times when he couldnt directing him slap into oncoming traffic cutting short her stream of apologies nicky had turned on the car wireless they could still get radio patricia hughes was announcing a performance of handels little organ concerto i didnt know handel had a small prick drawled cable nicky grinned round at her probably couldnt handel it he said they both giggled and started swapping more anecdotes about mutual acquaintances ostentatiously excluding matt and imogen imogen wished she could amuse nicky like that but weve only got my family and homer in common she thought dolefully and we cant really talk about them for a fortnight she noticed that each time they reached the end of a village its name was signposted with a diagonal red line through it she had a gloomy vision of nicky taking a ruler and calmly drawing a red line through her name to signify the affair was over later tempers were not improved by no one being able to decide on the right picnic place which at miles an hour on the motorway was admittedly quite hard to find james who had been obliged to stop for yvonne several times was driving just behind them now imogen could see his eager pink face with yvonne beside him wearing dark glasses her mouth opening and shutting in a constant stream of chat cable meanwhile was driving matt insane by sitting with a red michelin guide in her hand saying every time they came to a village theres a fabulous restaurant here itd be so much nicer to stop here than have a rotten picnic and five times more expensive snapped matt im buggered if im going to fork out francs for something you wont eat im fed up with providing expensive leftovers for restaurant cats all over england and france oh shut up said cable eventually they stopped high up in the mountains with a deep green valley falling away from them richly dotted with herds of golden cattle and russet farm houses despite the height it was appallingly hot a heat haze danced above the rocks cheese pâté and garlic sausage were soon sweating and melting in the blazing sun ham curled and turned brown the acid red wine was as warm as tea yvonne perched on a rock still looking as though shed been wrapped in tissue paper daintily eating cottage cheese with a pink plastic spoon and grumbling about the insects doesnt the silly cow remind you of little miss muffet said matt to imogen pity a big spider cant roll up and put the frighteners on her for good nicky having wolfed a couple of pieces of bread and pâté had annexed a bottle of wine and was further punishing imogen by dancing attendance on cable lying on the grass beside her he alternately fed her swigs of wine from the same paper cup or dropped green grapes into her mouth occasionally after shooting a venomous glance in matts direction cable would whisper something in his ear sending them both into fits of laughter yvonne looked disapproving and unpacked yet another polythene bag of carrot matchsticks ignoring them both matt stretched out and fell asleep among the wild flowers like ferdinand the bull imogen incapable of such sangfroid miserably ate her way through five pieces of bread and garlic sausage and then felt sick james had positioned himself so he could look up cables skirt as she writhed on the ground with nicky her pink dress rode up further and further to reveal black broderie anglaise bikini pants threaded with scarlet ribbon suddenly a car drew up on the road below and three frenchmen got out quite unselfconsciously unzipped their flies and relieved themselves against the grass verge how disgusting spluttered yvonne going scarlet with disapproval how lovely and uninhibited said cable sitting up and putting a cigarette in her mouth in a flash jamess lighter was out the flame shooting into the air nearly singeing cables hair and eyelashes overeager like its master said nicky pointedly james went slightly pink and helped himself and imogen to more wine thats enough jumbo snapped yvonne you know what i feel about drinking and driving she got off the rock and started to tidy up the picnic exclaiming over the ants that had already crawled into the pâté neatly tidying the rubbish into a polythene bag and stacking it in the boot dont work so hard said cable lazily youre making us feel so guilty someones got to do it said yvonne i for one like things shipshape imogen got back into the car wincing as the sunbaked seat burnt her skin everyones awfully prickly today she said to matt thats why its called a holly day said matt and now it was late afternoon imogen sat in the back feeling car sick homesick cooped up and uncertain where life was taking her after the long hours of travelling she felt sluggish and weighed down as though all the pieces of bread shed eaten in the last twentyfour hours were lying in a leaden lump at the bottom of her stomach and now the shadows were lengthening and matt was driving again sweat darkening his shirt an old panama hat pulled over his nose to keep his dark blond mane out of his eyes all the windows were open the heat was coming in great waves the windscreen was coated with dead flies the road was curling now through pine woods and burning red rock the crickets were going like rattles the air was getting clearer and clearer up and up they went round and round until it seemed their car would touch the sky then suddenly like a sheet of metal glinting in the evening sun sparkled the mediterranean imogen caught her breath cable got out her makeup case imogen wished she had some of those little cleansing pads which cable and yvonne whipped out on every occsion even her flannel was packed in her suitcase in the boot theres portlespins said matt imogen craned her neck down below the hill was thick with little white villas with red roofs and green shutters shops cafés casinos and pale pastel houses jostled for position along the sea front a fleet of fishing boats and yachts tossed in the harbour some tiny fishing village thought imogen another shock awaited her she had always believed the french were an ugly race dumpy with incipient moustaches but as they drove along the front she had never seen so many beautiful girls trailing back from the beach with their waistlength hair long limbs and brown faces no wonder cable had spent threequarters of an hour on her face no wonder nicky looked like a small boy let loose in a sweet shop their hotel la reconnaissance was at the far end of the front drying bathing dresses and towels hung from every balcony the fat madame accompanied by an even fatter poodle came waddling out gabbling with excitement and kissed matt on both cheeks imogen was relieved to discover that she and nicky had a room each madame combined respectability with avarice matt explained in english as they climbed the redtiled staircase she got more money for two single rooms than a double but as long as appearances were kept up she didnt mind who slipped into whose room after lights out imogens room was extremely small with a large single bed no soap no coathangers no drawer space and the tiniest of face towels a piece of plastic holly was tucked behind the only picture five pink lurex bulrushes stood in a vase beside the bed if she leaned right out of the window she could just see the sea she sat down overwhelmed by another desperate wave of homesickness her hair felt stiff with dust her body ached with the inactivity of the long days drive outside yvonne was complaining bitterly that baths cost francs each and cable was bullying matt to go downstairs and get the plug changed on her carmen rollers i must pull myself together thought imogen she was on holiday after all and she must try and enjoy herself she washed as best she could in stone cold water and put on one of her new voluminous orange kaftans she wore stockings and highheeled shoes to make herself look taller and slimmer and took a lot of trouble over her face before joining the others in the bar on the front immediately she was conscious of wearing quite the wrong clothes most people were in trousers and shirts in soft pastel shades girls in dresses wore them fitted or tightly belted with greek sandals on their bare feet she was aware of brown faces laughing at her all around nicky looked at the kaftan in illconcealed disapproval expecting a baby darling said cable in her cool clear voice she looks lovely said matt who was filling in the brown identification forms he patted the chair beside him come and sit here baby and let me take down your particulars is your room all right oh yes its fine she said gratefully ours isnt said yvonne i havent got a bedside lamp with all those raw carrots you eat said matt i would have thought you could see in the dark it is rather a dump snapped yvonne i had expected something a bit better like that for instance she waved in the direction of the huge white plaza hotel which with its red and white umbrellas dominated the bay you can stay there if youre prepared not to eat or go out in the evening said matt one night at the plazall cost you as much as a fortnight at la reconnaissance well perhaps not the plaza conceded yvonne but there must be somewhere a little less primitive matt went on filling in imogens form for her occupation he put bibliothecaire which sounded very grand madame was good to matt in the old days said cable defensively when i was an undergraduate she let me stay for practically nothing said matt she used to be in the resistance im sure shell lend you her revolver if it comes to a shoot out with the cockroaches imogen gazed at the prussian blue sea which glittered and sparkled in the sinking sun whats the french for model said james trying to bridge an awkward silence and fill in yvonnes form at the same time catin said matt cable stifled a giggle and james solemnly wrote it down a party of germans sat down at the next table and started banging the table for waitresses this place is awfully touristy grumbled yvonne well youre a tourist arent you said matt a slim brunette went by in a lace shirt with the tails tied under the bosom to reveal a beautiful brown midriff everyone seems to be wearing those this year said cable i must get one what does catin really mean said imogen to nicky later as they strolled along the front prostitute said nicky they had dinner in a restaurant overhung with vines below the sea was a wash of blue shadow sparked by the lights of the fishing boats putting out for the nights catch everyone was hungry and they ate garlicky fish soup and cassoulet the wine flowed freely even yvonne seemed more cheerful when suddenly she put on her wolf in red riding hood smile and turned to matt isnt it time you and cable named the day everyone stopped talking matt looked at yvonne steadily and said what day she waved a playful finger at him now dont be evasive you and cable have been going out for nearly two years now its only fair to make an honest woman out of her cable flushed angrily its none of your damn business yvonne darling i was only interested in your welfare matt took cables hand and squeezed it then he turned to yvonne and said softly lets get three things straight first i have cables welfare very much at heart secondly i agree with her its none of your damn business and thirdly youve got butter on your chin there was a frozen pause then everyone burst out laughing except yvonne who went as red as her hair with rage nicky yawned god im so tired i could sleep on a clothes line matt was gently stroking cables cheek early bed i think darling dont you she looked at him and nodded gratefully hes a nice man thought imogen a really nice man she was beginning to feel sick perhaps that garlic soup hadnt been such a good idea nicky was eyeing a sumptuous blonde at the next table dont forget to sleep on the right side of the bed said cable mockingly to imogen as she climbed the stairs to her room she felt sicker and sicker whitefaced whitebodied she looked at herself in the mirror oh fat white woman who nobody loves she thought sadly as she put on her nightdress and jumped into bed there was a knock on the door it was nicky in a violet dressinggown and nothing underneath his black curls fell becomingly the gold medallions jangled on his chest aftershave lotion fought with the sweet scent of deodorant imogens heart turned over she had never seen such a beautiful man if only he werent going round and round hullo darling he said huskily sitting down on the bed thank god were alone at last i couldnt sleep last night for thinking about you or the tomcats or the clocks thought imogen he was kissing her now and his hands started to rove over her body he put his tongue in her ear and imogen who couldnt remember whether shed washed her ears that morning wriggled away simulating uncontrollable passion nicky laughed underneath the surface youre a hot little thing great waves of nausea were sweeping over her come on he said lets have that stupid nightdress off nicky i feel sick she said leaping out of bed and rushing to the bidet you cant be sick here said nicky in horror cant i said imogen and was and all night long like the gadarene swine she thundered down the passage to the black hellhole of a lavatory nicky foiled yet again went back to his room in an extremely bad temper chapter nine next morning feeling pale and sickly imogen staggered down to the beach the sea was blue and sparkling the sand hot and golden umbrellas stretched six deep edge to edge for half a mile along the beach bodies lay stretched out hundreds to the acre turning and oiling themselves like chickens on a spit nearly everyone imogen realised to her horror was topless cable as brown as any of them was wearing the bottom half of the briefest bikini two saffron triangles held together by straps of perspex her small perfect breasts gleamed with oil her hair hung black and shiny over the edge of her lilo nicky lounged beside her slim lithe and menacing he totally ignored imogen when she arrived matt lay on his back his eyes closed his powerful chest curved in an arch above his flat heavily muscled stomach having sallow skin he was already going brown he opened a lazy eye and grinned at imogen come and join the oppressed white minority as she struggled into lady jacinthas red bathing dress she tried to protect herself with a small face towel theres masses of room on my towel if you need it said matt who had been watching her struggles with unashamed amusement he rolled over and went back to sleep imogen lay in silence bitterly ashamed of her whiteness christ said nicky who was reading a copy of yesterdays daily telegraph nastase was knocked out in the first round damn damn damn said matt suddenly everyone looked up here comes mrs setyourteethonedgworth and the prospective candidate for cockfosters yvonne was picking her way daintily across the miles of tangled brown flesh behind her staggered james weighed down by towels lilos snorkel masks picnic baskets a large parasol and yvonnes makeup case but still managing to cast excited glances at the naked bosoms around him they look as though theyre going on safari said cable theres something rather prehistoric about jamess shorts he looks as though hes crossing the foot hills said nicky what a crowd sighed yvonne you get such lovely deserted beaches in the bahamas no put the lilo there jumbo with the towel spread over it i dont want to perspire and put the parasol so it keeps the sun off my face can you move just a fraction of an inch imogen yes thats lovely when youve finished james just pop over to the café and get me some orange squash such a funny things just happened she added to cable a little french girl came up to me and asked me for my autograph shed seen one of my commercials when she was staying in england matt looking at her with acute dislike was about to say something then turned over and went back to sleep although she was pouring with sweat imogen was too ashamed of her white body to go and swim until cable and nicky were safely in the sea then how cool and sympathetically soothing the water felt to her limbs below the dark green surface she could see the slow moving shape of a fish then suddenly someone grabbed her ankles and she was falling she seemed to swallow half the ocean choking she came to the surface to see nicky shooting away at a flashy crawl later he and cable played very ostentatiously with a yellow beach ball i say thats rather naughty said james staring fascinated at a girl whose bikini pants had practically no back to them i dont know why she bothers to wear anything at all snapped yvonne why dont you wear a bikini yvonne asked imogen id lend you one but i dont think youd get into it i really think you ought to do something about your thighs exercises are the best thing said cable flopping down on the lilo sally chetwynde lost five inches by bicycling every night imogen blushed as red as her bathing dress if matt had been there she was sure they would never have been so nasty to her they shut up as soon as he came back she watched him oiling cable his hands moving steadily over her slim brown body big practised hands as skilful at making love as keeping a large car steady on a winding road at excessive speeds her heart suddenly twisted with loneliness her skin was already turning as pink and as freckled as a foxglove oh to be as beautiful as cable and to be loved by a man like matt she was also worried that although shed searched her room high and low she couldnt find her pills what on earth was nicky going to say when he discovered shed lost them perhaps she could get some from a chemist avezvous la pilule pour arreter les bébés but wasnt france a catholic country which forbade the pill anyway if only yvonne or cable were more cosy she could have asked them of course vogue pay peanuts only twentyfive quid a day yvonne was saying i wouldnt put on my makeup for twentyfive quid a day said cable matt sighed and took refuge in a tattered copy of brideshead revisited when imogen looked at herself in the glass before dinner she was scarlet her head and her eyes ached she had obviously overdone it her hair was stiff with oil sand and sea water sand also seemed to have got into everything towel comb bag clothes the floor of the room was just like the gobi desert she lay on her bed and wondered which would be the worst evil her baggy trousers or her other kaftan she decided on trousers which would at least hide her legs after she had dressed and had another fruitless search for her pills she wandered into cables room and found her busy combing out newly washed ebony curls goodness youre red said cable good thing you kept yourself well oiled try some of my green face powder guess what james edgworths just made a pass at me serve yvonne right for being so bitchy last night i cant think why i liked her in london and do you know she was purley carnival queen when she was james made me promise not to tell anyone in spite of the green face powder imogens face glowed like a furnace as the evening wore on after dinner they went to a nightclub she couldnt believe how ravishing the girls were with their smooth expressionless faces and long long legs and how beautifully they danced it was as though the sun had melted their limbs to liquid nicky having drunk too much spent most of the evening wrapped round cable matt ignored them both and gabbled away to the nightclub owner every so often he smiled reassuringly at imogen through the soupy darkness but later back in her room she wondered if she had ever been more miserable in her life here she was on the riviera with the handsomest man in the world a real daydream situation come true and she was loathing every minute of it she winced from sunburn as she climbed into bed oh please god make him be nice to me tonight much later nicky came in wearing not the violet dressinggown which shed so nearly been sick over last night but a pair of black pyjamas his gleaming beauty after a day in the sun was overwhelming squinting slightly from so much drink he looked like a dangerous hungry siamese cat he was obviously not going to put up with any nonsense tonight her stomach contracted with fear and expectancy feeling bridal darling he said silkily and pulled her towards him his fingers biting into her arms its time you stopped playing games his kisses were hard and brutal and gave her no pleasure she was nearly suffocated by the smell of cables scent no no nicky i dont want to well this time youre going to have to honey child but you dont love me she gasped not a bit youve ignored me since we left england rubbish said nicky i tried hard enough last night didnt i i couldnt help it oh nicky please please dont i cant find my pills your what it was like a pistol shot ive looked for them everywhere i must have left them in that hotel on the way his slit eyes were like dark thread jesus cant you do anything right i dont believe you ever got them in the first place imogen gave a gasp of horror oh i did i did i promise crap said nicky you just pretended you had we cant do anything to upset daddy can we i did get them said imogen bursting into tears oh why wont you believe me nicky mean with drink inside him rattled her like a cat shaking a mouse calling her every name he could think of until someone banged on the wall and told them to shut up in german nicky swore back in german and pushed imogen back against the pillow im sssorry nicky she sobbed i do love you well i dont love you he snarled get that straight nor do i like prissy little girls who string men along just for the sake of a holiday in the sun and he stormed out of the room slamming the door behind him there were four church clocks in portlespins and imogen counted each one chiming the quarter hours through the night until the crowing cocks brought the morning sun streaming through the shutters as she was going downstairs next morning dark glasses covering her reddened eyes cable popped her head out of the bedroom door i just found these at the bottom of one of my espadrilles she said i do hope you werent looking for them and laughing she thrust the mauve card holding the pills into imogens hand laughter thought imogen is the most insidious sound in the world cable and nicky lay on the beach slightly out of earshot from the rest of the party heads together laughing and talking in low caressing voices the heat of the sun was as fiery as yesterdays but a fierce wind was raging it tore the parasols out of the ground blew sand in everyones faces and ruffled the green feathers of the palm trees along the front its called a mistral matt told imogen it makes everyone very badtempered have you noticed how the nicest people become absolute monsters with too much spare time on their hands yvonne was moaning at james who was hiding his pink burnt body under a huge green towel cable was as snappy as an elastic band with matt and nicky didnt deign to recognise imogens existence a black poodle with a red collar came scampering by scattering sand james whistled and made clicking noises with his hand dont talk to strange dogs jumbo snapped yvonne they might easily have rabies cable in an emerald green bikini with a matching turban to keep the sand out of her hair had never looked more seductive matt retired behind paris match yvonne put on a cardboard beak to protect her nose from the sun which made her look like some malignant bird james got out his box brownie and went on a photographic spree which consisted mainly of front approaches on large ladies nicky went off to hire a pedalo three handsome muscular frenchmen playing ball edged nearer cable then one of them deliberately missed a catch so the ball landed at her feet with laughter and voluble apologies and much show of interest they all came to retrieve it cable gave them a smouldering look they smiled back in admiration next moment another catch was missed and the ball landed on her towel and with a flurry of pardons was retrieved again cable smirked matt took no notice and went on reading imogen suddenly thought how infuriating it must be for cable that he appeared so unjealous maybe it was an elaborate game between them she picked up a copy of elle that cable had abandoned which said une vrai beauté sauvage would be fashionable this autumn the glamorously dishevelled mane of the model on the front cover bore no resemblance to imogens awful mop of hair which was now going in toutes directions the heat was awful imogen who was burning picked up a tube of sun lotion and began plastering it over her face yvonne gave a squeal of rage and snatched it away from her how dare you use my special lotion matt lowered paris match stop beefing he said sharply one oils the same as another this one was specially made for me at great expense because of my sensitive skin said yvonne because im a model its absolutely vital i dont peel this stuff is matt got up and went down to the sea leaving her in midsentence hes the rudest man i ever met yvonne said furiously as she readjusted her cardboard beak i dont know why you put up with him cable cable rolled over and looked at yvonne her green eyes glinting because my dear she drawled hes a genius in bed what a disgusting thing to say said yvonne looking like an enraged beetroot once youve had matt said cable you never really want anyone else then why are you fooling around with nicky beresford imogen caught her breath cable grinned wickedly because nickys so pretty and i must keep matt on his toes or shall we say his elbows youre going about it the wrong way said yvonne you should occasionally sew a button on his shirt or cook more modellings not a very stable career you know neithers marriage snapped cable your husband made the most horrendous pass at me last night and getting up in one lithe movement she made her way down to the sea to join nicky on a pedalo yvonne turned on imogen as the only available target i dont know why you came out here with nicky and then let him get away with it she snapped and spluttering with fury went off to find james imogen got some postcards out of her bag she had bought them to send home to the family and the office but what on earth could she say to them they had all been so excited about her going how could she tell them the truth dear everyone she wrote very large how are you all i arrived safely none of the gardens here are as good as ours suddenly she had a vision of the vicarage and pikely juliet and the boys would be at school now her mother would probably be getting ready to go down to the shops flapping about looking for her list while homer waited for her impatiently trailing his chain lead around like marleys ghost at such a distance even her father seemed less formidable a great wave of homesickness overwhelmed her matt strolled lazily up from the sea water dripping from his huge shoulders heavylidded eyes squinting against the sun there was poor little imogen in that awful bathing dress surrounded by other peoples possessions hed never seen anyone so woebegone today she was redeyed covered in bruises nicky must have put her through hell last night those paleskinned english girls always translated badly to the south of france for the first few days her clothes were frightful her hair a disaster once she turned brown however she might have possibilities i could teach her a thing or three he thought he lay down beside her and put his arm round her shoulders i declare national necking week officially open he said she turned a woeful face to him and held up an arm covered in bites i dont seem to attract anything but mosquitoes she said her lips trembling has yvonne been bullying you listen baby dont let her get you down i know how she comes on like she owns this beach personally and everyone has to act like a vicarage tea party but youve just got to ignore her poor little thing he thought she really is miserable something will definitely have to be done about it chapter ten i feel lucky tonight said matt after dinner im off to the casino to blow all our french bread i suppose said cable sourly as they went into the roulette room imogen was overwhelmed by the smoke the glaring lights and the fever the place itself generated gambling was obviously taken very seriously here round the table sat women with scarlet nails and obsessive faces none of the pale hardeyed men behind them betrayed a flicker of interest in cable huge sums of money were changing hands matt went off to the cashier and returned with his big hands full of counters fifteen for cable fifteen for imogen and the rest for me because im good at it the others are fending for themselves to imogen her fifteen counters suddenly became of crucial importance and the green baize table a fearsome battleground if she won she would get nicky back if she lost then all was lost she would play number twentysix nickys age but twentysix obstinately refused to come up and gradually her pile dwindled away until she had only one counter left she put it on number nine it came up relief flooded her she backed it again and again it came up good girl said matt who was steadily amassing chips beside her but something compelled her to chance her luck and go on playing and this time she lost and lost until she only had two counters in desperation she put them both on noir rouge came up tears stinging her eyes she escaped to the ladies oh god i look hateful she moaned her face was still bright scarlet the mistral had played even worse havoc with her hair whipping it into a wild mop like a zulu warrior she couldnt even get a comb through it she didnt recognise the couple locked together in the passage when she came out a few minutes later but she stiffened as she heard the familiar purr of nickys voice darling youre so lovely he was saying and i can feel your heart going like the charge of the light brigade cable gave a husky laugh and wound her arms round his neck do you believe in love at first sight he went on i didnt until i met you then pow suddenly it happened as though id been struck by a thunderbolt i dont know what it is about you something indefinable apart from being so beautiful imogen couldnt believe her ears he was using exactly the same words hed used when hed tried to seduce her that first time on the moor words that were irrevocably signed on her heart what about old purple sprouting brocklehurst said cable softly nicky laughed i knew it was a mistake the moment i met you but i couldnt let her down shes not much trouble and anyway it gave me a chance of being near you i feel a bit mean cant we find some arresting provençal fisherman to bed her down never get near her said nicky and started to kiss cable again they were so preoccupied they didnt notice her stumbling past she met matt coming out of the roulette room he was looking pleased with himself ive just won nearly three thousand francs he said how much is that said imogen desperately trying to sound normal about ive been good and cashed it in he looked at her closely hey whats the matter nothing im fine she said cable and nicky is it she nodded impossible to keep anything from him he took her arm i think you and i had better have a little talk he led her to a deserted corner of the beach they sat down on the warm sand a huge white moon had turned the sea to gunmetal the waves were idly flapping on the shore matt lit a cigarette all right lovie what happened stammering she told him i dont mind him kissing her so much she said finally i mean shes so lovely anyone would want to but its just his using the same words cliché cliché cliché said matt scornfully but then you cant expect someone who hits a white ball across a net year in year out to have a very extensive vocabulary can you imogen had a feeling he was laughing at her but nickys clever he speaks five languages she said defensively a sign of great stupidity i always think said matt hell im not trying to put nicky down ive nothing against people with iqs in single figures i just think you should know some home and away truths about him i bet i know how he picked you up we were introduced said imogen stiffly no before that wasnt he playing in a match and he suddenly picked you out in the crowd and acted as though hed been turned to stone then i suppose he missed a few easy shots as though he was completely overwhelmed by your beauty and flashed his pretty teeth at you every time he changed ends he must have told you said imogen in a stifled voice no such luck sweetheart its standard beresford pickup practice in tournaments all round the country quite irresistible too when combined with those devastating good looks he never does it if theres any chance he might lose the match then why did he bother to bring me on holiday for a number of reasons i should think because youre very pretty because hes got a jaded palate and youre different from his usual run of scrubbers because he couldnt make you in yorkshire and he always likes to get his own way and finally because he hadnt met cable then and what chance have i got against her sighed imogen you still want him after hearing all that imogen nodded miserably im a constant nymph she said matt sighed i was afraid you were well well have to get him back for you wont we outside her bedroom he took her key and unlocked the door now baby lesson one dont cry all night itll only make you look ugly in the morning and if youre still smarting about the purple sprouting brocklehurst bit remember that cables real name is enid sugden he smiled touched her cheek with his hand and went imogen undressed and lay on her bed for a few minutes in the moonlight fancy cable being called enid she giggled then her thoughts turned to matt was it jane austen who said friendship was the finest balm for the pangs of despised love she got up locked her door and fell into a deep sleep it was after ten oclock when she woke next morning she found matt drinking pernod on the front surrounded by newspapers his long legs up on the table youre going brown isnt it a pity one cant have the first drink of the day twice he said ordering her a cup of coffee how is everyone she said grimly determined to enjoy their fortnights holiday yvonne running herself up as usual cable in one of her moods im not sure which one theyve all gone water skiing didnt you want to go said imogen anxiously it was bad enough that nicky should annexe cable without matt being left with nickys boring girlfriend after my performance on the boat coming over you must be joking you and i are going to take a trip along the coast it was a perfect day the mistral had retired into its cave the air was soft and as they drove along the coast road the smell of petrol mingled with the scent of the pines she still felt upset about nicky but for today she was determined not to brood where are we going asked imogen st tropez said matt oh god thought imogen as the wind fretted her hair into an even worse tangle everyone will look like bardot there matt parked the car on the front in the yachts round the port the rich in their pucci silks were surfacing for the first champagne of the day matt steered imogen through a doorway up some stairs into a hairdressing salon to kick off were going to do something about your hair he said imogen backed away in terror oh no she said theyll chop it all off no they wont said matt explaining to the pretty receptionist exactly what he wanted them to do itll look great he said smiling at imogen reassuringly ill pick you up later il a beaucoup dallure sighed the pretty receptionist to one of the assistants who nodded in agreement as she helped imogen into a pink overall when matt came back he didnt recognise her he gave her one of those hard appraising sexy looks that men only give to very pretty girls then he said my god and a great smile spread across his face her hair hung in a sleek bronze curtain to her shoulders parted on one side and falling seductively over one eye very pretty little one he said walking round her you dont look like judge jeffreys after too much port any more but the expression in his heavylidded eyes belied the teasing note in his voice lets go and have some lunch he said tucking his hand underneath her arm he led her down a labyrinth of alleys smelling of garlic abounding in cats and washing to a tiny dark restaurant which was full of fishermen the food was superb imogen watched matt slowly pulling leaves off his artichoke what does beaucoup dallure mean she asked matt looked up lots of sex appeal why imogen blushed i just heard someone saying it about someone as always he drew confidences out of her as the sun brings out the flowers under that exceptionally friendly gaze she was soon telling him about the vicarage and her brothers and sister and what hell it had been to be fat at school and how difficult it was to get on with her father hes a journalist she kept telling herself hes trained to ask questions and be a good listener hed do the same to anyone but she found herself noticing that his eyes were more dark green than black and there was a small scar over his right eyebrow youre not eating up he said stripping one of her langoustine dipping it into the mayonnaise and popping it into her mouth i was wondering what the others were doing she lied bitching i should think yvonne told me this morning that it takes all sorts to make a world really someone should write all her sayings down in a book so theyre not forgotten he ordered another bottle of wine two of the fishermen were staring fixedly at imogen now she wondered if shed got lipstick on her teeth and surreptitiously got out her mirror matt grinned at her theyre staring at you because you look beautiful he said the musky treacherous fires of the wine were stealing down inside her she was beginning to feel wonderful matt asked for the bill imogen got out her purse let me pay please let me matt shook his head this is on me as they went out into the fiery sunshine she swayed slightly and matt took her arm come on baby weve got things to do imogen kept catching reassuring glimpses of her sleek reflection in shop windows the rich in their yachts and their pucci silks held no terrors for her now she was walking on air i think im a bit tight she said good said matt turning briskly into a boutique in a daze she watched him rifling through a tray of bikinis if its for cable she said that red one would look lovely not for cable he said piloting her into one of the changing rooms for you oh i couldnt im too fat im the best judge of that said matt handing her a pale blue bikini and drawing the curtain on her oh what the hell thought imogen hiccupping gently she put on the bikini and then stood gaping at herself except for her midriff which was still pale there smiling back at her in the mirror was one of those beautiful shapely blondes who paraded up and down the beach at portlespins could it really be her she gave a squeal of delight matt pulled back the curtain and gave a low whistle thats not bad for a start he said but im practically falling out of it she said disgusting he ran a leisurely hand over her midriff youll have to put in some overtime here try these on everything he handed her dresses trousers shirts beach shifts was in pale greens blues and pinks calculated to take the last tinge of red out of her suntan the record player was pounding out old pop tunes youre just too good to be true cant take my eyes off you sang andy williams took the words out of my mouth said matt still the same teasing note in his voice but in his eyes once again she read approval and something else which made her heart beat faster as she struggled into an apple green dress covered in white daisies wondering how he should so instinctively know what suited her she suddenly heard a commotion outside matthieu mon vieux antoine mon brave followed by a torrent of excited french imogen put her head round the curtain to find matt talking nineteen to the dozen to the wickedestlooking frenchman she had ever seen he was wearing an immaculately tailored suit in brilliant yellow pinstripe with a grey shirt and a green carnation in his button hole rings flashed from his fingers gold rings in his ears he reeked of scent and was smoking a large cigar and although he had a young dark gipsy face his hair was already quite grey suddenly his black eyes lighted on imogen she come with you matthieu what a beautiful girl this is imogen said matt beautiful murmured antoine fingering the green dress you look like a meadow mademoiselle may i come and roll in you some time imogen baby sighed matt im afraid this is antoine de la tour playboy of the western world in between bouts of debauchery he makes films we are old friends said antoine we were at oxfawd together he spoke english fluently with a strong yorkshire accent my nanny come from yorkshire he explained to imogen she taught me english and much else besides ever since nanny ive a tendresse for yorkshire girls keep your hands off her said matt shes not mine to lend i only borrowed her for the day tell me do you know anything about braganzi ive seen him in marseilles once said antoine and the duchess what a beautiful woman how do i get to see him asked matt you dont said antoine is house is like a fortress at that moment a redhead came undulating across the room with a pile of silk shirts over her arm she was of such massive proportions she made imogen feel like twiggy this is mimi said antoine good girl but spik no english he handed her his wallet and after smiling ravishingly at him she undulated to the cash desk look at those ips sighed antoine but then i always prefer quantity to quality her father is biggest bidet manufacturer in france e finance my next film what is it asked imogen wondering where matt had disappeared to i mek story of annibal and the halps we import one hondred elephants from africa mimi will ave small part as annibals slave girl shell be splendid said imogen matt appeared and handed her a bulging carrier bag she peered inside aghast but matt i cant i thought we were just fooling about all these things must have cost a fortune you cant give them to me all in a good cause said matt consider that they come with the compliments of portlespins casino lets go and see antoine off he added before she could argue any more outside deep in onlookers was a huge pale mauve rollsroyce with smoked glass windows mimi two great danes and a goat were watching television in the back a tall sleek negro in a white suit and dark glasses was opening the door for antoine this is rebel said antoine my bodyguard and friend i want him to play caesar in my film but he say it against black power principles to play white dictator well come over to portlespins this evening au revoir mes petites and he joined mimi and the menagerie in the back he certainly has great style said imogen still giggling as she and matt stretched out on the beach later i mean that grey hair with that young face its dyed said matt you may laugh but hes absolutely lethal where women are concerned you should have seen him at oxford bowling them over with his cartier watches and his dinner jacket with green facings any girl worth her salt in those days claimed to be educated at roedean lady margaret hall and antoine de la tour so watch it mate although everyone else on the beach was sunbathing topless imogen jumped out of her skin as she felt matts fingers undoing the clasp of her bikini no i cant she gasped dont be silly said matt turn over ill oil you imogen shut her eyes and turned over the hot sun beat red through her lids hastily she covered her breasts with her folded arms come on said matt i want to look at you oh please dont muttered imogen im so awful shut up he said gently pulling down her arms youve been hiding your finest asset for far too long nicky was absolutely right about your tits as his hands began to move luxuriously over her stomach she felt her throat tighten and her mouth go dry she opened her eyes to find him smiling lazily down at her the heavy olive lids almost shutting out the dark green eyes her heart was going bumpbump like an overloaded spin dryer suddenly the beach had become a tiny room ill oil the rest of me she stammered snatching the tube of ambre solaire from him and hastily smothering her tits matt laughed fear no more the heat of the sun he said its not the heat of the sun im scared of at the moment muttered imogen frantically reaching for her bikini top im going for a swim uh uh he held her down not when ive just oiled you concentrate on getting brown he picked up the evening paper bugger he said braganzi and the duchess went to the theatre in marseilles last night jesus if only i could get in there if hes totally unmoved by my lying beside him half naked perhaps its all right thought imogen looking timidly around a few yards away a handsome german was lasciviously rubbing oil into his companions enormous breasts goodness i am seeing life she thought as gradually the tension seeped out of her much later when imogens bosom and the sea were turning a deep rosy gold matt glanced at his watch christ its late wed better get back they drove back in a manic mood the wireless was roaring out the fifth symphony matt was waltzing the car round the hairpin bends he was wearing that battered panama hat to keep the sun out of his eyes his thick tawny hair was now extravagantly bleached and streaked by the sun his teeth gleamed white in his brown face god hes divine how could i ever have thought he was ugly she wondered such a lovely day she said stretching luxuriously and all my heavenly clothes you are good to me matt he looked round and smiled approvingly nicky wont be able to keep his hands off you now nicky that brought her up with a jerk how awful she hadnt given him a thought for hours chapter eleven sulky faces greeted them as they drove up to the hotel where the hell have you been snapped cable exciting each other on the beach at st trop said matt nicky and james were gaping at imogen who had got out of the car and was standing in the street in her bikini her hair streaming down her back gosh said james in awe you look like one of the girls at the motor show matt seems to have been playing pygmalion said cable frostily rather successfully dont you think said matt looking at imogen she looks tremendous said james have a drink we bumped into antoine de la tour mad as ever hes coming over this evening how was the water skiing darling said matt to cable he bent over to give her a peck on the cheek but she jerked her head away and spat a remark at him which only he heard he straightened up and looked at her its those loving things you do that make me grow so close to you he said in an undertone yvonnes ill said nicky who was still staring at imogen shes been stung by a jellyfish oh dear said matt in concern is the poor jellyfish expected to live james tried but failed to look affronted she wants me to sit by her bedside all night he said plaintively id get her some pills to ease the pain but i cant make the beastly chemist understand ill get her something said matt order us a drink ill be right back first she says i stink of garlic and then i mustnt touch her because of her sunburn and now this what a holiday james looked as though he was going to cry nicky turned to imogen you look sensational he said and began to tell her about the water skiing his eyes wandering over her body as of old cable looked so thunderous imogen was glad when matt came back here you are he said handing james a phial of green pills but tell yvonne not to take too many theyre absolute knockouts thanks awfully said james bolting into the hotel he came back five minutes later his face wreathed in smiles what on earth were they he asked she went out like a light smarties said matt i got them from the sweet shop round the corner we extracted the green ones cable was the only person not to join in the shouts of laughter im going to change she said so am i said matt grimly imogen at a discreet distance behind them saw matt follow cable into their room when are you going to stop buggering up every one elses holiday she heard him say male chauvinist pygmalion thought imogen dinner was decidedly stormy the collision of wills in the bedroom had obviously escalated into a major row cable was in a murderous mood her jaw set her green eyes glittering she kept ordering the most expensive things on the menu and then sending them back untouched she was drinking heavily and although nicky was listening to her feverish chatter every so often he cast discreet glances in imogens direction imogen was feeling beautiful in one of the dresses matt had bought her she had noticed the way mens heads had turned and looked at her and stayed looking as she came into the restaurant it was a completely new experience even cable couldnt destroy her mood of euphoria james delirious to be off the matrimonial lead was getting thoroughly overexcited matt appeared outwardly unruffled but he was lighting one cigarette from another no one was sorry when antoine and mimi arrived and bore them all off to a disco outside the town on the way they passed a large turreted house strewn with creeper set back from the road behind high walls and huge iron gates thats one of braganzis ide outs said antoine it go straight down to a private beach above the burglar alarm trill of the cicadas they could hear the faint baying of guarddogs i ave made the enquiries matthieu antoine went on if you go along to le bar de le marine tomorrow lunchtime and ask for a monsieur roche e might be able to help the disco was called verdis requiem imogen was almost knocked sideways by the brushfire smell of pot alice cooper thundering out of the stereo and a mass of writhing bodies antoine promptly ordered champagne all round and installed them at the best table immediately nicky asked imogen to dance you look simply terrific he said as soon as they were out of earshot of the others i hardly recognised you when matt brought you back this evening im afraid ive been a bit offish lately but when you kept hustling me out of the bedroom and then losing your pills it seemed as though i was deliberately rejecting you a deliberate rejection was exactly what it semed im sorry nicky i didnt mean it im sorry too no hard feelings they smiled at each other his eyes are like velvet thought imogen but was shocked to find herself adding that his forehead was too low and his smile like a toothpaste commercial he laid his smooth brown cheek against her hair and drew her closer to him but her heart didnt thump in the usual way she even felt very strong at the knees did you have a nice day with matt he said yes thank you did you have a nice day with cable its rather like looking after a two year old said nicky you have to keep her amused all the time and shes into everything particularly boutiques i cant think how matt can afford her she needs a play pen the moment they got back to the table james swept her on to the floor it was as though he had hitherto proceeded gingerly through life like a sports car towing a huge cumbersome trailer but now suddenly the trailer had been detached or rather stung by a jellyfish and the sports car was careering off joyfully into the unknown jolly handsome chap antoine he said as his hands roved eagerly over imogens body i wonder if i could get away with wearing earrings would it be quite the thing for a tory candidate shouted imogen above the din of the music youd have to have your ears pierced my ears are pierced every day by the voice of my dear wife said james petulantly imogen giggled she realised shed had a great deal too much to drink oblivious that james was breathing down the front of her dress and caressing her back she tried to unravel her confused emotions whatever had happened to that undying love she had sworn to nicky last night she looked across the room at him talking earnestly to cable as though he was placating her for dancing so long with imogen she was alarmed that she felt no pang of jealousy what price the constant nymph now many a tear has to fall but its all in the game sang the record player that mimis a bit of all right isnt she said james squeezing imogen ever tighter how do you say do you bop in french a few minutes later james and mimi had taken the floor james just about coming up to mimis shoulder happily buried his pink face in her magnificent bosom imogen meanwhile was having a long dance with antoine who divided his time between flirting outrageously and telling her how awful he thought cable was she is a nighthorse he said finally nightmare giggled imogen but she was surprised she had thought antoine and cable would get on perhaps they were both too fond of the limelight this is a very nice place she said i own it said antoine simply looking like the devil himself swaying in front of her all in black with his diamonds flashing gaudily and his white teeth gleaming tigerish in his dark gipsy face any moment she expected him to disappear through a trapdoor in a puff of smoke oim jolly well pleased to see you he said mimi goes to paris at the weekend i come over and see you i have villa just behind the village we might go riding or sailing together i have been sailing in england at calves calves said imogen puzzled yes in the island of wight oh cowes she went off into peals of laughter she found it impossible to take him seriously i love england but i think your countrymen behave atrocious abroad he was looking at james who with mimis help was energetically lowering his countrys prestige on the other side of the floor mimi make the distress signals he said i must salvage her a bientôt ma cherie and kissing imogen fondly on both cheeks he delivered her back to the table james asked her to dance and then nicky again and then james cable refusing to leave the table and the champagne was looking absolutely thunderous and didnt even cheer up when nicky made the disc jockey play one of her favourite tunes fate is conspiring against me thought cable bitterly for the first few days of the holiday everything had gone so well she had succeeded in enslaving nicky and james irritating yvonne utterly overshadowing stupid naïve imogen and finally most important of all continually keeping matt on the jump she knew how upset he had been beneath that apparent imperturbability she had felt the whole time as though shed been driving a coach and five with complete success but tonight suddenly she felt the reins slipping out of her hands matt had obviously enjoyed his day with imogen and brought her back looking quite passable at least nicky and james and antoine obviously thought so and were all over her men always went for anything new cable was further irritated that antoine hadnt reacted to her charms shed always heard what a wolf he was and he wasnt even flickering in her direction as for that blousy overweight mimi even in the gloom of the disco everyone was turning their heads and staring at her in admiration in the same way cable supposed people would stare at an elephant if it came through the door and then nicky wasnt being as tractable as usual that very afternoon shed caught him exchanging surreptitious but no less smouldering glances with a blonde nymphette at the waterskiing club shed have to give him some concessions soon she drained her glass of champagne and banged it imperiously on the table get another bottle she ordered matt totally ignoring her matt turned towards imogen who was coming off the floor with james her hair was tumbled from dancing her cheeks flushed her breasts rising and almost falling out of the low cut dress my turn i think he said getting to his feet beautiful beautiful girl said antoine how i love yorkshire girls nicky was about to agree with him and claim responsibility for discovering her then glancing at cables face thought better of it isnt that bianca jagger over there said james peering through the gloom im going to ask her to dance imogen had been waiting to dance with matt all evening there was a thrill of excitement in the pit of her stomach as loosejointed he swayed in front of her his lazy triangular eyes amused yet approving youre having a good evening darling theyve been after you like wasps round a water melon its entirely due to you she said she looked across the room at nicky and cable who were deep in conversation nicky was holding cables hand and apparently trying to calm her down im sorry it didnt work getting nicky off cable i mean matt shrugged his shoulders im not losing any sleep he said the music accelerated the colours were shifting like a kaleidoscope the floor was filling up and they were constantly thrown together matt put his hands on her shoulders to protect her she was finding it difficult to breathe suddenly he buried his face in her neck her body turned to liquid youve been pinching cables scent he said oh goodness im sorry said imogen blushing crimson in confusion i dont mind pinch away it doesnt suit you thats all too clinging imogen was about to say she felt clinging when nicky came over antoines off james is about to be duffed up by the husband of a girl hes convinced is bianca jagger and cable says shes bored and im in absolutely no hurry cable can do the waiting for a change said matt imogen didnt dare look in cables direction and tried not to feel elated as they danced on for another two records by which time the table had emptied outside they found rebel the black chauffeur bearing a heavily embracing antoine and mimi away in the huge rollsroyce cable was crouched over the wheel of the mercedes with nicky beside her an arm along the back of the seat where the hell have you been said cable furiously revving up the car keeping you waiting snapped matt you and your darling protégée have been doing that all day i should write to the times about it if i were you said matt stop sending me up howled cable you can both bloody well walk home and jamming her foot down on the accelerator she thundered off down the coast road oh dear said imogen in horror silly bitch said matt totally unmoved shall we walk its only a mile or two if youre too knackered ill go back and ring for a taxi oh no id love to said imogen unable to believe her luck suits me said matt taking her arm i want to have a closer butchers at braganzis house on the way after the days relentless heat the night was warm and sultry compared with the stuffiness of the disco the air was sweet and smelt faintly of dew wild thyme and the sea the cicadas were cawing in the trees like frogs portlespins glittered in its cove ahead of them and every few seconds its northern jut of rock was bathed in a white beam from the lighthouse far above them everything in the sky stars planets milky way moon seemed to be out and twinkling eons away in their own heavens and im so lit up they can probably see me twinkling away down here on earth too thought imogen she was swaying slightly from drink and euphoria but matt steadied her holding her above the elbow gently stroking the inside of her arm with his thumb hes probably so used to caressing cable he does it automatically she thought youre too good to be true cant take my eyes off you hummed matt abstractedly they could see braganzis house ghostly in the moonlight its turrets thickly hung with creeper and silhouetted against the sky is it really necessary to get to see him said imogen nervously oughtnt you to be relaxing on your holidays all journalists are the same once theyve got on to a scent they cant let it alone like dogs with a bitch on heat they were only a hundred yards away now there were two lights on upstairs with bars like lift gates over the windows perhaps one was the duchesss bedroom imogen imagined her brushing out her long dark hair with silver brushes with coronets on she longed to open all the shutters like an advent calendar and perhaps find the little baby asleep in one room or braganzi plotting some dastardly crime in a black shirt and a white tie in another outside the main gates they could see a figure walking up and down with an alsatian on a lead the dog growled the man stubbed out his cigarette and looked around imogen started to tremble lets have a look round the back whispered matt fifteen foot high walls with another three feet of iron spikes and rolled barbed wire on top of that went almost all the way round the house then divided at the back running down to the sea and protecting braganzis stretch of private beach the only way into the house is from the sea whispered matt and i bet thats guarded night and day hes not taking any chances is he its worse than colditz he looked at the burglar alarms that clung like limpets to the walls of the house the brightness of the moonlight and the sweet heavy smell of tobacco plants and nightscented stocks made it all the more sinister do lets go pleaded imogen she was sure the guard dogs could hear the frantic hammering of her heart they were creeping close to the wall now suddenly she heard a tinny sound as her foot hit something metallic bugger said matt bending down to look thats probably an alarm next moment there was a frantic barking of dogs and sounds of a door clanging theyve rumbled us gasped imogen come here said matt and the next moment hed pushed her down on the ground and was kissing her tugging down the top of her dress baring her shoulders she could feel the rough scrub against her back and taste the salt and brandy on his lips the growling grew closer and more ferocious imogen wriggled in terror lie still muttered matt putting his full weight on her its a lovely way to go next moment the area was flooded with light the dogs charged forward it seemed they must rip them to pieces and then suddenly the ferocious growling stopped not six inches away imogens french was not particularly fluent but she could just make out matt furiously asking what the bloody hell the guards thought they were doing as he pulled imogens dress up over her shoulders the guards dragged the dogs off and made her and matt get to their feet matt explained that they were holidaymakers whod got separated from the rest of the party and decided to walk home that they were staying at la reconnaissance in portlespins then the guards frisked matt and had a look at his wallet and his travellers cheques imogen nearly fainted when she saw that all four men had guns they certainly took their time searching her rough hands wandering into the most embarrassing places until matt shouted at them to leave her alone finally the guards conferred among themselves for a minute and then told them to be on their way shouting something after them with a coarse laugh that imogen didnt understand she could feel their eyes following her and matt like eight prongs sticking into their backs keep walking dont look round hissed matt thank christ i didnt have my passport on me or theyd have rumbled us after what seemed an eternity they rounded the corner out of sight with portlespinss friendly lights winking just below them imogen started to tremble violently matt put his arms round her darling im terribly sorry are you all right im not sure she said i thought our last moment had come he held her close to him and stroked her hair and her bare arms until the reassuring warmth of his body made her calmer but your reactions were like lightning she stammered pushing me on to the ground like that then acting dumb and outraged like any old tourist caught in the act matt laughed and got a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket i always turn into a bumpkin at midnight anyway ive talked myself out of much worse trouble spots than that all the same im really sorry i shouldnt have put you through it what did they say as we were leaving next time i brought a bird up on to the cliffs for a quick poke to choose somewhere else so they really believed you matt shrugged his shoulders they wont tomorrow when they check up with the hotel he was walking along with an arm round her shoulders now and suddenly she felt choked with happiness almost to the point of tears as it dawned on her how much in spite of the danger shed enjoyed being kissed by him and feeling the muscular weight of his body on top of her she was still trembling but not from fear he must be terrified of something to wire a place up like that losing the duchess i guess said matt they had dropped down into the port now lights from the boats shivered in the black water like fallen earrings the forest of masts swayed gently against the stars in the distance they could hear the faint splash of the sea as it rolled over and over on the white sand they came to an allnight café along the front a few fishermen were drinking morosely at the bar a tiredlooking waitress had kicked off her shoes and was polishing glasses as though in her sleep what we need is immediate first aid said matt and as he was ordering black coffee and triple brandies for them both he suddenly turned round and smiled at her the effect of him that close was so mindblowing that her knees gave way she had to fumble for a bar stool and clamber on to it will you bother to go and see antoines contact tomorrow she asked as they got their drinks if that doesnt lead to anything ill scrub the whole thing and preserve my energies for squabbling with mrs edgworth he took her hand and she hoped he couldnt feel the tremor that shot through her look angel im really sorry you were frightened when ones had scraps with provos and white rhodesians and even amins henchmen as i have in my time braganzis hoods seem pretty small fry but i know how terrifying it was for you honestly im fine now she could hardly tell him shed never felt so happy in her life and she thought he was the nicest man shed ever met and if hed taken her in his arms and thrown her down on the heath again she wouldnt have minded if the entire criminal world formed a shrieking witchs coven round them so instead she said what were amins henchmen like then he told her about some of the trouble spots hed been to and they had several more brandies by which time the stars were fading and the horizon was lightening to a pale turquoise they walked back past the bar de la marine and the plaza hotel with its striped umbrellas folded and its dozing doorman they passed a few elderly homosexuals looking for comfort and guitarists from the nightclubs sleepily twanging their way home youre too good to be true cant take my eyes off you hummed matt at the reception area of la reconnaissance with its one naked light bulb he took down her key and extracted a dripping purple aster from the vase on the desk imogen ran upstairs pressing the lights and racing to catch the next switch before it went out and plunged them into darkness outside her room he stopped goodnight little accomplice he said softly handing her the dripping purple aster hes going to kiss me she thought in rapture but as he bent his head and touched her lips a door flew open and out charged a fat woman in a hair net who barged past them and rushed down the passage to the lavatory next minute they heard the sound of terrible retching and both collapsed with silent laughter then suddenly another door opened and there was cable wrapped in a dark green towel a cigarette hanging from her scarlet lips and about bloody time too she said inside her room imogen wandered around in a daze matt had kissed her she knew how casual kisses could be and theyd both been drinking all day but she didnt think matt was a casual person portlespins was teeming with beautiful girls but unlike nicky and james beyond a cursory approving glance hed never shown much interest in any of them she looked in the mirror and touched her lips where hed kissed off all her lipstick then ran her hands over her body with a shiver of excitement a genius in bed cable had said but it wasnt just the bed she wanted wipe that silly grin off your face she kept telling herself youre banking on too much she lay down on the bed but the room swung round and round so she got up and tried on all her new clothes standing swaying on the bed to see them full length tomorrow shed wear the pale green sundress or perhaps the duckegg blue shirt with most of the buttons undone like cable did she imagined matt at this moment having a blazing row with cable saying its all over between us i love imogen you mustnt hope she told herself sternly he loves cable he only gave you those clothes to get nicky off her back but the words made no sense to her i love him i love him she said pressing her burning face in the pillow then she carefully put the purple aster between the pages of her diary which wouldnt shut now because of the yellow centre bit and lay for a long time watching the sky lighten listening to cocks crowing and cars starting up and children shouting before she fell asleep chapter twelve she was woken by the sun on her body the same delicious feeling of happiness spreading through her like a rosy glow she put on the new pale blue sundress and went downstairs to find the rest of the party in various stages of disintegration having breakfast on the front and reading the papers yvonne was displaying a black and blue foot on a chair for everyone to see having had no dinner last night she had insisted on james ordering a boiled egg for her this egg is as hard as a bullet jumbo she was screeching as she tried to force a buckling toast soldier into it i asked for quatorze minutes said james defensively thats fourteen not four shrieked yvonne why do you drink so much when you know you cant hold it jumbo you know how idiotic it makes you next morning james desperately trying to disguise his hangover was lifting his cup of coffee with both hands he looked terrible matt didnt look much better he smiled rather guardedly when he saw imogen and didnt quite meet her eyes as he ordered her some coffee nicky looking healthy as ever was reading the sports page of the times christ he said connors got knocked out in the third round imogen watched him surreptitiously move his foot forward and rub it gently against cables ankle cable returned the pressure then stretched her beautiful brown legs out in front of her she was wearing a jean machine rugger shirt and sitting on one of matts knees reading the daily mail horoscopes i do hate not getting the horoscopes till the day after evidently i should have had a disastrous day for romance yesterday which simply wasnt true was it darling she coiled an arm round matts neck and kissed him lingeringly imogen picked pieces of skin out of her coffee with a spoon and felt happiness slowly oozing out of her like air out of a badly tied balloon madame waddled out with a telegram for matt its from larry gilmore he said when hed opened the orange envelope arriving plaza pm he read oh thats great said cable is that larry gilmore the photographer said yvonne i thought he was supposed to be a monster hes fine as long as you dont burst into tears every time he calls you a stupid cow and bambi his wife is lovely answered cable defensively bambi and jumbo said nicky its getting more like the zoo every minute everyone brightened at the prospect of new blood it would perhaps get them off each others backs except imogen who merely expected it would mean more talk about models what dyou want to do today jumbo said yvonne petulantly anything you like darling oh dont be awkward anyway ive got to go into marseilles to show this foot to a decent doctor she turned steely forgetmenot eyes on the rest of the company they shoot horses you know when theyre in this kind of pain id like to go to the isle of levant and bathe nude said cable have you any idea how lovely water feels on your naked body yes every day in the bath said matt nicky yawned and stretched out his legs once again rubbing his foot against cables i feel bloody unfit he said im going to find some courts in marseilles and have a workout will you be all right on the beach darling he added to imogen who nodded with relief im going into marseilles too then said cable shooting a spiteful glance at imogen i think its my turn to buy a few new clothes today are you coming too darling she added to matt slipping a hand inside his shirt and stroking his chest cant really ive got to see this chap at the bar de la marine at twelve imogens face lit up perhaps he was staying behind to be with her jesus cant you ever stop working snapped cable she glanced at imogen who was stirring her coffee and crumbling her croissant with a trembling hand not looking at matt and avoiding cables eye shes got a schoolgirls crush on matt thought cable it had happened before fairly often with women friends of hers matt had been particularly kind to or girls who worked on the paper who came round for drinks all tarted up then looked at cable with dismay realising the competition it was all matts fault for paying imogen so much attention yesterday as if he honestly believed that by buying her a few clothes hed get nicky back for her she was a drip and nicky didnt like drips and a few sophisticated clothes wouldnt change that cable wasnt in the least jealous of imogen the blazing row shed had with matt last night had been followed by the most passionate rapturous lovemaking but she didnt like him singling anyone out for attention he never bothered with yvonne like he did with imogen as she and matt went upstairs to get her some money she said quite gently darling you must stop leading imogen on shes got a terrible crush on you she hasnt taken her eyes off you all morning matt sat on the beach beside imogen reading the same page over and over again ever since hed woken up hed been kicking himself and going round saying damn damn damn damn like professor higgins admittedly hed been smashed out of his mind last night or hed never have risked casing braganzis house and putting himself and imogen in such danger but he never should have given her that aster or kissed her goodnight if they hadnt been interrupted by that fat woman rushing down to the lavatory heaven knows how far he might have gone he had his hands full with cable he liked imogen far too muuch to hurt her it was a soft day the breathing of the sea was remote and gentle the sky arched a perfect cornflower blue over their heads but yesterdays easy camaraderie had vanished imogen didnt seem to be getting on much better with tristram shandy either matt shut his book lets go for a walk he said he bought her a coke and a can of beer for himself and they wandered along the beach imogen gathering shells and popping seaweed as she popped away he could see her mouth moving he loves me he loves me not and the look of desolation on her face when it came out he loves me not they examined a dead jellyfish like a striped red blister overturned rocks so that little crabs scurried out and when they walked over the dark wet saffron masses of seaweed covering the rocks her hand slid into his as trustingly as a child to stop herself slipping oh christ why had he led her on he had only meant to be kind they reached the end of the beach and sat down to cool off under the indigo shadow cast by a huge red rock he looked at her round innocent face longing to be kissed imogen darling yes she said her eyes lighting up how old are you nearly and how many affairs have you had none really she blushed not bed anyway i expect i would have with nicky but i lost my pills but i found them again i took three yesterday she added quickly well dont tell him said matt deliberately misreading her offer nickys no good for you hes only interested in conquest servicing totally compris in fact he treats birds like french letters throwing them away as soon as hes used them he picked up a handful of sand letting it drift through his fingers do you know what you should do after this holiday get away from your father and the family and yorkshire and get a job in london the papers got a terrific library they sometimes have a vacancy would you like me to see if i could get you a job oh yes please she gasped oh yes to have a chance to see him every day to cut out his stories every week and file them under oconnor matt to do telling research for him whenever he needed help with a story but i dont really know anyone in london she stammered matt smiled you know me and basil and cable her fingers which seemed to be sleepwalking towards his hand suddenly stopped at the mention of cable she took a hasty swig from her tin leaving a moustache of coke on her upper lip you should live a little he said very gently get more experience play the field break a few hearts and have fun youll soon grow out of men like nicky i dont want to play the field she said dolefully cable and i have been together a long time we understand each other he was trying to tell her something however gently and she didnt want to hear it keep out of ireland hands off oconnor in the heat he had pushed his damp blond hair back from his sweating forehead showing the thick horizontal wrinkles and the laughter lines round his eyes which were bloodshot from drinking and lack of sleep the heavy lids swollen he looked thoroughly seedy and hung over and every bit of his thirtytwo years but gazing at the battered sexy face she wondered how she could ever have loved anyone else in her life matt sighed he wasnt finding this at all easy look sweetheart he said i shouldnt have kissed you last night i was extremely drunk and i enjoyed it but i shouldnt have done it youve had enough flak from nicky without my putting the boot in imogen watched a speedboat shooting by rearing up thirty degrees out of the water the noontide sky was the same colour as the sea now you could hardly distinguish the horizon she leapt to her feet if youre trying to pretend last night meant anything more to me than a friendly goodnight kiss she said youre very much mistaken and turning away she ran back down the beach towards the hotel hell hell hell and damnation said matt a huge pair of dark glasses over her reddened eyes had got her through lunch she could hardly eat anything picking away like cable she avoided looking at matt who wasnt eating much either he announced he was going into marseilles by himself that afternoon to follow up a tipoff antoines contact had given him at the bar de la marine ive had quite enough of marseilles for one day said cable whod had a successful shopping expedition im going to sleep for a few hours such an exhausting night darling she added running a caressing hand inside matts shirt imogen gritted her teeth yvonne looking smug and well bandaged after a trip to the doctor said the sun was too hot for her foot and she would like james to drive her to look over a nearby château and imogen shall come with us insisted james terrified of being left on his own with yvonne thats a good idea darling said nicky running a lazy finger down imogens cheek ive found some passable courts about five miles from here so ill have a workout this afternoon you go with james and yvonne youll enjoy it he was wearing a navy blue tshirt and white shorts and imogen could see the muscles rippling on his thighs and his shoulders and suddenly she was shot through with sadness because she had adored him so much and she remembered the ecstatic admiration she had felt when shed first watched him playing tennis and now although she could still appreciate his beauty he meant nothing to her maybe one day shed feel as indifferently towards matt im cured of nicky she thought dolefully now ive got to start again and get over the cure in the end when cable had gone up to bed and nicky and matt had set out she suddenly felt she couldnt face yvonne bitching all afternoon at james and told them she felt like a walk on her own it was very hot she wandered out of the town up a hill path which began with shallow steps between red and white holiday villas then became a rough track leading on to wilder heath above the cliffs not unlike the moors at home the sea sparkled below and the air had a marvellous sweetness from wild lavender and thyme mingling with the sharper tang of the sea if only matt were here all would be perfect but she mustnt think of him the path forked she followed a track leading steeply down she was pouring with sweat by the time she reached the seas edge picking her way across the jagged red rock feeling its heat and sharpness even through the soles of her espadrilles she took off her dress and shoes and dropped in her bikini into the cool green water hoping it might bring her some relief she swam out to sea wondering in a brief despairing moment whether to swim on and on but they always said you saw your past life again if you drowned and the past four months had been far too traumatic for her to want a replay she floated for a bit then swam round into the next cove climbing back on to the rocks regaining her breath suddenly she could hear the sound of voices and edged her way round the cove until she could see a beautiful stretch of beach deserted except for one family she sat down to watch them a darkhaired darkeyed child in a pink sun hat was aimlessly banging a red spade on the ground and watching his pretty mother and father build him a huge elaborate sandcastle the girl was wearing a red bikini the man a shirt and black trousers he must be baking in this heat tears filled imogens eyes they looked so united and happy she had a sudden fleeting picture of herself and matt laughing together building a castle for their own suntanned blond baby the child got unsteadily to its feet and waddled off clambering on to the rocks about twenty yards from her he was so beautiful and fat and brown she longed to call to him the parents hadnt noticed his departure they were so intent on building their castle the man was kneeling down tunnelling a moat round the castle forging a hole under a bridge keeping the sand firm with his other hand the girl was laughing and very close to him bending over to look the man suddenly turned round looked at her for a second and then kissed her taking her by surprise for a second she struggled then lay still in his arms kissing him back imogen looked away the world was like noahs ark everyone in twos in love with each other except her she looked back at the child then gave a strangled cry of horror he was teetering on the edge of the rocks now looking down into the deep water where more sharp wicked rocks lay beneath the weed below the next minute he had overbalanced and fallen in imogen gave a scream hes fallen in she yelled to the couple who looked round at her uncomprehendingly vite vite she went on in her schoolgirl french il a tombé frozen with horror neither of them moved the only thing to do was to plunge into the water herself swimming round the rocks to where she could see the little pink sunhat bobbing on top of the water the current was suddenly terrifyingly strong tugging her in every direction when she dived under frantically searching around all she could feel was thick weed and sharp rocks jagging her legs she surfaced gasping to find the man swimming in her direction followed by the hysterically screaming mother ici she called to them shaking her hair out of her eyes hes down here and she plunged down under the surface again next time she came up for air choking and spluttering the father had reached her his face ashen the mother followed him frantically dogpaddling still yelling hysterically over and over again they all dived down he cant be still alive thought imogen despairingly then suddenly between two rocks she felt something soft she tugged and tugged but the object seemed wedged by the weed she surfaced once more her ears drumming i think hes down here she spluttered i cant shift him taking a huge breath she plunged under once more and this time managed to catch the childs hair and then one arm and just as she thought her lungs would explode she dislodged him and lugged him to the surface his eyes were shut his mouth open the mother redoubled her sobs help me gasped imogen taking great shuddering gulps of air she was so exhausted now the child felt like lead in her arms the father took the weight from her and together they towed him to the shore with the mother screaming behind them they laid the child on the sand and the man started pummelling and pumping at his chest let me do it said imogen frantically trying to remember her first aid classes first you had to jerk back their heads to see if the wind pipe was blocked it didnt seem to be then bending down she put her lips to the slack little mouth and slowly started breathing into it he felt so cold and lifeless she had a terrible feeling they were too late she was so worn out by diving it was almost impossible to keep her breathing even she tried to ignore the hysterical ranting of the mother it seemed for an eternity she laboured but it was obviously hopeless not a flicker of response there was no point in going on she willed herself to continue she could feel the sun burning into her back then suddenly miraculously there was a faint flutter in the childs chest and slowly she could feel his lungs expanding like a bellows and gradually with agonising slowness he took up the breathing of his own accord imogen knelt back on her heels feeling dizzy the next minute the child opened bloodshot eyes gave a sob and was violently sick hes going to be all right said imogen the mothers hysterics incomprehensibly increased imogen noticed a trickle of blood on her left leg where she had jagged it on the rocks ferme ta gueule snarled the father still looking grey with fear a fat lot of help theyre being thought imogen she reached for a towel cleaned the childs face and gently began to dry him hell be ok honestly she said wrapping another towel round him they still seemed incapable of movement you must get him home at once she urged them as though speaking to children and keep him warm and very quiet and call the doctor immediately the man began to gibber his thanks honestly its nothing she said youre probably suffering from shock too she added to the snivelling mother but hes all right really he is but how did you come to be here said the father in very broken english didnt you know the beach was private oh goodness no i didnt im so sorry but look the important thing now is to get him home where are you staying asked the father slowly in portlespins she picked up the shivering child in his towel and handed him to the father at once go home cest très important only after shed got dressed and begun the long walk home did she realise how much the incident had shaken her she must go back to the hotel and tell someone her thoughts veered towards matt and then away matt was out of bounds and belonged to cable perhaps madame was in she was always good for a gossip but when she reached the hotel she heard the ricochet of bullets and the thunder of horses hooves coming from madames room behind the reception desk the family must be stuck into some television western then she saw nickys key was missing from its hook he must be back she ran upstairs and knocked gently on his door there was no answer she knocked again perhaps he was asleep she tried the handle and the door opened the shower was going he couldnt have heard her then she saw cable lying naked on the bed her beautiful breasts poking up in the air she was smoking a cigarette and laughing and saying something to nicky who was obviously in the shower because he shouted back something imogen couldnt hear and cable laughed even more imogen shut the door and ran down the corridor her legs felt completely weak her body was one burning blush oh poor poor matt he loved cable and she could do this to him and nicky allegedly his great friend pretending he was going off to practise tennis what on earth would happen if he came back from marseilles and caught them at it in a state of complete shock she wandered round and round the town then went and sat trembling on the beach a sailing boat was putting out she noticed how pretty its red sails looked against the darkening blue of the sea and the soft ochre of the sand she wished she were on that boat escaping from all the turmoil and crosscurrents and the misery chapter thirteen she was suddenly aware of a clock striking seven and turning round saw that the tables at the bars along the front were filling up it was part of the portlespins ritual every night you sat and drank and commented on the beautiful people drifting along the street on foot or driving slowly by in open cars often they merely paraded to one end of the beach turned round and walked back again over and over again so everyone could admire them reluctantly she decided she had better be getting back the rock that overhung the bay was turning rose red in the sunset the cypress trees reared up stiff as cats tails against the glowing sky the sea was veiled in an amethyst haze to her horror the first people she saw were nicky and cable drinking vodka and tonics under a cocacola umbrella which gave a faint red glow to their sunburnt faces cable was wearing a white lace top tied under her breasts with matching lace bermudas which would have made anyone else look fat her long expanse of midriff was as smooth and brown as mahogany nicky was wearing white trousers and a grey cashmere sweater his black curls still hanging in wet tendrils from the shower they both looked superbly indolent replete and handsome like two panthers after feeding time blushing crimson aware of her tousled hair and unkempt appearance imogen tried to creep past them but nicky saw her and called out where have you been ive been looking everywhere for you come over here and tell us all about the château and the embattled edgworths i didnt go in the end she stammered for a second nicky looked wary i walked along the beach she added quickly and sunbathed and wrote postcards instead i must go and change have a drink first said nicky steering her firmly into an empty seat beside him you look bushed fortunately at that moment yvonne and james arrived both washed and changed and looking incredibly well laundered the château was quite lovely you did miss a treat imogen the owner happened to be in residence and took quite a fancy to me said yvonne patting her hair and showed us everything they had a winetasting on too and gave us free glasses of wine no ill only have a pineapple juice thank you nicky and james doesnt need anything stronger nicky ordered the drinks in his rapid french and went on eating his way through a packet of crisps its a pity you dont take more interest in culture cable said yvonne looking disapprovingly at cables stretch of midriff im sure you and matt would find a lot more to talk about in the evenings if you did matt and i have got more exciting things to do in the evenings than talk snapped cable a seagull that had been circling overhead looking for titbits suddenly swooped on one of nickys crisps that had dropped on the floor bugger off said nicky swiping at it with his foot bet you say that to all the gulls said cable nicky grinned i dont want it to dump on me supposed to be lucky said james one dumped on me when i was playing in rome i promptly dropped the set how did the workout go asked james find someone good enough to play with nicky laughed surprisingly yes for once i was really stretched and in the diversion caused by the drinks arriving imogen saw him stretch a hand out and gently stroke the underneath of cables thigh she wriggled luxuriously and smiled at him james took an unenthusiastic gulp of his pineapple juice and nearly choked must have gone down the wrong way he said his eyes streaming as imogen thumped him on the back i didnt think your hair would stay like that imogen once it got wet said yvonne smugly i hate her thought imogen id like to take her beastly clean neck between my fingers and throttle her then she saw matt coming towards the table and her stomach dropped with love and she felt as though she was hurtling downwards in a very fast lift he looked bugeyed and exhausted and collapsed into a chair next to cable darling she said with unnatural enthusiasm how was the tipoff disastrous complete bum steer i give up its obviously impossible to reach braganzi cant say im sorry said cable running her hand sexily over his thigh we might have the pleasure of your company for a change how can she thought imogen appalled shes just got out of bed with nicky and in front of him shes fawning all over matt matt threw a bulging airmail envelope down on the table braganzis cuttings i asked the paper to send them out he said ruefully arrived by second post wont be needing them now so i might as well get drunk tonight you did that last night remember said cable with a slight edge in her voice she pointedly removed her hand from his thigh another large round of drinks was ordered imogen hadnt even finished her first she wondered how on earth she was going to get through the evening there seemed to be so many people in the party whose eyes she couldnt meet any more it was as though matt had read her thoughts gilmorell be here any minute he said to the table in general but more in her direction youll like him he and bambi are one of the few happily married couples i know she actually likes staying home and being a mother and baking bread and polishing furniture said cable how nice said yvonne how old is she about forty i love older women said james taking a hefty belt at his pineapple juice and looking very excited shes happily married jumbo snapped yvonne i dont think gilmores ever strayed either said matt cable smirked as though she knew better oh he may have pinched your bottom at the odd press party admitted matt but its all show i must say it will be nice to have another wife to talk to once one gets married one does find single girls rather limited said yvonne getting to her feet i must just pop over to the newsagents and get some more postcards i havent sent one to your mother yet jumbo bitch said cable sticking her tongue out at yvonnes trim departing back what did you ask them to put in these pineapple juices nicky said james vodka said nicky i thought it was the least obvious probably disgusting at least its alcohol said james thanks awfully let me get another round quickly while the old girls buying postcards youre very quiet imogen said cable are you all right the heats probably been too much for her said nicky we should have taken better care of you and not left you alone they were all looking at her now imogen thought her face would crack with trying to smile i think ill go and change she said upstairs she listlessly flipped through her wardrobe in the end she put on the green dress with the white daisies though it seemed far too frivolous for her mood of black gloom the lowcut neck showed her shoulders and breasts beautifully tanned now during a day of such traumas it seemed odd that she should have turned so brown her hair despite yvonnes acid comments fell into perfect shape when she combed it she fiddled around a long time getting ready she didnt want to go down she couldnt bear to face the faces a knock on the door made her jump matt she thought with longing but it was cable hullo thats nice she said not looking imogen in the eyes did matt get it for you yesterday imogen nodded he really ought to be on the womens page we were worried about you you took so long you can talk thought imogen im so pleased larry and bambi are arriving tonight said cable as they went downstairs bambill be such a relief after yvonne shes sliding into middle age in such a happy leisurely sort of way makes one think getting old might not be so desperate after all youll love her bambi was obviously no competition thought imogen from cables mona lisa smirkings earlier larry gilmore was obviously an old flame of hers with nicky as a current admirer james ever ready to pounce and matt in attendance no wonder she was in such a good temper when they got to the table james wolfwhistled at imogen and nicky told her she was looking beautiful imogen went and sat next to him as far away from matt as possible ive got dinner to get through and then im going straight to bed she thought a girl a few tables down was petting a panting golden retriever it reminded her of homer suddenly she felt so homesick she could hardly see straight she mustnt cry she stared down at her clenched fists fighting back the tears the blakerharrises are supposed to be arriving at st syriac tonight said cable we must call them tomorrow conversation fortunately moved on to the rocky state of the blakerharrises marriage and imogen was able to recover herself glancing up she saw matt was watching her she flushed and looked quickly away im an embarrassment to him now she thought miserably then to her relief cable said look theres gilmore over here yelled matt waving his arms at a very suntanned man of medium height with a thin hawklike face he was wearing a beautifully cut cream boiler suit slashed to the waist and tucked into black boots he was screwing his eyes up and looking round he cant see a thing without his glasses said cable christ what has he done to himself the suntanned man finally located them and stopping to gawp at a sensational brunette as he crossed the road nearly got run over by a couple of stunning blondes in a pink convertible what a lovely way to go he drawled hullo everyone he clapped matt on the shoulder kissed cable and collapsed into a chair jesus i need some first aid order me a quadruple whisky no one moved what have you done to yourself asked matt youve changed your hair said cable its the mark antony look gilmore pulled the black tendrils over his forehead and youve been at the grecian youre as brown as a berry its been a very good summer in islington said gilmore and roared with laughter youve had your ear pierced and where did you get that white suit from i decided my image was getting a bit dreary i ought to jazz myself up a little a little said cable christ almighty gilmore matt started to laugh oh shut up said gilmore it jolly well works anyway how are you nicky you look disgustingly healthy no more than you said nicky and introduced imogen and james matt ordered gilmore a drink and another round for the rest of them any luck with braganzi said gilmore matt shook his head not a squeak ive tried everything and he machineguns doorsteppers well if you cant get in there no one can said gilmore they were bloody good those beauty queen pictures of yours said matt took a hell of a lot of retouching both beauty queens and pix hows the paper asked matt much the same when i left it gilmore drained half his whisky in one gulp bruce winter gave in his notice again wrote a page letter of resignation which no one could be bothered to read so hes staying on after all our man in jerusalem was wounded in the foot in a riot he sent his love all he can think about at the moment is the allwoman everest expedition are we going to sponsor it not if the finance boys have their way i picked up a good story this afternoon said matt all the kids have been cheating in their baccalaureate some child got hold of the papers in advance and gave the answers to all and sundry the authorities are completely flummoxed they cant fail the whole lot of them wish that would happen in london sighed gilmore its the only way my children would ever get their a levels are you going to file any copy i might said matt if i can summon up the energy theres trouble blowing up in peru said gilmore if it gets any worse he did say you might have to cut short your lotuseating and fly out there what sort of trouble said matt hes happy thought imogen wistfully he must have been bored out of his mind this week with the rest of us it was cable who broke them up must you two talk shop all day wheres bambi in the bath er no said gilmore wincing as he gingerly turned the ring in his ear god these things hurt shes in islington shes what said cable in islington youve come on your own then in a word no said gilmore you havent brought someone else said cable suspiciously in a word yes said gilmore the stunned silence was interrupted by a gasp of amazement from james an incredible blonde in silver platform heels a silver space suit with long blonde hair was causing considerable excitement as she wended her way along the front there she is said gilmore going slightly pink under his suntan over here my cherub she looks just like bardot she isnt is she said james in excited tones not quite said gilmore i call her brigitte barmaid actually jesus look at those tits said nicky smoothing his hair matt was torn between laughter and disapproval where on earth did you find her he said she came to us as a temporary said larry i kept bumping into her in the lift there was room for you both in the lift asked matt i thought shed have a nice soothing influence on cable said gilmore i know how she likes as many pretty girls around her as possible cable was looking like the inevitable thundercloud this is tracey went on gilmore as the blonde sat down between him and imogen with a flurry of pleasedtomeetyous and she never drinks anything else but sweet cinzano because shes hung up on sweet sin arent you my precious do you mind said tracey youre lovely and brown she added beaming at imogen i always think a tan does more for a blonde than anyone else thank god i brown very quickly dont you burn said imogen looking at the platinum hair never said tracey this colours out of a bottle normally its dark brown imogen blinked unused to such frankness larrys a wonderful colour already she said oh thats man tan said tracey it didnt work on his legs theyre all striped like a tiger imogen giggled and suddenly felt more cheerful at that moment yvonne arrived weighed down with paper bags and postcards i got this for our daily she said producing a lady in a crinoline made entirely of shells isnt it original oh hullo she added to gilmore you must be larry weve never met but i so admire your work and you must be bambi she said turning to tracey ive heard so much about you may i call you bambi well i keep doing it all the time said gilmore in his lazy drawl but she doesnt like it very much yvonne sat down between james and matt where are you staying she asked at the plaza said tracey the rooms are awfully pokey yvonne looked put out you should see our little hellholes she said glaring at matt tracey turned back to imogen isnt it awful every time you turn on the bath in an hotel you get absolutely drenched from the shower i got soaked tonight she cant be much older than i am thought imogen cable and yvonne were both glaring at her as though she was a particularly nasty maggot whod appeared in their salad looking at her more closely imogen realised that underneath the heavy makeup she had a round face huge brown eyes and a very sweet smile ta very much she said taking her cinzano from matt who belongs to who round here she added to imogen whos the little one with the pink face who looks like ronnie corbett thats james hes married to yvonne the one with red hair shes a model and the lovely brown one next to you goodness hes handsome he must be a coastguard or a swimming instructor or something imogen stifled a giggle hes called nicky beresford at the mention of his name nicky looked up i was just wondering what you do for a living said tracey smiling at him with luscious simplicity he plays tennis snapped cable then after a pause extremely successfully oh how lovely i love tennis perhaps we could have a game tomorrow perhaps we could said nicky smiling into her eyes it doesnt have to be tennis encore de whisky shouted gilmore glancing round at the girls sitting at nearby tables and walking along the front christ the standard of talent is fantastic here just like the kings road used to be on a saturday afternoon cant think why i brought you tracey darling rather like carrying electric logs to newcastle youd have to speak french to them i shouldnt wonder said tracey placidly and you know how that tires you im hungry i hope the foods better than it was in paris we went to maxims last night it was disgusting i wanted a steak and they gave me this charred rectangle of beef when you put your fork in all the blood ran out i love a nice scampi and chips i expect it can be arranged said gilmore yvonne was looking at tracey in a puzzled way i cant believe youre forty she said she is round the bust said cable spitefully thats clever said tracey quite oblivious of either girls animosity how did you guess i hear youre a model she added to yvonne i do a bit too in my spare time what kind said yvonne coldly oh nude stuff mostly i was penthouse pet of the month last july were you indeed said nicky shamelessly undressing her with his eyes they told the most terrible lies said tracey they photographed me cycling against a backdrop of some old university with some pictures in these lovely silk undies and some in nothing at all really said james his eyes out on stalks then they wrote all this stuff in the paper about me being an intellectual and my father being a don but they let me keep the undies and they paid very well is your father a don said yvonne no hes an undertaker said tracey yvonne looked taken aback well i suppose they do fill a need and an awful lot of holes said matt drily do you do any nude work tracey asked yvonne i couldnt do that sort of thing said yvonne in a shocked voice oh i wouldnt be discouraged said tracey kindly i used to be as flat as a board like you too then my manager said tracey why dont you get some decent tits hes got this doctor friend who can give you boobs like sophia loren so i went and saw him the operation was a bit of a drag but the aftereffect was terrific these are just silicone she said patting her jutting bosom fondly but ive never looked back since ill give you the address of the doctor if you like pity not to be able to take your clothes off when its so lucrative for once yvonne was completely at a loss for words glancing across imogen saw that matt was crying with laughter where did you really find her he said to gilmore wiping his eyes came to me as a temp types words a minute and spells laurence with a w all the time but any girl with a body like that deserves to make it in life cant think what shes doing with you she obviously wants to marry her grandfather yvonne leant across to cable i dont think that girls married to larry gilmore at all she hissed we ought to eat soon said larry lifting up one of traceys silver breasts which was hanging over his watch its nearly half past nine ill get the bill said matt tipping back his chair and waving to a waitress then suddenly imogen could never remember exactly how it happened the bustling noisy street went absolutely quiet waiters stopped in their tracks with trays held aloft a man carrying a basket of fish up from the quay dropped it with a crash on the ground and stood motionless as though hypnotised conversations all along the front slithered to a halt a poodle barked and was angrily hushed a child cried and was clouted everyone had turned towards the end of the street somehow the fear and anticipation had infected even the rowdiest holidaymaker the only sound was the swish of the waves and faint complaining of the seagulls it was like high noon and then imogen saw him strolling lazily down the street towards them chewing on a cigar a little bald man wearing dark glasses a black shirt and illfitting white trousers and apparently in no hurry but even in his leisureliness there was tension braganzi hissed matt christ i wish i had a camera muttered larry he was only a couple of tables away now everyone smiling sycophantically the same poodle growled and was kicked again hes making for this table said cable shaking back her hair and licking her lips in anticipation perhaps hes coming to say you can do a piece on him more likely to warn us off said matt imogen watched him mesmerised it wasnt often you saw a legend that close he reached their table now and paused taking them all in then he took out his cigar and ground it into the pavement good evening he said in a very strong italian accent i look for mees brocklehurst imogen gasped in terror and threw a supplicating glance in matts direction what dyou want her for said matt sharply may i present myself said the little man softly my name is enrico braganzi we know that said matt i would simply like to talk to miss brocklehurst he smiled showing several gold stoppings nicky put a protecting hand on imogens arm this is her he said braganzi removed his dark glasses his eyes were hooded watchful very very dark mademoiselle he asked were you by any chance swimming round the rocks to the petite plage today imogen gazed down hoping the ground might swallow her up were you lovie said matt gently she knew the whole beach was watching her yes she stammered im terribly sorry it was so pretty i just wanted to be on my own for a bit i didnt realise it was private please mademoiselle braganzi held up a beautifully manicured hand heavy with gold rings i have only come to thank you from the bottom of my heart you saved my little boys life i what said imogen bewildered you saved him from drowning and then bring him back to life he was your child whispered imogen but i thought he belonged to that couple that couple said braganzi in a voice that sent shivers down imogens spine were the childs nanny and one of my guards so that was why the girl was sobbing so hysterically even after the child was revived from terror of braganzi the girl came back to the house and tried to pretend nothing had happened fortunately another of my men had seen everything through binoculars from the house you were too far away for him to help when he arrived you had gone he said you display amazing courage and presence of mind for one so young oh gosh it was nothing muttered imogen anyone would have done it but they did not he went on the child would have died if it had not been for you mademoiselle i owe you an eternal debt of gratitude it was nothing she muttered once again scuffing the ground with her foot is he all right now yes thank god the doctors been and a specialist the duchess was frantic but they reassured her that all was well ricky is sleeping now the duchess is naturally still very shaken but she would very much like to meet you oh really she doesnt have to i mean imogen stammered terrified at the prospect please mademoiselle it will mean so much to her she wishes to thank you personally i have my car here may i drive you up to the house imogen looked at matt beseechingly but he was shaking with laughter you are a dark horse darling why didnt you tell us said nicky we probably didnt ask her said matt imogen turned to braganzi all right id like to come wonderful braganzi turned and raised a hand it was the first time imogen had noticed the tattoos on his thick muscular arms next moment a black car that seemed as long as the beach glided up to them a chauffeur got out and opened the door for them as she climbed inside imogen felt like jonah being swallowed by the whale she wondered if shed ever see the others again where did you learn your first aid asked braganzi as the car climbed the hill are you nurse imogen told him about working in a library and someone having to do a first aid course i grumbled like mad at the time and i was awfully bored but im very glad i did now so indeed are we mademoiselle can i please tell you something now we are alone a few minutes you know perhaps a little about the duchess and me imogen nodded when she leave england to come to me she had to leave her children too i am not considered suitable stepfather you understand nor are the children allowed to visit us although we are fighting court battle camilla misses the children although she doesnt show it so all her love has gone into little ricky she had him late in life we both did he is how you say it an autumn crocus she is fortythree now when she had ricky she nearly died and the doctors later insisted on a hysterectomy so its no more children for either of us now you can appreciate how important ricky is to both of us and what you have done by saving his life imogen glanced up and saw that his dark eyes were full of tears and knew that she was no longer afraid of him how did you track me down i have how you say impeccable spy system imogen was very nervous about meeting the duchess but one glance at that lovely ravished face with its brilliant grey eyes which were still red from crying and all her fears vanished the duchess walked forward quickly and took both imogens hands and then kissed her on both cheeks saying in a choked voice i can never begin to thank you i really dont know how to start but she was so friendly and natural and incredibly grateful that after a few minutes armed with a large glass of whisky imogen began to feel she really had done something rather good after all they sat on the terrace chatting twenty to the dozen together and breathing in the heavy scent of the tobacco plants and the nightscented stock and later they went up and looked at little ricky asleep in his cot in his pale blue bedroom a basil brush on the pillow beside him his cheeks were pinker now his black hair flopped over his forehead the duchess moved round the room on tiptoe straightening his bedclothes adjusting the pillow arranging toys and checking the heat of his forehead with her hand he looks much better said imogen he does doesnt he the doctor says theres nothing to worry about but i have to keep checking as they went downstairs imogen noticed a picasso a modigliani and a matisse on the wall braganzi was waiting for them all right darling he said taking the duchesss hand he must have been three or four inches smaller than her but somehow his width of shoulder and force of personality made it seem as though he was protecting some infinitely fragile object miss brocklehurst must be hungry shall we eat now yes of course how awful of me the duchess turned smiling to imogen you will stay wont you we see so few people here and there are so many things i want to ask you about your holiday and about england but you must be far too exhausted after such a terrible shock stammered imogen terrified her table manners wouldnt be ducal enough but in the end they persuaded her and she found she was absolutely famished all her worries about her table manners vanished when she saw braganzi falling on his food like a starved dingo elbows on the table taking great swigs of wine with his mouth full and picking away at his teeth they had some kind of fish mousse then delicious chicken if the duchess and braganzi both picked their bones imogen supposed it was all right if she did too and who did you come out here with asked the duchess hes called nicky beresford the tennis player oh hes frightfully glamorous ive admired him at wimbledon so often and he thinks youre marvellous too said imogen her mouth full of fried potatoes how lovely the duchess looked pleased so youre both having a wonderful holiday yes i suppose so said imogen you dont sound very enthusiastic said braganzi what was mr beresford doing leaving you alone on a hot summer afternoon he er he its really very boring faltered imogen but she was so longing to tell someone go on said the duchess enrico and i have so little excitement and then the whole awful story came pouring out we came in a party said imogen but it was quite obvious even before we left london that nicky had fallen for one of the other girls did she come with a boyfriend yes hes called matthew oconnor hes a journalist isnt he a very good one said the duchess when i can face the english sundays i always read him hes terribly nice said imogen flushing then why dont you do a swap said the duchess he loves cable this other girl he just ignores her and waits for her to come back occasionally they have terrible rows but he realises shes only doing it well to make him keener on her how very complicated said the duchess oconnor seemed quite keen on you the other night outside said braganzi drily imogen went crimson how do you know she stammered enrico knows everything said the duchess with pride goodness thought imogen darting a startled glance at braganzi so he knew matt and i were casing his house all the time they had their coffee on the terrace the night was black now sprinkled with huge stars the fireflies darted above the tobacco plants and the duchess bombarded imogen with more questions about her holiday about her home in yorkshire and then about england in general imogen suddenly realised it was very late i must go not yet enrico will take you back darling go upstairs and just check if ricky is all right when he had gone imogen turned shyly to the duchess what a sweet man he is she said i never dreamt hed be so kind the duchesss face lit up you think so im so pleased people in england find it quite incomprehensible that i threw up everything to run off with him i understand it perfectly said imogen stoutly she was suddenly aware she was more than a little drunk id give anything to go home for a few weeks said the duchess but enrico would be arrested the moment he set foot in england suddenly she looked very tired and shadowed under the eyes i miss the children horribly alexander my exhusband wont let me near them in case they are corrupted by enrico corrupted indeed if the courts knew what an immoral creature alexander was im so sorry said imogen oh thats enough about me said the duchess lightly lets talk about you what can we possibly do to repay you you have some days left of your holiday we go back to paris on saturday why not leave the coast and mr beresford its too hot anyway and come back with us we would love to show you round paris oh no really not cried imogen suddenly the thought of being whisked away from matt however little he felt about her was more than she could bear its terribly kind she added to soften her outburst honestly rescuing him was enough knowing youre pleased there must be something youd like suddenly imogens heart beat faster there is just one thing she said matt more than anything else in the world he wants an interview with your husband hes been trying to get one ever since we came out here hes really a very responsible journalist he wouldnt her words faltered she was about to say bitch him up then thought it seemed rude the duchess looked dubious but at that moment braganzi returned the little one is fine he said for a moment they chattered to each other in italian the duchess still looking worried im sorry muttered imogen i shouldnt have asked it was horribly presumptuous it is difficult in enricos position explained the duchess he is worried that anything mr oconnor says about him will prejudice my chances of seeing the children again oh well of course i should have thought stammered imogen braganzi went over to the window and threw out his cigar into the garden then he turned round and smiled at imogen it is a very little thing in return for what you have done for us tell him to come at ten oclock but he must let me see what he is going to print that is the only condition he is an honourable man oh yes yes of course he is he is very honourable she said joyfully thinking how pleased matt would be i cant thank you enough i really must go now she couldnt wait to get back to portlespins and break the news to him the duchess kissed her very affectionately saying write to us in paris and let me know how the holiday progresses braganzi rode back with her in the car its been a wonderful evening she found herself saying and the duchess is so wonderful i think shes one of the nicest people ive ever met she is said braganzi she likes you too she is very isolated now you understand she gave up so much when she left england for me but she gained so much braganzi sighed i hope so but you will come and stay with us perhaps next year and we see that you have a better holiday he took her address in yorkshire what would her father say if he could see her now thought imogen with a giggle hobnobbing with one of the most notorious criminals in france the chauffeur was driving along the front now although it was long after midnight people were still drinking in the cafés imogen wondered where the others were probably smashed out of their minds in some nightclub or perhaps they were at the casino it would be awful if theyd gone to bed it was almost as though braganzi had read her thoughts theres your friend mr oconnor keeping an eye out for you he said as the car drew to a halt and he leaned across and opened the door for her then he smiled as he saw how imogens face had lit up that pleases you doesnt it dyou want to meet him now said imogen as she saw matt get to his feet and walk towards them braganzi shook his head tomorrow will do and tell him to bring larry gilmore with him he can take some pictures of camilla and ricky but i didnt even tell you larry was here said imogen in amazement you really know everything dont you i do my rich best said braganzi modestly goodbye and once again thank you for everything and taking her hand he kissed it and imogen could see exactly why the duchess had given up everything for him she waved as the car moved away the next moment matt was beside her what was that hood doing mauling you like that he said sharply just saying goodbye was that all he did his face was in shadow so she couldnt read its expression but his fingers were hard and painful on her arm of course it was i had the most wonderful time you were away so long we were about to send out a search party you didnt have to they were lovely to me bloody well should have been after all you did for them what was she like he let go of her arm oh sweet beautiful and well sort of vulnerable where are the others inside the bar gilmores pissed out of his mind come and have a drink he put an arm round her shoulders and hugged her for a second sorry i snapped darling i was worried about you a great surge of happiness welled up inside her then she said down boy to herself as she remembered matts trespasserswillbeprosecuted lecture on the beach that morning hed have been worried about anyone in the party whod been closeted in braganzis fortress as long as she had inside the bar larry and tracey were dancing round to the juke box im larry the limpet cried larry shoving his hand down traceys dress i do wish youd stop doing rude things she said placidly pulling his hand out they danced past the ladies which said little girls on the door i want seven said larry banging on the door and i want them now nicky and cable sat watching them nicky was roaring with laughter cable wasnt james and yvonne appeared to have gone to bed darling cried nicky jumping up when he saw her are you all right tracey and larry immediately stopped dancing and came over and showered her with questions it was wonderful imogen kept saying embarrassed yet happy to be the centre of attention the house is beautiful inside and the pictures are amazing probably got half the uffizi and the louvre in there said larry werent you terrified said tracey no not at all not even by the duchess she was so friendly and well ungrand why on earth should she be snapped cable she was only some twobit actress before she married the duke shes really as common as muck rubbish said nicky she comes from a perfectly respectable family did they seem keen on each other oh yes and braganzis amazing he knows everything he knew all about she was about to say last night but she didnt know how much matt had told cable about their skirmish with the guards he seems to know who we all are she added lamely matt came over warming a large glass of brandy with his hands have a breath of that sweetheart and tell me all about it id like one too said larry imogen took the glass from matt thanks awfully she stammered and oh matt braganzis promised to give you an interview ive just bought you three matt was saying to larry then he doubletook he what he said his voice like a pistol shot hes agreed to give you an interview youre to go up there tomorrow at ten oclock youre having me on he said incredulously no truly im not and larry can go too and take some pictures holy mother youre a genius how the hell did you swing that i asked him the only condition is he wants to see copy thats all right so should i if i were in his shoes baby you really are a beautiful beautiful thing and he leant forward and kissed her on both cheeks and this time she didnt even bother to say down boy to the surge of happiness she just revelled in how delighted and overwhelmed he was by the news cant i come and take pictures instead of gilmore said nicky id love a crack at the duchess imogen giggled she thinks youre beautiful too shes heard of me said nicky in surprise yes they are capable occasionally of watching television the upper classes some of the brighter ones can even read now whos going to buy me a drink said larry no one said matt firmly youre having some coffee to sober you up or your handll be shaking far too much to hold a camera straight i shall be caught with my nikkons down yet again said larry just a small brandy wouldnt hurt cable got to her feet now that shes finally deigned to show up she said shooting a venomous glance in imogens direction can we please move on to somewhere slightly more exciting matt got the envelope of cuttings out of his back pocket and threw them on the table you can if you want ive got to read this lot now sit yourself down imogen my darling girl he patted the seat beside him and if youre not too tired would you tell me from the rescue onwards exactly what happened chapter fourteen imogen woke late the next morning to another blazing hot day through the open window she could see a few little white clouds ermining the serene morningglory blue of the sky she lay for a minute reflecting on the extraordinary events of the past fortyeight hours first matt transforming her in st tropez then meeting antoine who was pretty bizarre by any standards then being threatened by braganzis guards matt kissing her goodnight and warning her off next morning then her rescuing little ricky finding nicky and cable in bed and finally meeting braganzi and the duchess live a little get some experience matt had said well shed certainly made a start yet as she gazed at her smooth brown face in the mirror she looked as young and as roundeyed as ever she looked at the purple aster wilting in the diary and sighed shed just got dressed and was wondering how matt and larry were getting on with braganzi when there was a knock on the door it was tracey wondering if she was ready to come down to the beach its awfully hot she said as they wandered along the front even a tshirt feels like a fur coat did larry get off all right this morning yes but he was feeling very poorly ive never known a guy knock it back like he does that cables a crosspatch isnt she yes sighed imogen i dreamt all my teeth fell out last night said tracey isnt it supposed to mean something probably that youre worried about all your teeth falling out said imogen she noticed that even the brownest and most blasé frenchmen sat up pulled in their stomachs and took notice as tracey undulated past her silver waterfall of hair glinting in the sun this was going to make cable even crosser they found yvonne and james parked in the middle of the beach yvonne was grumbling away under the cardboard nose shield looking like a malignant goose hullo did you sleep well i certainly didnt far too hot i couldnt sleep a wink and whats more i had this terrible nightmare about a jellyfish and when i woke up i found this huge mosquito bite and then the water in the shower was cold this morning how did you get on last night imogen said james whod brightened perceptibly at the sight of them i was worried braganzi might have turned you into a pattie hearst it was all frightfully exciting said tracey laying out a large green towel go on tell them imogen imogens account of the events of last night however was slightly overshadowed by the counterattraction of tracey stripping down to the bottom half of a leopardskin bikini james who was oiling yvonnes back stopped in midstroke his eyes falling out with excitement every frenchman within yards appeared similarly affected get on james said yvonne chattering with disapproval and do lie down tracey and dont draw attention to yourself go on imogen how had the duchess done up the lounge oh in pale blue silk said imogen still not feeling her audience was really captive particularly as tracey started to oil herself all over thatll keep out the ultraviolent rays she said twenty minutes later by which time every man on the beach seemed to have made a detour past their little group to walk down to bathe and then return flexing his muscles and dripping water all over them yvonne could bear it no longer youll burn you know tracey you really ought to cover yourself up and those er bits burn much the worst maybe youre right said tracey getting to her feet i think ill go and swim well on your head be it snapped yvonne its not my ead itll be on giggled tracey and she tripped off down to the sea followed at a very indiscreet interval by a tidal wave of frenchmen im going to swim too said james and before yvonne could stop him bounded off down the beach its disgusting the way she flaunts her bosoms spluttered yvonne well they rather flaunt themselves said imogen such a bad example for james particularly larry turning up with her i wondered if she knows hes married imogen buried her face in the bodley head scott fitzgerald she had given up tristram shandy shes bound to burn grumbled yvonne adjusting her cardboard beak people simply dont realise you have to take it slowly in this heat thats why i never burn on she moaned until imogen was quite glad to see cable and nicky walking towards them she supposed with matt gone off to see braganzi theyd taken the opportunity to spend a couple of hours in bed and both got out of the wrong side of it judging by the set sullen expressions on their faces good morning said yvonne cheering up at the sight of cables sulkiness whats good about it snapped cable throwing her flattened lilo down on the ground will you blow it up for me nicky he shot her a look which plainly said blow the bloody thing up yourself then thought better of it and crouched down by the lilo muttering under his breath i hear matts gone to see braganzi said yvonne to cable you must be delighted for him i am not a fine holiday im having with him wasting his time running after silly stories hed gone by nine oclock this morning and thatll be the last ill see of him today most likely hes bound to be up half the night writing the beastly thing he even asked me to find him a typewriter i ask you in a godforsaken place like this its getting more and more like margate she added glaring round the beach then turning to nicky whod nearly finished blowing up the lilo why dont we push off to st trop for the day no said nicky suddenly catching sight of tracey frolicking around in the shallows with james we havent got a car well lets hire one said cable imperiously following nickys glance too much hassle snapped nicky corking up the lilo and laying it at cables feet and its far too hot to drive cables green eyes flashed it was getting too hot right here thought imogen im going to swim she announced setting off towards the sea so am i said nicky hastily following her youre looking very choice today my darling lets get out of the line of fire were over here tracey called to them waving frantically her long blonde hair trailing in the green water like a mermaids its lovely and how are you this morning nicky admiring you breasting the waves said nicky or rather waving the breasts they all laughed and splashed around then nicky did his spectacular flashy crawl out to the raft and back oh i wish i could swim like that said tracey ill teach you said nicky just rest your stomach on my hands now move one arm like this and put your head down tracey emerged giggling and spluttering i wouldnt call that my tummy she said oh well give or take a few inches said nicky smiling down at her suddenly they stopped laughing and just gazed at each other oh my goodness thought imogen nervous but pleased as well what will cable say come on imogen said james with a jolly laugh ill give you a swimming lesson too ouch he squeaked as he stepped forward i feel a prick again said nicky and they all collapsed into giggles again which was all in all not the sort of behaviour to improve either cables or yvonnes tempers when they finally came out of the water yvonne promptly sent james off to the café to get her some lemonade can you get me a vodka and tonic with ice and lemon said cable ill come and help you said nicky i could do with a snifter myself dont forget to make the tonic slimline cable called after him yvonne turned her attention to tracey who was sitting up combing the tangles out of her hair my dear have you known larry long not very well theres something about him i feel you really ought to know may i be frank with you he is married oh is he said tracey quite unmoved is she nice very evidently said yvonne and theyve been happily married for seventeen years well i expect he needs a holiday from her then said tracey then hell go home all the keener but put yourself in his wifes place said yvonne how dyou think she feels at this moment abandoned in islington with the children while you sun yourself on the côte dazure at her husbands expense a shadow fell over imogens book she looked up and jumped as she saw larry a camera hanging from his neck he put his finger to his lips my dear said yvonne warming to her subject dont you realise how physical men are its so easy for them to be led astray by the sight of a pretty face if i encouraged them i could have hundreds of men and husbands running after me but it wouldnt be fair men are so animal its up to us girls to take a stand larry had crept round to yvonne and the next moment he was growling furiously into her ear making her jump so much she fell off her lilo how dare you she screamed bow wow growled larry bow wow im an animal being led astray by a pretty face bow wow that nose does suit you i cant think why you ever take it off and picking up his camera he took a succession of quick snaps of her put that thing away squealed yvonne furiously tearing off her nose well stop brainwashing tracey then not that theres a lot of brain to wash hullo larry said nicky returning with james a trayful of drinks and a cornet with two strawberry spheres of ice cream spilling out of the top how did you get on fantastic said larry seizing cables vodka and tonic and draining half of it in one gulp what a pad theyve got up there its a tragedy we couldnt use colour how was the duchess said james sensational christ what a beautiful woman ive just been to marseilles airport and put four rolls of film on a plane to london wheres matt said cable still up there getting on like a château on fire braganzis being amazingly free and frank he can afford to be if hes going to see copy snapped cable you might leave me some of my drink gilmore oh sorry darling said larry finishing it ill get us both another one in a minute ugh said yvonne youre dripping ice cream all over me whos it for tracey said nicky handing it to her somehow its structure reminded me of her do you mind giggled tracey ta awfully nicky im going to swim said cable tucking her black hair into a yellow turban are you coming nicky for a minute they glared at each other then he laughed and said all right and putting an arm round her shoulders walked down to the beach with her im going too said yvonne still obviously put out by larrys presence larry took off his shirt and trousers underneath he was wearing black bathing trunks he had a muscular wellshaped body already very brown the mantan as tracey had pointed out had striped his legs he laughed when he caught imogen staring at him its terribly difficult to put on over hairy legs he said sitting down beside her its a great story you got matt you know and you certainly made a hit with braganzi and the duchess theyve been singing your praises all morning werent your ears burning no but my boobs are interrupted tracey rolling over on her front and picking up imogens book larry looked out to sea at cable and nicky who had reached the raft clambered on to it and were plainly having some kind of argument cables being poisonous to that nice tennis player he said in his slow voice he must be her latest oh theyve been flirting a bit said james jolly pretty girl but a bit of a handful suppose im one of the lucky ones he said blowing bubbles into his drink with a straw old yvonnes never really looked at another man im one of the lucky ones too drawled gilmore another mans never looked at old bambi thats not right thought imogen quickly both matt and cable said she was very attractive larry drained cables drink whos for a refill he said what are you having james vodka and pineapple said james im getting quite addicted to it but for gods sake dont tell yvonne and what about you tracey im all right for a bit said tracey licking her ice cream and still engrossed in imogens scott fitzgerald she glanced at the jacket she writes rather well this bodley head has she written lots of other books im starving said nicky as the beach emptied for lunch lets find a nice cool restaurant and have something to eat and something to drink said larry on the way they called in the hotel where cable found a note for matt hooray she said opening it its from the blakerharrises theres a big party on tonight were all invited will it be smart said yvonne pretty said cable lots of jet set oh dear said larry im getting quite pixillated by high life the duchess this morning the blakerharrises tonight i must go down to the sieffs again what does everyone want to eat said james as they sat down in a little restaurant hung with fishing nets and overlooking the sea hands up for salade niçoise id like an advocado pear said tracey id like an enormous vodka said larry hes deliberately setting out to get drunk again thought imogen a waiter shot past them bearing a plate of pink langoustines to a corner table and she suddenly felt a stab of misery remembering last time shed eaten them with matt in st tropez she wondered for the hundredth time how he was getting on theyd reached the coffee stage by the time he arrived cable and yvonne were discussing what to wear that evening nicky was making discreet eyes at tracey and talking to james about forest hills at the same time larry was ordering another bottle when she saw him standing in the doorway watching them i cant help it she thought in misery every time i see him i want to bound forward like a dog and wag my tail and jump all over him matt shouted larry bon journ main sewer questque ce going on up at château braganzi matt pulled up a chair and sat down between him and cable jesus what a story he said its so hot it frightens me well have a drink and then it wont any more said larry matt shook his head id better stay sober going to need all the wits ive got ill have some coffee are you all right darling he said to cable then not giving her time to answer turned to imogen they both sent their love they gave me a present for you but i left it behind ill bring it back when i go up this evening and show them the copy if i ever get it together that is youd better get it written this afternoon said cable the blakerharrises are giving a party tonight well theyll manage without me said matt thats ridiculous snapped cable it cant take you that long youre not writing a novel bloody nearly ive just talked to the paper theyre going to hold the review front for it you cant churn that out in a couple of hours therell be a lot of talent at the blakerharrises said cable tauntingly rod stewarts going to be there well you wont need me either as soon as he finished the cup of coffee he got to his feet id better get started did you find me a typewriter no said cable christ said matt i did try but i had a lot of things to do this morning she added defensively ive no doubt one of them was human what dyou mean said cable momentarily nonplussed you should tidy up after your gentlemen friends one of them left this on the bed this morning said matt and there was a slither of gold as he dropped nickys medallion on to cables lap there was an awful pause then cable said oh thats nickys the hot tap wasnt working in his room so he used our shower perhaps youd have a word with madame seeing shes a friend of yours matt looked at nicky reflectively for a minute and then he laughed i would have thought a few cold showers would have done you all the good in the world nicky boy and he was gone there was another long pause im going to the hairdresser this afternoon said yvonne so am i said cable nicky turned to tracey how would you like to come for a ride on a pedalo larry looked out of the window at the heat haze shimmering on the road out of the village i think its going to snow i want another large vodka larry and imogen and james went back to the beach and they taught her how to play poker but before long the heat and the heavy lunch overcame james and he staggered back to the hotel for a siesta larry picked up his camera lets wander along the beach id like to take some pictures of you oh please no stammered imogen i dont take a very good photograph dont be silly said larry im the one who takes the good photographs and certainly he was so quiet and gentle and snapped away so unobtrusively and flattered her so outrageously that she was soon relaxing and posing in every position he suggested on the rocks paddling in the shallows lounging against a breakwater has anyone told you what a pretty girl you are he said imogen gazed at his thick black and grey hair as he bent over the viewfinder yes one or two people she said bitterly and then they rush off with other people telling me im too inexperienced he looked up finding the musical beds confusing are you i must say were a pretty decadent lot for you to stumble on except perhaps yvonne and shes enough to put one off respectability for life the frigid bitch turn your head slightly towards the sea darling but leave your eyes in the same place but matt doesnt seem like that the temptation to talk about him was too strong matts different said larry changing the film in what way said imogen letting her hair fall over her face so larry couldnt see she was blushing i mean when he gave cable that medallion he must have known what shed been up to with nicky but he didnt seem in the least put out he was far more annoyed with her not getting the typewriter he completely switches off when hes working until hes got that piece finished and its going to be a bugger turn your head slightly to the left darling he wont notice if cables being laid end to end by all the frogs in portlespins it must be awfully irritating for her shes so beautiful shes nothing special just a spoilt little bitch who doesnt know what she wants she wants matt said imogen et alia but ive got a feeling each time she cheats on him it worries him less head up a bit darling and if he allows her enough rope shell hang herself imogen giggled and felt a bit better and allowed herself a tiny dream about getting a job in the library on matts newspaper and his taking her on a story and then getting snowed up thats enough work for one afternoon said larry lets go and have a drink he screwed his eyes up to look out to sea wheres that pedalo i hope nicky hasnt sunk without tracey she is nice said imogen in fact its been so much better all round since you and she arrived last night will it be frightfully grand this evening itll be ludicrous said larry tucking his arm through hers but we might get a few laughs they turned into the first bar on the front and sat idly drinking and watching the people coming back from the beach that girl oughtnt to wear a bikini said larry as a fat brunette wobbled past them she ought to wear an overcoat you should have seen the sensation tracey caused on the beach this morning said imogen it was a bit like the pied piper drawing all the rats into the water when she went down to bathe larry didnt answer and suddenly turning round imogen saw hed gone as white as a sheet and was gazing mesmerised with horror at a beautiful woman with short light brown hair and very high cheek bones who was walking hand in hand with a much younger athleticlooking man down to the sea whats the matter said imogen he took a slug of his drink with a shaking hand please tell me she urged i know somethings wrong you seem so well cheerful but underneath im sure youre not for a minute he was silent his thin face dark and bitter and she could feel the struggle going on inside him then he took a deep breath and said that woman for a minute i thought she was bambi but shes in islington no she isnt shes down here somewhere with her lover she left me about a fortnight ago oh said imogen with embarrassment i cant bear it you poor thing i didnt want everyone pitying me it was my fault i suppose i neglected her ive been working so hard the last two years just to survive and pay the school fees every night id come home and collapse in front of the telly with a double whisky far too zonked out with my own problems to realise she was unhappy but when did she start seeing this other man asked imogen oh last year sometime suddenly she started finding fault with everything i did if the washing machine had broken it was my fault going home at night was like being parachuted into a fucking minefield in retrospect i realise now she was picking fights with me to justify falling for this other bloke how did you find out silly really she used to go out every wednesday to pottery classes i used to babysit she was quite often late back said she and the rest of the class had been to the pub then one day i met her pottery teacher in the high street and he said what a pity it was she didnt come to classes any more when she was so talented i went straight home and she admitted everything in the old days i suppose id have blacked her eye but i was buggered if i was going to be accused of being a male chauvinist pig so i just got bombed out of my skull every night and what about tracey shes just window dressing shes a nice girl but with me putting back the amount im putting back at the moment im not much use to her in the sack anyway best thing for her is to get off with nicky theyre well matched intellectually he took her hand look im really sorry to dump on you like this i like it said imogen ive felt so useless this holiday but arent you likely to bump into bambi any minute he shrugged i know she and loverboy are staying somewhere on the riviera hes frightfully rich so its bound to be expensive does matt know of course said larry he rumbled it last night back at the hotel they found cable and yvonne both with sleek newly washed hair drinking lemon tea with nicky and james i suppose id better ring the paper to see if that films arrived said larry what time have we got to be on parade asked imogen well it starts at eight but i dont think we need roll up much before nine or ninethirty said yvonne must make an entrance muttered nicky james looked at his watch five oclock ive just got time to ring the office to see if everythings ok after that nicky decided he ought to go and ring his agent and cable and yvonne suddenly came to the conclusion they ought to ring theirs as well imogen wondered if she ought to keep her end up by ringing the library but what could she ask them had the mayor returned the hite report at last was lady jacintha still clinging on to dick francis she decided to go upstairs and wash her hair she met cable coming downstairs looking bootfaced matts lost his sense of humour he simply cant get his dreary piece together hes just bitten my head off simply because i asked for some change to telephone ill have to borrow from gilmore imogen turned around and went out to a nearby café and bought six cans of iced beer and a couple of large sandwiches made of french bread and garlic sausage she could see cable safely squawking in the telephone box as she went through reception so she went upstairs and knocked timidly on matts door there was no answer she knocked again come in shouted a voice what the bloody hell do you want this time inside she found him sitting on a chair that was too small bashing away at a typewriter on a tiny table that shuddered and trembled under the pressure his blue denim shirt was drenched with sweat he looked like a giant trying to ride a shetland pony his shoulders were rigid with tension and exasperation there were scrumpledup bits of paper all over the floor cant you leave me alone for five minutes he said through gritted teeth then he looked round blinked and realised it was her oh its you he said i thought you might need something to eat and drink not now but later she said nervously you didnt have any lunch you ought to eat he looked slightly less bootfaced that was very kind of you sweetheart is it going any better nope he pushed his damp hair back from his forehead its going backwards ive got a total brainfreeze i cant think how to do it itll break soon its got to ive got to show it to braganzi before midnight the bugger is him having to see it its like having to adapt de sade for the parish mag his eyes were just hollows in his suntanned face he flexed his aching back suddenly he looked so tired and lost and defeated she wanted to cradle his head against her and stroke all the tension out of him i wouldnt bother about what theyre going to think she said im sure if you get across how much they adore each other and what a sacrifice they had to make and how the relationship does work and how hes not just a cheap hood they wont mind what else you say theyre just panicking that someone might write something that might prejudice her chances of seeing the children again but you know all that anyway i used to get panicky about essays in exams she said tumbling over her words in her shyness matt reached over and opened one of the cans of beer go on he said so i used to pretend i wasnt doing an essay at all just writing a letter about the subject home to juliet trying to make it as amusing for her as possible matt grinned for the first time you think i should pretend im writing to basil imogen giggled well maybe something of the sort are you going to the blakerharrises he said she nodded well for gods sake wear a chastity belt and a bulletproof vest its bound to turn into an orgy he turned back to his typewriter dismissing her but as she went out on to the landing he thanked her once again she was just starting to wash her hair when larry knocked on the door im going back to the hotel to have a bath and change he said tracey and ill come and pick you up about half eight we dont want to miss valuable drinking time what shall i wear she asked gilmore went over to her wardrobe the pink trousers and that pale pink top he said itll look stunning now youre brown will it be smart enough she asked doubtfully perfect i want you to downstage the others and remember no bra what was the point of dressing up for a ball she thought listlessly when there was no chance of prince charming showing up chapter fifteen hey you look good enough to ah well good enough for anything said larry when he collected her you certainly do things for that sweater you like it yes and whats inside it even better isnt it a bit tight said imogen doubtfully and are you sure trousers will be all right perfect why wear expensive gear to go to a rugger scrum he was wearing a pale grey suit and a black shirt which matched his black and silver hair you look lovely too she said as they went downstairs they could hear the relentless pounding of matts typewriter thats a relief said gilmore sounds as though hes getting it together at last it was a stifling hot night tracey james and nicky all in high spirits were having a drink in the bar tracey was wearing a black dress plunging at the front slit up to her red pants at the back madame had presented james with one of her purple asters for his button hole ive never been to a jet set party he was saying i do hope bianca jaggers there who are the blakerharrises anyway asked nicky he made a fortune in dog food said larry i gather theyre staying with some rich frogs called ducharmé who are giving the party are cable and yvonne anything like ready do you suppose id much rather drink at monsieur ducharmés expense than my own well im ready said a gay voice and yvonne arrived in a swirl of apple green with green sandals and a green ribbon in her red curls you look lovely my darling said james dutifully like crème de menthe frappé said larry under his breath i thought you said itd be all right to wear trousers muttered imogen and the most wonderful news went on yvonne my agents just rung back and said im shortlisted for jane bennet in the new bbc pride and prejudice everyone gave rather forced exclamations of enthusiasm and james kissed her but very gingerly so as not to disarrange her hair when will you know said nicky in a day or two said yvonne theyre starting shooting in three weeks isnt it exciting suddenly her beady eyes fell on imogen oughtnt you to go and change were going to be terribly late shes already changed said larry arent you rather miscast as jane yvonne dear she was supposed to be such a nice sweet natured girl yvonne was saved the trouble of thinking up a really crushing reply by the arrival of cable looking sensational in a dress entirely made of peacock feathers it was sleeveless and clung lightly to her figure stopping just above the knee two peacock feathers nestling in her snaking ebony hair and bands of peacock blue shadow painted on her eyelids made her eyes look brilliant flashing turquoise rather than green nicky whistled james gasped yvonne merely glared and shut her lips tighter thats the most beautiful dress ive ever seen said tracey im going to change muttered imogen havent got time said larry seizing her wrist im surprised you havent borrowed yvonnes cardboard beak to complete the picture cable darling the sun was falling into the sea as the taxi turned off the coast road im glad its getting dark said tracey adding another layer of mascara to her false eyelashes party makeup looks so much better at night in jamess spotlessly clean paleblue car in front imogen could see cable whod commandeered the entire back seat to herself so her feathers shouldnt be ruffled and yvonne getting out combs and beginning to tease their hair with the pointed ends she wished matt were there to look after her she was sure as soon as they got to the party larry would get drunk and disappear nicky already had his arm along the back of the seat and was surreptitiously caressing the back of traceys neck so she couldnt expect much support from him either the taxi turned and sped up a drive the gravel spluttering against the wheels vineyards and olive groves on either side stretched to infinity ahead in the dusk every window blazing with light was a huge white house its a mansion said tracey they could see a man in a pink suit with red and pink hair get out of a rollsroyce and ring the door bell i think thats david bowie said larry oh dear said imogen faintly as they walked up the marble steps a butler opened the door then a maid whisked imogen and tracey upstairs to a room with walls covered in pink satin on the floor was a thick fur carpet the bed was covered in fur coats which must have been brought by guests just to show off it was such a stifling hot night do you take cloth coats too said tracey taking off her white blazer and handing it to the maid cable and yvonne were still engaged in teasing their hair in front of the mirror im sure i caught a glimpse of omar sharif said yvonne out of the window imogen could see a jungle of garden punctuated by lily ponds aviaries full of coloured birds two lanternlit swimming pools and in the distance the sea shaking with nerves she went downstairs to find larry waiting for her and talking in a low voice to a splendid blonde covered in sequins imogen darling this is your hostess claudine take a good look at her she may not pass this way again but before he had a chance to say anything else claudine had shimmered forward and seized imogens hands mees brocklehurst how wonderful to meet you what a fantastic coincidence that you should be on holiday with matt and nicky beresford and the next moment she had drawn imogen into a huge room which seemed to be seething with suntanned faces with hard restless eyes constantly on the lookout for fresh excitement wait for larry begged imogen larry who screamed claudine and shoving a drink into imogens hand she dragged her from one group to another crying this is lovely imogen brocklehurst whisper whisper yes really braganzis child snatched from the jaws of death everyone started oohing and aahing as though claudine was bringing in the christmas pudding flaming blue with brandy how do you do how do you do hi imogen glad to know you how do you do people were thrusting forward to meet her imogen turned to claudine in horror but what have you told them did you really meet the duchess what was she like did she seem keen on braganzi clamoured the faces oh stop called imogen after a disappearing claudine please dont tell people braganzi doesnt want publicity now everyone was mobbing her and introducing her she was so breathless with answering questions she found shed finished her drink which was delicious and tasted rather like coke filled with fruit salad the moment she put her glass down another was thrust into her hand how has she furnished the house are the guard dogs as ferocious as everyone makes out werent you terrified to meet braganzi does he keep her chained up there has she lost her looks i hear the duke more people were crowding round her asking excited questions finally somebody introduced her to larry no we havent met he said grabbing her by the arm and pulling her into a side room this place is a lunatic asylum she gasped what on earth did you tell claudine i gave her a brief run down on your lifesaving activities yesterday youre certainly the star attraction have another drink he grabbed one from a passing waiter ive had several already said imogen with a giggle its delicious and so refreshing what is it pimms said larry practically nonalcoholic a vision in yellow flew out at him larry darling where did you get to ive been looking for you everywhere and she hauled him away next moment a stunningly handsome man in a white dinner jacket had crept up and put his arm through imogens i hear you know darling camilla he said do give her my love next time you see her a light flashed thank you said a photographer moving away the sounds of revelry grew louder the heat grew more oppressive by the minute come and look at the garden said the man in the white dinner jacket two beautiful young men in shirts slashed to the waist met them in the doorway at last weve found you you must be morgan brocklehurst they chorused weve been simply dying to meet you all evening i hear you had dinner with braganzi last night said the first is he as butch as everyone says he is asked the second a large woman in crimson with one false eyelash hanging askew like a ladder from her bottom lid charged up to them does anyone know which morgan brocklehurst is she said eagerly i hear shes actually met braganzi and the duchess shes somewhere in there said the first young man pointing back at the drawingroom from which a hysterical rush of talk was now issuing oh dear said the woman in crimson ive just fought my way out of there i want to try and nail her for a beach party im having tomorrow she dived back in the mêlée ill get you another drink morgan said the man in the white dinner jacket thanks id adore one said imogen who was beginning to enjoy herself one of the beautiful young men took her arm and led her through the gardens past huge jungle plants with leaves like dark shining shields and brilliant coloured birds scarlet turquoise dark blue and emerald all chirruping and fluttering about their aviary like guests at the party round the corner they found two pale pink flamingos standing on one leg in a bright green pond full of fat golden carp gliding in and out of the water lilies in the stifling heat imogen was quite happy to rest on a cool stone bench with lions heads rearing up at either end the two young men sat at her feet a captive audience she was soon quite happily recounting the events of yesterday soon quite a crowd was gathered round her people kept topping up her drink it really is very moreish she said to the company at large she kept looking around for larry and hoping matt would arrive but after a bit she stopped worrying even about them can i get you something to eat asked the man in the white dinner jacket oh no thank you said imogen she seemed to have consumed far too much fruit salad already well come and dance then he said leading her back into the house claudine brought in bottles of champagne for this party plus lbs of caviar and god knows how many gallons of diorissimo to put in the swimming pool of course shell claim it all on tax it was far too dark to see anyone on the dance floor morgan morgan youre so fresh and unspoilt said the man in the white dinner jacket drawing her to his bosom oh dear she thought i do hope i dont leave makeup all over him another man cut in and danced her off into another room where he tried to kiss her she wanted to slap his face but he wasnt very steady on his feet and she thought she might knock him over then a haughty aristocratic beauty drew her aside im giving a party in marbella tomorrow night love it if you could make it we could easily send a plane bring anyone you like perhaps camillad like an outing has she put on any weight since shes been living with braganzi the band was playing smoke gets in your eyes the laughter and tinkle of broken glass were getting louder a crowd was clamouring round her again suddenly a hand shot out and grabbed her it was larry waving a full bottle of champagne doctor livingstone she screamed ive been looking for you everywhere he said dragging her through the french windows out into the garden where are the others well ive just seen nicky and tracey come out of the library looking rather ruffled nicky was wearing lipstick tracey wasnt any more mrs edgworths been dancing the night away with omar sharif and cables been dividing her unwrapped attention between rod stewart and warren beatty so shes happy not entirely no point in being the belle of the ball if the guy who matters isnt here to witness it matt hasnt showed up yet he cant still be wrestling with his copy hes probably having trouble getting braganzi to ok it said imogen if he does get it through hell make a bomb on syndication bloody well need to to pay for cables peacock feathers pity someone cant lock her away in the aviary with all those coloured birds thought imogen she held out her glass id like another drink please thats my girl said larry filling her long pimms glass up to the brim with champagne for a while they danced on the lawn both slightly supporting one another christ i wish id brought my camera said larry half the crowned heads of europe are frisking nude in the swimming pool evidently leonard is on hand with a fleet of minions to blow dry anyone who wants it when they come out imogen listened to the shrieks and splashes from the pool and wished she felt slim enough to bathe in the nude she seemed to have drunk all her champagne i really must go to the loo well dont be long said larry its nearly light up time imogen realised how drunk she was when she found herself liberally pouring her hostesss scent over her bosom in the pink satin bedroom breaking the eighth commandment again she put the bottle down hastily what would her father say and matt her face however looked rather sparklyeyed and pinkcheeked and much better than shed expected after so much booze have you met morgan brocklehurst she heard two women saying as she went downstairs quite ravishing i must ask her who does her hair evidently braganzis leaving her half of sicily as she reached the bottom step a large brunette shot past her shrieking playfully followed two seconds later by james very pink in the face and emitting tarzan howls they both disappeared into the shrubbery why arent you dancing morgan asked claudine rushing forward ill take care of that said a smooth voice and the next moment she felt herself clutched to the muscular scented hairychested bosom of one of the screens greatest lovers i took one look at you he crooned in her ear thats all i meant to do and then my heart stood still how would you like to go to a party in rome im supposed to be going to one in marbella tomorrow said imogen oh thatll be effie strausss thrash ill give you a lift if you like they danced and danced drank and drank and although she was slightly missing the forehand drives of conversation he didnt seem to mind at all then she remembered shed left larry in the garden she must go and find him as she reached the end of the lawn she passed a couple under a fig tree locked in a passionate embrace the girls silver blonde hair fell below her waist the moment i saw you yesterday the mans voice was saying huskily pow suddenly it happened like being struck down by a thunderbolt i dont know what it is about you tracey darling but its something indefinably different and your pulse my darling is going like the charge of the light brigade shrieked imogen loudly and rushed off howling with laughter as they both jumped out of their skins she was still laughing when she found larry rolling a joint by the flamingo pool its light up time he said again this is the best party ive ever been to she said have a drag of this said larry and itll seem even better i dont smoke said imogen go on im a great believer in first times there may not be another opportunity he lit the cigarette inhaled deeply two or three times then handed it to her she took a nervous puff and choked then took another one then she put the joint in the snarling mouth of the stone lion at the end of the seat and she and larry both laughed immoderately then she took another drag nice asked larry yes sighed imogen it makes the flamingos so pink and the water so green threequarters down the cigarette by which time they were both cackling with laughter over anything she turned and looked at him he was really very attractive in a hawklike ravaged way and quite old enough to be her father so that made everything quite safe larry yes angel do you think im pretty exquisitely so and he bent over and kissed her very slowly and with velvet artistry and now youre even prettier he took a deep drag on the cigarette then kissed her again and this time it took much longer imogen got to her feet and went to the edge of the pool the flamingos seemed to be floating above the water the turning beam of the lighthouse revolving most erratically the huge stars were so near she could have reached up and plucked them dont go away said larry the way to heaven is paved with bad intentions im not going anywhere she could hear the throb of drums and the carnival howls of the party when love comes in and takes you for a spin oh la la la cest magnifique played the band the night was so warm and beautiful yet she felt a terrible stab of longing if only matt were here then suddenly she was filled with passion and resolve and per cent proof courage larry darling she turned to him people keep telling me ive got to grow up and live a little and get some experience with men and catch up with cable and yvonne and tracey and things you wouldnt help me would you and teach me about sex wouldnt i just what an offer christ if you want experience im your man sweetheart je suis le professeur now stay here and finish the joint and ill go and get another bottle and well take it down to the beach imogen collapsed back on the seat when love comes in and takes you for a spin she sang to the flamingos she was feeling very lightheaded from where she was sitting she could see some planes parked in a field perhaps one was waiting to whisk the screens greatest lover off to rome beyond the planes were a row of cars mostly rollsroyces and bentleys but standing there cleaner than any other was james and yvonnes pale blue cortina suddenly imogen felt an overwhelming urge she opened her bag scrabbling inside for a lipstick she found one that gloria had given her for her birthday that shed never used it was dark maroon and called plum dynasty to make you more sophisticated gloria had said jolly soppy name said imogen giggling hysterically to herself as she ran through the trees towards the cars fancy founding a dynasty of plums anyway your hour has come plum and she repeated come plum several times to herself giggling some more and there was the pale blue boot door of yvonnes car just asking to be scribbled on she unscrewed the lipstick and wrote yvonne edgworth in a large maroon scrawl then she added is a stroppy cow then crossed out cow and put bitch and henpecker then she wrote bugger three times on the top of the car and fuck twice on the windscreen then she rushed round to the other side and wrote yvonne bismarck the iron duke but that wasnt quite right so she crossed out the d and changed duke to puke and laughed immoderately at her own joke shed just started to write go home carrot top when the lipstick broke in half so she ran shrieking back to larry who had returned and was swaying dangerously as he tried to balance along the top of the stone seat with a bottle in one hand and a glass in the other he jumped down spilling some of the champagne and said ive just seen yvonne edgworth asking omar sharif if hed ever bought a whole flower stall for anyone the path down to the sea was quite steep and they were both very drunk but somehow they managed to support each other i want to get my organ into morgan chanted larry and they both roared with laughter i seem to be going from one bad end to another said imogen i do love you larry is it possible to love two people at once i think so said larry but its rather expensive his drawl was more exaggerated than ever his hair was all over the place they reached the beach imogen could feel the sand cool and separating beneath her feet somewhere on the way down shed lost her shoes when love comes in and takes you for a spin sang larry i want to get my organ into morgan so do a lot of other guys at the party i found several men in white dinner jackets looking for you when i went back to the house there was only one said imogen you must have been seeing quadruple and they both shrieked with laughter again pot on a lot of drink makes the stupidest things funny the whole beach and the distant lights of portlespins and the lighthouse seemed to hang in a rosy glow the waves were hissing like little white snakes on the sand a half grapefruit moon lay on its back in the dark sky waiting to submit like me thought imogen she felt weightless like an astronaut larry picked up a stick and tried to write with it but the sand was too dry tell the sea to come nearer he said they ran whooping hand in hand down to the waters edge where he wrote larry loves imogen in huge letters in the wet sand then he kissed her and she could feel the warm sea washing over her feet ill give you a crash course in experience he muttered into her hair you lovely warm thing you do realise i havent been to bed with anyone before i said i was a great believer in first times said larry gently pulling her sweater over her head shall we swim first one should always have a bath before sex perhaps im not too fat to bathe in the nude after all thought imogen hazily as she ripped off the trousers and pants and threw them down on the sand there was no shock as shrieking with joy she paddled ecstatically into the waves it was almost as warm in the water as out its heavenly she shouted to larry next minute he was chasing after her and she felt his hands round her waist youre beautiful he said looking down at her you look like venus coming out of the waves bottichilly giggled imogen though actually its not chilly at all quite the reverse thats enough overture said larry lets get down to act one as he kissed her his lips tasted of salt and imogen was glad he was holding her she doubted she could have stood up alone she really felt very hazy she asked larry if he thought there was any point in having a crash course if she wasnt going to remember the finer points afterwards larry laughed and said two of her finest points were sticking into his chest at the moment and he certainly wasnt going to forget them and began to kiss her in the hollow of her throat in the distance she could still hear the sound of revellers and shrieks from the swimming pool then she heard voices much nearer angry voices and she was gradually aware that larry had stopped kissing her and was gazing over her shoulder there was a long pause then larry muttered my god it cant be then she heard an all too familiar voice saying for christs sake gilmore imogen buried her face in larrys neck then slowly swivelled round a man and a woman were standing on the sands only a few yards away from them both their faces were in shadow but she could see the girl had short streaked blonde hair and was very slim and no one could miss that height and the width of the mans shoulders larry swallowed nervously hi matt he said brightly oh dear said imogen id better do a venus in reverse and giggling frantically she slid back into the water what the bloody hell have you been up to gilmore said matt icily you told me to keep an eye on her protested larry and so he has said imogens head just above the water two eyes most of the time and a lot of hands hes been lovely weve had such a nice time when love comes in and takes you for a spin oh la la la jesus said matt what have you done to her larry now seemed to be on shore futilely trying to tug on imogens pink trousers which came no higher than his knee caps imogen dear he said you havent met bambi bambi squeaked imogen looking at matts companion oh my goodness how do you do ive heard so much about you funny said bambi acidly ive heard absolutely nothing about you matt picked up gilmores trousers and threw them at him i know youve been trying to get into imogens pants all evening he snapped now try and get into your own for a change awfully good party said imogen flipping water at them come out of there at once and get dressed im taking you home said matt in no time at all it seemed she was sitting beside matt in her dripping clothes as he belted the mercedes down claudines drive somewhere in the distance behind them she could hear yvonnes voice rising and falling in fury like a fire siren i dont want to go home id like some more champagne said imogen petulantly youve had quite enough imogen let her head loll back on the seat youre a rotten spoilsport she said in a slurred voice ive been having the time of my life everyones been trying to get off with me morgan the hero the intrepid rescuer stars of stage and screen have been battling for my favours ive been smoking pot and drinking quite a lot and having a whole load of new experiences in fact i was just about to embark on my first affair with a married man when you and bambi came along so inconsiderately and put a spoke in the wheel matt gazed stonily at the road in front and jammed his foot down on the accelerator darling larry was giving me a crash course in experience a crash course larry ought to be shot i dont know why youre so cross grumbled imogen you dont want me youre just being a dog in the manger larry was just being kind i asked him to seduce me i thought if i became a woman of the world like cable a few more people might fancy me well youre going about it the wrong way matt ground the gears viciously when love comes in and takes you for a spin sang imogen tunelessly oh la la la its bloody awful do you think bambill excite me as corespondent probably well what a stupid time for her to stage a comeback in the middle of an orgy she must have known larryd be up to someone if not me matt ignored her and lit a cigarette she was beginning to feel very odd everything like vesuvius seemed to be erupting inside her oh well this time next week ill be back in my little grey home in the west riding she said fretfully and you can forget all about me then suddenly out of the corner of her eye she saw he was laughing youre not cross anymore absolutely blind with rage im awfully sorry she said her head flopping on to his shoulder but i do love you and she passed out cold chapter sixteen when she woke next afternoon she thought she was going to die shed never known pain like it as though a nutcracker was slowly crushing her skull in and a lot of gnomes were hammering from the inside for a few minutes she lay groaning pitifully then opened her eyes whereupon an agonising blaze of sunlight stabbed her like a knife and she hastily shut them again wincing she started to piece together the events of the evening the crazy lionising the drinking and pot smoking and finally the nude bathing someone had hung her wet trousers and jersey from the window she wondered what had happened to her knickers and her shoes she also had hazy memories of meeting bambi and matt being very cross and bringing her home but who the hell had undressed her sweat broke out drenching her entire body she only just made the lavatory in time and was violently sick on the way back to her room she passed madame and a squeegee mop wanting to hear all about her encounter with braganzi and the duchess muttering about shellfish poisoning imogen apologised and bolted back into her room where she cleaned her teeth and then crawled miserably into bed she tried to remember what shed said to matt on the way home oh why had she made such an idiot of herself there was a knock on the door it sounded like a clap of thunder it was matt wearing jeans and no shirt he had just washed his hair and was rubbing it dry with a large pink mascarastained towel imogen disappeared hastily under the bedclothes she felt him sit down on the bed and slowly emerged youre an absolute disgrace he said oh go away she moaned i know i behaved horribly im quite prepared for whats coming to me and i dont want any flowers or letters please a smile so faint it was almost imperceptible touched his mouth at one corner rotten france she said burying her face in the pillow one spends ones time being sick for love or just sick i feel terrible serve you right trying to pack ten years experience into one night and as for scribbling obscenities in lipstick all over mrs edgworths clean car holy smoke she sat bolt upright clutching her head with one hand and the sheet to her breasts with the other did i really does she know it was me no thanks to me i managed to blur the yvonne bismarck bits so she assumes its some random scribbler who got litup at the party oh thank goodness goodness as mae west said had nothing to do with it he shook his head i must say the most outrageous alter ego emerges when you get stoned im not sure your father would be very pleased by your performance last night not that anyone else appears to have behaved particularly well nicky hasnt surfaced yet and jumbos looking very poorly wwheres larry she stammered pleating the sheet with her fingers unable to meet matts eyes gone he sent fondest love and a letter bambis taken him off to antibes will they be ok probably after a bit of straight talking theyre both equally to blame and tracey gone to a thrash in marbella with some movie star he wanted you to go too but i thought youd had enough excitement to be going on with by the way ive got a present for you and out of his pocket he produced a leather jewel box for a glorious lunatic moment imogen wondered if he was giving her a ring then he said its from the duchess and braganzi to say thank you theres a letter from her too imogen opened the box it was a gold necklace set with seed pearls and rubies she gave a gasp of delight pretty isnt it try it on she bowed her head forward he put his arms around her to do up the clasp his broad brown chest was only inches away from her she ached to reach out and touch it she trembled as she felt his fingers on her neck she prayed it was clean enough there matt leaned back it looks terrific have a look he reached for a hand mirror beside the bed and held it up for her the necklace was beautiful but the effect was slightly spoiled by a mascara smudge under one eye and a large bit of sleep in the corner of the other hastily she rubbed them away its so kind of them both it was so little that i did she muttered then she gave a gasp of horror but i never asked you i quite forgot what happened about the piece they liked it they hardly changed a thing oh thats wonderful and your paper theyre pretty pleased too im so glad so it was worth it after all that struggle yes it nearly always is i feel sort of christlike today its the best feeling in the world or almost the best feeling he smiled the day after youve finished something youve really sweated your guts out over he squeezed her thigh gently through the blanket and its all due to you darling imogen wriggled with embarrassment it was nothing she cast desperately around for a change of subject look does yvonne really not realise it was me well her minds on other things today evidently jumbo disgraced himself last night and being saturday the beach is like oxford street in the rush hour but shes forgotten all that she got a telegram midday confirming her film part oh dear said imogen quite shes being utterly insufferable upstaging cable in particular so you can imagine cable is not in the sunniest of tempers his hair was nearly dry now blond and silky it flopped over his tanned forehead imogen longed to run her fingers through it she was driven distracted by his nearness but it was such heaven having him sitting gossiping on her bed shed almost forgotten her hangover he got to his feet to celebrate her new starring role mrs edgworth has actually offered to take us all out to dinner i hope youll be able to make it i need a few allies when he had gone she opened her letters there were several invitations addressed to morgan brocklehurst asking her to parties in various parts of europe someone even wanted her to open a fête in marseilles next week larrys letter was scrawled on a piece of flimsy darling little imogen you were very sweet to me last night when i needed it very badly and you succeeded in making bambi wildly jealous which is all to the good although i had great difficulty on the evidence of last night in persuading her how miserable id been without her ill send you those pictures when i get them developed if you ever want a bed in london come and stay with us je tembrasse larry ps i thought your piece on mrs edgworths car was inspired the last letter was from the duchess my dear imogen thank you again a million times for what you did for ricky this little necklace is only a small way of expressing our gratitude do come and stay with us next time you have some time off and write and let me know how your holiday works out i liked your mr oconnor and he writes very well too i wouldnt give up hope if i were you love camilla but hope would be hope of the wrong thing sighed imogen but allowed herself a daydream of having a flat in london and giving dinner parties asking the duchess and braganzi to meet larry and bambi with matt coming early to help with the drinks and her letting him in in a black satin petticoat and him starting to kiss her so neither of them were remotely ready when the guests arrived stop it she told herself firmly but with the thought that she really would ask him to help her get a job in london she drifted off to sleep when she woke up around eight she felt a bit shaky but normal the rest of the party gathered in the bar greeted her like a long lost sister within a few minutes she realised that they were in for a decidedly stormy evening yvonne dressed in a cowlnecked skyblue dress which could easily have been worn by the virgin mary was at her most poisonous smiling smugly and queening it over everyone particularly cable whom imogen would have felt extremely sorry for if she hadnt been in such a filthy temper biting peoples heads off and casting dark spiteful looks in imogens direction now tracey had gone she had apparently made it up with nicky and insisted on sitting next to him at dinner they had just finished eating cable had only toyed with a few asparagus tips when the waiter put a shampoo sachet on the side of her plate whats that for said cable do they want me to wash my hair cleaning your fingers said nicky i prefer finger bowls theyd be quite useful for aprèssex said nicky examining the sachet they should put them in bedrooms i prefer finger bowls for that too said cable tinker tailor soldier sailor said imogen idly counting her olive stones cable shot her an uncontrollable look of hatred pity there isnt a rhyme that includes dissolute irish journalists thats what youre really after isnt it imogen pack it in said matt icily well its true said cable opening her bag and getting out her lipstick at the same time a bill fluttered out on to the table cable quickly reached out to retrieve it but matts hand closed over it first give it to me hissed cable matt smoothed out the bill and looked at it for a minute a muscle started to flicker in his cheek whats this for he said quietly a few things i bought in marseilles but this is for francs thats well over thought imogen incredulously it must have been your peacock feather dress said yvonne brightening at the prospect of a showdown i told you it was a ripoff at the time particularly as someone ripped it right off you at that party said james and roared with laughter stopping suddenly when he realised no one else was dyou mean to tell me you spent francs on one dress said matt slowly i had to have something new you couldnt turn up in any old rag to that party everyone noticed it thats the way one gets work not that kind of work how the hell dyou think were going to pay for the rest of the holiday youll have to win it back at the casino you can always cable the paper you must have made twice that on your precious braganzi story already they paused rigid with animosity as the waiter cleared away the debris leaving only clean glasses and ashtrays anyway cable went on since you decided to buy her she glared at imogen an entire new wardrobe i thought it was my turn to have a few new clothes dont you agree nicky nicky showed his teeth noncommittally he wasnt going to be drawn in children children cried yvonne dimples flashing highly delighted by the turn of events please dont spoil my party ive got something to tell you all this is a very special night for jumbo and me so youve already told us snarled cable she turned to matt i dont know why youve got so fucking tight with bread recently skip it said matt well discuss it later his face was expressionless but his hand trembled with rage as he folded up the bill and put it in his pocket thats right kiss and make up said yvonne theres going to be one hell of a row later thought imogen as the waiter arrived with an ice bucket and a bottle of champagne whats that for said nicky as the waiter removed the cork and filled up everyones glasses because i want to celebrate my first and last film part for a long time your last asked imogen when i went to the doctor about my foot the other day he was able to confirm that im expecting a baby yvonne her head on one side looked even more like the virgin mary than ever there was a long pause imogen caught nickys eye and for a terrible moment thought she was going to laugh she could see matt still gaining control of himself with an effort then his natural good nature conquered his fury with cable thats great news congratulations to you both he raised his glass in the air to baby edgworth baby edgworth said nicky and imogen dutifully i must say im jolly excited said james leaning across and giving yvonne a great splashy kiss which she immediately wiped away with her napkin cable said nothing she was drumming her fingers on the table then she got to her feet im going to the loo arent you going to congratulate me said yvonne the prospect that there might be another replica of you in the world shortly is too horrible to contemplate said cable and turned on her heel there was another long pause how horrid of her said yvonne in a choked voice then added more brightly of course shes only jealous as i told her this morning shes twentysix now her days as a model are numbered she really ought to think about settling down soon i know you dont like talking about marriage matt but im sure if she had a tiny baby of her own shed be a different person even worse i should think said nicky filling up everyones glasses i cant see cable changing nappies oh she could always use the nappy service or disposable nappies dont you agree matt whens it due asked imogen hastily may the th said yvonne im awfully glad itll be a little taurean rather than gemini so much more placid cables gemini isnt she matt she knows exactly to the day thought imogen she and james cant sleep together very much yvonne was still rabbiting on about the baby when cable came back imogen could catch an asphyxiating waft of her scent from across the table shed drawn even darker lines round her eyes she looked like a witch for a moment she stood glaring at them until nicky and james rose dutifully to their feet matt remained seated his eyes cold his mouth shut in a hard line cable slipped into her seat where are we going next she said lets drive over to antoine de la tours place were not going anywhere snapped matt we cant afford it oh dont be bloody stingy when i planned this holiday i didnt bank on you spending francs on a lot of feathers im going to bed too said yvonne with baby on the way i dont want any late nights i want to go to verdis requiem well you cant why dont we compromise said nicky reasonably lets go to the fair and win some cheap plonk at the shooting range and have a party back in our rooms only yvonne wanted to go to bed it would have been like missing the last act of a thriller after theyd been to the fair they all congregated in nickys room james who proved a surprisingly good shot had won a large teddy bear a china alsatian and two goldfish who were swimming around in the bidet imogen sat on the floor too stunned by the hostilities at dinner to say anything nicky was filling toothmugs matt lounged on the bed blowing smoke rings cable who was extremely drunk by now was pacing up and down determined to keep everyones attention she tossed back one mug of wine and was about to pour another one when matt got up and took away the bottle youve had enough he said quietly i have not she snapped back she rushed over to nicky and flung her arms round his neck im as sober as a judge arent i darling nicky grinned and pulled her on to his knee i dont care what you are he said but i like you there you are cable said triumphantly nicky says im lovely im glad someone appreciates me cable baby said matt at this moment the whole neighbourhood is appreciating you particularly the people in the next door room keep your voice down cable slipped off nickys knee and went over to the dressing table and picked up the transistor lets have some music she said turning it up full blast imogen did a striptease last night now its my turn im going to do the dance of the seven veils she kicked off her shoes and started to sway to the music theres one veil gone atta girl said nicky whats the next veil said james my watch said cable taking it off without stopping dancing a muscle was going in matts cheek cable he said in a voice of ice turn that transistor down why should i she said im sick of being ordered about veil number three coming up she started undoing the buttons of her blue shirt jamess eyes were out on stalks matt got to his feet went over to the transistor and turned it off cable seized his wrist why are you such a wet blanket go to bed and stop making a fool of yourself all right said cable defiantly ill find some decent music somewhere else she opened the window and put a foot out oh dont cable cried imogen its terribly dangerous im going said cable starting to climb down the wall you mustnt let her said imogen running to the window and catching cables hand turn on the transistor screamed cable who was hanging from the window imogen turned pleading to matt please stop her leave her alone shes just showing off he said oh let her go said nicky im fed up with her tantrums reluctantly imogen let go of her hand cable started to clamber down the wall then missed her footing and crashed to the ground are you all right called imogen worried nicky and james started to roar with laughter shes sitting in the middle of the road said imogen giggling in spite of herself i hope she doesnt get run over most unlikely said nicky its a very deserted road unfortunately for goodness sake forget her said matt shell get bored soon and come in but she might have hurt herself said imogen cable yells her head off if she even pricks her finger said matt james put on cables wig and a pair of earrings and started to do a tango with the teddy bear everyone got slightly hysterical shes all hunched up said imogen i think shes crying im going down to her not by yourself said matt taking her arm ill come with you as they turned down an alley to reach the back of the hotel imogen stumbled matt caught her and suddenly she was in his arms her eyes wide her heart pounding as if by instinct he bent his head and kissed her and once she started she found she couldnt stop she was powerless to do anything but kiss him back it was matt who had to prise her fingers away from his neck easy sweetheart weve come to look for cable not the end of the rainbow he groped for a cigarette and as the match lit up his face his features were expressionless shattered mortified imogen walked beside him how could she have let herself go like that they found cable lying in a huddle in the street she was sobbing quietly matt was across the road in a flash in the moonlight imogen could see that her ankle was grotesquely swollen matt dropped on his knees beside her oh god darling im sorry i didnt realise there was no mistaking the tenderness and concern in his voice please dont go said cable through gritted teeth and as he picked her up to carry her inside she fainted when the doctor arrived next morning he said she had broken her ankle chapter seventeen and that thought imogen dully was that in the simplest if most painful way possible cable had drawn matt back to her side again once more she was the centre of attention nicky and james mortified at having laughed at her last night brought her huge bunches of black grapes yvonne peeved at having missed a drama and furious with james for not coming to bed was only too keen to take cables part cable once her ankle was set took every opportunity to wring every ounce of pathos out of her situation the terrible thing was she told yvonne that when i was in such agony all i could hear was drunken laughter disgusting said yvonne how could they have been so heartless after last nights heartlessness cable had gone off nicky again but she insisted on matt dancing attendance on her i think i could just manage a little soup could you possibly close the shutters a little is it too soon for another pain killer shes got us over a barrel thought imogen angrily and then felt ashamed of herself matt who was looking tired and on edge drove everyone out of the bedroom in the end james as a penance was made to clean the car yvonne and nicky went waterskiing rather halfheartedly they tried to persuade imogen to join them but she said she preferred to sunbathe in fact she just wanted to be alone as she lay on the beach she wondered if shed ever been more unhappy in her life after yesterdays day in bed her suntan had settled to a deep tawny brown without any red in it her hair was streaked with gold the beach was packed with weekend trippers man after man sidled up and asked her to come for a drink or a swim she was wondering how much longer she could stand it when a silky voice said your sun lotion has spilled oh go away she snapped and looked up into the wicked brown face of antoine de la tour antoine she said her face lighting up how lovely to see you and you ma petite he sat down beside her his eyes running over her body imogen told him about cable serve her jolly well right he said and now she mangle the commiseration out of everyone i know er sort mimi has gone back to paris he added looking at her out of the corner of his eyes i am poor boy on my own ow about the two of us spending the day together imogen drew circles in the sand and decided it didnt really matter what she did now id like to antoine can i just tell the others but for reasons best known to herself she didnt go up and tell matt where she was going instead she left a hastily scrawled note at the desk hours later she sat drinking brandy on the terrace of antoines villa the moon grown slimmer since last night was pouring white light on to the sea fireflies flickered in and out of the orange trees the milky way rose like smoke from the dark hillside antoine sprawled in a hammock smoking a cigar the day had passed in a dream they had ridden along the sand for miles they had swum and they had dined in a fourstar restaurant antoine had been a constantly amusing companion but although he hadnt lifted a finger in her direction she knew he was playing a waiting game and this time she was dealing with a professional not a larky amateur like gilmore it was like spending the evening with a tiger he drained his glass of brandy stubbed out his cigar and stood over her very tall very dark lets go inside he said this isnt really happening to me thought imogen as she sat down on a huge sofa covered in leopard skins in about two minutes hes going to seduce me and i dont give a damn antoine sat down beside her he put a warm hand on her throat and slid it very slowly along her cheek to her ear and removed an earring pretty pretty girl he said would you like me to make love to you properly he swiftly removed the other earring improperly i mean oh god thought imogen its like being in the dentists waiting room the hifi began to swell soft music antoine put her earrings on the table and began to stroke her hair youre just too good to be true cant take my eyes off you sang andy williams imogen burst into tears darling ma petite please dont cry she was sobbing in his arms it is matt is it not she nodded miserably i thought that was the way the gale was blowing and what does he feel nothing nothing at all he loves cable they fight like mad but you should have heard his voice when she hurt her ankle last night antoine nodded he is strange mixture always he joke and give impression e take nothing seriously except the horses and the betting but beneath he care about things very deeply and even at oxfawd he was always onewoman man though why e choose that orrible cable i cant imagine i go to rome tomorrow he said come with me i show you nice time i make you forget she shook her head sadly it wouldnt work i give you part in my film he picked up one of the leopard skins and draped it across her shoulders and stood back with halfclosed eyes you make beautiful slave girl after that they drank a lot more brandy and antoine got out his photograph album and showed her stills from his films and lots of snaps of himself and matt at oxford i think i ought be getting back said imogen hélas said antoine ruefully im not tired i think ill drive as far as milan tonight just wait while i pack a luggage outside the hotel he took her in his arms and gave her a very thorough kissing pretty girl he said tell matthieu i behave with honour the sheep in wolfs suiting i think are you sure you dont want to come to rome imogen shook her head no thank you as she climbed the stairs she was surprised to see a light on in her bedroom she pushed open the door to find matt lying on the bed the ashtray on the bedside table was brimming with cigarette butts where the hell have you been he said it was the crack of the ringmasters lash out with antoine she faltered i left a note its nearly two oclock he said getting to his feet and towering over her his eyes were almost black did you think id turned into a pumpkin too she said with a nervous giggle you wrote that note ten hours ago i just wondered how you filled in the time we went riding and we swum and had dinner and we talked and talked matt lost his temper it was as though a thunderstorm had broken over her head seizing her by the arms his fingers biting into her flesh he swung her round to face the mirror just look at yourself her lipstick was smudged her hair rumpled the two top buttons of her dress had come undone hastily she did them up he was just kissing me goodbye she said sure he was ten hours after hed kissed you hullo and your dress is covered in fur talk yourself out of that if you can a slow anger was beginning to smoulder inside her he draped a leopard skin over my shoulders he wanted to see what id look like as a slave girl oh boy what you lack in morals you certainly make up for in imagination we were talking we were talking said imogen her voice rising youre repeating yourself kid you really want to lose it dont you first you try nicky and hes not having any so you switch to me then you try gilmore and then when that doesnt come off you fall back on antoine i dont shouted imogen you picked the wrong guy he said viciously antoinell have forgotten you by tomorrow imogen saw red why wont you listen because ive had enough of your blarney oh matt nickys so mean to me oh matt im so unhappy oh matt im such a constant nymph get out get out shrieked imogen its nothing to do with you what i do just because youre tied to cables apron strings you cant bear anyone else to have fun leave cable out of this but she was quite hysterical now all the pentup rage and jealousy of the past few days came pouring out of her she didnt know what she was saying every vicious hurtful thing that came into her head matt grabbed her wrist shut up shut up shut up now whos repeating himself she said for a moment she thought he was going to hit her in the long silence that followed she could only hear his rapid breathing and the pounding of her heart then he turned round and went out of the room imogen stood stunned and terrified trembling like a dog on guy fawkes night how could she have said all those terrible things she collapsed into a chair and sat hunched up her face in her hands then she gave a low moan her earrings were missing they were pearls and belonged to her mother they were still on the table at antoines house shed have to go and get them putting on a sweater she tiptoed downstairs the moon was setting drunks were swaying in the streets she had no difficulty finding the road but it was further than she thought she passed two men who looked at her curiously and called out to her but she ran stumbling on at last there was antoines house gleaming like an iced cake no windows open at the front she ran round to the back if she lugged one of the magnolia tubs underneath and climbed on to it she could just reach she was wriggling inside when everything round her was suddenly floodlit someone seized her by the ankle and pulled her to the ground a man grabbed her arm and started gabbling at her in french struggling and shrieking she was carried to a waiting car and thrown into the back where another man pinned her arms behind her back she was being kidnapped shed never see matt again never see her family she redoubled her struggles it was only when the car drew up outside the police station that she realised shed been arrested je ne suis pas un burglar je suis friend of antoine de la tour she said to the fat gendarme who was sitting behind a desk but he just laughed and threw her into a cell at first she screamed and rattled the bars but the fat gendarme came up and leered at her he got out his keys his meaning was quite plain imogen shrunk away oh non non please not that ferme ta gueule encore she sat on the narrow bed trying to stifle her sobs no one would ever find her she would be there for years like the count of monte cristo it was suffocatingly hot she dripped with sweat but was too shattered to think of taking off her sweater the blazing row with matt the horror of her arrest were beginning to take effect she couldnt stop shaking the hours crawled by light was beginning to seep through the tiny window when there was a commotion outside she heard a familiar voice matt she shrieked he came straight over and took her hands through the bars imogen are you all right his face was ashen oh please get me out of here they think im a burglar i was trying to climb into antoines villa to get my earrings she didnt understand what matt was saying to the fat gendarme but he spoke very slowly and distinctly waving his press card back and forward and the tone of his voice put a chill even into her heart she was released in two minutes she fell sobbing into his arms its all right youre safe everythings all right it was light in the streets as he drove back to the hotel how did you find me she asked in a small voice as soon as i cooled down i realised id come on too strong i came back to apologise and found youd done a bunk i toured the town for a bit then i tried antoines house and found the place seething with police and alsatians it was simple after that she hung her head im dreadfully sorry you seem to have spent your holiday getting me out of trouble skip it i had no right to shout at you my lousy irish temper im afraid yesterday was a bit trying cable upstaging like nobodys business nicky sulking james and yvonne at each others throats poor matt said imogen you havent had much of a holiday have you then she tried again we werent doing anything antoine and i truthfully we werent it doesnt matter what you get up to is your own affair but lets drop it shall we this weary acceptance was far worse than his earlier blinding rage chapter eighteen as soon as she got back to the hotel she went to bed lying for a long time in a state of coma before she fell asleep when she woke it was afternoon listlessly she dressed and wandered along the passage to cables room chaos met her eyes clothes of every colour of the rainbow littered the bed suitcases lay all over the floor what are you doing said imogen aghast what does it look as though im doing snapped cable packing of course since youre here you may as well help me get those dresses out of the wardrobe take the coathangers too this beastly hotel can afford them and put them in this case my foot is hurting so much i cant tell you she sat down on the bed but where are you going said imogen cable gave one of her sly malicious smiles all roads lead to rome darling but im going by way of milan imogen looked horrified but thats where antoine is right first time said cable approvingly youre getting perceptive in your old age rebels collecting me in halfanhour but i thought you loathed antoine did you now well im entitled to change my mind i never said he wasnt attractive and hes mad for me which is half the battle he telephoned this morning absolutely gibbering my dear and said ever since he met me on wednesday he couldnt get me out of his mind he knew i wasnt happy with matt if i came to rome hed give me the best time in the world dont forget those bikinis hanging from the window hes going to give me a part in his film as a slave girl and what about matt cables face hardened dont talk to me about matt she said stonily im through with him for good if anyone deserves his comeuppance its that guy but whats he done said imogen hes impossible thats what he was in the most vile temper all yesterday quite unsympathetic about my foot which incidentally is absolute agony then he swans off for most of the night god knows what he was up to that blasted casino i suppose then he comes in at some ungodly hour this morning just as id taken two more sleeping pills put all those bottles in my makeup case darling its that trunk over there where was i youd just taken some pills so i had well i was very uptight so i began to tell him a few hometruths very gently mind you and do you know what he said imogen shook her head he said why dont you shut up about your bloody foot it would have been better for everyone if youd broken your jaw imogen buried her face in the bottles to hide a smile and then without giving me a chance to retaliate he charges out of the room to watch some forest fire thats broken out in the mountains there was a knock on the door cable jumped nervously answer it will you she said a sleek black face appeared round the door it was rebel oh hullo said cable with relief i wont be long could you take these cases down im afraid youll have to make two journeys as soon as rebel had left the room imogen pleaded you cant leave matt like this ok so he blew his top but hell calm down hes worth a million of antoine antoines just a lovely playboy and im a lovely playgirl said cable wriggling into a green dress that looked faintly familiar but matt really loves you imogen was almost in tears he shows it in a most mysterious way said cable but hell be shattered wont he just said cable gleefully men hate it so much more when you take off with one of their mates well if he loves me so much he can come and get me and this time itll be marriage or nothing she got an envelope out of the chest of drawers ive written him this letter telling him everything she said spraying it with scent will you be sure to give it him rebel appeared at the door you can carry me down this time darling said cable rebel picked her up lovely said cable feeling his muscles and smiling up at him i dont think well bother to go as far as milan fear and desolation crept slowly through imogens stomach like a cold wind she went downstairs and ordered a coke madame came waddling over in carpet slippers ave you seen monsieur oconnor she asked putting the coke tin and a glass on the table imogen explained about the forest fire ah said madame well i ave his plane tickets tickets said imogen slowly it was as though another layer of ice was being placed over her heart madame nodded despondently tonight he go i think e meant to take that one back to london for her foot but she seems to ave gone already always monsieur oconnor stay for two week but this year i think he not happy mindlessly picking up her coke tin imogen left madame in full spate and went out into the street she was numb with horror it was like some terrible dream to be suddenly faced with life without matt a grey drab expanse stretching to infinity tears streaming down her face oblivious of the people in the street she walked blindly to the far end of the cove and stood there for a long time looking at the sea frothing like ginger beer on the sand a car was hooting insistently blasted french why did they always drive on their horns imogen yelled a voice she looked up as the white mercedes drew alongside her matt leant across jump in he said theres something i want to show you in a daze she got in he looked at her closely poor little love you look done in his face and hands were grimy and his eyes bloodshot but otherwise he seemed in excellent spirits but not for long thought imogen cables letter was burning a hole in her pocket as he swung the car off the coast road and headed for the mountains she said matt ive got something to tell you and theres something he said taking the coke tin from her and helping himself to a great swig of it that i must tell you in spite of her hundred per cent guaranteed sun protection lotion yvonne is peeling like a new york tickertape welcome its coming off her in festoons imogen couldnt help giggling how was the fire she asked raging merrily but they expect a storm tonight so no ones very worried about it i got a good story though portlespins fire brigade spent all morning bravely fighting the fire but come lunchtime like all good frogs they downed tools and returned to the town when they got back three hours later they found their fire engine burnt to a frazzle his shoulders shook shed never seen him so happy it wrung her heart oh damn damn cable they drove past vineyards and olive groves shimmering like tinfoil past braganzis fortress and up into the mountains when theyd gone as far up as the car could go matt got out come on he said taking her hand and leading her up a steep path to the top below them stretched a mountainous waste of old testament country the sun moved in and out of the clouds lighting up village and farms to the right like a judgement on an ungodly people a great furnace was licking over the hillside bits of ash fluttered like snowflakes through the air its beautiful breathed imogen i always make a pilgrimage up here every year he said its sort of insurance that ill come back again the highest rock was smothered in undergrowth matt pulled away the brambles and the wild lavender to reveal a plaque with a list of names on it who were they asked imogen the local resistance fighters in the last war he said i ought to add your name oughtnt i my name she said in a stifled voice yes sweetheart for resisting the advances of three of the most formidable wolves in the business not that you were exactly resisting larry the other night she had a feeling he was laughing at her again what are you talking about she muttered he sat down in a hollow in the rocks and pulled her down beside him matt she said desperately theres something i must tell you tell away then he put his hand under her hair and was gently stroking the back of her neck dont do that she sobbed ive got a letter for you from cable she pulled it out of her pocket and almost flung it at him he picked it up studied it lazily and tore it into little pieces which the wind scattered in an instant now arrest me for being a litterbug he said i know whats in that letter i dont even have to open it cable driven to distraction by my appalling behaviour and lack of consideration has pushed off to rome with antoine imogen looked at him in bewilderment a faint hope flickering inside her i tried not to get uptight about you and antoine he said but in the end i knew id go crazy if i didnt have it out with him so i rang milan he gave me a rundown on last night corroborating your story word for word he said you were enchanting but entirely preoccupied with someone else imogen blushed im sorry i was so bloody to you last night little one its that coleridge thing about being wroth with one we love working like madness in the brain but im glad it happened it showed me how hung up on you id got without realising it i never felt a fraction of that whitehot murderous rage when i caught cable being unfaithful his voice was as soft as an irish mist and as he took her face in his hands they smelt of wood smoke and wild lavender funny little imogen you were like a little girl running after the rest of us crying wait for me and he bent his head and kissed her very gently next moment she flung her arms round his neck oh matt oh matt much later she said but i dont understand i thought antoine and cable loathed each other did they animosity as intense as that often means the other thing neither will trust the other farther than they can throw them which seems a good basis for a relationship but shes expecting you to follow her shes got a long wait in front of her then if you keep turning a light switch on and off on and off like cable did the fuse blows in the end theres nothing left a suspicion crossed imogens mind matt you didnt put antoine up to it he grinned not exactly lets say i planted the seed and what about nicky rumour has it that nicky has been casting covetous eyes at some nymphette at the waterskiing school and traceys due back this evening so i dont think hell be inconsolable for very long which leaves you and me imogen looked down at her hands but youre going back his face became serious ive got to darling the foreign desk rang me this morning this business in perus going to explode at any moment they want me to fly out tomorrow imogen went pale but you might get hurt not i matt the cat with nine lives besides ive got something to come home for now havent i i got a ticket for you too im sorry to rot up your holiday but i cant leave you here alone at the mercy of every passing wolf and gendarme youre taking me back to london with you she asked incredulously everything was crowding in on her she couldnt take so much happiness at once matt picked up the coke tin that had fallen on to the ground and wrenched off the silver ring used to open it you can go home to yorkshire if you like or better still he looked at her under drooping lashes you can shack up in my flat and look after basil and make up my mind where you want to go for a honeymoon imogen opened her mouth and shut it again its all right dont rush into anything kick the idea round for a bit you might not like being hitched to a journalist its a rough life but i warn you i dont give up easily anyway people keep telling me i ought to hang on to you gilmore antoine the duchess braganzi tracey youve got a lot of fans sweetheart i have she said in amazement yep and im the biggest one he picked up her left hand and slid the cocacola ring on to her weddingring finger then he pulled her into his arms and kissed her i love you he said softly because youre gentle and good and because i know you love me he looked at his watch christ wed better step on it if were going to catch that plane imogen grumbled and snuggled up to him wanting to be kissed some more come on said matt pulling her to her feet its a great day for the irish but i cant answer for my actions if we stay here necking much longer and i cant have you getting blasé as he drove back into the town she sat her fingers clutched over the cocacola ring halfstunned with wonder at what was happening as he stopped the car outside the hotel however she looked at him with troubled eyes matt are you sure youre over cable darling he said flinging his arms out in a fair imitation of al jolson id run a million miles from one of her smiles come here if you dont believe me it was a few seconds before they realised yvonne was tapping angrily on the window matt matthew matt turned round yes yvonne looked in horror suddenly realising it was imogen he was kissing what on earths she doing just getting into training yvonne pursed her lips wheres cable im not quite sure well most of my wardrobe seems to be missing the end
