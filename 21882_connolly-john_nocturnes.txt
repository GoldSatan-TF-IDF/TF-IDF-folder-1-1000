john connolly nocturnes for ad√®le who will always be missed the cancer cowboy rides i the rutted track was playing hell with jerry schneiders shocks he could feel every cleft and furrow ramming hard into the base of his spine and shooting up to the top of his skull so that by the time the farmhouse came into view he already had the beginnings of a raging headache migraines were his affliction and he hoped this wasnt about to be the start of one of them he had work to do and those damn things left him near puking on his bed just wishing to die jerry didnt much care for the detour to the benson farm at the best of times they were religious nutcases the whole bunch of em a family of seven living pretty much apart from the rest of the world keeping mostly to themselves except when they headed into town to buy supplies or when jerry made his twiceweekly call to pick up a load of freerange eggs and a selection of their homemade cheeses jerry thought the cheeses stank to high heaven and he only ate his eggs scrambled and with enough salt to empty the dead sea but the new wealthy who flocked to the state during both summer and winter swore by the taste of the bensons cheese and eggs and were prepared to pay top dollar for them at vern smolleys place vern was a smart one jerry would give him that hed spotted the gap in the market straight off and transformed the rear of his general store into a kind of gourmets paradise jerry sometimes had trouble even finding a space in which to park verns lot being filled to the brim with lexuses salesroompolished mercedes convertibles and in winter the kind of snazzy wds that only rich people drove with a smattering of designer mud on them for that authentic country look the bensons would have no truck with folks like that their old ford was held together with string and faith and their clothes were thrift store when they werent hand made by ma benson or one of the girls in fact jerry sometimes wondered how they squared selling their food to the kind of people they regarded as being on a oneway express ride to hell he wasnt about to ask bruce benson himself though jerry tried to avoid having much conversation at all with bruce since the old man used any kind of opening as an opportunity to peddle his own particular brand of godhugging for some reason bruce seemed to believe that jerry schneider could still be saved jerry didnt share bruces faith he liked drinking smoking and screwing around and last he heard those pursuits didnt much enter into the bensons scheme for salvation so twice each week jerry would drive his truck up that migraine minefield of a track pick up the eggs and cheese with the minimum of fuss or talk then head back down the track at a slightly slower pace since vern would take breakages of more than percent out of jerrys fee jerry schneider never felt as if he had quite settled back into life in colorado not since hed come back from the east coast to look after his mother that was the curse of being an only child there was no one to share the burden nobody to take some of the strain the old woman was becoming forgetful and she had taken some bad falls so jerry did what he had to do and returned to his childhood home now it seemed like every week some new misfortune befell her twisted ankles bruised ribs torn muscles those kinds of injuries would take some of the steam out of jerry and he was near thirty years younger than his mama inflict them on a woman of seventyfive with osteoporosis in her legs and arthritis in her elbows and it was a miracle that she was still standing truth to tell things had slackened back east since and jerry was working short hours before he made the decision to move home if he hadnt moved then pretty soon he would have been working a second job in a bar to make ends meet and he was just too beat to consider putting in seventy hour weeks simply to live anyway he had no real attachments in the city there was a girl but they were coasting he didnt figure shed be too cut up when he told her he was leaving and he was right in fact she looked kind of relieved but returning here had reminded him of a lot of the reasons why hed left to begin with ascension was a small town dependent for its prosperity on outsiders and it resented that dependence even while it concealed its true feelings with smiles and handshakes and it wasnt like boulder which jerry liked because it was a little enclave of liberalism most of the time folks in boulder seemed just one step away from raising their own flag and declaring independence people in ascension by contrast were proud to live in a state with enough radioactive material under the ground to make it glow in the night jerry figured that like the great wall of china parts of colorado could be seen from outer space the rockies gently luminescing in the darkness he suspected that folks in ascension would be proud to think that their state acted as a kind of radioactive beacon for god or aliens or l ron hubbard it was worse farther south in places like colorado springs down by the usaf academy but ascension still remained a bastion of blind patriotism jerry wondered too if people grew stranger as they got closer to utah like the mormons were putting something into the water or the air that might explain the bensons and the other religious types like them who seemed to have gravitated toward the area maybe they just got lost on the way to salt lake city or ran out of gas or it could be they thought they were already in utah and that the state was just joshing with them by making them pay taxes to colorado jerry couldnt figure the bensons out but he wished theyd devote a little of that time spent praying to fixing up the road to their farm the track seemed tougher to negotiate this week a consequence of the cold weather that had already begun to settle on the state pretty soon the first snows would come and then bruce benson would have to plow the route to his house himself if he were planning to continue making money out of cheese and eggs verns other suppliers all made their own deliveries but not bruce benson he seemed to equate his hatred of sin with a hatred of the town of ascension and preferred to keep his contact with the population at large to the absolute minimum his wife was the same way jerry schneider couldnt recall ever meeting a more hatchetfaced bitch and hed been around some still bruce must have plucked up the courage to fill her purse at least four times although jerry would lay even money hed kept the lights off and the windows blacked out while he did it because they had four kids three girls and a boy then again the kids were all goodlooking maybe with a little of bruce to them but not so much that it would bother anyone so maybe bruce had seeded up someone betterlooking than his wife the old hag probably sent him off with her blessing grateful not to have to do something she might enjoy the boy zeke was the youngest he had three sisters the eldest of whom ronnie was beautiful enough to make jerry listen to bensons ravings for a time if she happened to be out in the yard doing chores sometimes the sun would catch her just right and jerry would see the shape of her through her long skirt her legs slightly apart like a pitched tent inviting him inside and the rays gilding the muscles on her calves and thighs jerry suspected that bruce knew what he was doing but chose to ignore it in the hope that jerry might see the light jerry was hoping to see something else entirely and wondered if ronnie might be prepared to show it if he got her alone and away from her daddys influence for a time she occasionally smiled at him in a way that suggested she was suffering the frustrations that a goodlooking young woman like her would surely feel cut off as she was from any outlet for her appetites the children were educated at home by their parents and jerry figured that the sexual component of that education could pretty much be summed up as dont do it and especially not with jerry schneider educated at home their ailments kind of treated at homejerry just hoped that nothing serious ever happened to any of the family because the bensons didnt hold with doctors or medical interventionand their lives revolving only around one another and a miserable distant god it would be some time before the networks got around to basing a comedy on the benson family one of bruce bensons brothers also lived with them his name was royston and jerry figured him for mildly retarded he didnt say much and his head was always nodding like one of those little dogs that some people kept on the dashboard of their car but he seemed fairly harmless there was talk around town that hed once tried to feel up verns mother in the store a couple of years back although jerry had never worked up the courage to ask vernor his motherif this was true maybe that was another reason why bruce benson never came down to the store nothing sours relations between folk like the dimwit brother of one party coming over all italian on the upright baptist mother of the second party jerry passed through the main gates to the benson farm instinctively turning down the volume on the truck radio since bruce didnt appreciate music much and certainly not the stuff that was pouring out of jerrys speakers just now gloria scotts sultry vocals backed up by the late great barry whites production skills jerry liked the old walruss touch he might not have been quite as out there as isaac and he could legitimately be blamed for setting the tone for the limp insipid stuff that passed for modern r amp b but there was something about those massed strings that made jerry want to find some willing young thing and mess up the sheets with baby oil and cheap champagne he wondered if ronnie benson had ever heard of barry white as far as jerry knew the bensons didnt even listen to the crazy preachers at the end of the dial the ones who testified to the love of god yet seemed to hate just about everyone or at least the kind of people that jerry knew and liked introducing the benson kids to barry white would probably kill the old man stone dead and drive the daughters into some kind of frenzy discreetly jerry turned the volume back up a notch the bensons always moved their chickens into a big barn as soon as winter came in fact bruce had told jerry last week that theyd be inside next time he came but as he approached the chicken runs on the right jerry could see small bundles of white scattered upon the ground they lay still the wind ruffled their feathers some so that they seemed to be trembling on the ground but it was only a false impression of life the sight made jerry stop short leaving the engine idling he stepped from the truck and walked to the wire close by lay the body of one of the bensons chickens jerry leaned in to touch it pressing gently into its flesh with the tips of his fingers black fluid instantly oozed from its beak and its eyes and jerry withdrew his fingers hurriedly rubbing them on the seam of his pants in an effort to cleanse them of any potential contagion all of the chickens were dead but no animal had done this there was no blood upon the feathers and no damage that jerry could see in the far corner of the run jerry spotted the bensons rooster strutting among his dead concubines his red coxcomb clearly visible as he pecked at the ground hunting for the last grains to stave off his hunger somehow he had survived the slaughter jerry leaned in and turned off the engine of the truck everything here was wrong there was desolation on the wind he walked across the yard the door to the benson house was wide open held that way by a triangle of wood at its base he stood at the base of the steps leading up to the porch and called out bruce bensons name hello he said anybody home there was no reply the door led directly into the bensons kitchen there was food on the table but even from outside jerry could tell it was rotting i should just call the cops i should call them now then wait for them to come but jerry knew that he couldnt do that instead he went back to his truck tipped open the glove compartment and took the clothwrapped ruger from under the accumulation of maps restaurant menus and unpaid parking fines the gun wouldnt change anything not now but he felt better for having it in his hand the kitchen smelled bad the dinner of chicken and biscuits looked as if it had been there for a couple of days jerry recalled the dead fowl in the run and the black substance that had oozed from the mouth of the bird hed touched christ if the chickens had somehow become contaminated and that contamination had spread to the familyhis thoughts went to the eggs that he had been collecting and delivering to town for the past six months and to the chicken that benson had given to him as a thanksgiving present less than a week before jerry almost threw up there and then but he regained his composure in all his life hed never heard of anyone dying from a poultry disease except maybe that flu they had over in asia and what killed the bensons chickens didnt look like any flu jerry had ever seen he checked the living roomno tv just a couple of easy chairs an overstuffed couch and some religious pictures on the wallsand the downstairs bathroom they were both empty standing at the bottom of the stairs jerry gave one more holler before making his way up to the bedrooms the smell was stronger here jerry took his handkerchief from his pocket and jammed it against his nose and mouth he already knew what to expect hed worked for a time in a slaughterhouse in chicago when he was younger one that wasnt too fussy about the quality of its meat jerry had not eaten a hamburger since bruce benson and his wife were in the first bedroom lying beneath a big white quilt he was wearing his pajamas and she was dressed in a blue cotton nightdress there was black fluid on their clothing and on the bed and more of it caked around the lower half of their faces bruce bensons eyes were half open and his cheeks were streaked with black tears from their expressions jerry figured theyd gone out hard even in death the pain remained fixed upon them as though they were models carefully sculpted by a disturbed artist the three daughters were in the next bedroom although there were bunks in one corner the girls had congregated on the big bed in the center of the room jerry guessed that this was ronnies bed she held her younger sisters cradled in her arms one on each side there was more black blood here and ronnie was no longer beautiful jerry looked away the youngest child zeke was in a little box room at the far end of the hallway he had been covered up with a sheet first to go jerry thought when someone still had enough strength to shroud him after he died but if there was strength to do that why not call for help the bensons had a telephone and even with their peculiar beliefs they must have realized that something was very wrong whole families didnt die this way not in colorado not anywhere civilized this was like the plague jerry turned to leave the boys room and a hand touched his shoulder he spun around the gun raised and let out a kind of tortured shriek later he would describe it as a womans scream a sound such as he never thought he would make but he wasnt ashamed like he told the cops anyone would have done the same theyd seen what hed seen royston benson stood before him poor dumb roy who loved god because his brother told him that god was merciful that god would look out for him if he prayed hard and lived a good life and didnt go around feeling up other peoples mothers in grocery stores except god hadnt looked out for roy benson didnt matter how much he prayed or kept his hands to himself his fingers were swollen and blackened and his face was covered in dark tumors red at the edges and dark at the center one masked the entire left half of his face closing the eye to a slit and disfiguring his lips so that they turned up at one side in the semblance of a grin jerry could make out what was left of his teeth barely held in place by his rotting gums and his distorted tongue flicking in the cavern of his mouth black fluid flowed like oil from his nostrils and his ears and the corners of his mouth pooling on his chin before dripping onto the floor he said something but jerry couldnt understand what it was all he knew was that roy benson was rotting away before him and crying because he couldnt understand why this was happening to him he reached out for jerry but jerry backed away he didnt want roy touching him again no matter what take it easy roy he said be cool im going to call for help its going to be okay but roy shook his head the movement causing snot and tears and black blood to spray jerrys face and shirt again he tried to form words but they wouldnt come and then he was jerking and spasming like something was trying to burst out from inside of him he fell to the floor his head banging against the boards with enough force to dislodge his dead nephews toys from their shelves his hands scraped at the wood wrenching the nails from the tips of his fingers then as jerry watched the tumors on his face began to spread colonizing the last fragments of untainted skin rushing to meet one another before their host died and as the last trace of white disappeared from his face roy benson stopped struggling and lay still jerry staggered away from the dead man he stumbled to the door found the bathroom and vomited into the sink he continued retching until only spittle and bad air came up then looked at himself in the mirror half expecting to see that terrible blackness erasing his own features just as it had consumed roy benson but that was not what he saw instead he turned and looked at the cigarette in the ashtray by the toilet the ashtray was filled with butts but this one was still smoking the last tendril of nicotine dissipating as jerry watched nobody in this house smoked nobody smoked or drank or swore nobody did anything except work and pray and over the last few days rot away like old meat and he knew then why the bensons had not called for help someone was here he realized someone was here to watch them die ii t en days later and two thousand miles to the east lloyd hopkins said the words that nobody wanted to say were going to have to replace that plow hopkins was wearing his new uniform trousers which seemed to him to be fitting a little more snugly than they should have he was wearing new pants because one change of clothes was in the wash while the second had been ripped to shreds during a recent search for a pair of hikers the hikers were reported missing by jed wheaton the owner of easton s sole motel after they failed to return from a scoot around broad mountain two days earlier as it turned out the couplefrom new york wouldnt you know itwere apparently overcome by lust for each other while on the trail and had checked into a lodge under assumed names because they thought it would spice up the occasion they didnt bother to tell jed wheaton so when they didnt come back to their room that night he called the station house and chief lopez rounded up the rescue team which included lloyd hopkins his only fulltime patrol officer to begin searching first thing next morning they were still out on the mountain when the couple their appetites under control again turned up at the motel to settle their bill and collect the rest of their stuff under instructions from the chief jed had refused to let them leave until lopez got back to town and gave them the kind of dressingdown that stopped just short of beating them to a pulp and hanging them from the towns welcome sign as an example to others now hopkins lopez and errol crisp easton s new mayor were all standing in the garage of the municipal building looking at the towns sole ancient snowplow maybe we could get someone to patch it up said errol that worked before lopez snorted yesterday it bled oil like someone had just stabbed it with a spear today we cant even get it started if it was a horse youd shoot it errol gave one of his long sighs the ones he used whenever the idea of spending money was raised he was the first black mayor easton had ever elected and he was trying to step lightly in his first month on the job the last thing he wanted was people complaining that he was spending money like a freed slave at sixty errol was the oldest of the three men in the garage lopez who didnt look even the onesixteenth spanish that he claimed to be was twelve years younger lloyd hopkins meanwhile looked like a teenager a chubby teenager maybe but a teenager nonetheless errol wasnt even sure if the kid was legally allowed to drink the councils not going to like it said errol the councils going to like it a whole lot less when its members cant see the town for the snow said lopez the councils not going to like it when businesses start complaining that nobody can park on the street or that folks are falling off the curb and breaking their legs because they cant tell where the sidewalk ends and the road begins for crying out loud errol this thing doesnt owe us anything its older than lloyd here lloyd shifted his thighs trying to work some space between the fabric of his pants and his skin when that didnt work he tried to discreetly extract the material from the crevices into which it had lodged itself the hell is wrong with you son asked errol he took a couple of steps back from the young policeman just in case whatever was ailing him could jump sorry said lloyd these trousers dont fit right why are you wearing them they dont fit right lopez answered hes wearing them because he was too vain to admit that hed put on a little weight since the last time he had to buy new pants thirtyfour inches my ass i told you when you were ordering them that you ought to get measured up errol here will see thirtyfour again before your waist does lloyd reddened but didnt reply dont worry said lopez well get you another pair put it down to experience you better put it down to miscellaneous expenses said errol i dont want people asking how come we buying pants like theys a shortage on the way shit son i got a twoyearold grandson dont need two pairs of pants in a month and hes growing like grass in summertime two years old even he knows when a pair of pants aint going to fit him lopez grinned and let the mayor ride on lloyd for a while he knew what was going on even if lloyd didnt errol would get himself worked up in a lather over a fortydollar pair of blues so he could feel better about spending one hundred times that amount on a new plow once hed finished lopez would walk with him back to his office and theyd work out the details of the purchase there would be a new plow in the garage in a week lloyd might even have trousers that fitted him by then still the young patrolman could be forgiven his little idiosyncrasies he was honest diligent smarter than he looked except when it came to his weight and he didnt claim overtime lopez would have a talk with him about his diet lloyd tended to listen to his superior on most things who knew maybe those trousers could end up fitting him after all it might take a while but lopez viewed lloyd as a work in progress in any number of ways easton was a typical new hampshire town not quite pretty but not ugly either a little too far away from the big winter playgrounds to enjoy much of a tourist trade from them but close enough for the locals to hop in a car and spend a day on the slopes if they chose it had a couple of bars a main street on which more than half of the businesses made a reasonable income yearround and one motel which was as much a hobby as a business for its owner its school had an adequate football team and a basketball team that most people preferred not to mention it also had a sense of civic pride out of all proportion to its apparently modest aspect a conscientious if frugal town council a police department that consisted of just two fulltime cops and a handful of parttimers and a crime rate just slightly below the average for a town of its size all told the chief sometimes reflected there were better places to live but there were also far far worse frank lopez the chiefs father worked as an accountant in easton from until when he retired and moved to santa barbara with his wife his son jim had by that time been a policeman in manchester for almost twenty years in the chiefs job in easton became vacant and jim lopez applied for it and got it he had his quarter century under his belt and while he didnt want to leave law enforcement he fancied a quieter life for himself his marriage had broken up ten years previously childless but also without bitterness and easton his hometown offered him familiarity comfort and a place in which to settle comfortably into middle age the job didnt tax him unduly he was liked and respected and he had met a woman whom he suspected he loved all told jim lopez was happier than he had ever been the easton motel was quiet that week after the fuss about the hikers jed wheaton was kind of grateful not to have too many guests to worry about things would pick up again once the snows came when easton usually enjoyed a small trickledown from the winter tourist trade it would still be a bad year but something might be salvaged from it of the twelve rooms only a couple were currently occupied there were two young japanese tourists in one who giggled a lot and took too many photographs but kept their room so tidy that maria the maid said she felt like she was making more of a mess than they were they folded their towels didnt leave hairs in the shower or the sink and even made their own beds wouldnt it be great if everybody who stayed here was like them maria asked jed that morning after she came back from checking the rooms yeah wonderful he replied i could fire you and spend the money i saved on making my old age more comfortable tcah maria dismissed him with a flick of her wrist youd miss me if i wasnt here you like having a pretty young girl around maria was puerto rican big and ribald and happily married to the towns best mechanic she might have been a pretty girl once but now she looked like shed just eaten one maria worked hard was never late or badtempered took care of the desk and the reservations and generally had more to do with keeping the motel running from day to day than jed did in turn he paid her well and didnt complain when she used her knowledge of the inner workings of the vending machines to feed herself the occasional free candy bar as if to test her skills and jeds tolerance maria walked over to the big red candy machine in the corner of the office put her ear to its side listening to it like a safecracker would to a safe then gave it a sharp slap with the palm of her hand a snickers bar fell from its perch into the tray how do you do that asked jed not for the first time i try but i just end up hurting my hand then as if realizing that he was effectively condoning theft against himself he continued and if youre going to do that at least dont do it in front of me its like robbing a bank and asking for a receipt maria sat down and unwrapped the candy bar you want some no thank you why am i even saying thank you i paid for the damn thing whatd it cost you a whole seventyfive cents its the principle yah yah yah the principle some principle costs seventyfive cents even with what you pay me i could buy me a lot of principles yeah well maybe you should consider investing in some like not stealing for one its not stealing you see me doing it and you dont say nothing thats giving not stealing jed left her to it he reviewed the guest register they had nobody else checking in that day then two confirmeds for thursday and five for friday combined with those who might follow the signs from the highway when they tired of driving it didnt look so bad for the rest of the week guy in twelve maria said what about him maria stood walked to the door to check that there was nobody around then leaned in toward jed i dont like him the guest in room had arrived in darkness two nights before jeds son phil who was home for a couple of days from college and didnt mind earning a few extra bucks on the desk had checked him in why he wont let you steal his candy maria didnt reply immediately usually she was quick to make her feelings known jed put his pen down and looked serious he do something to you he asked maria shook her head so what is it hes got a bad feeling about him she said i tell you i went to clean his room the drapes were closed but there was no sign on the door i knocked heard nothing so i opened the door and he was justsitting there on the bed it didnt look slept in he was just there his hands on his knees facing the door like hed been waiting for me to come in i said i was sorry and he said no it was all right i could come in i said no ill come back but he insisted he said he didnt sleep so good at night and that he might try to have a nap later in the morning so hed prefer if i cleaned the room now but it didnt look like there was nothing to clean so i said to him what do you want me to do he told me hed used some towels in the bathroom that was all so i got some clean towels and went to the bathroom he was still sitting on the bed but i could see him watching me he was smiling and i felt like there was something wrong for the first time jed noticed that maria had not eaten the candy bar it remained untouched in her hand she saw him looking at it then carefully wrapped it and put it on the counter i dont want it now she said jed thought that she was about to cry thats okay he said ill put it in the refrigerator you can eat it whenever you want he picked it up and placed it carefully on a shelf in the little unit behind the counter go on he said you were telling me about twelve she nodded i went into the bathroom and all of the towels were on the floor when i picked them up i think there was blood on them blood i think so yes but it was black like oil maybe it was oil jed wasnt sure which was worse blood or some jackass using his towels to mop up an oil leak from his car maybe i dont know i got them in a bag in the laundry i can show you well well see so thats it dirty towels maria raised her hand she was not finished yet i put on my gloves and picked up the towels i was going to take them outside when i looked at the toilet the seat was up i always check anyway just in case you know it needs to be cleaned there was more black in there like hed puked it up from inside him or worse it was all over the bowl i turned around and he was standing beside me i think i cried out because he frightened me i almost fell but he reached out so that i didnt slip he told me he was sorry that he should have warned me about the bathroom i been ill he said real sick his breath smelled bad you need a doctor i said no no doctor no cure for what ails me maam but i feel like im on the mend i just needed to get some stuff out of my system then he let me go i picked up the towels replaced them with clean ones and flushed the bowl i was going to scrub it but he told me i didnt have to do that when i left he was just sitting on the bed like he was when i arrived i asked him did he want me to pull the drapes and he said no he was sensitive to the light i closed the door and left him there jed thought for a time so hes been sick he said at last nothing to stop a sick man renting a room i guess though i figure wed better be careful with those towels you said you wore your gloves right i always wear my gloves the hiv the aids im always real careful good said jed thats good he nodded to himself ill go down and check on him myself once im done here maybe convince him to let doc bradley take a look at him doesnt sound to me like hes on the mend he leaves black blood in the bowl doesnt sound like hes getting better at all if hes doing that he told maria to head home early spend some time with her grandchild he would roust phil if there was anything that needed to be done sure phil might whine some but he was a good kid jed would miss him when he headed back to school at the end of the week he wouldnt be seeing him again until after christmas since phil was spending the holidays with his mom in seattle jed consoled himself with the thought that the boy would be back before new years and if the choice were his own phil would probably have preferred easton to seattle anyway most of his buddies would be back for the holiday season in the hopes of getting a little skiing in and phil was as good as any of them on the slopes in the meantime hed talk to the guy in and try to figure out if there was anything that needed to be done he might even send him on his way since there would be nothing worse for business than a stranger dying in one of his rooms maria thanked him before she left he could see that she was badly shaken although he wasnt certain why sure finding bloodied towels and a bloodied bowl in a room occupied by a sick man wasnt nice for anyone but theyd had to mop up a lot worse in the past hell there was a bachelor party that stopped off a couple of years back and left jed thinking it might be easier just to burn down the motel and rebuild it instead of cleaning it jed drew the register toward him and ran his finger down the page until he came to the name of the man in carson he read aloud buddy carson well buddy looks like you may be checking out sooner than you think in more ways than one he thought although the man who gave his name as buddy carson had arrived at the motel only two nights before he had been drifting around easton and its environs for more than a week ever since he left colorado two thousand miles and hed covered it in less than two days buddy didnt need to sleep more than an hour or two at most and didnt eat much other than candy bars and sweet things sometimes he wondered about his eating habits but it didnt occupy him for long buddy had more important things to worry about like easing his pain and feeding the appetite of the thing that dwelt within him on monday shortly after crossing the vermontnew hampshire state line he came across link frazier changing the wheel on his truck and knew it was time to begin again link was seventy moved like he was fifty and came on to young women like he was seventeen but changing a tire was still a damn chore link used to own reeds bar in easton but back then it was called the missing link on account of the fact that his wife used to joke that whenever there was hard work to be done lincoln frazier was always unaccountably absent when myra died ten years ago some of the spark had gone out of link and he sold the bar to eddy reed on condition that eddy change the name of the bar to something else the joke seemed less funny now that myra was gone links knees werent what they once were so he was kind of pleased when the red dodge charger pulled up in front of him and the driver got out he was younger than link decades younger and wore faded blue jeans and an antique black leather vest over his equally faded denim shirt from beneath the frayed ends of his jeans peeked the pointed toes of a pair of snakeskin cowboy boots his hair was black and long slicked back against his head with the parallel tracks of a widetoothed comb visible among the strands the hair was thin though and the white of his skull gleamed between the rows like rainwater shining on a rutted mud track the driver reached into his car and removed a battered straw cowboy hat from the passenger seat then placed it carefully on his head an oval of white material was stuck to the front of the hat it looked as if it had been torn from a pair of coveralls the kind worn by auto shop mechanics and written on it was the word buddy in red cursive script as the dodges owner drew closer link got his first good look at the mans face slightly shadowed though it was by his hat his cheeks were very gaunt so that link could see the tendons move as his jaws worked chewing at something in the corner of his mouth his lips were deep red almost black and his eyeballs bulged slightly in their sockets as though he were slowly being choked by a pair of unseen hands he was almost ugly yet he carried himself with a kind of grace there was a purposefulness about him despite the laidback air his clothing and manner seemed calculated to communicate you having some trouble he asked his voice had a distinct southern twang to it although link had the feeling he was exaggerating it a little the way some men will do when they believe that a certain quality adds to their charm took a nail back a ways said link flatter than a pancake thats for sure said the man he knelt down beside link let me do that he said no offense i know you can do it yourself i know you could probably lift the whole damn truck without a jack but just because you can do a thing doesnt mean you should have to do it link decided to accept the compliment excessive though it was and the help that came with it he rose and watched as the man in the cowboy hat swiftly loosened the wheel nuts and hoisted the tire off he was stronger than he looked thought link the older man had been planning to beat on the tire iron with the heel of his boot to loosen the nuts but this guy just flipped them free with barely a stretch of his back pretty soon the tire was changed with the minimum of fuss or conversation which suited link just fine link wasnt much for polite conversation least of all with strangers didnt matter how many tires they changed when he owned the missing link it was myra who did the charming and link who dealt with the beer and liquor people the cowboy stood took a bright blue rag from his pocket and wiped his hands clean i appreciate your help said link he stretched out his hand in thanks the names link frazier the cowboy looked at links outstretched palm the way a child molester might respond to an unexpected flash of young thigh in a playground he finished cleaning his hands put the rag back in his pocket then shook links hand in return link felt an unpleasant sensation as if there were bugs crawling on his skin he tried to hide it but he felt sure that the cowboy had seen the change in his expression buddy carson said the cowboy he had noticed links response buddy was finely attuned to the rhythms of other peoples bodies it made him good at what he did it was my pleasure said buddy as the cells in links body started to metastasize and his liver began to rot he tipped the fingers of his right hand to his hat gave link a little salute and headed back to his car later that day buddy picked up a waitress in a bar over by danbury she was fortyish and overweight nobody would have called her goodlooking but buddy worked her pretty well and by the end of a nights drinking he had convinced her that they were kindred spirits two lonely but decent people whod taken some knocks in life but who had somehow managed to pull through they went back to her place a neat little twobedroom duplex that smelled faintly of musty clothing and buddy rattled her bed and her bones she told buddy that it had been a long time that it was just what she needed she moaned beneath him and he closed his eyes as he moved upon her it was easier when he could get inside people when he could touch the interior of their mouths with his finger maybe cut them slightly with a nail open wounds were good too and even a kiss if he could force the lips apart and get a bite in but sex was best of all with sex it worked faster so that he could stay and watch with little risk to himself the second time the tone of her sounds changed she asked him to stop she said there was something wrong buddy didnt stop once it started it couldnt be held back that was the way of it when he finished she was already breathing more shallowly and some of the flesh had receded from her face her fingers were like talons gripping the sheets and her back arched with pain she couldnt speak there was some blood now that was good it was red but soon it would turn to black buddy sat back on the sheets and lit himself a cigarette it was slowly getting worse there was a time when once a week would have been enough to ease the pain but no longer now once daily permitted him to rest for a time but only for a couple of blessed hours if he managed to corrupt more than one the hours without agony increased exponentially but the risk was that folk would notice so multiple victims were rarely an option for him that mornings troubles were a sign that the thing inside him was becoming harder to control and to sate the black blood began to appear while he was making water pretty soon he was coughing it up soaking the towels he was only just recovering when the fat maid entered the room he wondered if she would tell anyone about it and felt certain that she would he got a sense of her as he held her his skin working against hers the rottenness within him seeking purchase in the new host he would have to move on soon but he was so weak there was another option of course but it represented an enormous gamble he had been turning it over in his mind for some time calculating the odds assessing the risks now with his own pain increasing and the presence of the black fluid in his urine the prospect was growing more and more enticing if one offered temporary ease he reasoned and two doubled the time he could sleep what would happen if he took on more many more he thought about the family in colorado after them the pain was gone for days and even when it returned it was diminished considerably so that taking the waitress had been more out of desire than out of necessity what might happen if he corrupted a town a city weeks perhaps months of respite might ensue maybe he could even rid himself of it entirely the possibility of an extended peace dangled invitingly within his grasp this was a small community under ordinary circumstances it would be hard to reach out to enough people but when he had taken a walk the day before he saw something that caused him to reconsider his options he spent the rest of the day thinking about it weighing the pros and cons and trying to work out how best it might be done that morning with the black blood pooling in the bowl he reached a decision he would make a stand here in easton then head north and find somewhere quiet to rest for the winter maybe forever his eyes were closing touching the maid had clouded the pain enough to enable him to sleep he put the chain on the motel room door then stretched out on the bed and began to dream the cowboys name was not buddy carson the cowboy didnt have a name not now there might have been one a long time ago but if there was then it had been lost to him for many years his new life began on the day he awoke in the middle of the nevada desert wearing ragged clothes and with tumors on his skin he had no memory of any existence before that his insides felt as though they were being slowly roasted and when he squeezed his hands to his stomach to try to ease the pain black blood shot from beneath his nails at last he found the strength to rise he made his way to the highway and thumbed a ride from a garage mechanic who was hauling a red dodge charger over to a dealer in reno the mechanic had spent months restoring the dodge in his spare time and now figured that he was about to make a good profit by selling it the cowboy felt the growing pain in his insides ease the moment his hand accidentally brushed the mechanics hand most of the tumors were hidden beneath his clothes but after he touched the mechanic he could see the one that peeped out from under the cuff of his shirtsleeve begin to fade within seconds it was entirely gone the cowboy touched the driver again hey the fuck are you doing man said the mechanic keep your hands away from me you fucking faggot he started to pull over there were no other cars visible on the highway get out he said get the fuck out of my the cowboy grasped the mechanics right arm then clasped his left hand around the mans throat he squeezed a trickle of blood appeared in the mechanics nostril then dripped down over his lips and chin the force of the flow began to increase and the color of the blood began to darken until it turned a deep black as the cowboy watched the skin around the mechanics eyes began to tighten his skin grew waxy and his cheekbones grew sharp in his face and for the first time the cowboy had an image of something inside of himself like a great black worm that had found purchase within him it lay in his bowels feeding off him slowly turning his cells to black simultaneously destroying all that was human about him while keeping him alive pumping its unknown poisons into his system if it had a consciousness then it was beyond the cowboys capacity to understand all he knew was that it had chosen him as its host and if he did not do what it wanted then it would destroy him the cowboy howled and his fingers broke through the mechanics neck and into his flesh he felt a pressure building in his arm and then his fingers straightened convulsively as the poison erupted through the pores of his skin the sockets of the mechanics eyes flooded with darkness he stopped struggling even as the cowboys own pain faded and then was gone the cowboy buried the mechanics body in the desert he kept his wallet and when night fell he found the mechanics apartment and spent the night there as he rested up he thought of the image of the worm in his body he didnt know if it was really there or was simply his minds way of trying to explain to itself what was happening to him he decided to talk to a doctor as soon as possible although in his dreams that night the worm inside him spoke to him its blind head splitting to reveal a barbed mouth and it told him that no doctor could ever help him and that his purpose in life was not to be cured but to spread the black word despite his dream he visited a doctors office the next day he told the old man who examined him of his pain and of the dark blood that he had coughed up in the desert the doctor listened to him then opened a syringe and prepared to take a sample the agony as the needle entered was impossible for the cowboy to bear as soon as it penetrated his skin he felt the worm in his being convulse as though the needle were entering through his stomach wall and puncturing his internal organs scraping and tearing as it went his screams brought the doctors receptionist and he took them both just as he had taken the mechanic but the pain did not go away that night and he felt that he was being punished for his temerity in trying to cure himself the mechanic lived alone and received no calls that were not related to his business the cowboy kept the charger as a souvenir as well as a pair of the mechanics overalls when they began to fall apart he held on to the mechanics name badge which he attached to a straw hat he took from a drifter outside of boise idaho he already had the boots they had been on his feet when he came to in the desert and they felt as if he had been wearing them for years the mechanics name was buddy so that was what the cowboy decided to call himself as for carson well that was his private joke he had found the word in a medical book for folks suffering from cancer and buddy figured that it pretty much summed up what he was or what he had become he was buddy carcinogenic buddy carson for short by the time folks might come to understand the humor they were already dying iii l opez drove around the streets letting folks see that he was on the job like most small towns easton was a peaceful place with little real crime beyond petty theft the occasional bar fight and the omnipresent shadow of domestic violence lopez dealt with all of it as best he could in a way he suited the town there were probably better cops than him he figured but there couldnt have been too many who tried as hard after a couple of hours during which he did nothing more than hand out a speeding ticket to a salesman doing sixty in a fortymile zone and warn off a couple of kids who were skateboarding in the banks parking lot he slipped into steve diventuras diner for coffee and a sandwich he was about to take a seat at the counter when he saw doc bradley alone in a deuce by the window so he asked steve to send his order over mind if i join you he asked greg bradley looked as if hed been jolted out of a reverie although lopez didnt think it was one that he was particularly sorry to leave bradley was about lopezs age but pure whitebread tanned blond hair good teeth and money to his name lopez guessed that he could have earned a whole lot more for his services someplace other than easton but his family was from the country and he had a genuine attachment to the area and its people lopez could understand that he shared bradleys view he also suspected that bradley was gay although he had never broached the subject with him he could see why the doctor might want to keep that quiet most people in easton were pretty tolerantafter all they had a black mayor and a police chief with a hispanic name in a town that was percent whitebut patients were funny about their doctors and there were some who would drive to boston for a consultation before they would allow an openly gay man to touch them and that went for women as well as men so greg bradley remained single and mostly the folks in easton chose not to comment on the fact it was the way things were done in small towns sure take a seat bradleys tuna on rye had barely been touched and his coffee looked cold glad i didnt order the tuna said lopez tunas fine said bradley its me thats not so good a waitress brought lopez his coffee and told him his sandwich was on the way he thanked her anything i can do to help asked lopez not unless you can work miracles i guess youll find out soon enough but you may as well hear it from me first link frazier has cancer lopez leaned back in his seat he genuinely didnt know what to say link seemed to have been a fixture around the town for as long as he could remember lopez had even dated one of his daughters many years before link had been good about the whole thing not even holding it against lopez that hed dumped her one week before senior prom well not holding it against him for more than a couple of years anyway how bad hes riddled with it as bad as ive ever seen he approached me a couple of days back first time he ever came near me hed passed blood that morning a lot of it he might have hated the idea of seeing a doctor about anything but he knew there was something seriously wrong i sent him for tests that afternoon and they called me later that night with the results hell i dont think they even had to wait for the biopsies the xray was enough looks like the livers where its worst but its spread to his spine and most of his other major organs i spoke to his son this morning and he gave me the allclear to start telling people close to his father jesus how long has he got bradley shook his head not long the thing of it is he swears he had no pain before a couple of days ago and no symptoms until the blood appeared its almost impossible to believe links strong he could lose an arm and he wouldnt notice until he tried to wind his watch nobody is that strong believe me he should have been in agony for months lopezs sandwich arrived but like bradley he no longer had much of an appetite where is he manchester i think theyll keep him there untilwell until the end the two men sat in silence watching the life of the town pass by the window people waved and they waved back but their smiles were automatic and without warmth my father died of cancer said bradley i didnt know that he smoked a lot drank some too ate red meat fried food didnt believe he was eating a real dessert unless his arteries began cracking halfway through if cancer hadnt taken him there were about a dozen other candidates lined up for the job i had a friend who died of cancer said lopez andy stone he was a detective with the state police he didnt drink didnt smoke and ran fifty or sixty miles every week they diagnosed him and he was dead within a year what was it pancreatic cancer bradley winced bad its all bad but some are worse than others i hear a lot of stories like that some of them are people that i knew or friends of friends people contracting that shit without any apparent cause people who ate like they were supposed to didnt work in risky jobs didnt even seem to have much stress in life next thing theyre just shadows i dont think i can go that way i dont know how good i am with pain to tell the truth ive never been shot never broken a limb never even been in the hospital since i had my tonsils taken out as a boy i saw the way andy went and i dont think i could take that kind of suffering folks are strong said bradley like link i suppose our instinct is to fight and to survive it never ceases to amaze me the reserves of strength that lie inside the most ordinary men and women even in the worst of suffering theres cause for hope or admiration anyway lopez pushed his sandwich away this is a conversation i didnt need to have he said lets hope its the last time you should feel sorry for stevie over there hes going to think his food sucks lopez glanced over his shoulder to where steve diventura stood at the register a pencil behind his ear as he totaled his customers checks maybe hell give us a discount if we complain steve if we complain hell charge us extra for his time the subject of food brought lopezs mind back to link frazier and the bar that he had once owned and that he still used to frequent driving the new owner crazy by commenting on what he described as the fancy food that it now served you talk to eddy reed yet he asked no youre pretty much the first person ive told ill tell eddy if i see anyone i think should know ill spare you the trouble of telling them too i can give you a call later maybe let you know how things have gone bradley looked grateful i guess its a job we share sometimes giving people bad news about their friends and relatives i guess the difference is i usually dont have to tell people that theyre dying bradley smiled blackly yeah i suppose most of yours already knew they were dead is that what they call laughing in the face of death whistling by the churchyard whatever works it was bradley who stood first id better be getting back its hard enough to get people to come to see a doctor in the first place if i keep them waiting they just go home and treat themselves with aspirin lopez wished him luck it was terrible about link frazier just terrible lopez sipped at his coffee hed read somewhere that too much coffee was carcinogenic it seemed like so many things these days were he wondered what had caused link fraziers cancer or if the connection was even that simple maybe link had done nothing at all except live his life as best he could he supposed that there was only so much you could do to protect yourself from things you couldnt see lopez abandoned his coffee and instead bought an apple on the way out greg bradley walked back to his office his head down and his mind filled with thoughts of link frazier he wondered what might have happened had link come to him earlier the doctor tried to encourage the towns senior citizens in particular to see him for routine checkups even if they werent feeling ill but the good folk of easton werent great believers in spending money unnecessarily on doctors or on much else it was almost funny dentists had more or less convinced the population at large that it was important to have their teeth looked at on a regular basis but it was near impossible to persuade those same people that they should extend that care to the rest of their bodies there were already six patients waiting for him when he reached the office a couple of them flicking listlessly through the stock of outofdate magazines others probably indulging in that ageold waiting room pastime of wondering just what was bothering their fellow sufferers and whether or not they should try to keep their distance from them lana his receptionist gave him a disapproving look as he walked by discreetly tapping her wristwatch to let him know that he was already running late he asked her to give him another five minutes then closed the door to his office behind him and made a telephone call lopez had he been there to witness it would not have been surprised at the conversation that followed between the doctor and a man named jason coll who worked as a tax lawyer in rochester although others in the town might have been the more openminded among them might even have envied the fondness in greg bradleys voice and could not have failed to note the obvious consolation he derived from talking with the other man when he at last hung up the phone the doctor took a moment to consider as he often did if their relationship and his practice would survive if jason moved to easton perhaps it was more realistic to think about moving to boston but greg didnt want to leave the town he belonged here it was as simple as that for the present telephone calls and snatched weekends would have to suffice he tapped the intercom on his desk and told lana to send in the first patient the rest of lopezs day was quiet apart from a phone call from errol wondering if the plow had to be brandnew or if they could settle for one with a reconditioned engine false economy lopez told him he wasnt sure if it was false economy he just liked the idea of a new snowplow even if it would be someone elses job to drive it but on a practical level he knew that winter took its toll on the older folks and the last thing he needed was an ambulance stuck in drifts because a used plow had broken down lopez touched base with lloyd when he returned to the station house ellie harrison one of the parttime cops assigned to each shift had just arrived and was doing paperwork at the desk in the back office she gave him a wave he left her to it lloyd came around the counter and leaned in quietly to lopez you hear about link frazier he asked yeah how did you know i heard it from my mom she was with doc bradley this afternoon lloyd looked genuinely upset he still lived with his mom and dad occupying two rooms over the garage at the side of the house he was dating penny clay who worked at the drugstore and as local gossip had it was less than the silent type in the sack lopez wondered what mr and mrs hopkins did when their son took penny back to his place assuming that they let him bring girls back could be that they were lucky enough to be going deaf but if they werent already then exposure to penny clay in the throes of ecstasy could well be the thing to do it penny was an unlikely partner for lloyd she was kind of fullon and sometimes seemed to be missing a filter between her brain and her mouth but she seemed to adore lloyd in her way and lopez hoped that she might instill a little more steel into the young man if lopez had a criticism of lloyd hopkins it was that he sometimes seemed just too sensitive for his own good but it meant that he had a way about him that lopez lacked when renee bertucci was attacked by her exhusband a year or so back and arrived at the station house all black and blue with her blouse torn and that glazed look in her eyes that told you something real bad had happened back at her place it was lloyd who took care of her true ellie was there for the tests and the swabs but it was lloyd upon whom renee seemed to lean the most he sat on a chair outside her room at the medical center for the rest of the night until word came that aldo bertucci had been picked up by the smokeys outside of nashua and then drove her to her mothers the next day in a situation as delicate as that there werent many male cops who could be relied upon to do the right thing lloyd hopkins didnt even have to think about it it just came naturally to him i think i might drive down to see him if i get a chance said lloyd you give him my best i will you heading home no im meeting elaine for dinner over at reeds you need me for anything the cell will be on big night tomorrow said lloyd you think it will go ahead once folks hear about link reeds was hosting its annual prechristmas fundraiser the following night each year eddy reed handed over one nights takings from reeds bar and grill to local charities it was a tradition that he had inherited without complaint from link frazier pretty much everyone in town tried to make it along for part of the evening at least and most added a couple of bucks extra to the cost of their meals and drinks to boost the pot i dont know but suppose we assume it will unless we hear otherwise said lopez everyone is on duty we dont want anyone taking it into his head that this might be a good night to rip off the bar lloyds comment reminded lopez that he had not yet spoken to eddy reed about link he also wondered how link stood regarding medical insurance he didnt know how well off the old man was and if the cost of proper care was going to be a problem then maybe some or all of the proceeds from the charity night at reeds could be used for links benefit he made a mental note to ask greg bradley about it when next they spoke lopez showered and changed then left lloyd and ellie and drove the five blocks to reeds in his own bronco there were other bars in town but reeds was the only one with food that went beyond burgers and fries the bar was about a quarter full when lopez arrived most folks clearly electing to wait for the following nights festivities before spending their money lopez ordered a beer and took a seat at the bar somebody had left a newspaper so he flicked idly through it exchanging small talk with the patrons and eddy himself until elaine appeared elaine olssen was the kind of magazinequality scandinavian blonde over whom lopez used to weep tears of frustration when he was a teenager she was easily the most beautiful woman he had ever dated five eleven her face always a little sallow even in winter her hair hanging just below shoulder length her eyes were a very pale blue and her lips parted slightly in repose creating a tiny diamond at the center of her mouth he could see other men glance at her as she approached him following her progress men always did most of the ones in reeds stopped as soon as they saw lopez clocking them in the mirror above the bar only one man did not seem troubled by the policemans presence he continued to stare at elaine as she took her seat then turned casually away he was drinking soda the remains of a piece of apple pie on the table before him his hair was slicked back on his skull and he wore snakeskin cowboy boots and blue denims a straw hat lay on the table beside the plate of apple pie there was something written on the front but lopez couldnt read what it said he considered rousting the stranger partly out of annoyance at the way his gaze had lingered on elaine but also because of the feeling of unease he got when the man briefly caught his eye whats wrong said elaine after they had kissed in the mirror she followed the direction of lopezs gaze yeah i saw him checking me out she said creep he does it again i may have words with him elaine touched her fingers to his lips he kissed them lightly isnt that abusing your position only if i beat him up after oh i never realized the law was so subtle she sat down beside him and shrugged off her coat she was wearing a red polo neck that followed her curves in a way that made lopez catch his breath almost instinctively he shot a look at the man in the window booth he seemed to be staring through the glass at the street beyond but lopez was pretty certain that elaine was reflected in that same glass she ordered a white wine while they browsed the menus how was your day he asked her elaine was an assistant da with responsibility for communications over at the new hampshire ags office which made her the first point of contact between the media and the attorney general it meant that she appeared on tv whenever the ags office was handling a big case or when something controversial occurred that needed to be defused elaine olssen was an expert at dealing with potentially explosive situations even the tougher male reporters tended to go a little weak when she turned the full wattage of her smile upon them while female reporters simply tried to stay out of her way in case she made them look bad pretty quiet for me the rest of the office is looking to clear up as much stuff as possible before the holidays kick in nothing focuses the mind better than the prospect of putting someone in jail for christmas gets you right in the spirit of the season and you he finished his beer and called for another same pretty dull errol whined about paying up for a new plow lloyd needs new trousers what are you his father that boy just keeps growing and growing his beer came he picked at the label and link frazier is real sick cancer im sorry elaine closed her eyes her house was only a mile up the road from links and hed been kind to her when she first moved to easton three years before are you sure asked elaine once she had recovered herself i saw him just a few days ago he didnt look sick and he wasnt complaining about any pain i met greg bradley this afternoon he said it was bad he doesnt think links going to last too long lopez reached out for her and stroked her back this was what lloyd hopkins was good at lopez knew that he just wasnt in his league the news cast a shadow over the rest of the evening but still they ate and drank and talked eddy now knew about link and he offered to approach the family about the state of links insurance and the possibility of the townsfolk making a contribution to his care if it was needed lopez thanked him then walked with elaine out to the parking lot you want to come back with me asked elaine id like you to id like it too she smiled and hugged him to her over her shoulder he saw the man at the window watching them he was licking his lips lopez pulled back from her can you give me a minute he asked sure is there something wrong he took his badge from his back pocket his hand brushing the gun on his belt if there isnt there soon will be he said buddy carson watched the big cop approach hed seen him in town cruising around giving the nod to just about everyone he encountered buddy had found out his name and his position lopez was a danger and buddy knew it over the years buddy had developed a predators instinct for spotting those equal to or above him on the food chain who might prove dangerous to him where possible he avoided them when there was no other option he got rid of them hed never taken a cop though cops were different you killed one and others came after you there was a pecking order in the amount of heat a killing drew young men particularly ethnics drew the least women and children brought down much more but killing a cop was like putting yourself in front of a flamethrower still if buddy was to achieve what he hoped to accomplish in easton then something would have to be done about this one the cop was heavily bundled up only his hands and face were bare and buddy wasnt sure that he would be able to find an excuse to touch him for long enough if he pushed the cop too far he might end up in a cell and buddy didnt like to think of what would happen if he were incarcerated there was an additional risk factor involved in trying to corrupt him in the bar when he wouldnt have long enough to really get to work on him buddy had learned from experience that some people were more aware than others when they were touched by him it was as though they actually felt themselves changing as if they sensed the sudden distortion of themselves at the most basic of levels they were the most dangerous and buddys practice was to destroy them utterly to remain in contact with them until they were completely subdued he was like a spider poisoning a wasp pumping it with venom even as it tried to sting because to back away before it was completely subdued would leave it vulnerable to a lethal counterattack buddy had become adept at spotting the alert ones the nature of their work meant that cops were particularly sensitive and for that additional reason he tried to avoid even casual encounters with them whenever possible something about the way lopez carried himself told buddy that he was good at his job which meant that buddy had to be especially careful other customers were watching as lopez approached the end table he flashed buddy his badge you got some id he asked why did i do something wrong officer said buddy sir just show me some id please buddy reached for his jacket the cops hand was resting on the butt of his gun the gun withdrew an inch from its holster exposing the glocks dull frame slowly said lopez this is a tough town said buddy as he felt in his jacket pocket got laws against minding your own business laws against looking at a pretty woman thats what this is about isnt it i looked at your woman and you dont like it im sorry but shes a goodlooking lady i didnt mean nothing by it he found his wallet and removed his nevada state drivers license it was the genuine article the man who had acquired it for buddy assured him that it would stand up to scrutiny and he had told nothing less than the truth it was worth every penny that buddy had briefly paid for it before the mans death made redundant his need for buddys money he handed it to the cop and was almost tempted to brush his knuckles against the policemans hand the barest of contacts would enable him to gauge the cops sensitivity as well as delivering a little added dose of mortality but the policeman was too quick for him and what is your business mr carson im between jobs im just traveling around trying to take in some of this great country we dont get many people coming all this way just to visit easton you know anybody here not yet if this is anything to go by doesnt look like ill be making too many friends here in the future i guess that depends said lopez on what on how friendly you really are im the real deal said buddy i just want to reach out to people lopez told buddy to stay where he was then used his cell to call the station house ellie answered and he asked her to do a check on buddy carson he gave her the license number then waited he watched buddy carson sitting quietly in his booth he wasnt looking at elaine any longer instead he was just staring at the blank wall before him the check came back clean lopez was disappointed but he still had his suspicions about the man in the booth where are you staying he asked buddy when he returned buddy was slightly disappointed that the cop didnt hand him back his license instead lopez placed it flat on the table picture side up his finger holding down one corner the easton motel said buddy its real nice i might extend my stay its so nice let me tell you something mr carson said lopez theres not a whole lot for a man to do in easton at this time of year i reckon that by tomorrow you should have exhausted all of the possibilities and then it will be time for you to be on your way you have a safe journey he flicked the license back across the table that sounds like im being run out of town said buddy no youll be leaving under your own steam but if you want me to help you along that can be arranged you have a good night buddy watched him leave he had hoped that by goading the cop he might get the opportunity to touch him if he lost his temper and made a move but the cop had kept his cool in the end it was probably for the best buddy was storing up his venom now getting ready for the big play making a try for the cop might have dulled his edge or alerted the policeman to the threat buddy posed better to let him go now and hope for another chance at him later buddy did not consider himself to be a vindictive man but he would take pleasure in giving the cop a little something if the opportunity presented itself he envisaged himself squatting on the cops chest his fingers in his mouth and the cops tongue slowly turning black in his grip buddy allowed himself a small smile dealing with the spic cop would be a real pleasure as for the woman well in her case the pleasure would be doubled so elaine was driving lopez would pick up his car when she dropped him back to town the following morning elaine owned a black mercedes clk convertible and lopez reckoned it was a good thing that she had a job with the ags office because elaine olssen had never met a speed limit that she liked there were times driving with her on the stretch of between montpelier and white river junction that lopez doubted even their combined influence would be enough to keep her out of jail or from being recruited for some form of secret nasa rockettesting program so what youve hardly said a word since the bar did that guy do something to you he got under my skin thats all ive never met a guy called buddy that i liked its one of those names thats trying too hard men named buddy are right up there with guys who call you pal or friend are you going to give him the bums rush i already did i told him i wanted him gone rough justice bet every girl who gets eyed up by a creep in a bar wishes her boyfriend could just have him thrown out of town lopez wasnt sure if she was being sarcastic or not he glanced at her she made sultry eyes at him i like it she purred its kind of sexy for the first time since his encounter with buddy carson lopez grinned back next time ill beat him up for you ooooh she said i can hardly wait hit him harder officer hit him harder iv b uddy carson left the bar and drove his dodge back to the motel he hadnt planned on checking out the next day he wanted a place to rest up before the nights exertions but buddy had no doubt that the cop would check up on him and he needed to avoid another confrontation until he was ready now that he had scouted out the bar he was convinced that he could take a dozen people easily without arousing any suspicion at first maybe more if they were all packed together tight if his plan of action worked like he hoped he would gain respite for weeks maybe months he liked the idea of moving on to new york but it would be hard to find skin to touch casually in winter with his pain alleviated for a time he could afford to hibernate until spring maybe florida he thought or california san francisco with its hobos and tourists appealed to him buddy had been sick again in the mens room of reeds bar it was almost as if the black worm knew what he was planning and wanted to make sure that he didnt back out by reminding him of its dominion over him buddy sometimes wondered what would happen if he tried to resist the impulse if he took the pain and tried to see it out to the end would he die in the beginning on that second night after the deaths of the doctor and his receptionist he had found a gun in the mechanics nightstand he drank a couple of shots of bourbon to give him a little dutch courage then placed the gun in his mouth he closed his eyes and thought about pulling the trigger but in the end he did not it wasnt that he couldnt pull the trigger if he actually wanted to that was the thing of it what he thought of as the black worm couldnt make him do anything against his will sure it could use pain to force him into a certain course of action but it didnt control him he still had his own freedom of choice no the reason why buddy didnt pull the trigger that night was at once simpler and infinitely more complex than mind control buddy didnt pull the trigger because buddy liked what he was doing passing on to others some small aspect of the disease that had colonized his own body gave him not only release but pleasure he enjoyed it he relished the sense of power it gave him the ability to decide who lived and who died it was godlike buddy still did not know for sure if the black worm really existed in the form that he had imagined sleek and black in its plated carapace vestigial eyes buried at either side of its pointed front end its mouth little more than a ridged wound or if it was merely his minds way of picturing the corrosion within himself the foulness that had always been intrinsic to him if the worm was truly present inside him then it was evil and some part of the pleasure that he felt was shared or even generated by that alien presence but even if it did not exist there was still evil within buddy evil beyond the worst atrocities he had witnessed on his tv screen and buddy knew it he wondered sometimes if there were more like him if there were others scattered around the country even the world passing on their contagion with a single touch alleviating their own pain by gifting it to others buddy didnt know and he suspected that he never would he still had no understanding of how he had come to be this way it might have been the work of some outside agency but equally it could just have been a consequence of buddys own moral decay maybe he thought im the next step in human evolution a being whose physical form has become a reflection of his moral state a man whose soul has corrupted and rotted within him poisoning and transforming his insides whatever he was buddy was certain of one thing he was stronger and more lethal than anyone in this shithole town and pretty soon a lot of people were going to learn that lesson the hard way buddy was still smiling when he pulled into the parking lot of the easton motel and saw someone leaving his motel room buddy stopped smiling jed wheaton had asked phil to check up on the guy in phil was about to take over the night shift but he didnt have his study books with him like he usually did phil wasnt even carrying a paperback to read there was a tv behind the desk but phil like his father usually only turned it on when he was desperate perhaps he was hoping to catch up on some sleep there was a couch in the office and after two am a sign on the door told people to ring the bell in order to wake the night clerk phil certainly looked tired and distracted enough to want to curl up for the night you okay son jed asked phil reacted as if hed just been woken from a trance huh yeah im fine just fine jed wasnt sure that he believed him but phil tended to keep things to himself most of the time if there was a problem his son would get around to telling him when he felt like it phil didnt have much to add to what jed already knew when he asked him about the night buddy carson checked in phil said that he had seemed okay hed even insisted on introducing himself his hand outstretched as soon as his bag hit the floor buddy buddy carson how you doing tonight his teeth were bad and his breath smelled some but that was about the sum total of phils recollection jed had called greg bradley that evening to discuss the health of his new guest but bradley still troubled by link fraziers diagnosis was already on his way to talk with the oncology people at manchester medical a recording on his machine advised anyone needing a doctor in a hurry to call the doctors over in brewster five miles west of easton jed left a message asking greg to call him because he was worried about one of his guests but there was nothing more that he could do for him he wasnt even sure that there was anything greg bradley could do after all it wasnt as if he could force carson to consult with him still when phil arrived jed told him to take a quick looksee at carson s dodge wasnt in the lot so jed figured it was a chance to check the room and make sure that his guest hadnt bled a gut over the bed just stick your head in take a look at the bathroom then come back to me he said phil after what seemed like a couple of seconds while his addled brain tried to make sense of his fathers simple request grabbed the master key and headed out phil had found the lump while showering that afternoon like most men he wasnt as careful as he should be about checking his privates secretly and also in common with most men he had a dont ask dont tell attitude toward his own health the last time he had consulted a doctor was two years before when he broke his wrist snowboarding since then phil had suffered nothing worse than head colds and hangovers but this lump couldnt be ignored hell phil could see it when he looked in the mirror like someone had slipped a grape in there it was tender but not unduly painful and phil was certain that it hadnt been there the night before there was no way that he could have missed something like that but it couldnt be anything serious right i mean these things took time they didnt just happen overnight hed give it a day maybe it was just one of those oddities and by morning it would be gone he couldnt get rid of the image of it from his mind though worse he couldnt shake off the sensation that he had like there were worms beneath his skin burrowing into flesh and marrow transforming everything within to black now as he walked past the motels small clean rooms he felt the throbbing in his groin and knew that he would have to talk to someone about it he had almost told his father what was troubling him but he was simultaneously concerned about worrying the old man and mortified at the prospect of jed wheaton asking his son to show him his privates he decided that once the night shift was done he would head over to doc bradleys first thing and get himself looked at phil opened the door to there was a smell in there the kind he always associated with his grandma dying shed been in one of those old peoples wards where nobody was ever going to see home again and the whole ward stank faintly of vomit and piss and mortality all unsuccessfully masked by cleaning products and industrialstrength deodorant there was the same smell in except there was nothing strong enough to really hide it phil thought he could detect the residue of marias spray but she might just as well have hung one of those pine tree air deodorizers on a corpse for all the effect it was having the smell was worst in the bathroom but at least it was clean the towels were folded and unused the shower was dry and even the soaps remained wrapped the toilet had been flushed but there was some blood on the floor nearby phil stepped back into the bedroom there was a bag in one corner an expensivelooking leather duffel but it was locked it was the only sign that the room was occupied everything else was just as maria always left it for arriving guests even down to the remote for the tv lying perfectly centered on the cover of the latest hbo schedule phil killed the light locked the door and turned to find himself facetoface with buddy carson can i ask what youre doing said carson in the moonlight his face looked gaunt and cadaverous and up close his breath smelled like a distilled version of the stink in his room instinctively phil backed away from the stench just checking to make sure you dont need more towels we do it for everyone phil lied buddy made a big play of looking at his watch kind of late to be doing that isnt it youll wake folks up we got tied up with other stuff this evening and youre the only guest tonight i knew you were out because your car wasnt in the lot seemed like the best chance id have without disturbing you buddy didnt say anything in reply he just eyeballed phil nodding slowly to let the kid know that what he was saying might sound like the most reasonable thing hed ever heard and yet he still didnt believe a damn word of it well i appreciate it he said at last you have a good night phil made as if to walk around him but buddy gripped his wrist and once again phil had an image of black creatures moving under his skin hey you feeling okay asked buddy and although there was concern in his voice the moonlight made his face appear to be leering you look kind of sick tired said phil then winced as something stabbed into his groin he looked down half anticipating the sight of a needle sticking into his pants but there was nothing i got to go he said sure said buddy you be careful now he watched the kid stumble away hed make for the bathroom thats what buddy would do if he was the kid hed go to the bathroom unbutton his pants and take a look at what was going on downstairs because it surely felt now as if that thing were growing and spreading it was of course but not in any way that the kid would be able to see buddy figured the true pain would start in a couple of hours time as the cancer really started to eat away at him making steady progress toward the major organs and eroding his spine but in the bathroom the lump would appear unchanged just a lump folks nothing to see here move along move along buddy closed the door and glanced around his room his bag had not been touched that was good buddy had things in there that he didnt want other people looking at time was pressing buddy figured that the kid would go to the doctor the next day by then the bitch maid would probably have discovered the lump in her breast on top of the old man that would make three in less than two days more if some of the other folks hed touched that day proved weaker than suspected a cluster like that would not go unremarked buddy had done some asking around that day there wasnt but one doctor in the town and he ran his clinic out of a peachy little onestory house on the eastern outskirts of town it made things easier for buddy he would have only one call to make he knelt down and used a small silver key to open the lock on his bag inside were a couple of changes of clothes identical to those he was already wearing a passport and a drivers license in the name of russ cercan another of buddys little jokes and a glass jelly jar it was this that buddy now reached for holding it up to the light the way an entomologist might examine a particularly interesting bug inside the jar was a black tumor it had come from inside buddys own body coughed up that morning as the pain began to tell upon him he had crawled to the bathroom but didnt make it to the bowl instead he lay retching on the tiles coughing up blood and black matter including the tumor now contained in the jar it was a reminder of what dwelt within him a gift from the disease to help him in the work to come dead cells thought buddy thats all you are just dead cells he tapped the glass gently with his fingernail and the tumor moved across town in elaine olssens untidy bedroom lopez sat at the window and looked out on the fields elaines place was right at the edge of easton where town met country there was a stream close by and distant mountains silvered by the moon he heard an owl hooting he wondered if it had already fed itself that night or if it had not yet found its prey lopez could not stop thinking about buddy carson earlier that evening as he stood over him in reeds he had been conscious of a ringing in his ears a kind of highpitched whine lopez knew what the sound was it was his senses kicking up a gear like they did when distantly he thought he heard his garden gate open and knew that someone was approaching his door even if he could not hear the steps on the path or when a person came too close behind him and he felt his personal space being encroached upon even though he could not see the individual in question without turning around faced with buddy carson lopezs senses appeared to go on high alert even though he had no reason to think it lopez believed that buddy carson was trying to touch him in the bar as though some game were being played between them the rules of which were clear only to carson it was in the awkward way that he turned his hand in order to pass his license over or in the way his fingers leaped forward to take it back when lopez returned it aiming at once at and beyond the license itself lopez didnt want to be touched by buddy carson something told him that to have any physical contact with the cowboy would be a very bad idea indeed knowing that carson had left town would help but it would not alleviate his concerns entirely he was bad news for somebody and moving him along would only transfer to another man the burden of eventually dealing with him there were times when he was a trooper that lopez encountered individuals who brought nothing of worth to the world who in fact seemed to enjoy making it worse for anyone who had the misfortune to cross their path lopez would often try to imagine what they had been like as children in an effort to modify his feelings of hatred for them sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not when it didnt lopez would find himself agreeing with those of his peers who felt that the best thing for everyone involved would be if those people were dead they were like bacteria in a petri dish spreading out and colonizing their surroundings tainting everything they touched lopez tried to picture buddy carson as a child and found that he could not nothing came to him maybe it was tiredness but in his head carson seemed both old and young both newly formed yet ancient like old metal that had been smelted and reused again and again becoming more and more corrupt in the process lopez looked to the bed where elaine lay sleeping she always slept the same way curled up on her right side with her right arm pressed against her breasts and her left hand close to her mouth she rarely moved in the night and uttered no sounds in her sleep he slipped back into the bed and made as if to reach for her instead his hand remained hovering inches above her skin unwilling to make contact he drew it back to himself and moved away from her finding his own space at the very edge of the mattress where at last he drifted into sleep v b uddy carson checked out of the easton motel shortly after eleven the following morning the pain was growing in his right side he could take a small hit from someone if it got too bad but just a little in case he might be tempted to rest for he usually felt sleepy after release and there was work to be done he would accept some discomfort now in return for more lasting relief later jed was too distracted by his family problems to care much about being polite to his sole guest phil wheaton was already sitting in the waiting room of greg bradleys office his face white and stretched taut with pain he told his father that he wasnt feeling so good that he had pains in his lower body but jed didnt need to be told that his son was sick his physical appearance had changed drastically overnight he seemed to have lost pounds in a matter of hours jed wanted to go see the doctor with him but phil said he would prefer to go alone and that hed give his father a call if there was a problem despite that jed was considering heading over to the doctors office anyway when maria called to say that she wasnt feeling great and that shed be late when buddy carson came in jed was already calling around his relief staff trying to find someone who might be prepared to cover at short notice buddy had paid up front for his stay now that he had decided to check out early he wanted his money back jed didnt argue he just wanted buddy gone so that he could set about seeing to his sons needs bad morning asked buddy not so good said jed he reached out to count the cash and buddy carson tapped him softly on the back of the hand with a yellowed index finger you need to take a deep breath try to relax said buddy solemnly youll make yourself sick believe me i know jed remembered the description of the blackened bloodied towels and registered the way buddy carsons teeth were streaked brown with nicotine his gums a vivid purple ill bet you know all about sickness he thought im glad that youre leaving but if i find out that you brought something into this town if i discover that it was you that made my boy sick ill hunt you down you fuck ill hunt you down and ill take a knife to you and then you wont have to worry about bloody towels or your teeth falling out of your head or your ragged fucking nails cracking and disintegrating because ill tear you apart i swear to god i will sure said jed you have a good day now lopez woke with elaine they made love quickly then elaine showered while he toasted some bagels he listened to the news on the radio in the kitchen then took his shower while elaine dressed she dropped him outside reeds kissed him goodbye and told him that shed see him later that evening he watched her drive away waving to her as she turned the corner and left his view then strolled over to talk to eddy reed who was sweeping the steps outside the bar economy drive he asked i thought you had employees to clean steps while you counted your millions in a back room two called in sick said eddy today of all days they have to get sick youll have no problem getting folks to help out if youre in trouble eddie stopped sweeping and leaned on the handle of the brush i guess youre right he sucked on his lip as though trying to reach a decision with himself then said to lopez you got a minute to look at something lopez shrugged and followed him into the bar reed led him to the mens room then opened the door last one he said lopez walked past the urinals the door to the end stall was half closed he pushed it open with the toe of his boot there was black fluid on the wall and more liquid pooled on the floor an inexpert attempt had been made to prevent it from spreading by dumping toilet paper on top of it the paper was almost entirely soaked through found it when i was locking up it was quiet last night so i guess nobody used the stall after it happened i was going to call lloyd but it was after two in the morning and i figured that maybe it wasnt worth troubling him about lopez squatted down and took a closer look at the blood give me that brush for a second he said reed handed over the brush and lopez used the handle to explore the accumulation of paper and fluid at the center of the mass he found pieces of black matter what are they asked reed i dont know looks like someone might have coughed them up whoever it is hes real sick lopez stood then washed the tip of the broom in the sink before handing it back to reed you remember who was in the bar last night after i left reed considered the question locals mostly i can name them two couples from out of town dont think they were staying here and the guy in the corner booth the one you were talking to creepy sonofabitch kept brushing up against the wait staff lopez swore softly i think i know where to find him he said i want you to make a list of the people who were here just in case put some scotch tape over the door to this stall maybe an out of order sign too ill get greg bradley to stop by and take a look at it and ed dont tell anyone about this okay ed looked at him as if hed just been advised not to stir cocktails with his wiener you mean you dont want me to tell my brunch customers about what looks like black blood in the mens room which might make them think twice about ordering the beef i dont know chief but if you insist lopez called by the easton motel jed was no longer behind the desk a young girl one of pat capoores kids was looking after things while jed was gone a teen magazine was open in front of her and she was sipping a can of soda through a straw you know where he is he asked his son phil isnt feeling so good he told me hed be over at greg bradleys if there was a problem lopez asked for the motels registration cards he flicked through them until he came to buddy carsons did this man check out the motels empty i guess he must have done have you made up the room i dont think its been done yet i guess ill have to do it when jed gets back she made a barfing gesture by sticking her finger in her mouth then gave lopez the key to before returning to her magazine hey she called as he was about to leave should i ask you for a warrant or something why he asked you got something to hide maybe she said coquettishly her lips closed around the straw she sucked deeply never taking her eyes from him the whole time lopez left her to it wondering if maybe he shouldnt have a talk with pat capoore about his little girl the room was neat and empty the toilet roll was folded into a little triangle at the end and none of the towels had been used the bed had been slept on rather than in lopez could see the depression buddy carsons body had made on the quilt the quilt was yellow and green where it covered the pillows lopez saw a dark stain black blood not much though lopez thought he could see traces of it in the toilet bowl too although nothing like the mens room at reeds it looked like buddy carson wouldnt be creeping people out for much longer lopez tried to find an ounce of sympathy for the man but failed he closed the door returned the key and headed home to change into his uniform greg bradley was having a bad morning first there was maria dominguez with a lump in her breast the size of a walnut hed warned her again and again about screening but she was a big buxom woman in the fullest bloom of health people like her believed that they just couldnt get sick hed given her a referral for manchester and made the appointment for her for that afternoon shed called her husband from the office and he had collected her as soon as they were gone greg phoned amy weiss the counselor he used and told her the details she assured him that shed call the house and offer to accompany maria to manchester now there was phil wheaton he began to cry almost as soon as greg examined him big silent tears that rolled down his cheeks and exploded on his bare thighs greg tried to keep his voice calm as he examined him how long have you had this phil he asked just since yesterday greg looked up at him seriously phil i need you to tell me the truth that is the truth honest i wouldnt lie about something like this i mean look at me it flew in the face of all medical knowledge but greg was inclined to believe him the expression on phil wheatons face was one of absolute fear and panic and greg had become expert at spotting the liars in his office but this made no sense he was looking at what he very much suspected was an advanced stage of testicular cancer he tested him for discomfort and found pain centers as high as his abdomen okay phil we need to get you looked at by a specialist you got someone you can call my dad said phil can i call my dad greg told him to pull his pants up then went out to ask his secretary to call jed wheaton but the older man was already in the waiting room staring at the bulletin board on the wall without taking any of it in greg walked over to him touched his shoulder and gestured toward the second consulting room at the opposite end of the hallway from where his son was dressing jed he said you want to come inside with me for a moment lopez relieved lloyd and ellie then left chris barker another parttime cop in charge of the station house while he did his rounds it would be a long day today culminating in the event at reeds which would require him to be present and in uniform for the occasion he called greg bradleys office but lana told him that the doctor was pretty much tied up for the morning and asked him to call back later lopez decided that the blood in reeds could wait until the afternoon once greg had taken a look at it reed could get the stall cleaned up before the crowds started to arrive buddy carson the guy certainly managed to leave his mark on a place it was lloyd who spotted the red dodge charger he was halfway home and thinking only about his bed when he saw it parked under a bank of trees beside easton s old bowling alley long since boarded up and slowly falling into disrepair lopez sometimes commented that lloyd had a mind like a sorting office everything in its right place the smallest of facts correctly filed away a seemingly innocuous detail could set lloyd off leading him to flip diligently through the storehouse of his mind until he came up with the relevant case among the headsups in the in tray that morning was a bulletin concerning the deaths of a family in colorado while medical experts were still examining the bodies state policeand for reasons that werent made clear in the bulletin the feds and the health authoritieswere anxious to talk to a man who might have visited the scene apparently the owner of a neighboring ranch had noticed a red dodge charger entering the property a day before the bodies were discovered he couldnt make out the plate but the driver was male and the witness thought he might have been carrying a white hat in his hand now here was a red dodge charger it was a long way from colorado but there was no mistaking it standing beside the car was a thin man wearing a white cowboy hat and eating a candy bar there was something stuck on the front of the hat just above the brim lloyd didnt know that this was buddy carson the same man lopez had asked ellie to run a check on the night before because lopez hadnt mentioned a car lloyd pulled into the lot he didnt have a radio in his truck but he did have a cell phone he could call lopez he supposed but he decided to see what the guy had to say for himself first of all he pulled up about ten feet from the man in the hat and opened his door lloyd was still wearing his uniform but the man didnt appear troubled by the sight of him either he was very cool or he didnt have a lot to hide the trouble was that those who had the least to hide tended to worry the most when confronted by a cop in uniform it was the quiet ones who needed to be watched morning said lloyd everything okay here buddy carson finished the candy bar rolled the wrapper into a ball then placed it carefully in his shirt pocket just behind his wallet he was wearing black leather gloves everythings just fine he said you got some identification sure said buddy he took his wallet from his pocket found his drivers license and handed it to lloyd but lloyd jerked his hand away at the last moment and the license fell on the ground between them he felt as though he had come too close to an electrical field bristling and humming with dangerous energy contained only by the thin leather of the mans gloves what the hell was that he asked buddy carson didnt answer instead his mouth opened wide and a steady stream of black fluid struck lloyd hopkins in the face he stumbled backward his eyes burning he tried to reach for his gun but buddy moved in on him wrenching his arm away from the weapon and hitting him on the bridge of the nose with the heel of his right hand lloyd went down and buddy took his gun buddy listened for a second but could detect no cars coming he considered shooting the cop but was afraid that someone as yet unseen might hear and he couldnt risk dissipating his energies by taking him in the usual way instead he slipped the gun into his belt then raised his foot and brought the heel of his boot down hard on lloyds head by the third strike lloyd hopkins was dead greg bradley cleared his office by twelve thirty then told lana to go home fridays were always half days but lana was in even more of a hurry to leave than usual since she was due to help eddy reed with the preparations for the charity evening once she had left turning the sign on the door to closed on her way out he sat down at his desk and put his head in his hands it was as bad a morning as he could ever remember maria and her husband driving out of the lot she with her head lowered too stunned even to cry jed wheaton trying to console his weeping son and a call from manchester to say that link frazier had passed away during the night three cancer cases in as many days at least two of them massively advanced and two of them connected with the easton motel he replayed the message jed had left on his machine the night before he had wanted to question him more closely about his sick guest the one who had bled all over the towels but jeds attention was now fixed entirely on his son anyway the guy had checked out that morning the towels were still there jed told him maria had placed them in a bag in the laundry room just in case but this was cancer and different forms of cancer how could they be linked to one man there was something terribly wrong he had to talk to lopez he was about to get his coat when he heard someone enter reception and close the door there was the sound of the lock being engaged he walked out to the receptionists desk sorry he began im buddy carson had wiped most of lloyd hopkinss blood from his face but it still streaked his nose and forehead his lips were drawn back from his mouth and bradley could see what looked like oil caked at the corners buddys right hand swept across from left to right knocking greg bradley back into his office the pointed toe of a cowboy boot struck the doctor in the left kidney and then buddy carson was sitting on his chest his knees pinning his quarrys arms to the floor im sorry doc he said but buddy aint got time for your shit he held a glass jar in his left hand using his thumb and forefinger he unscrewed the lid something black inside the jar twisted in response to the action buddy shifted his position now using his shins on the doctors arms while his knees gripped his head he leaned over then pressed the open end of the jar against bradleys left ear like a slug the black tumor began to slide across the glass toward its host the day crawled by lopez got tied up with a domestic dispute eventually hauling in the husband to give him time to cool off in a cell there were couples in the town who seemed to spend most of their married lives first beating up on each other then breaking up with each other before finally getting back together in time to start the whole cycle once more charges were often threatened but rarely pressed and lopez had forced himself not to become clinically depressed by the number of women who stayed in or returned to abusive relationships despite every effort to help them he knew it wasnt that simple and he had heard all the complex psychological arguments about the nature of such relationships but that still didnt stop him from wanting to take a length of rubber hose to some of the men and to shake some sense into the women the guy currently languishing in a cell had not come to his attention before according to his wife he had lost his job a couple of months earlier and begun drinking more than usual money was tight and bills were going unpaid what began as an attempt to have a reasoned discussion had escalated into shouting and then briefly violence a neighbor called the police and now the husband was in a cell and lopez had left another message on amy weisss phone asking her to try to schedule an appointment with the wife lopez called greg bradleys office but got the machine he tried the doctors cell but got a powered off message finally he made a call to gregs house and when there was no reply got lana over at reeds and asked her if she knew where he was she told him that shed left him at the office and filled him in some on the mornings events without mentioning the names of those involved but she couldnt talk for long already there were people starting to arrive and lopez could hear eddy reed shouting in the background lopez let her go he checked his watch lloyd hopkins was late hed promised to return early to help out with the parking at reeds again lopez was forced to call both his cell and his home but got no reply from either doesnt anybody answer the damn phone anymore he asked nobody in particular the only people within earshot were barker and ellie they just exchanged looks and returned to their business with renewed vigor lopez asked ellie to head over to reeds until lloyd made an appearance then left barker at the station while he took a ride over to greg bradleys office the door was unlocked he stepped inside and saw the papers on the floor and the cracked glass in the office door where gregs body had struck it he drew his gun and advanced toward the room it was empty but there was a dark stain on the carpet he checked the other rooms and found them empty he had just picked up his handset to call barker back at the station when he heard a sound from the closet at the end of the hallway its doors were chained and locked lopez ran to it someone was trying to speak but the words were indistinct greg the voice spoke again ill have you out of there in a second he said he took his baton twisted it against the chain then pulled the handle on the closet popped out of the wood releasing the door it shot open and what was left of greg bradley tumbled out onto the floor his face was entirely black and his eyes were hidden beneath his swollen flesh most of his hair had fallen out and what remained were gray strands stuck to the lesions that had opened in his scalp lopez turned away feeling himself start to retch at the smell uhee said bradley i cant bradleys hand tried to grip at lopezs shirt but it had no strength uhee repeated bradley uhee sick his consciousness was failing the black things eating away at him consuming him by turning his own body against him he could not remember his own name or where he was he was lost in the growing darkness and he would never be found again all that was left was pain and the memory of the man who had brought it and then even that was gone lopez eased bradleys body slowly to the floor uhee buddy at that moment buddy carson was standing in the shadows at the back of eddy reeds bar the place was filling up nicely with more cars arriving every minute a small lithe female cop was helping to direct the new arrivals into the parking lot buddy waited patiently he knew his chance would come and it did a fat woman in a nissan three of her howling brood crammed into the backseat tried to buck the oneway system in the lot in order to grab a parking space close to the bars back door unfortunately she reckoned without a big explorer which was next in line for the space and which pipped the nissan there was some shouting which confirmed buddys view that the neighborliness in this town was only skindeep before the nissan backed away glancing against someones lexus and setting off the alarm the couple who owned the lexus had not yet made it to the bar and the sound of the alarm brought them scurrying back it also brought the cop who had to skirt the dumpsters behind which buddy lay he grabbed her quickly and without fuss then left her bleeding amidst the trash five minutes later he was heading for the bar the call about lloyd hopkins came just seconds after lopez finished up with barker he had given the young parttimer a description of buddy carson and told him to alert the state police he was trying to raise ellie when barker came back to him on the radio he sounded on the verge on tears chief its lloyd he said a couple of kids think theyve found his body behind the old metzgers bowl his cars there too they say hes been beat on pretty bad what do you want me to do jesus not lloyd lopez felt a wrenching in his gut who are the kids ben ryder and the capoore girl pat capoores daughter the girl from the motel she knew lloyd hopkins by sight im heading out there he told barker get back on to the troopers again tell them we have one officer dead and the suspect is carson buddy carson lopez didnt know for sure that carson was responsible for lloyd hopkinss death but he was the best suspect nobody local would ever even raise a voice to lloyd hopkins and chris he added you tell them to use extreme caution tell them not to even touch this guy i think theres something wrong with him he may be contagious you understand he was about to hit the lights and speed to metzgers but paused before activating the siren first link frazier was diagnosed with cancer then greg bradleys receptionist had alerted him to two further possible cases now greg was dead his face a mess of tumors and lloyd hopkinss body was lying in the deserted lot of an abandoned bowling alley beaten and maybe diseased but cancer wasnt contagious it didnt work that way he tried raising ellie again but with no success instead he took out his cell and called reeds eddy picked up on the third ring reeds how can i help you eddy its jim lopez do me a favor look out into the lot see if you cant spot ellie winters he could hear voices in the background and laughter music was playing hang on chief said reed the phone was put down and in that instant lopez made his decision minutes went by before the phone was picked up again but by the time eddy came back on the line lopez was in sight of the bar no i dont see her anywhere her cars outside but eddy reed paused hold on theres something happening he said then the music died and lopez heard somebody start to scream buddy had been preparing himself all day working on the poison within him until it was distilled to its purest essence he could feel it responding to his thoughts readying itself for what lay ahead the fluid with which he had blinded lloyd hopkins was waste matter and nothing more he had kept back the real stuff so that when he touched the first woman over by the ladies room the release of energy rocked him on his heels he could almost see the black fluid seeping through his pores and entering the base of her skull he felt lightheaded and giddy with power even as the womans skin puckered and blackened before him she spun toward him her fingers reaching back to try to find the source of the pain but buddy was already moving he touched a fat man on the hand and a waitress on the shoulder blade her tray fell to the floor the glasses upon it shattering then a woman screamed buddy thought it might be the bitch at the toilets but in fact it was one of her companions responding to the sight of the creeping tumor colonizing her friends face buddy felt somebody reach for him the mans hand closing firmly on his shoulder without looking buddy slapped back at his face and felt the surge again as the transfer occurred he was making for the far corner of the bar where a familiar blondhaired woman was talking to a man in a gray suit he had spotted the cops girlfriend as soon as he entered the bar he liked the idea of taking her while the venom was still so strong in him he stretched out his arms in a crucifixion pose his fingers trailing behind him brushing against skin cloth hair as he began moving like a dark messiah through the crowd quickly losing count of those whom he touched for a moment he found himself in a clear space he drew a deep breath his eyes briefly closing and felt the worm uncoiling deep within his bowels he released the breath and opened his eyes the bullet hit him in the right shoulder spinning him into the bar he saw the female cop in the side entrance hallway cold air entering through the open door behind her her hair was matted with blood and rivulets of red ran down the side of her face she was almost slumped against the doorjamb weakened by her injuries and exhausted by the effort it had taken her to get to the bar buddy reached under his shirt for the gun he had taken from lloyd hopkins as ellie tried to clear her vision for a second shot there was no pain from the wound but the arm of buddys shirt was soaked in a black viscous fluid people were shouting and screaming trying to put as much space between him and them as possible most of them were already on the ground or seeking cover behind tables and flimsy chairs buddy felt his body changing it was as though he were being stretched to bursting by some unseen force he looked at his hands and saw his pores widening expanding in size until his skin appeared to be pocked with halfinchwide holes they spat black fluid like miniature volcanoes erupting he felt more of them appear on his face and liquid pressure building behind his eyes increasing the bulge in his sockets and distorting his eyesight the great worm writhed in his belly and he felt it shoot tendrils through his system causing him to spasm in agony his clothing started to tear as dark nodes pressed upward bursting through the denim and twisting in the air like newborn eels in clear water buddys hand found the gun and drew it from his belt the muzzle of the cops pistol wavered then fell as ellie lost consciousness her body sliding down the jamb buddy aimed following her progress down he saw her as a vague blue blur almost lost amid the blackness encroaching upon his vision he could kill her now or use her to relieve some of the great force that threatened to overwhelm him buddy dropped the gun and advanced on the prone cop something tore a hole in the center of his being a black spray erupted from his chest dousing the tables and the floor buddy was propelled forward tripping over ellies body as his hands scrabbled at the walls to prevent himself from falling he opened his mouth to scream aware of the massive shock that his system had endured there was a great wound in his chest he touched his fingers to it and thought that he saw at last the black worm twisting and biting in the corrupted remains of his flesh its movements appeared frenzied and tormented as though it sensed buddys end was near and was now intent upon chewing its way out of its hosts system before it collapsed entirely he turned to see lopez standing at the bar the stock of the big shotgun firm against his shoulder buddys mouth was filled with fluid it coursed down from the corners of his mouth as he spoke turning his chin dark and losing itself in the hole in his chest his vision left him and he felt a great absence within as the link between the worm and himself was abruptly severed no cure said buddy he was smiling in his final agonies his mouth a mass of yellow and black like the halfchewed remains of wasps no cure for cancer buddy raised his gun blindly and lopez blew the top of his head off vi by the time the state police arrived buddy carsons remains had turned to a dark clotted mass on the floor of reeds bar with only his clothes his boots and his white straw hat to indicate that this had once been the form of a man the snows came the next day and piles of earth later marred the whiteness of the town cemetery as the bodies were buried more would follow as buddy carsons victims succumbed to the disease with which he had infected them some died quickly others dragged on for weeks nobody lasted longer than a month reeds bar closed so did the easton motel as jed followed his son phil into the ground people left for new places and the town began to decay as surely as if buddy had found a way to taint its buildings and corrode its streets it was the beginning of the end for easton even lopez left he followed the trail of pain and death back to colorado and drank a beer with jerry schneider who told him of what he had seen at the benson farm he traveled through wyoming and idaho and ended up in nebraska before the trail ran dry he returned to new hampshire and settled down with elaine olssen near nashua but he never forgot buddy carson he never forgot the cancer cowboy in a desert in western nevada a man dressed in cheap denim opens his eyes he is lying on the sand and though the sun beats down upon him his skin has not burned he cannot remember his name or how he came to be here he knows only that he is in pain and he needs to reach out to someone the man rises to his feet the lizard skin cowboy boots strangely familiar upon his feet and heads for the highway mr pettingers d√¶mon the bishop was a skeletal man with long unwrinkled fingers and raised dark veins that ran across his pale skin like tree roots over snowy ground his head was very bald tapering to a point at the top of his skull and his face was either scrupulously cleanshaven or quite without natural hair of any kind he was dressed entirely in purples and crimsons apart from the white collar that rested at his neck like a displaced halo when he stood to greet me deep reds flowing from the pale sharpness of his head i was struck by his resemblance to a bloody dagger i watched as the fingers of his left hand curled slowly and carefully around the bowl of his pipe while his right hand gently tamped tobacco into the hollow there was something almost spiderlike about the way those fingers moved i decided that i didnt like the bishops fingers but then i didnt like the bishop we sat at opposite sides of the marble fireplace in his library the flames in its grate the only source of illumination in the great room until the bishop struck the match in his hand and applied it to his pipe the action seemed to deepen the sockets of his eyes and gave a yellow aspect to his pupils i observed him draw upon the stem until i could abide the sucking of his lips no longer then turned my attention to the volumes upon his shelves i wondered how many of them the bishop had read he seemed to me to be the kind of man who distrusted books wary of the seeds of sedition and independent thought that they might sow in minds less disciplined than his own how have you been mr pettinger the bishop asked when his pipe was lighted to his satisfaction i thanked him for his concern and assured him that i was feeling much better i still had some trouble with my nerves and at night i twisted in my sleep to the sounds of shelling and the scurrying of rats in the trenches but there was little point in telling that to the man before me there were others who had returned in a far worse state of disintegration than i their bodies ruined their minds shattered like dropped crystal somehow i had managed to retain all my limbs and a little of my sanity i liked to think that it was god who protected me through it all even when it appeared that he had turned his back upon us and left us to our fate although sometimes in my darkest moments i believed that he had deserted me long ago if he ever existed at all strange the things that one recalls there were so many horrors experienced amid the flesh and dirt that to choose one above another seemed almost absurd as if an ascending graph might somehow be created in which offenses against humanity were graded according to their impact on the individual psyche yet again and again i came back to a group of soldiers standing against a flat muddy landscape broken only by the trunk of a single blasted tree some still had blood around their mouths although so mired in filth were they that it was hard to tell where men ended and mud began they were found in a shell crater by advancing troops after a furious battle led to a minute shift in our lines four british soldiers crouched over the body of a fifth man their hands working upon him tearing strips of warm meat from his bones and feeding them greedily into their mouths the dead soldier was a german but that hardly mattered somehow this quartet of deserters had contrived to survive for weeks in the nomansland between the two lines by feeding upon the bodies of slain soldiers there was no trial and no record was kept of their execution their papers were long gone and they declined to offer their names before the sentence was carried out their leader or at least the one to whose authority the others most clearly deferred was in his thirties the youngest still in his teens i was permitted to say a few words on their behalf to beg forgiveness for what they had done i was standing to one side of them praying as they were blindfolded when the eldest one spoke to me i have tasted it he said i have eaten the word made flesh now god is in me and i am god he tasted good he tasted of blood then he turned to face the guns and they spoke his name i am god i taste of blood this too i decided not to share with the bishop i was uncertain of the bishops views on god sometimes i suspected that he considered the concept of the lord as merely a convenient way of keeping the masses in check while securing his own authority i doubted if his beliefs had ever been tested beyond the occasional intellectual joust over sherry how he would have fared in the mud of the trenches i do not know i think perhaps that he would have survived but only at the expense of others and how are you finding your time at the hospital as with all of the bishops utterances it was important to understand the subtext before one answered thus in reply to the bishops earlier question i was tolerably well even though i was not now he was inquiring about the army hospital at brayton to which i had been assigned upon my return from the war i ministered to those who had been deprived of limbs or senses attempting to ease their pain and to make them understand that god was still with them and while i was nominally a member of the hospital staff i felt that i was as much a patient there as they were for i too required pills to help me sleep and had occasional recourse to the more enlightened of the head doctors in an effort to shore up my fractured sanity i had been back in england for six months all i wanted was some quiet place where i could minister to the needs of my flock preferably a flock that was not intent upon blowing out the brains of someone elses flock the bishop had the power to grant me my wish if he chose to do so i had no doubt that he was astute enough to sense my dislike although i imagined that my feelings were of little concern to him if nothing else could be said for the bishop at least he was not in the habit of allowing his emotions or the emotions of others to influence his decisions his question still dangled in the air between us if i told him that i was happy at the hospital he would transfer me to a more arduous posting if i told him that i was unhappy at the hospital i would be there until my dying day i was hoping that you might have found a living for me i replied opting to answer a different question entirely i am anxious to resume parochial work the bishop waved those arachnoid fingers in response in time mr pettinger in time we must walk before we can run first i require you to comfort an afflicted member of our own flock you know chetwyndark i assume i knew it chetwyndark was a small parish perhaps a mile or two from the southwest coast one minister hardly any parishioners and not the most rewarding of livings but there had been a church there for a long time a very long time mr fell currently has responsibility for the parish said the bishop despite possessing many admirable qualities he has endured his difficulties in the past chetwyndark was adjudged to be a suitable place for him torecuperate i had heard stories of mr fell his disintegration was rumored to have been quite spectacular involving alcoholism unexplained absences from services and obscure rantings from the pulpit during those services that he remembered to attend it was the last that proved to be his undoing for in making public his difficulties he embarrassed the bishop and the bishop was a man who prized dignity and decorum above all else mr fells punishment was to be banished to a living where few would be present to listen to his ravings although i did not doubt that the bishop retained agents in chetwyndark who would keep him apprised of the ministers activities i was told that he suffered a crisis of faith i said the bishop paused before answering he sought proof of that which must be understood through faith alone and when that proof was not forthcoming he began to doubt everything in chetwyndark it was believed that he might find a place in which to heal his doubts and to rediscover his love of god the words i thought emerged hollowly from the shell of the bishop but it appears that we were wrong to assume that mr fell was capable of restoring himself in comparative solitude i am informed that he has begun to behave even more oddly than usual he has taken to locking the church i hear from the inside he also appears to be engaged in some form of renovation work for which he is temperamentally and vocationally illsuited his congregation has heard him digging and hacking at the stones within although i am told that there are as yet no obvious signs of damage to the chapel itself what would you have me do i asked you are practiced in the art of dealing with broken men i have heard good reports of your work at brayton reports that lead me to believe that you are perhaps ready to return to more conventional duties let this be your first step toward the living for which you ask i want you to talk to your brother cleric comfort him try to understand his needs if necessary have him committed but i want this to stop do i make myself clear mr pettinger i want no more trouble from mr fell and with that i was dismissed the next day my replacement arrived at brayton a young man named mr dean with the instructions of his tutors still ringing in his ears after an hour in the wards he retreated to the bathroom when he eventually emerged his face was considerably paler and he was wiping his mouth with a handkerchief youll get used to it i assured him although i knew he would not after all i never did i wondered how long it would be before the bishop was forced to replace mr dean as well the train brought me to evanstowe from there a car arranged by the bishop collected me and brought me ten miles west to chetwyndark depositing me after a cursory farewell from the driver at the entrance to mr fells garden it was raining and i could smell salt on the air as i walked up the path to the ministers house the sound of the departing car gradually fading as it returned to evanstowe beyond accessible by another paved pathway was the church itself silhouetted against the evening sky it stood not at the center of the village but about half a mile beyond it and there were no other dwellings within sight of it it had once been a catholic church but it was sacked during the reign of henry and then later claimed for the new faith small and almost primitive in construction it still retained something of rome about it a light burned in the depths of the house but when i knocked no one came i tried the door and it opened easily revealing a wooden hallway leading to a kitchen straight ahead with a flight of stairs to the right and a doorway to the left into a living room mr fell i called but there was no reply in the kitchen some bread lay on a plate covered by a napkin a jug of buttermilk beside it upstairs both bedrooms were empty one was tidy with spare blankets laid out carefully at the base of a newly made bed but the other bedroom was strewn with clothes and halfeaten food the sheets upon the bed did not appear to have been laundered in some time and there was a smell from them as of an old mans unwashed body there were cobwebs on the windows and mouse droppings upon the floor yet it was the writing desk that drew my attention for it and what lay upon it had obviously been the focus of mr fells interest for some time i cleared some stained shirts from the chair and sat down to examine his labors under ordinary circumstances i would not have intruded upon another mans privacy in such a way but my duty here was to the bishop not to mr fell his cause was already lost i did not want mine to join it three old manuscripts so yellow and worn that the writing had almost faded away occupied pride of place at the center of a storm of papers the language was latin but the script was in no way ornate instead it was neat almost businesslike at the end beside an illegible signature was a darker stain it looked like old dried blood the documents appeared to be incomplete with sections missing or unintelligible but mr fell had made a considerable job of translating what remained in his neat script he had recorded three extended sections the first of which related to the foundation of the original church at the end of the last millennium the second appeared to describe the location of a particular stone formation on the floor originally marked by a tomb of some kind beside it was a rubbing on thin paper revealing a date adand a simple cross behind which was a design of some kind i could make out an eye at either side of the vertical trunk of the cross and a great mouth segmented by the lower as though the cross were resting upon the face beneath long hair streamed from its skull and its eyes were huge with fury but the features were not human it reminded me of a gargoyle but the impishness of such creatures was absent and a grave malevolence appeared in its place i turned to the third part of mr fells ongoing work he had obviously encountered the greatest difficulty with this section the translation was littered with gaps or guessed words indicated by question marks but he had underlined the terms of which he was certain they included entombed and malefic but there was one that had been repeated again and again throughout the text and which mr fell had in turn emphasized in his translation that word was d√¶mon i left my bag in the second uncluttered bedroom and looked out of the window it faced toward the chapel and there i saw that a light burned i watched it flicker for a time then went downstairs and remembering mr fells reported habit of locking the church searched until i found a set of dusty keys in a small cabinet these in hand i took an umbrella from the stand beside the door and made my way to the house of god the front entrance was locked and through a gap in the door i could see that a bar had been raised across it from within i knocked hard and called mr fells name but there was no reply i was walking to the rear of the church when close by the east wall but low almost as if it came from beneath the ground i heard a slight noise it was the sound of someone tunneling slowly inch by inch and yet listen though i might i could not discern the use of any tool it was as if all the work were being done by hand i continued quickly to the back door and tried each key in turn until the lock clicked and i found myself standing in an alcove of the chapel with carved heads on the cornices above me and as i stood the sound of digging came again to me mr fell i called and i was surprised to find my voice catching in my throat so that the words came out as almost a croak i tried again louder this time mr fell the digging from below stopped i swallowed hard and moved toward a lamp that burned in a small nook my feet echoing softly on the stone floor rainwater and sweat mingled upon my face the moisture tasted like blood upon my tongue the first thing i saw was the hole in the floor beside which stood a second oil lamp its fuel almost depleted so that the flame was tiny and flickering a number of stones had been removed and placed against the wall leaving a gap big enough for a man to squeeze through one of the stones i noticed was the model for the rubbing on mr fells desk now although the stone was worn the face behind the cross could be more clearly discerned and what i had taken to be flowing hair now appeared to be flames and smoke issuing from the features of the creature so that the cross seemed to be branding it the hole itself was dark and dropped gently down but i thought that i could discern another light deeper within i was about to call again when the digging resumed this time with greater urgency and the sound made me stumble back in fright on the floor the oil lamp was almost sputtering its last i took the second lamp from the nook and knelt at the opening i caught the smell that came from within faint but definite the stench of waste matter i took my handkerchief from my pocket and wrapped it around my nose and mouth then i sat on the lip of the hole and gently lowered myself down the tunnel was narrow and sloped and i felt myself sliding on stone and loose earth for a few feet the lamp held low before me in case it might break upon the roof for a moment i feared that i might fall into some great chasm with only darkness around me as i plummeted never to be found again instead i landed on stone and found myself in a low tunnel perhaps only four feet at its highest point which curved ahead of me and to the right behind me there was only a blank wall it was intensely cold in the tunnel the sound of digging was stronger and more noticeable now but so too was the smell of excrement holding my lamp ahead of me i walked crouching along the stone flags of the tunnel following it as it sloped down ever down where old supports had decayed someonei guessed that it was mr fellhad made improvements adding new braces to hold the roof one support in particular caught my eye it was larger than the others and covered in carvings of writhing serpents with the face of a beast at its highest point tusks sprouting from either side of a snouted mouth its eyes hidden beneath a thick wrinkled brow the face was reminiscent of that on the marker stone in the chapel although better preserved and far more detailed in its depiction for i had noticed no tusks before two heavy ropes snaked from either side of the brace with a knot at each end when i looked closely i found them connected to a pair of iron rods hammered into a gap in the stone the ropes were new the rods old from the looks of them if these ropes were pulled then the stones would collapse taking the brace with them and i wondered why this tunnel had ever been built and why someone had taken the precaution of contriving a mechanism to destroy it if the need arose the digging grew closer and closer the tunnel ever cooler it was narrower now and far more difficult to negotiate but i found myself hurrying my curiosity briefly overcoming my unease i was crouched almost double and the stench was becoming unbearable when i rounded a corner and my foot touched something soft i looked down and heard myself moan a man lay at my feet his mouth contorted and his face deathly white his eyes were open and there was blood in the corneas where tiny vessels had burst under some dreadful pressure his hands were raised slightly as if to ward off something before him the clothes of his ministry were tattered and filthy but i had no doubt that i was in the presence of the remains of the late mr fell when i looked up i saw what i thought at first was simply a stone wall but at the center of the wall was a hole big enough for a mans head to fit through from behind it came that picking sound and i knew then what i had been hearing it was not mr fell digging down but something else digging up i raised the lamp and examined the breach in the wall at first i saw nothing the wall was so thick that my light barely penetrated through the hole i drew closer and suddenly there was a gleam from within as the lamp caught a pair of eyes entirely black as if the pupils had permanently enlarged themselves over time desperately seeking light in that dark place there was a flash of yellow bone as those great tusks were revealed followed by a hiss like an exhalation of breath then the image was gone and a moment later the presence in the chamber struck the wall from behind i heard it grunting with effort as it retreated and threw itself once more against the barrier dust descended upon me from the roof and i thought i heard some of the stones in the wall shifting a claw appeared through the hole its fingers were long impossibly so and appeared to be jointed at least five or six times huge curved nails erupted from the ends clouded with dirt a gray scaling covered the bones and thick dark hairs protruded from cracks in the skin it reached for me and i felt its fury its malevolence its searing desperate intelligence and its absolute loneliness it had been imprisoned here in the darkness for so long until mr fell had commenced his translation and begun to explore moving rock from where it had fallen clearing debris and restoring braces as he drew closer and closer to the mystery of this place the fingers were withdrawn and the beast hurled itself again at the wall a fine tracery of cracks shot out from the hole at its center like threads on a spiders web i retreated backing farther and farther away from it until the tunnel grew wide enough that i felt that i could turn for a moment i thought that i had trapped myself in doing so and found that i could go neither backward nor forward now the beast was howling but in between its cries i thought i could discern words although they were spoken in no language that i had ever heard with a final effort that tore my coat sleeve from my arm and ripped open a wound on my skin i freed myself and ran i heard stone falling behind me and i knew that the creature was close to breaking through seconds later my fears were realized for i discerned the sound of its clawed feet upon the stones as it pursued me through the tunnel i began to pray and cry at once so terrified was i my feet could not move fast enough and the narrow curving passageway arrested my pace i could sense the thing growing nearer could almost feel its breath on my neck i cried out and considered using my lamp as a weapon but i feared being trapped in darkness with the beast and so i continued to run never looking back cutting my skin on the stones and stumbling twice on the uneven ground until i reached once more that ornate support where i turned to face it at last there came the sound of those talons scraping on the stone moving faster and faster as i groped for the ropes found them and pulled nothing happened i heard iron bolts falling but no more a clawed hand appeared at the edge of the tunnel its nails scraping along the stones and i prepared to die but as i closed my eyes something rumbled above me and i pushed myself back instinctively the tunnel shook as the beast advanced and a shower of rocks fell at my feet i heard the thing roar and suddenly it was lost from sight as the ceiling collapsed yet i thought that i could still hear it as the rocks descended howling in rage and frustration as it retreated farther and farther in its efforts to escape burial beneath tons of rubble then i too was running until at last i was hauling myself up into the blessed calm of the chapel and dust was belching from the hole and the sound of stones falling seemed to go on forever i received my living it is a small church an old church there is sunken ground nearby and visitors sometimes stop and stare at this unexplained and recent phenomenon some damage to the floor of the chapel has been repaired and a new larger stone set in the place where mr fell began his excavations that stone now marks his burial site i have few parishioners and fewer duties i read i write i take long walks by the seashore sometimes i brood on mr fell and the great thirst for proof of the existence of the divine that led him to begin his excavation as though by finding its opposite he might somehow have banished all of his doubts i light candles for him and i pray for his soul the documents have been taken away and now i suspect they rest in the bishops safe or in the care of his superiors perhaps their ashes lie in his fireplace as he tamps tobacco into his pipe and lights its bowl in the darkness of his library where they were discovered and how they came to be in mr fells possession remains a mystery their origins do not matter and their confiscation does not trouble me i do not need yellowed paper to recall the creature to mind it stays with me and it will always be thus for sometimes when i am in the church alone at night i believe that i can hear it digging patiently and intently moving tiny stone after tiny stone its progress infinitesimally slow yet still progress for all that it can wait after all it has eternity the erlking how should i begin this story once upon a time perhaps but no thats not right that makes it a story of long ago and far away and its not that kind of story its not that kind of story at all better then to begin the tale as i remember it after all it is my story mine to tell mine in experience i am old now but i am not foolish i still bar the doors and lock the windows at night i still check in the shadows before i sleep and give the dogs free roam through the house for they will smell him if he comes again and i will be ready for him the walls are stone and we keep torches burning there are always blades to hand but it is fire that he fears the most he will take no one from my house he will steal no child from under my roof my father was not such a careful man he knew the old stories for he told them to me when i was a boy tales of the sandman who tears out the eyes of small boys who will not sleep and of baba yaga the demon witch who rides in a chariot of old bones and rests her palms on the skulls of children and of scylla the sea monster who drags men into the depths and has an appetite that can never be appeased but he never spoke of the erlking all that my father would say was that i should not venture into the woods alone and that i should never stay out beyond nightfall there were things out there he would say wolves and worsethanwolves there is myth and there is reality one we tell and one we hide we create monsters and hope that the lessons wrapped in their tales will serve to guide us when we encounter that which is most terrible in life we give forged names to our fears and pray that we may face nothing worse than what we ourselves have created we lie to protect our children and in lying we expose them to the greatest of harms our family lived in a small house close to the edge of the forest at the northern end of our little village at night the moon would drench the trees relieving the dark expanse of woodland and creating silver spire upon silver spire receding into the distance like a convergence of churches beyond were mountains and great cities and lakes as wide as oceans so that a man might stand on one side and be unable to see land on the other in my childs mind i would picture myself passing through the barrier of the woods and into the great realm that they concealed from me at other times the trees would promise me shelter from the adult world a cocoon of wood and leaves in which to hide myself for such is the lure of dark places for a child i would sit at my bedroom window late at night and listen to the sounds of the forest i learned to distinguish the hooting of owls the flapping of bat wings the panicked scurrying of small things seeking to eat without being consumed in their turn all of these elements were familiar to me and they lulled me to sleep this was my world and for a time there was nothing in it that was not known to me yet i recall one night when all seemed quiet when it appeared that everything living in the darkness below had momentarily stifled a breath and as i listened i sensed a presence moving through the consciousness of the forest searching hunting a wolf howled a quaver in its tone and i could hear the fear communicated in its cry within moments the howl turned to a whine rising in pitch until it resembled a scream before it was suddenly cut off forever and the wind blew the curtains as if the woods had at last released their breath it seemed that we lived our lives at the very edge of civilization aware always that beyond us lay the wildness of the forest when we played in the schoolyard our cries hung in the air for a moment then seemed to be sucked into the dense woods our childish voices wandering lost between the trees before fading at last into nothingness but beyond that tree line a creature waited and it drew our voices from the air like a hand plucking an apple from a tree and it devoured us in its mind there was a light dusting of snow upon the ground the earliest fall of winter when first i saw it we were playing in a field by the church chasing a red leather ball that stood out like blood upon the whiteness of the ground a gust of wind arose where no wind had been before it carried the ball upon it until it came to rest in a patch of young alders some distance into the forest unthinkingly i followed as soon as i passed beyond the first of the great fir trees the air around me grew colder and the voices of my companions were lost to me dark growths of fungus hung upon the shaded sides of the trees close to the ground i saw a dead bird lying at the base of one such cluster its body collapsed in upon itself and seepage from the mushrooms frozen above it in a yellow glotted mass there was blood on its beak and its eyes were tightly closed as though the bird were lost forever in the remembrance of its final pain i moved farther into the forest the imprint of my passing trailing behind me like an unseen rank of lost souls i parted a cluster of alders and reached for the ball and as i did so the wind spoke to me it said boy come to me boy i looked around but there was no one near me the voice came again closer now and in the shadows before me a figure moved i thought at first that it was the branch of a tree so thin and dark was it its frame wreathed in gray as if spiders had spun a thick skein across it but the branch reached out and the twigs of its fingers gathered and beckoned waves of strange desire emanated from it they washed over me like the tides of a polluted sea leaving me filthy and soiled boy beautiful boy delicate boy come boy embrace me i grabbed the ball and backed away but my foot caught on one of the twisted roots beneath the snow i fell heavily on my back and a light thread touched my face it was a gossamer strand of web strong and sticky which clung to my hair and seemed to coil around my fingers as i tried to push it away then a second fell and a third heavier now like the filaments of a fishing net dim light speared through the trees and thousands of floating strands were revealed from the shadows where the gray being waited line upon line of web floated so that the figure appeared to be disintegrating shedding itself upon me i struggled and opened my mouth to cry out but the threads were falling thickly now and they descended upon my tongue and tangled themselves around it so that i could not speak the being advanced silver web heralding its approach and the mesh seemed to tighten upon me as i moved with all the strength that i had i pushed myself backward upon the ground and felt the strands catching on the roots tearing apart and freeing me from their grasp branches scratched my face and snow gathered in my boots as i burst through the tree line the ball still in my hands and as i drew away that voice came again boy beautiful boy and i knew that it wanted me and that it would not rest until it had savored me that night i could not sleep i recalled the web and the voice from the darkness of the forest and my eyes refused to close i twisted and turned but i could find no rest despite the cold outside the room was unbearably warm so that i was forced to kick the sheet from my body and lie naked upon the bed yet i must have drifted into sleep for it seemed that something caused my eyes to flicker open and i found the light in the room was no longer what it had been there were shadows in the corners where no shadows belonged they shifted and twisted but the trees outside remained undisturbed and the curtains on the windows hung still and unmoving and then i heard it a soft low voice like the rustling of dead leaves boy i rose up suddenly my hands reaching for the sheet to cover my body but the sheet was gone i looked around and saw it lying discarded beneath the window even in my worst thrashings i could not have sent it so far from my bed boy come to me boy in that corner a presence seemed to hover at first it was almost shapeless like an old blanket that has begun to rot and strands of spiderweb filigreed themselves upon it the moonlight illuminated folds of faded wrinkled skin that hung across its stickthin arms like old bark ivy curled around its limbs and wreathed the thin fingers that now beckoned to me from the shadows where its face might have been there were only dead leaves and darknessexcept at its mouth where small white teeth glistened come to me boy it repeated let me hold you no i said i curled my legs up before me trying to make myself as small as possible to expose to it as little of my body as i could no go away at the ends of its fingers an oval shape glittered it was a mirror its frame carefully ornamented and shapes like dragons chased each other around its edges look boy a gift for you if you let me embrace you the mirrors face was turned to me and for an instant i saw my own face reflected in its surface for that single fleeting moment i was not alone in the mirrors bright reaches other faces crowded around mine tiny facestens hundreds thousands of them a whole legion of the lost small fists beat at the glass as if hoping to break through to the other side and among them its eyes huge with terror i saw my own face and i knew that this was how it could be please leave me alone i was trying not to cry but my cheeks burned and my sight grew misty the thing hissed and for the first time i became conscious of the smell a dense loamy stench of rotting leaves and still dank water a lighter less foul odor drifted in and out of my senses curling through the stink of decay like a snake through the undergrowth it was the scent of alder the stick hand gestured again and this time a puppet danced at the ends of its fingers a small infant carefully carved so lifelike that it looked like a tiny person a homunculus silhouetted against the moonlight it jerked and danced as the fingers moved yet i could see no strings controlling its limbs and when i looked closer i could discern no joins at its elbows or legs the creatures arm extended moving the puppet closer to me and i could not help but give a little moan of fear when the true dimensions of the marionette became clear for it was not a toy not in any sense that we might mean it was a human baby tiny and perfectly formed with wide unblinking eyes and dark ruffled hair the thing gripped it by the skull applying pressure to which the child responded by moving its arms and legs in protest its mouth was open but it made no sound and no tears fell from its eyes it was dead it seemed and yet somehow alive a beautiful toy said the shadow being for a beautiful boy i tried to shout out then but it seemed as though fingers had grasped my tongue and gripped it tightly i could taste the thing in my mouth and for the first time in my life i knew what it would be like to die for the tang of death was upon its skin the hand moved in a flash and the child was gone do you know me boy i shook my head perhaps it was a dream i thought only in dreams were you unable to cry out only in dreams could a sheet spring unbidden from a bed only in dreams could a being that smelled of leaves and stagnant water hold a dead child before you and make it dance i am the erlking i have always been and i will always be i am the erlking and i take what i desire would you deny me my desire come with me and i will give you treasures and toys i will give you sweet things to eat and i will call you beloved until the day you die from where its eyes should have been two black butterflies fluttered forth like tiny mourners at a wake then the mouth opened wide and its knotted fingers reached for me and something caught in its voice as desire overwhelmed it the erlking advanced and i saw him in all his terrible glory a cloak of human skins hung upon his shoulders falling almost to the floor and in place of ermine it was fringed with scalps yellow hair and dark hair and red hair all interwoven like the colors of autumn trees beneath the cloak lay a silver breastplate intricately carved with details of naked bodies intertwining so many of them that it was impossible to tell where one individual began and another ended there was a crown of bone upon his head each tine the remains of a childs finger bound with gold wire curling inward as though beckoning me to add to their number and yet i could see no face beneath the crown all that was visible was that dark mouth with its white teeth appetite made flesh with all the strength of will that i could muster i sprang from my bed and leapt for the door from behind me came the sound of leaves rustling and branches scraping i twisted the door handle but the sweat of my palms made it slippery and treacherous i fumbled once then again the stench of rotting vegetation grew stronger in my nostrils i let out a little whine of panic and then the doorknob was turning my feet were on the passageway and branches were scraping at my naked back i wrenched myself away and with one twisting motion pulled the door closed behind me i should have run to my father then but some instinct sent me to the fireplace in the parlor where the last flickering embers of the fire still remained i took a stick from the woodpile wrapped a rag around it and soaked it in oil from the lamp i plunged it into the fire and watched as the flames leapt before me i lifted a hearthrug from the floor and wrapped it around my body then my bare feet slapping softly on the cold flagstones i made my way back to my room i listened silently before turning the handle of the door and pushing it open slowly before me the room was empty the only shadows that moved came from the flickering of the flame i made my way to the corner where the erlking had stood but now there were only cobwebs and the drained husks of dead insects i stood at the window but the woods beyond were quiet i pulled the window closed but as i stretched to do so i became aware of a pain in my back i reached behind me and my fingers came back with blood at the tips in the small shard of mirror that hung above my jug and bowl i could see a series of four long slashes across my back i thought that i screamed except that no noise came from my lips instead the scream came from the room where my father and mother both slept and i followed the sound in the sputtering torchlight i saw my father at the open window and my mother on her knees beside the overturned cradle where my younger brother slept each night swaddled in blankets now there was no sleeping infant the blankets were strewn across the floor and a dense loamy smell as of rotting leaves and still waters hung in the room my mother never recovered she cried and cried until at last she could cry no more and then body and spirit surrendered themselves to eternal night my father grew old and quiet and the sadness hung about him like a mist i could not confess to him that i had denied the erlking and that he had taken another in my place i carried the blame inside me and vowed that i would never let him take another being who was under my protection now i lock the windows and bar the doors to the outside and give the dogs free roam of the house my childrens rooms are never locked so that i can reach them quickly day or night and i warn them that if they hear the knocking of branches at their window they must call me and never ever open the window themselves and if they see a bright and shiny object dangling from a tree branch then they must never reach for it but should continue on their way always remaining on the true path and if they hear a voice offering them sweet things to taste for the promise of an embrace then they should run and run and never look back and in the light of the fire i tell them tales of the sandman who tears out the eyes of small boys who will not sleep and of baba yaga the demon witch who rides in a chariot of old bones and rests her palms on the skulls of children and of scylla the sea monster who drags men into the depths and has an appetite that can never be appeased and i tell them of the erlking with his arms of bark and ivy and his soft rustling voice and his gifts to trap the unwary and his appetites which are so much worse than anything they can imagine i tell them of his desires so that they will know him in all his forms and they will be ready for him when he comes the new daughter in truth i cannot recall the first time i noticed the change in her behavior she was always developing alteringor so it seemedwith each passing day it is the element of being a parent that is most difficult to explain to those without children of their own the fact that every day brings something new and unexpected revealing some previously unsuspected facet of their personalities it is harder still for a father bringing up a daughter alone for there will always be some part of her hidden from him unknowable to him as she grows older the mystery of her intensifies and he is forced to rely on love and memories in an effort to remain close to the little girl that was once his own or perhaps i can talk only about myself and other men have no such fissures in their understanding after all i was married once and thought that i understood the woman who shared my bed but her dissatisfaction with the life she had made for herself must have been simmering for many years before it revealed itself to me i was shocked when it emerged but not as shocked as i might have been i suppose looking back that her discontent must have communicated itself to me in a thousand subtle ways and that i had already been preparing myself to receive the blow long before it landed that makes me sound like a passive element in all that occurred but i am not by nature an aggressive man i am not even terribly proactive in most matters and when i look back on the path that led my wife and me to the altar it was she not i who made most of the running still i was prepared to fight her for the children even though my legal advisers and my instincts told me that the courts rarely decided in favor of the father in such cases to my surprise my wife decided that the children were a burden that she wished to relinquish at least for a time they were very youngsam was one louisa sixand my wife did not feel that she could take advantage of the opportunities she sought in the wider world while carrying two children in her arms she left them with me and there was an end to it she calls them a couple of times each year and sees them when she passes through the country sometimes she talks about them coming over to join her at some point but she knows that it will never happen they are settled and doing well in their lives they areor werei think happy sam is gentle and quiet and likes to stay close to me louisa is a more independent spirit inquisitive and testing of the constraints placed upon her and as she approaches adolescence these aspects of her character have become more and more pronounced and so it may have been that she had already become something different even before we took the house for the summer i do not know all i can say for certain is that i awoke one night to find her standing in the darkness by my bedside my son asleep beside me i said to my daughteror what used to be my daughterlouisa whats the matter she replied im not louisa i am your new daughter but i move ahead of myself i should explain that this announcement was preceded by some tumultuous months we moved abandoning our life in the city for what we hoped would be a more peaceful one in the countryside we sold our house for what still seems to me an obscene sum of money and bought an old rectory on five acres by the outskirts of the town of merrydown it was a beautiful property and absurdly underpriced leaving me with a considerable nest egg with which to provide for our comforts and for the education of my children both louisa and sam were due to transfer to new schools anyway and their friends would be scattered neither objected to the prospect of a move and my exwife after the obligatory grumblings decided to raise no formal objection in any case i informed them that nothing was written in stone we would try it for a time and if we were not all happy by the end of the trial period we would return to the city the house had five bedrooms four of them quite substantial in size so the children were able to claim spaces for themselves far larger than had previously been available to them in the city two remained unoccupied while i took possession of the last to the rear of the house in addition there was a large kitchen that overlooked the rear garden a dining room a study that i annexed for my own use and a spacious living area lined with oak bookshelves to one side of the house were some old stables they had not been used in some time but the faint smell of hay and horses still hung about them the stables were gloomy and damp and after a cursory investigation the children decided that they would provide little scope for play it appeared that the rectory had been on the market for some time although i did not learn why this was so until some months after it was sold to me apparently it had never provided a good living and the care of the villages flock now lay with clerics from the larger town of gravington who took turns offering services in the old chapel an artist an illustrator of childrens stories had lived in the rectory for a time after the last cleric had departed but she did not stay very long and had since died in a house fire far to the north i suspected that she had trouble keeping up the modest rent on the rectory if the nature of her work was anything to go by i came across a box of hers amid a heap of rubbish and dead branches at the back of the house some attempt had been made to burn the whole pile but either the fire had not taken or rain had doused it for the box was wet and the ink had run on many of the drawings still it was clear from what remained that her true vocation probably did not lie in working with material for children the illustrations were uniformly horrific i felt dominated by pale halfhuman creatures with melted features their eyes narrow oval slits their nostrils unusually wide and their mouths agape as though they relied predominantly on smell and taste for their survival some had long tattered wings extending from bony nodes upon their backs the membranes punctured and torn like those of dead dragonflies rotting on the spiders web i kept none of the drawings for fear that the images might disturb the children if found and the addition of a little paraffin to the fire ensured that this time all was burned there was nothing structurally at fault with the rectory itself and the introduction of new paint and furnishings meant that the previous dark hues and heavy drapes were quickly replaced by summer tones brightening our surroundings considerably there were apple trees at the end of the back garden from which a series of small sloped fields descended gradually toward a stream overhung by thick green trees it was good land but none of the locals appeared anxious to pursue grazing rights upon it for their cattle despite repeated offers on my part the reason for their reluctance could be traced to a mound in the third field equidistant from our house and the stream it was perhaps twenty feet in circumference and a little over six feet in height its origins were unclear some in the village referred to it as a fairy fort a former dwelling place for some older mythical race others said that it was a burial mound although it went unmentioned as such in archaeological records of the area and no one appeared to have any idea of who or what might be buried beneath it louisa liked the idea of having a fairy castle on our land and so she chose to regard it as such frankly i was happy to do the same little people being infinitely less troubling to my slumbers than the possibility of large numbers of old bones slowly decaying beneath green grass and daisies sam by contrast avoided the mound preferring that we take a circuitous path through adjoining fields rather than pass close by it while his more adventurous sister took the direct route frequently choosing to wave at us from her perch upon its topmost point as we passed sam was always a little in awe of his sister and her mercurial qualities while louisa in turn remained protective of her brother while simultaneously urging him to be less of a little boy and more of a man the result was that sam against his better judgment would find himself in awkward and sometimes painful situations from which his sister would have to extricate him these inevitably ended in tears recriminations and a temporary respite from his sisters dares before slowly she would set to work on him again there was always something new with which to tempt him some shiny aspect of herself with which to fascinate him once again perhaps that was why i failed to spot the changes in her for they took place against a constantly shifting backdrop of moods and humors yet now that i consider the matter more closely i do recall an incident two weeks after we arrived i woke to feel a cool breeze flowing through the house accompanied by the sound of a window beating against its frame i left my bed and followed the sound to my daughters bedroom she was standing at the window reaching out to the sill what are you doing i asked she turned quickly from the window pulling it closed behind her i thought i heard someone calling to me she said who would be calling to you i said the people in the fort she replied but she was smiling as she said it and i took it for a joke even as i noticed that she appeared to be concealing something from my view as she climbed back into bed i went to the window and looked out but i could see only blackness beyond on the windowsill itself i spied some fragments of painted wood torn from the frame close by the lock but then a wind rose and blew them away into the night i returned to louisa she had drifted back to sleep almost immediately as though she were wearied by her efforts her hands hidden beneath the blankets there was a leaf caught in her hair perhaps blown in through the window and i removed it gently brushing the rest of her hair away from her brow so that it would not tickle her in her sleep as i did so my fingers touched something rough close by her shoulder gingerly i drew back the blanket her doll molly which she always kept close to her in bed was gone in its place was a rough form made of straw and twigs it resembled a person except that its arms were unusually long and its torso was distended the belly enormous six matted strands of woven hair hung from its head there was a circular hole where its mouth might have been and oval sockets for eyes four dandelion leaves intersected at its back in a crude imitation of wings i saw movement inside the hollow of its abdomen i looked closer and discerned a large spider trapped beneath the branches and straw it could not have found its way inside by accident for the figure was too tightly woven instead whoever was responsible for its construction had deliberately placed the creature within it probed at the gaps attempting to escape from its prison as i removed the figure from my daughters grasp the spider seemed to shudder once then curled in upon itself and died i carried the primitive form from my daughters room and placed it on a shelf in my study before returning to bed when i went back to check on it the next morning it had fallen to pieces no trace of its previous form remained and the spider that had once dwelt within it was now merely a ball of dry withered limbs it was almost midday when i at last had a chance to talk to louisa about the incident of the night before but she could recall nothing of our conversation nor could she tell me where molly had gone or how the straw figure came to be in her place i left her scouring the house for her lost doll the sky had darkened and the promise of rain hung in the air sam was napping and our housekeeper a local woman named mrs amworth was keeping one eye on him while working through a pile of ironing despite the prospect of the weather changing i decided to take a walk and found myself not entirely without design making my way toward the mound in the third field even in bright sunshine it had a vaguely threatening aspect to it now beneath lowering skies and gray clouds it seemed almost to have a palpable consciousness as though something within were brooding and conspiring i tried to dismiss the sensation but louisas words from the night before kept returning to me her window faced out upon the mound she could see it in the distance when she stood at the glass beyond it lay only the river and empty fields i reached the mound and squatted silently at its base i laid my hand upon it the earth warm beneath my palm i was experiencing no unease now in fact quite the opposite i found myself relaxing my eyes closing the scent of wildflowers and running water filling my nostrils i wanted to rest to lie upon the ground and forget my worries to feel the grass against my skin i think that i almost began to stretch myself upon it when an image came unbidden to me i both saw and felt a presence approaching fast from beneath the mound ascending along a tunnel of earth and roots segmenting worms and crushing insects as it came i glimpsed white skin as of a creature that had spent too much time away from the light longlobed ears that came to sharp points wide flattened nostrils beneath slitted depressions where once eyes might have been revealed now concealed by a layer of veined skin and a mouth set in a permanent grin the lower lips drawn down to create a triangle of teeth flesh and gum its ruined wasted wings were held tight against its body occasionally flapping tentatively against the earth walls as though desirous of the freedom of flight that had long been denied them and it was not alone others followed it ascending toward where i knelt drawn by my warmth and driven by an anger that i could not comprehend my eyes snapped open my mind emerging from its torpor and i snatched my hand away and threw myself back from the mound but for a brief moment i felt movement beneath my palm as though some force had tried to thrust itself through the crust of the earth in order to grasp me to itself i rose to my feet and wiped the grass and dirt from my hands where my palm had rested only moments before i now glimpsed a patch of red warily i stabbed at it with a twig it tumbled down the slope of the mound a little pile of disturbed earth beneath it exposed by the movement and came to rest at my feet it was a dolls head separated from its body worms coiling through its thick red hair and beetles scurrying from the hollow of its neck it was the head of molly my daughters doll and it was only when the first drops of rain began to strike my face that i found the strength to pick it up and take it home later i went to louisas room and attempted to speak to her but she grew agitated and tearful denying with increasing force that she had done anything wrong and appearing genuinely shocked when i showed her the remains of her doll in fact she became so distraught at the possibility that molly was lost beneath the earth that i was forced to remain with her until at last she fell asleep i myself locked her bedroom window securing it with a little key that until now had remained unused then deposited the key in my pocket and took it with me to bed once i had ensured that every other entrance to the house was also securely closed that night a great storm arose and all the windows and doors rattled and shook i awoke to the sound of sam crying and brought him to my bed i checked on louisa but she remained asleep oblivious of the turmoil without the next morning when i pulled the curtains the sun shone brightly and there was no sign of any disturbance to the garden or its environs the leaves remained upon the trees and the flowerpots on the windowsill had not deviated so much as an inch from their positions and in the village nobody could recall even the slightest breeze arising during the preceding night days went by and the summer sun grew warmer and warmer we slept with the thinnest of sheets to cover us and tossed and turned until tiredness overcame our discomfort and at last brought us rest on one or two of the hottest nights i awoke to the sound of a tapping at the glass in the room next door and found louisa standing somewhere between sleeping and waking scraping at the lock i would approach her carefully recalling vague warnings against waking those who walk in their sleep and guide her gently back to her bed in the morning she would have no memory of what might have caused her to rise and she never again spoke of the people from the fort but marks began to appear on the outside of the glass faint parallel scratches as though the tines of a large fork had been dragged roughly against it and more wood was torn from the frame my dreams were haunted by shadows of flying beings their longconstricted wings now free once more to beat against the darkness they surrounded the house testing doors and windows frantically trying to gain access to the children within sam no longer went walking with me down to the stream instead he preferred to stay in the house spending more and more time in his own room with its window screens or in my study which had narrow leaded panes that would open only an inch at the top when i asked what was troubling him he declined to say what had caused this change in his behavior and it seemed almost that some threat hung over him requiring silence on all such matters if it were not to be put into action for the first time i began to make serious enquiries about selling the house then one day i was called away to unavoidable business in london where i was forced to spend the night despite my repeated warnings to her that all the windows and doors should remain securely locked at night mrs amworth who had agreed to stay with the children left the window in louisas bedroom slightly ajar so that air might flow through her room and give her some comfort and whatever dwelt within the mound took the invitation that was offered and all was altered irrevocably it was sam who first alerted me to the change in his sister previously adoring of her he now kept himself apart from her refusing to join in her games and remaining even closer to me than before one night after i put him down to sleep i heard movement in his room and upon attempting to enter found my progress impeded by a chair and cushions and sams toy box when i asked him what he was doing he at first refused to speak instead pushing his lower lip out and looking at his feet but slowly that lip began to tremble and in the midst of a flood of tears he told me that he was frightened frightened of what i asked louisa he replied but why shes your sister sam louisa loves you she wouldnt do anything to hurt you she asks me to go outside and play with her said sam you like playing with her i said conscious suddenly that while this might once have been true it was true no longer at night said sam she wants me to go out and play with her at night in the dark at the fort he added and then his voice broke altogether and he would not be consoled but when i questioned louisa about her brothers fears she would answer only that he was lying and that she had no desire to play with him anyway when i tried to pursue the matter she would not reply and i eventually gave up frustrated and uneasy in the days that followed i watched louisa noticing now a stillness about her a wariness she spoke less and less and appeared to be losing her appetite she would eat only the meat on her plate leaving the vegetables piled to one side when confronted about any aspect of her behavior she simply retreated into silence there was little that i could do to punish her and even then i remained unsure of precisely what i was punishing her for although one day i found her examining the metal screen that kept sam from opening his window until he was older testing the lock with her fingernail for the first time i lost my temper with her demanding to know what she thought she was doing she did not answer and tried to slip by me but i caught her by the shoulders and shook her hard demanding a reply i almost struck her so furious was i at the change in her behavior until i looked into her eyes and saw something red flicker in their depths like a torch suddenly igniting in the darkness of a deep chasm and it seemed to me although perhaps i merely imagined it that her eyes were narrower than before and slanted upward slightly at the corners dont touch me she whispered and there was a hoarse filthy aspect to her voice dont you ever touch me again or youll be sorry and with that she wrenched herself from my grasp and ran from the room that night i lay in bed and thought of fire and recalled again my predecessors drawings curling to black i wondered at the manner of her death and briefly envisaged her tormented by her imagination piling picture upon picture in the hearth in the vain hope that their destruction might bring her some peace her death was adjudged to have been a tragic accident but i was not sure sometimes there was only so much that a mind could take before it sought at last a final release from its sufferings there is only one further incident that remains untold and one that frightened me more than any other last week sam complained about the loss of a toy a small bear given to him by his mother for his third birthday it was a mangy thing with mismatched eyes and thick black stitches where its fur had parted and been inexpertly repaired by his father but he loved it dearly its disappearance was discovered shortly after he awoke for it always rested on the small table by his bed i asked mrs amworth who had just arrived to help with the search while i went looking for louisa in order to ask if she had seen the bear louisa was not in her room or in any other part of the house i went out into the garden calling after her but it was only when i reached the orchard that i saw her in the distance kneeling by the foot of the mound i do not know what instinct made me decide not to alert her to my presence i stayed under cover of the trees to the east until i was close enough to see what she was doing but as i neared her she rose cleaned her hands on her dress and ran back toward the house i let her go until she had entered the orchard and was lost from sight then approached the mound i suppose that i already knew what i would find there was a newly dug hole and as i scraped away the earth i felt fur beneath my fingers the eyes of the bear stared blankly up at me even as i pulled it free there was a ripping sound and i came away with the head alone when i dug further for the rest of the bear it could not be found i stepped away from the mound aware more than ever before of its strangeness the regularity of its lines suggesting a plan to its construction the way it flattened at its peak as though inviting the careless to rest upon it to lose themselves against its warmth and the rich color of its grass so much greener than its surroundings that it appeared almost unreal i turned around and saw a figure in white standing at the edge of the orchard watching me and i no longer knew the girl who used to be my daughter now i have caught up with myself and the details are almost entirely known i am once again lying on my bed my daughter standing beside me in the darkness a red cast to her eyes as she says i am your new daughter and i believe her close by me sam sleeps i keep him with me every night sometimes i wake him with my dreams dreams in which my true daughter lies buried beneath a mound of earth alive yet not alive surrounded by pale things that have taken her and now keep her close to them both curious and hateful of her her cries smothered by the dirt i have tried digging for her but i hit stone within inches whatever lies under the mound has secured itself well go away i whisper to her the red lights flicker briefly as she blinks you cant keep him safe forever the new daughter says youre wrong i reply some night youll fall asleep with a window open or a door unlocked she whispers some night youll be careless and then youll have a new son and i will have a new brother i grasp the bundle of keys tightly in my fist they hang from my neck secured by a chain and they never leave my sight only at night are we at risk only when the sun has departed do they come testing the security of our home i have already put it up for sale and soon we will leave time is pressing for them and for us no i tell her and i watch as she retreats into a corner and sinks slowly to the floor the red lights shining in the darkness as unseen figures pull at the windows and the doors and my son my real son sleeps softly beside me safe for now the ritual of the bones the headmasters voice was the voice of god you there johnston minor stop running bates my office ten am be prepared to explain why you were studying the form on the two thirty at kempton during latin one yesterday in latin boy since youre obviously so adept at the language that you no longer feel obliged to study it you there boy whats your name and for the first time or so i thought i found his attention turned upon me jenkins headmaster the scholarship student ah jenkins the scholarship student he nodded as if everything had suddenly slotted into place i trust youre not too intimidated by your surroundings jenkins the scholarship student a little headmaster i lied the montague school with its mahogany walls its elaborate busts its legions of dead men in powdered wigs staring down from the wallsprime ministers bankers captains of industry diplomats surgeons soldierswas just about the most intimidating place i had ever encountered i shouldnt let it trouble you jenkins said the headmaster he placed a hand on my shoulder and gripped tightly i could feel his fingers moving upon me testing the small muscles beneath my blazer i feel certain that youre going to make a fine contribution to the montague school you know in many ways scholarship students are the lifeblood of this establishment the montague school for boys had been in existence for almost four centuries so many great men had passed through its portals that it had become almost a microcosm of the empire a byword for all that was once great about britain it stood amid rolling hills and green playing fields its buildings elaborate constructions of towers and battlements as though the school were in a state of constant readiness to repel the great masses envious of the privilege it represented its old boys network spread through the upper echelons of british society like a great unseen web permitting only its favored sons to trip lightly across its strands on the way to wealth and glory while trapping those less worthy of ascension and draining them of hope and ambition their hollow forms littered the hallways of the civil service the foreign office and the lower divisions of the foremost institutions in the land an object lesson in the power of good breeding and better connections it was surrounded by a vast high wall and although its great iron gates remained open from early in the morning until late in the evening few without business at the school dared to venture beyond them relations with the natives of the neighboring villages were strained at best for the school appeared to evoke feelings of intense dislike among those whose children would never experience the benefits of such an establishment feelings exacerbated by the knowledge that in all likelihood their children would be subject to the whims of some of its graduates in later life just as they themselves were as a result trips to the villages were carefully monitored and supervised by the school although the older boys were permitted greater latitude in their wanderings and took a perverse pleasure in taunting the local merchants certain in the knowledge that however much the merchants despised these wealthy interlopers they could ill afford to turn down their custom still occasionally groups of local urchins would mount an assault on the schools property hoping to inflict some minor vandalism on the statuary or steal apples and pears from the orchard if they were very lucky they might encounter an unfortunate student who had drifted too far from the safety of the herd and a beating would be administered but this was a risky business for the grounds were regularly patrolled by porters in night blue uniforms who meted out their own brand of justice upon those who fell prey to them and on at least one occasion potential marauders had found themselves facing the combined might of the schools first fifteen and were fortunate to leave the grounds without medical assistance yet the montague school appeared to recognize in some small and infinitely patronizing way a vague duty toward those less fortunate than its feepaying elite every ten years a scholarship examination was held in the schools great hall and this test along with a subsequent interview was used to determine the identities of those lucky few who would be plucked from a life once destined to be littered with disappointment and unhappiness and instead allowed to glimpse the possibility of a better future even if that future was never really on offer for the ignominious reek of charity would hang about them for the rest of their days and dirt would forever cling to their boots leaving a trail behind them so that the wealthy and privileged might not however briefly mistake them for their own like all such great institutions the montague school had its own unique traditions and rituals there were particular dress practices to be followed certain directions in which to walk and peculiar hierarchies of students and teachers that appeared to have little to do with age or merit those with the strongest familial ties to the school were permitted dominion over those with less secure links and with great wealth came the freedom to inflict pain and humiliation with impunity there were songs to be learned and histories to be recited there were games with no rules and rules without purpose and then there were the bones and with them went the strangest ritual of all that morning following my first facetoface encounter with the headmaster i saw them for the first time a selection of the finalyear boys was presented with them at assembly each one stepping onto the stage in turn to receive a bone locked in a small velvet box in most cases their fathers had held the bones before them and their fathers in turn back back for hundreds of years when a family line died out there was always another great name waiting to take its place and so possession of the bones remained the preserve of only the bluest of bloodlines it was an old montague tradition this ritual of the bones when at last the final student received his token all the boys turned to face their younger fellows and we were permittednay instructedto cheer loudly three times i wondered where the bones had come from but when i tried to catch more than a glimpse of them as their new owners were proudly displaying them i found myself shunted roughly away and a sea of backs closed before me denying me even that small concession later that night as i lay in my dormitory bed i imagined my father devoted but impecunious discovering to his surprise that he was the lost heir to a great fortune with a title to his name that would eventually be passed on to his son overnight i would find myself elevated to a position of influence and respect in the school i would perform heroic deeds on the sporting field and my academic achievements would dwarf those of my peers as my reward the school would ignore the submissions of betterknown families in order to make up for earlier injustices and i would take my place on the stage and receive into my hand a small velvet box containing a single yellowed bone the symbol of a new life to come it was a brief fantasy driven sharply away by the flicking of a towel at my face and a burst of laughter from the culprits i knew that there would never be a relic for a scholarship boy that they were not for the likes of us but i was wrong for in a way they were all for us one week later i was standing in the rain watching a dispiriting rugby match when a small untidylooking boy with dirtyblond hair approached me jenkins isnt it said the boy yes i replied i tried to sound detached and unconcerned but secretly i was quite grateful to be approached i had found it difficult to make friends among the other students in fact i had made no friends at all im smethwick the other scholarship student he smiled uneasily ive been a bit ill so i started term late crumbs its quite a place isnt it so big and old but everyones being jolly kind even the older boys and they were the ones who scared me the most for a brief moment i was jealous of smethwick why had the older boys spoken to him but not to me scared you i said at last why oh you know in case theyd try to bully me and then there are the stories the stories crikey jenkins youre like an echo the stories you must have been told some of them ten years ago a scholarship boy died during some kind of prank it was all hushed up of course they claim he wandered off and got hit by a passing train but some say he was dead before the train even left the station smethwick s face betrayed mingled terror and fascination at the tale i wasnt sure what to feel i was finding it hard enough to settle into the routine of life there without adding stories of mysterious deaths to my woes i had already been regaled with tales of wandering spirits and creatures that lived in the eaves and on my second day at the school my head was covered with a pillowcase and i was locked in a dark cupboard beneath the stairs until the housemaster heard my cries and finally released me but dont worry smethwick smiled and patted my shoulder well be fine but we were not going to be fine we were not going to be fine at all in the weeks that followed i grew closer to smethwick even though we had little in common it was natural that i should do so for i was without allies or support in that place and smethwick offered both yet i found myself distanced from him by the actions of the older boys it was as though they had chosen to take smethwick under their wing for he was not subjected to the same little humiliations and hurts that marked my first months at the school instead they joshed with him and permitted him to run small errands for them in return for which he was allowed to conduct his business without fear of casual violence he seemed to become almost a mascot for them a totem of some kind i took to staying close to him in the hope that some of the goodwill directed toward him might extend to me smethwick to his credit did all that he could to protect me even to the extent of placing himself between me and those who would have harmed me otherwise on one such occasion he received a gash to his forehead that required treatment by the school nurse the headmaster was called and although he spent some time with both smethwick and me in an effort to discover the identities of those responsible we both remained silent nevertheless the fifthformers who had perpetrated the assault were quickly found and their punishment was both savage and public as an example to others the result was that gradually i was left in peace although less out of a regard for my wellbeing than a greater reluctance to cause smethwick any harm things continued that way for some months for my part i neither understood nor trusted the motives of the older boys in taking smethwick under their wing but smethwick himself was too grateful to be suspicious when at last they came for him i believe that he cried as much out of sorrow as from dread on the night of the ritual i remember waking as a long line of sixthformers entered our dormitory some with candles but all holding their little velvet boxes in their hands they moved silently and none of the other boys appeared to be awake to see them or if they were they chose not to reveal the fact the sixthformers slapped their hands over smethwick s mouth so that he couldnt scream while four or five of them lifted him from his bed i could see smethwick thrashing in his pajamas his eyes full of fear and panic perhaps i should have cried out but i knew that it would do no good perhaps also i should have left smethwick to his fate and remained content in my ignorance but i did not i was anxious to see what they were going to do to him it pains me to say it but i was glad that it was him instead of me i shadowed the group at a distance following them down corridors and stairs until they came to an oaken door bound with iron bands that stood open in a corner by the staff common room i cant say that i remembered ever seeing the door before perhaps it had been hidden by a tapestry or a suit of armor for there were many such relics in the montague school the door was pulled closed behind the boys but not locked i opened it gently and felt cool air on my face stone steps wound down in front of me in the quickly fading light from the candles of the group i descended until i found myself in a huge cold room with stone walls and a low vaulted ceiling there were more candles here and more figures waiting i hid in the shadows behind a stone column and watched on a raised stone platform below me stood the male teaching staff of the school there was bierce the games master and james who taught latin and greek and dickens and burrage and poe before them all stood mr lovecraft the headmaster dressed in a red tartan nightgown and matching slippers bring him forward boys said the headmaster gently now thats it tie him down well hyde we dont want him running off on us do we oh do stop whimpering smethwick itll soon be over they tied smethwick to four iron rings set into the stone slab binding his arms and his legs tightly with strong rope to each ring smethwick was wailing now but nobody seemed to be paying him much attention and the stone walls simply threw his cries back at him all right you older boys said the headmaster beckoning them with his right hand up you come one at a time you know what to do the sixthformers stood in an orderly line facing the platform on the floor beside smethwick i could make out a pattern perhaps a foot long and six inches wide marked in a stone that was darker and older than those surrounding it it looked like fossil remains except concave as if whatever fossil had once been entombed there had been expertly removed leaving only the impression of what it had once been and as i watched each of the boys stepped forward opened his little velvet box and placed his bone in a section of the hollow pattern filling it bit by bit until at last the skeletal remains of some kind of animal lay on the floor although it was like no animal i had ever seen it seemed to have eight legs like a spider but its skeleton was obviously internal not external i could see its rib cage and a tiny pointed skull and a kind of short barbed tail that followed a groove in the stone the headmaster smiled as the last bone was positioned then removed a small ivoryhandled knife from the pocket of his dressing gown hyde as head prefect the honor of bleeding smethwick falls to you hyde a darkhaired smug looking youth stepped forward in his brocade gown he accepted the knife from the headmaster with a small bow then turned to smethwick the cries of the spreadeagled boy rose an octave please let me go sobbed smethwick please headmaster i wont tell please please hyde dont hurt me the headmaster shook his head in exasperation for goodness sake smethwick stop whining be a man about it its no wonder your family never made anything of itself hydes brother died at the somme leading a charge of two hundred men they all died with him and were grateful for the chance to go out like soldiers behind their beloved captain is that not correct hyde yes headmaster replied hyde with the kind of misplaced pride that only the relative of a bloodthirsty lunatic could show you see smethwick hydes the kind of chap that other men follow to their deaths whod follow a whiner like you smethwick nobody thats who whod vote for you smethwick not a soul would tribes of natives break their ranks and flee in terror from the sight of your sword no smethwick theyd laugh at you then cut your head off and stick it on a pole you are of no value as you are and you would be of no value in the future this way youll bring a whole new generation of montaguans together that will be your legacy hyde continue if you please hyde leaned over and made a long deep incision in smethwick s left arm smethwick immediately cried out in pain blood flowed quickly from the wound and dripped onto the skeletal remains of the insect thing below and as i watched a red membrane began to form over the creature i saw veins and arteries appear and a tiny dark heart began to pump blood the bones on the beasts skeletal legs which had lain curled over what had once been its abdomen now bonded and began to twitch testing the air a yellow substance flowed over its little skull as the spined tail moved on the stone with a thin raking sound the creature twisted where it lay then coiled its body in on itself and stretched suddenly the springing movement ejecting it from its bed and bringing it to rest on the ends of its long jointed legs it stood about ten inches tall the semitransparent skin on its back a whitish yellow and sectioned like a caterpillars in the candlelight six round black eyes of varying sizes gleamed at the front of its skull it raised its head and i caught a glimpse of a long mouth perhaps an inch or two in diameter flanked at either side by small thick palps the headmaster took a careful step back then raised his left hand like a conjurer displaying his latest illusion gentlemen he said his voice quavering with pride i give youthe school mascot there was a round of applause from the assembled boys on the stone slab smethwick s whole body twisted and shook as he tried to wrench his limbs free no pleeeaase he pleaded let me go im sorry for whatever ive done im sorry what did i do tell me what did i do the headmaster looked at him with what might almost have been pity you smethwick were born into the wrong class then the creature found at last the source of the blood its jaws opened and its mouth expanded and contracted as it swallowed the drops it tensed its body again its abdomen lowering until it almost touched the ground and sprang up onto the slab i heard smethwick scream as the thing scuttled across his chest arched its back and with a single scorpion thrust plunged its tail into smethwick s neck there was a jet of red that was quickly stopped by the creatures mouth as slowly it sucked the life from the boy i tried to block my ears from the soft rasping noise that it made and i felt my gorge rise as its horrid body began to expand stretching to store the blood of the unfortunate boy dying beneath it at last the thing was sated it drew away from smethwick and staggered slowly onto the slab itself smethwick lay still his eyes open and his face pale there was a round bloody hole at his throat his left hand spasmed once twice then was still gingerly the headmaster lifted the beast by its sides and raised it high into the air its legs flailing gently and blood dripping from its jaws by this ritual of the bones we are bonded together all complicit all united in the great family that is our class he declared generations of men have learned their most valuable lesson from this little creature the blood of the lower classes is also our lifeblood without it we cannot be great and if we cannot be great our country cannot be great now three cheers for the montague school all of the boys shouted hiphip hooray as the headmaster lowered the creature and placed it in a small cage then handed the cage to mr dickens you know what to do dickens he said his voice carrying in the echoing chamber in a few days itll be skin and bone again then you can disassemble it and put the pieces back into the boxes mr dickens held the cage away from his body and stared at its occupant now drowsy and gorged with blood it is the damnedest thing isnt it head for the first time what might almost have been disgust showed itself on the headmasters face indeed it is the damnedest thing hyde you and two boys take smethwick here and dispose of him i suggest a walk along the cliffs but be sure to weight him down before you drop him off now mr bierce will lead the rest of you boys in a chorus of the school song but i didnt wait to hear it i ran back to my room and packed my bags and by morning i was gone my parents were surprised to see me and wanted to take me back to the school my father was angrier than my mother conscious i think of the opportunity that i was rejecting and the future hardships attendant upon this decision i cried and screamed even vomiting with distress until they relented i think perhaps that my mother guessed something was very wrong although she never said anything about it and i never told her of what i had witnessed after all who would have believed me and so a letter was sent to mr lovecraft announcing my withdrawal from montague a place was found for me at a local school one to which every child brought with him his own sandwiches and milk and in which lice were rumored to be a constant irritant i was surrounded by those who were like me and i quickly found my place among them one week after leaving the montague school the headmaster came to the house for a visit and a talk my father was at work my mother gave him tea and scones but politely declined to return me to his care well be sorry to lose him mrs jenkins he said as he shrugged on his long blue overcoat he could have made a wonderful contribution to the school new boys are our lifeblood you know will you permit your son to walk me to the gate i should like to say farewell to him my mother gave me a push in the small of the back and i was compelled to follow the dark form of mr lovecraft to the garden gate he paused on the footpath and looked closely at me as i told your mother jenkins were sorry to lose you he gripped my shoulder and once again i could feel those fingers working at my flesh but mark my words jenkins in the end you cant escape your destiny one way or another well have you he leaned in close to me so near that i could see tributaries of blood in his eyes because jenkins like all the members of your sturdy loyal class youre full of the stuff that makes britain great the furnace room the thibault company once made locomotives and carriages for the railroads famous names that ran on lines all across the northeast green cars for wicasset and quebec green and red for sandy river yellow and green for bridgton and saco then the railroads closed downfirst the narrow gauge in the forties then the standard gauge in the fiftiesand the trains from boston no longer made the journey north union station once the hub of the rail network in that part of the world had disappeared from the map to be replaced by an ugly shopping mall the only reminder of the great trains that had once proudly left the yards were some disused tracks their sleepers now rotted and overrun by dark weeds the thibault company closed its doors and its buildings fell into disrepair windows were shattered and holes were punched in roofs weeds sprouted in the yard bursting through cracks in the concrete while the gutters filled with filth and rainwater streaked the walls occasionally there was talk of knocking the whole place down and building something new and impressive there instead but the city was in decline and no investor could be found who was willing to pump money into the economic equivalent of an open grave after all there were malls being constructed on the outskirts of the city and businesses were abandoning the center of town in favor of covered streets bathed in artificial light so that elderly walkers could pretend to fend off mortality without being troubled by either the elements or fresh air then a decade or so ago the city stopped dying someone with an ounce of intelligence and imagination noticed that the port with its beautiful old buildings and its cobbled streets leading down to the working harbor was pretty enough to warrant its preservation true not every business had closed up shop and headed for the suburbs there were old bars and a couple of general stores even a diner or two they soon found themselves side by side with chichi souvenir stores and microbreweries and pizzerias that offered more than one kind of cheese there was some whining of course and claims that the character of the port had been sacrificed for the tourist dollar but truth be told the old character hadnt been much to write home about to begin with that kind of nostalgia tends to come from folks who never had to scrape together nickels and dimes to pay the rent on a bar or who never opened their store and sat there all the long day just for a couple of sales and a side order of chitchat soon there were visitors on the streets for more than half of every year and the old port became a curious mix of working fishermen and gawping tourists of those who remembered the bad times and those for whom there were only good times to come the developments began to expand beyond the natural boundaries of the old port and it was decided to reopen the thibault company yard as a business park the old redbrick buildings were converted into specialized engineering works and boatmakers sheds and a locomotive museum a narrowgauge railway ran up and down the waterfront from early summer until christmas when the last of the tourists departed after seeing the citys festive lights the place wasnt exactly bustling since the kind of work it attracted was the lowkey sort done indoors and under cover it was pretty quiet during the day but even quieter at night except for the wind that howled across the bay bringing with it the sound of breaking waves and passing ships their horns calling through the darkness a sound that was either reassuring or lonesome depending upon your frame of mind when you heard it i dont recall much of how i came to the city it was a bad time in my life i didnt care about where i was or where i was going id done some things that i regretted i guess most people do somewhere along the line its hard to live any kind of life without building up a store of regrets the important thing for me was just to keep moving i thought that if i kept shifting from place to place then i could leave my past behind me by the time i realized that i was bringing my past right along with me it was too late to do anything about it there wasnt much work on offer when i arrived the season was almost over and the casual workers in the restaurants and the bars had already departed for florida and california or for the winter resorts in new hampshire and vermont i found a cheap room in a rundown house and spent my nights looking for twoforone specials in bars desperate for custom asking anyone who sat still long enough if they knew of somewhere i might pick up a job but the people who frequented those kinds of places either didnt much care for work or would take the job themselves if they heard about it first so i didnt have a lot of luck after a week i was getting pretty desperate i dont think i would even have found out about the job had i not been walking along the waterfront smoking a cigarette and wondering if i hadnt made a mistake by coming this far north but there it was a handlettered sign covered in plastic to shield it from the rain night watchman wanted apply within with nothing else to do and no other hope for employment on the horizon i went inside to inquire in the main office about the job a guy who was sweeping the floors asked my name then told me to come back the next morning when the man in charge would be available to talk to me i was told to bring along a r√©sum√© i thanked him but he kept his back to me the whole time i never even saw his face the next morning i sat in the offices of the thibault companys administration department and listened as a man in an expensive gray suit explained my duties to me his name was mr rone but he told me that most folk just called him charles he said he used to be in the marine business and still liked to keep his hand in transport he explained animals sometimes and people mostly people the night watchmans job would require me to patrol the complex making sure that the vacant premises did not become homes for hobos and junkies for there were still buildings unoccupied or under development i was not being paid to sit in a chair and read the sports pages or snooze there were no electronic clocks nothing to monitor my activity or lack of activity but if anything went wrong then it was my ass that would be in a sling yessir any questions said charles i was confused you mean i have the job just like that charles gave me a watt smile sure you seem like the guy weve been waiting for he hadnt even asked for my r√©sum√© id typed it up at the local kinkos the night before spending money i couldnt afford to waste now i was feeling a little resentful at having spent my time preparing it true it maybe wouldnt stand up much to close examination and the people included for reference purposes would be harder to track down than dodos but id made the effort i brought a r√©sum√© i said and i was kind of surprised at how hurt my voice sounded hell youd think the guy had refused to hire me the way i was going on charless smile brightened maybe two watts hey thats great he said i handed it over he didnt even glance at it just put it on top of a trayload of papers that looked as if they hadnt been touched since the last locomotive left the building in fact it was hard to see precisely what mr rones company actually did from what i could tell we were the only people in the entire building still that was it i had the job they gave me a brown uniform a flashlight and a gun i was told the paperwork for the gun would be sorted out later and i didnt question them i didnt imagine that id ever have to use it anyway the worst that could happen i thought was that some kids might try to break in and id have to run them off i figured that i could handle myself against kids just in case i brought my own telescopic baton and a can of mace each night before i went to work i filled a small flask with wild turkey just to keep out the cold dont get me wrong im not a big drinker and never was but a northeastern waterfront gets pretty cold in the winter when youre wandering around the yards or checking out those unheated buildings then there are times when youre pretty glad of something to warm the heart i never minded working alone id read somemystery stories mainlyor do word puzzles or watch latenight tv i didnt have a wife to worry about i used to have a wife but shes gone now people think she left me went to live in oregon but i know different it was the start of my second week when the noises began there were two vacant buildings on the site close by the main road the larger one was three stories tall and kind of rundown the windows were covered with wire screens so mostly i just checked the locks on the doors to make sure that they hadnt been tampered with but id never gone inside id never had any call to until then i was doing my usual am round when i heard the sound of doors opening and closing inside the empty building and thought i saw the flicker of flames when i checked the doors and windows they all seemed to be secure and i could hear no voices from within i shone my flashlight onto the roof but as far as i could see it looked okay there were no holes no busted slates through which someone could have squeezed but those flames were a worry if some hobo had found a way in then lit a fire and fallen asleep the whole place might go up i took my keys from my belt and found the one that fitted the main door lock id colorcoded them all with scotch tape then learned the colors so id know them immediately the door opened easily and i stepped inside finding myself in a lowceilinged room that extended the entire length of the ground floor at the end of the room was an open doorway from which one flight of stairs ascended to the upper levels while another flight led down to the furnace room the light was coming from there i slipped the taurus from its holster and gun in my right hand flashlight crossed under it i headed for the door i was maybe halfway there when footsteps sounded a little warning noise was triggered in my head and i twisted the maglite to kill the beam while i waited quietly in the shadows two people appeared in the doorway they wore long black coats over black trousers and heavysoled black boots their faces were hidden in shadow until they stepped into the warehouse itself a single dusty bulb burned over the doorway and its faint light briefly illuminated their forms they were a man and a woman but they were all wrong both were bald with pale almost gray skulls crisscrossed with thick veins that bulged against their skin the man was bigger with red eyes set into his hairless face but he had no other features there was no nose no mouth just a flat expanse of skin below those eyes the woman stood beside him the shape of her breasts visible beneath her coat she had a mouth and a small button nose but no eyes just smooth skin from her hairline to her nose from my left came a sound and two more figures came forward the first was another tall man dressed in black like the others i couldnt see his face but the back of his skull was perfectly round and pale there were no ears to be seen one hand hung by his side but the other hand rested on the shoulder of a small thin man wearing a brown shirt and pants his back was to me so i couldnt see his face but there was a wound to his right temple and blood on the left side of his head and on the left shoulder of his shirt as if a bullet had exited from his left temple i should have intervened but i couldnt move i was so scared that i forgot to breathe and when i realized that i was holding my breath i gasped so loudly that i thought they would hear me and come for me too for an instant it seemed that the womans eyeless gaze searched the shadows resting momentarily where i crouched before moving on then her fingers probed at the darkness reaching for the bloodied man her mouthless companion did the same and when all three of the figures were touching him they guided him gently toward the stairs and pulled the door closed behind them after a moments pause i followed them the door was unlocked behind it were stairs one flight leading to the upper levels of the warehouse the other leading down the furnace in the building shouldnt have been lit but it was burning now i could smell it i could feel it and so i descended until i came to an iron doorway almost rusted away on its hinges it stood open and i could see the light of flames flickering within casting an orange glow on the walls and floor i could hear the roar of the fire within i moved toward it there was sweat running down my back and my palms were slick against the gun and the flashlight i was almost at the doorway when the fire died and now there was only the flashlight in my hand to guide me i breathed deep then slipped quickly into the doorway whos i stopped the room was empty inside i could see the great furnace but it was unlit i walked over to the system and very gently reached for it with my hand i paused before touching it conscious that if i was mistaken my hand would never be right again the furnace was cold to the touch i made a quick check of the room but there was nothing else to be seen it was uncluttered with but one way in and out i kept my back to the wall of the stairs and my gun pointing toward the furnace room until i reached the main warehouse then left so quickly that i raised dust from the floor i spent the rest of the night in my office with my gun on the desk before me my senses so heightened that my ears rang i didnt say anything to anybody about what i thought i had seen in fact when i woke up that afternoon and prepared for another nights work i thought that i might just have imagined it all maybe i fell asleep in my chair with one too many nips from the flask under my belt and then just dreamed my way into the warehouse and back to my desk where i woke up with a memory of mutilated figures taking a small man with a hole in his head down to a furnace room that created heat without burning i mean what other explanation could there be nothing else happened for the rest of that week i heard no more sounds from the warehouse i even took the trouble of putting a lock and chain on the door and checked it twice each night but it never moved still that smell the odor of burnt powder lingered i could detect it on my uniform and in my hair and no amount of washing seemed to be able to shake it from me then one sunday night when i was making my usual rounds i entered the warehouse and found the stairwell doorway gaping the main door to the building had been closed and locked when i arrived nobody had been in or out of there in the past week except me but now the door was open and once again i could see the light of flames dancing on the walls i drew my gun and called out hello anybody there there was no answer come out now i shouted sounding braver than i felt you come out now or i swear ill lock you in here and call the cops there was still no reply but in the shadows to my right a figure moved behind some old crates to the right of the door i shone the flashlight and caught the edge of something blue as it slipped back into the darkness dammit i see you you come out now yhear i swallowed once and the noise of it seemed to echo in my head although it was a cold night there was sweat on my forehead and my upper lip my shirt was soaked in it heat was coming from somewhere intense searing heat as if the whole warehouse were ablaze with some hidden fire and i heard the furnace roar i kept the gun level with the flashlight as i stepped softly toward the crates as i drew closer the light revealed a bare foot with filthy twisted toenails and thick swollen ankles marbled with blue veins the hem of a dirty blue dress was visible just below the knee it was a woman a downandout taking shelter in the warehouse maybe she had been there all along and i had just never seen her there must have been another way in and out for her a busted window or a concealed door id find it after i rousted her ass okay lady i said as i drew almost level with her out you but it wasnt a hobo like the old joke goes it wasnt even a lady it was my wife except i wasnt laughing her dark hair had grown obscuring most of her face and the mottled skin seemed to have tightened on her bones drawing back her lips and exposing long yellow teeth her head was down her chin almost resting on her chest and she was looking at the wound in her stomach where the knife had entered the wound i had made on the night i killed her then she raised her head and her eyes were revealed the blue had faded from them and they were now almost entirely white the rictus that was her mouth stretched further and i knew that she was smiling hi honey she said i could hear the dirt moving in her throat there was more beneath her broken fingernails left there as she dug herself out of the shallow grave i had made for her far to the south where dead leaves would cover her resting place and wild animals would scatter her bones she moved forward in an awkward shuffle and i backed away from her one step then two until my progress was halted by an obstacle behind me i turned my back on her and found myself staring into the pale face of the earless man in the black coat you have to go with him said my wife as the man in the black coat laid his hand upon me i looked up into his face for he was taller than me by a foot or more in fact he might just have been the tallest man id ever met where am i going i asked him before i realized that he couldnt hear me i wanted to run but the pressure of his hand kept me rooted to the spot i looked over my shoulder to where my dead wife stood this had to be a dream i thought a bad dream the alltime worst nightmare i could ever fear to have but instead of struggling or crying out or pinching myself awake i heard the sound of my own voice speaking calmly tell me i said tell me where im going the dirt in her throat shifted again youre going underground she said i tried to move then but all the strength seemed to have left my body i couldnt even raise my gun in the doorway beyond two figures now stood the woman without eyes and the man without a mouth the mouthless figure nodded to the man now holding me and he began to guide me firmly toward the stairwell oblivious to my words no i said this isnt right but of course there was no sound from him and at last i understood earless so that he could not hear the pleas of those for whom he came eyeless so that she could not see those she fed to the flames and the mute judge the repository of sins unable to speak of what he had seen or heard merely required to nod his assent to the passing of the sentence three d√¶mons each perfect in its mutilation my feet were sliding on the dusty floor as i was dragged by the collar toward the waiting flames i looked to the doorway of the warehouse and saw a man in a gray suit watching me it was mr rone i cried out to him but he merely smiled his dim smile and closed the door i could hear the sound of his key turning in the lock i remembered the papers on his desk old and dusty i recalled the absence of a secretary and a man sweeping the floors whose voice now that i thought of it might have sounded something like that of charles rone himself i was nearly at the doorway when i spoke for the last time i looked up at the d√¶mons standing before me and said simply but im not dead and at that moment i felt my right hand start to raise my gun to my temple and saw in my head a small thin man with blood on his shoulder walking to the stairs beside me i heard my dead wifes voice beside my ear there was no breath only sound let me help you with that she whispered her hand closed upon mine pressing my finger against the trigger as she lifted the gun to my skull im sorry i said the sound of the furnace filled my head its heat rose through the floor and melted the soles of my shoes already i could smell my hair burning too late she replied the gun exploded and the world was shrouded in crimson as i prepared to descend the underbury witches steam and fog swirled together upon the station platform turning men and women to gray phantoms and creating traps for the unwary out of carelessly positioned cases and chests the night was growing colder and a faint sheen of frost could already be detected upon the roof of the ticket office through the steamedup glass of the waiting room figures could faintly be discerned huddling close to the noisy radiators that reeked of oil and smoldering dust some drank tea from cheap cups lined with spidery cracks sipping urgently as though apprehensive that the crockery might yet disintegrate in their hands and shower them with tepid liquid tired children cried in the arms of weary parents a retired major tried to engage two soldiers in conversation but the men new conscripts already fearful of the trenches were in no mood to talk the station masters whistle sounded defiantly in the gloom his lamp swinging gently high above his head and the train slowly began to move away leaving only two other men standing upon the suddenly deserted platform had there been anyone to see or to care it would have become quickly apparent that the new arrivals did not belong in underbury they carried heavy bags and were dressed in city clothes one the larger and elder of the two wore a bowler hat and a muffler around his mouth and chin his brown coat was slightly frayed at the sleeves and his shoes were built for comfort and long life with few nods to fashion or aesthetics his companion was almost as tall as he but slighter and better dressed his coat was short and black and he wore no hat exposing a mass of dark hair that was a good deal longer than would ordinarily have been considered acceptable in his chosen profession his eyes were very blue and he might almost have been called handsome were it not for a curious aspect to his mouth which curled down slightly at the edges and gave him an air of perpetual disapproval no welcoming committee then sir said the older man his name was arthur stokes and he was proud to call himself a sergeant of detectives in what he did not doubt was the greatest police force in the world the locals never like it when theyre forced to accept help from london said the other policeman his name was burke and he enjoyed the rank of inspector in scotland yard if enjoyed was indeed the right word judging by his expression at the moment in question endured might have been a more appropriate term the arrival of two of us is unlikely to make them doubly grateful they made their way through the station and onto the road beyond where a man stood waiting beside a battered black car youll be the gentlemen from london he said we are said burke and you would be my names croft the constable sent me to collect you hes busy at the moment local newspapermen weve had some of the london boys calling on us as well burke looked puzzled he was told not to make any comment until we arrived he said croft reached out to take their bags and hows he supposed to do that then if he cant talk to them first to tell them that he cant make no comment he asked he winked at burke sergeant stokes had never seen anyone wink at the inspector before and he wasnt convinced that croft was the ideal candidate to be the first fair point i suppose sir said sergeant stokes hurriedly then added for forms sake dont you think burke gave his sergeant a look that suggested he thought a great many things of which few were complimentary toward the present company whose side are you on sergeant the side of law and order sir burke replied happily the side of law and order the witch panic that gripped europe for over three hundred years beginning in the mids and ending with the death in switzerland in of anna goldi the last woman in western europe to be executed for witchcraft claimed the lives of between fifty and one hundred thousand people of whom eighty percent were women most of them old and most of them poor such panics were most prevalent in the german lands which accounted for roughly half of all those killed fewer than five hundred died in england but twice that amount were executed in scotland due in no small part to the scottish courts greater tolerance for torture as a means of securing confessions and the paranoia of its young monarch james vi the most comprehensive guide to the identification interrogation and finally immolation of witches was the malleus maleficarum the hammer of witches coauthored by the german dominican heinrich kramer and father james sprenger the dean of theology at the university of cologne kramer and sprenger pinpointed the seed of witchcraft in the very nature of the female species women were spiritually intellectually and emotionally weak and motivated primarily by carnal lust these fundamental flaws found their most potent expression in witchery the coming of the reformation did little to undo such beliefs if anything any existing tolerance for the socalled wise women of village life was to be stamped out along with any other evidence of old pagan ways leading martin luther himself to declare that they should all be burned as witches it would be before the crime of witchcraft would officially be removed from the books of law in england almost years after the capture trial and execution of the three women known as the underbury witches croft drove the two policemen to the heart of the village of underbury where they checked into a pair of small but warm rooms at the back of the vintage inn when they had refreshed themselves and taken some tea the two policemen were brought to the local undertakers waiting for them were the village doctor allinson and the sole representative of the local constabulary constable waters allinson was young and a recent arrival in underbury with his family following the death of his uncle who had previously dealt with the births illnesses and various manifestations of mortality in the area allinson walked with a slight limp a vestige of childhood polio which had excused him from service in france waters in burkes view was a typical village copper cautious without being careful and with a modest intelligence that had not yet evolved to the stage of wisdom all four men stood by while the undertaker a man seemingly composed entirely of creases and wrinkles slowly uncovered the body that lay upon his slab we havent done much with him yet on account of you gentlemen coming down from london he explained lucky its been cold or else hed be on the turn more than he is already the body revealed to them was that of a man in his early forties with the bulk of one who labored in the fields during the day at the dinner table in the evening and in the pub at night his features or what remained of them were discolored and the men could smell the greater decay already taking place inside him there were long vertical wounds across his face and similar injuries to his chest and stomach the wounds were deep and penetrated far into his body so that his innards were clearly visible to them rolls of torn intestine extruded from two of the cuts like the larvae of some dreadful parasite his name was malcolm trevors said waters mal to most people single man no family good lord said stokes it looks as though an animal attacked him burke nodded to the undertaker and said he would be called if he was needed the little man exited quietly and if he felt any sense of injury at his exclusion he was far too practiced in his trade to show it once the door to the embalming room was closed burke turned to the doctor youve examined him allinson shook his head not fully i didnt want to interfere with your investigations i have taken a closer look at those wounds though and if its the work of an animal its like none ive ever seen weve sent out word to the circuses and fairs in the area said constable waters well soon find out if theyve lost one of their beasts burke nodded but it was clear that he had little interest in what waters had just said his attention remained on allinson why do you say that the doctor leaned over the body of the dead man and pointed to smaller abrasions to the left and right of the main cuts you see these in the absence of any other evidence id say they were left by thumbs thumbs with deep nails on the ends of them he raised his hand curled the fingers slightly as though grasping a ball then raked them slowly through the air the deep wounds come from the fingers the ancillary angled cuts from the thumb he continued couldnt someone have used some kind of farm implement on him asked stokes the sergeant was london through and through and his knowledge of agriculture extended no further than washing the dirt from vegetables before cooking them nevertheless he had a pretty fair suspicion that if one were to open up any barn between here and scotland there would be enough sharp objects contained within to fillet a whole tribe of men such as trevors its possible said allinson im no expert on farm tools we may know a little more once ive taken a closer look at the body with your permission inspector id like to open him up a more detailed examination of the wounds should confirm it but burke was once again leaning over the body this time looking at the hands can you pass me a thin blade he asked allinson took a scalpel from his instrument bag then handed it to the policeman burke carefully placed the blade beneath the nail of the dead mans right index finger and probed get me something to hold a sample allinson gave him a small specimen dish and burke scraped the residue from beneath the nail into it he repeated the process with each nail of the right hand until a small scattering of matter lay upon the dish what is it asked constable waters tissue answered allinson skin not fur very little blood hardly any in fact he fought back said burke whoever attacked him should be marked hell be long gone then said waters a man scarred in that way wont hang around to be found out no perhaps not said burke still its something can you take us to where the body was found now said waters no the morning should do in this fog well risk trampling on any evidence that hasnt been crushed or lost already doctor when do you think you might complete your examination allinson removed his jacket and began to roll up his sleeves ill start straightaway if you like i should know more by morning burke looked to his sergeant right then he said well be off for now and well see you at nine tomorrow thank you gentlemen and with that the strangers left the village of underbury numbered barely souls half of whom lived on small farms some distance from the village itself with its church its inn and its handful of stores all set near the crossroads that marked underburys heart a visitor might have noted that the central area in which the two roads met was considerably larger than one might have expected it was perhaps sixty feet across and was dominated by a raised grass circle upon which no flowers grew instead to alleviate its dullness a statue had been raised to the duke of wellington although the cheap stone used for its creation had already begun to disintegrate giving the duke the physical appearance of one who was slowly succumbing to leprosy or one of the more unmentionable social diseases to understand the nature of the circle at the crossroads required a knowledge of local history of which few visitors could boast underbury once upon a time was a far more populous place than it now appeared to be and was in fact the commercial hub for this part of the county a vestige of those former days still remained in the form of the weekly farmers market held each saturday in a field on the east side of the village although in the past and indeed in the present in places other than underbury such markets traditionally took place in the very heart of the village this practice came to an end in the latter half of the seventeenth century when underbury became the focus of the largest single investigation into witchcraft ever undertaken in the british isles up to that point the reasons for the arrival of the witchfinders remain unclear although an outbreak of illness among some of the children in the village may have provided the initial spur five children died in the space of a single week all of them firstborn males and suspicion fell upon a trio of women newly arrived in underbury from parts unknown the women claimed to be sisters of independent means formerly resident in cheapside the eldest ellen drury was a midwife and took over such duties in the village following the sudden drowning of her predecessor one grace polley ellen drury delivered the male children who subsequently passed away and it was immediately said of her that she had cursed them as they passed from womb to world demands for the womens arrest and questioning grew louder yet the drury sisters had managed in their brief time in underbury to make themselves popular with many of the local women due to their facility with various medicines and herbs it may also have been that the drury sisters could have been described almost as protofeminists for they encouraged those who were victims of casual abuse from their husbands and male relatives to make a stand against such acts and a number of men found their houses surrounded by groups of shouting women invariably led by ellen drury and one or both of her sisters in fact one resident a farmer named brodie and a vicious man towards his wife and daughters to boot was so badly beaten as he made his way home through his fields one night that it was thought he would not survive his injuries brodie subsequently declined to name his assailants but gossip in the village intimated that the drury sisters were abroad that night and that their walking staffs were ingrained with brodies blood while few wept for the victim of the assault who was left with a useless right hand and an impediment to his speech as a result of the attack this was clearly a state of affairs that could not be allowed to continue the deaths of the children gave the men of the village the excuse that they sought and a pair of witchfinders was despatched from london on the orders of the king to investigate the occurrences there is little that needs to be said about the manner of the witchfinders enquiries for their methods have been recorded elsewhere suffice it to say that the drury sisters were sorely tried along with ten other women from the village of whom two were married three very ancient and one barely twelve years of age marks were found upon their bodiespatterns of warts unexplained folds of skin in their private partsthat were construed as evidence of the womens diabolical nature the young girl under threat of torture admitted to the practice of witchcraft and claimed that she had seen ellen drury prepare the potion that took the lives of the newborn infants she told her interrogators that the three women were not in fact sisters at all although she did not know their true names finally she added stories of debauches conducted in the womens cottage in which she was forced to participate and of treasons spoken against the church of england and even against the king himself a confession thus secured the women were presented to the circuit court judges and sentence was passed on november ellen drury and her sisters were hanged to death in the village square at underbury and their remains buried in an unmarked plot to the north of the cemetery just beyond its walls their codefendants were set to suffer the same fate but the intervention of the kings physician sir william harvey who was curious about the nature of the witch marks allegedly found upon the bodies of the convicted women led to their transportation to london where they were reexamined by the privy council and among whose members their fate was subsequently debated at leisure five of the prisoners passed away while imprisoned and ten years went by before the survivors were quietly released to spend their final years in poverty and ignominy ellen drury was the last to die on the gallows even in her final agonies it was said of her that her eyes remained fixed on her tormentors unblinking until a relative of the unfortunate brodie threw pitch upon her and set her alight whereupon her eyes exploded in their sockets and her world went dark dr allinson worked into the early hours examining the wounds left upon the body of mal trevors the largest of them as he later told burke and stokes over breakfast at the inn extended internally from the mans belly all the way to his heart which had been pierced in five places by long claws or nails at this point sergeant stokes briefly lost his appetite for his bacon are you telling us that a hand was pushed up through this mans body asked burke it would appear so replied the doctor i inspected him closely in the hope that i might find a fragment of nail but none was forthcoming which i find surprising under the circumstances it is no easy thing to tear apart a mans insides in such a way and some shattering would have been expected it leads me to suspect that either the nails of the hand were unusually strong or that the fingers had been artificially enhanced in some way perhaps by the addition of metal talons that could be strapped on or removed as needed the doctor could add nothing more to the sum of their knowledge and retired to his bed at the behest of his wife who had arrived to do a little shopping and encourage her exhausted husband to return home she was a woman of striking looks a tall blonde with flawed green eyes that caught the light as though they were emeralds inset with fragments of diamond her name was emily and burke exchanged only a few words with her as he escorted her husband to the door thank you for your help he said as allinson buttoned his coat at the door of the inn his wife remaining inside to exchange some pleasantries with the innkeepers daughter im sorry that i could not be of more assistance said allinson nevertheless it is most intriguing in a dreadful way and i should like to take one more look at trevors later before we leave him to the gentle ministrations of the undertaker it may be that in my exhaustion i missed some detail that could prove useful burke assented then stepped aside in order to allow mrs allinson to pass and a most curious thing happened directly across from burke was a mirror advertising some brand of whiskey with which the policeman was unfamiliar he could see himself reflected clearly in its surface and as she passed so too was emily allinson but through some distortion in the glass it appeared as though her reflection moved more slowly than she did and burke almost believed that it seemed to turn its face toward him even though the original stared fixedly ahead that face for an instant was not that of emily allinson elongated and ruined its mouth gaped and its face was grotesquely charred in places the eyes like cinders in their sockets then mrs allinson stepped outside with her husband and the vision was gone burke walked closer to the mirror and saw that it was deeply tarnished as such cheap advertising tools tend to become its surface was mottled and uneven so that even his own face shimmered and buckled like an image in a carnival tent yet he remained unsettled even as he watched mrs allinson escort her husband down the street the doctor seeming almost to lean into her for support as they went there were few males under the age of fifty wandering through underbury that morning although this was by no means unusual most towns and villages were now sorely depleted of their stock of young men and burke had no doubt that when the present hostilities came to an end it would still be many years before places like underbury found some balance restored between the sexes burke returned to his sergeant but he allowed the remainder of his breakfast to go cold and untouched anything wrong sir asked stokes who had rapidly regained his appetite with the departure of the doctor just tiredness replied burke stokes nodded and finished off the runny yolk with a swipe of his toast it was a good breakfast he thought maybe not as good as the breakfasts mrs stokes cooked up for him but very satisfying nonetheless his good lady wife often offered the view that inspector burke could do with a little fattening up but burke was not one to accept invitations to dinner in any event stokes understood that by fattening up his wife meant that burke should be married with a good strong table beneath which he could rest his feet while a woman fed him cooked meals but inspector burke appeared to have little time for women he lived alone with his books and his cat and while he was always courteous in his dealings with ladies even with those for whom the term ladies usually came with the appendage of the night he remained distant and even slightly uncomfortable in female company such an existence would have proved insufferably lonely for stokes who fitted easily into the company of both sexes but police work had made him conscious of the differences between people and the complexity that lay beneath even the most apparently mundane of lives besides he felt a great admiration and even a fondness for the inspector who was a very good copper indeed stokes was proud to serve alongside him and his private life was a matter for himself and no one else burke stood and removed his coat from a hook on the wall i think we need a little air he said its time to see where mal trevors died burke and stokes stood at one side of the post constable waters at the other it was still possible to discern traces of the victims blood upon the wood and fragments of his jacket sleeve were caught in the barbs of the wire that formed a fence marking the verge of the property on which they stood beyond lay barren ground then the low wall surrounding the church and the village cemetery he was found against the post his sleeves hanging from the wire said waters poor beggar he added who found him asked stokes fred paxton he remembered trevors leaving the pub shortly before ten and he followed about an hour later did he touch the body no call to didnt need letters after his name to tell that he was dead well have to talk to paxton waters proudly drew himself up a little thought you might say that he and his missus live not half a mile up the road and i told them to expect us this morning burke would happily have flayed waters with the fence wire had he not taken this simple step but the detective allowed the village policeman a muted well done constable which seemed to content waters did you search the area burke resumed i did burke waited trevors was crossing the field when he was attacked and it was a cold night the temperature had not risen much since in fact if anything it had fallen burke could see his footsteps and those of his companions receding toward the road whoever attacked trevors must have left some sign upon the grass well there were only two sets of footprints mal trevorss and fred paxtons i tried to keep people away from the body once id seen what had been done to it so there wasnt as much disturbance as you might think perhaps he was attacked on the road said stokes then attempted to escape across the fields and died on the fence when he could go no further dont think so said waters there was no blood in the field between the road and the fence i checked burke knelt and examined the ground at the base of the post there was still a great deal of dried blood visible upon the blades of grass if what waters said was true and even burke was forced grudgingly to acknowledge a certain level of competence on the part of the village copper then waters had been attacked on this spot and had died here something must have been missed he said at last no disrespect to you constable but whoever killed trevors didnt materialize out of thin air well go over the ground on either side of the fence inch by inch there has to be some trail waters nodded his assent and the three men spread out from the death post burke moving toward the cemetery stokes toward the road and waters in the direction of a cottage some way distant which was he informed the detectives the home of the paxtons the policemen searched for an hour until the cold had burrowed into their hands and feet yet found nothing it seemed that mal trevors had been attacked quite literally from out of nowhere burke finished his examination of the ground and sat upon the low cemetery wall watching his fellow policemen as they moved across the field stokes bent over slightly his hands in his pockets waters less careful but still doing his best in his heart burke knew that it was a futile yet necessary effort to have made a proper search would have required more men and men were scarce but even then he remained unconvinced that anything would be found still it made no sense to him that a big man like trevors could be savagely murdered with no sign of a struggle he took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped it over his face he was sweating profusely and starting to feel a little ill its this place he thought it saps ones energy he recalled dr allinson walking down the main street virtually propped against his wife and the earlier lassitude of constable waters which seemed to have been arrested somewhat by the arrival of new blood in the form of the two london policemen underbury was a village emptied of its most virile men all of whom were now fighting in foreign fields those that remained must have been aware of their status as flawed bodies unsuited for combat or sacrifice and that awareness hung like a miasma over their lives now burke was feeling it too if he stayed here too long perhaps he also would end up like allinson exhausted after a few hours labor for the doctor told him that he had retired to bed shortly after one in the morning he had therefore rested for some six hours but at breakfast burke would have sworn that the man had not enjoyed proper sleep in many months burke slipped down from his perch and went to rejoin his colleagues as he did so his foot struck stone he stepped back then knelt down and brushed the tips of his fingers along the ground there was a slab there almost entirely covered by long grass and weeds the vegetation came away easily as burke pulled at it for some of it had merely fallen across the stone or had been placed there to conceal it there was no inscription upon it but burke knew its purpose this was an old community and he did not doubt that in times past the bodies of suicides of unbaptized children and of gallows fodder had been interred outside the walls of the cemetery it was common practice although it was rare to see a marker of any kind upon such graves now as he looked at the ground from this low angle he could see two other similar raised slabs nearby when he examined them he discovered that the stone on one had been broken recently someone had taken a hammer and chisel to it fragmenting the rock into a number of pieces and leaving a hole as big as burkes fist at the center burke leaned forward and slipped two fingers into the gap expecting to touch earth below instead there was only emptiness he tried a similar experiment using his pen tied to a piece of thread from his coat and again felt the instrument dangle in the space beneath the stone curious he thought he stood and saw stokes and waters watching him from the road there was nothing more to be learned by the cemetery wall so he joined them and made no argument when waters suggested that now might be the time to talk to the paxtons and perhaps take some tea for their trouble what kind of man was trevors burke asked waters as they made their way along the road the constable made a noise somewhere between a cough and a sigh i didnt care much for him myself he said he served time in a prison up north for assault then came back down here when he was released and lived with his father until the old man died after that it was just him alone on that farm and the mother died when mal was a boy her husband used to beat her but she never made a complaint constable stewart my predecessor he tried talking to her and to her husband but nothing ever came of it i reckon mal picked up some of his old mans bad habits because he was jailed for beating up a well youll forgive me sir but a prostitute in manchester near killed her from what i hear when he came back here he took up with a woman named elsie warden but she soon gave him a wide berth when he fell back into his old ways with her there was an incident about a week ago when he came to her house in the night and demanded to speak to her but her father and younger brothers sent him on his way theyd already given him a taste of his own medicine once and he didnt fancy another spoonful burke and stokes exchanged a look could the wardens be suspects they were all in the bar when trevors left and they were still there when fred paxton came back there with news of what hed found they never left even elsie was with them theyre in the clear as far as this is concerned waters reached into his pocket withdrew a folded sheet of paper and handed it to burke thought you might want this its a list of all the people who were in the bar that night a star marks the ones who were there from the time trevors left until the time the paxtons returned burke took the list and read it one name caught his eye mrs allinson was there that night and her husband saturday nights the big night in the village most people find their way to the inn sooner or later emily allinsons name was one of those marked with a star and she never left he said so quietly that nobody heard him utter the words the paxtons a young couple with no children were both relative newcomers to the area fred was born about twenty miles west of underbury and after a period of city living decided that it was time to return to the countryside with his wife the land at underbury had cost them comparatively little and they were now raising cattle and hoping for a good crop of vegetables to sell in the coming year they fed the detectives bread and cheese and brewed up a pot of tea large enough to sate a field of laborers i remember i was walking along my mind on getting home and i just happened to look to my right said fred paxton his left eye was yellowy white with tendrils of red crisscrossing upon it it brought back to burke an image from his childhood a visit to his uncles farm on the outskirts of the city where his father had drunk milk fresh from the cow and the boy had seen blood in the creamy liquid there was a shape draped across the fence paxton continued it looked like a scarecrow but theres no scarecrow on that land i climbed the gate and went to have a looksee i never seen so much blood i felt it under my boots id say mal hadnt been dead more than a couple of minutes when i found him why do you say that asked stokes his innards were steaming replied paxton simply what did you do then said burke i went back to the village fast as i could ran into the pub and told old ken the barman to send for the constable here i think some people might have been on their way to take a look at the body for themselves soon as they heard but as it happened the constable was passing when they came out and he went with them and you also went back i presume said stokes i did when all was done i went home to the missus here and told her what had happened burke turned his attention to the young woman seated to his left mrs paxton had spoken barely five words since their arrival she was a slight thing with dark hair and large blue eyes burke supposed that she might even have been termed beautiful is there anything you can add to what your husband has told us mrs paxton he asked her did you hear or see anything that night that might help us her voice was so low that burke had to lean forward to hear what she was saying i was asleep in bed when fred came in she said when he told me it was mal trevors well i just felt something turn inside me it was terrible she excused herself and rose from the table burke watched her go then caught himself doing so and returned his attention to the men around him do you remember how the people in the inn responded when you told them the news he asked paxton shocked i suppose he said was elsie warden shocked well she was later when she found out said paxton later dr allinson said that elsied taken ill not long before i returned his wife was looking after her in old kens kitchen burke asked if he might use the toilet so that he could have a little privacy in which to consider what he had learned fred paxton told him the facilities were outside and offered to show him but burke assured him that he would be able to find them alone he walked through the kitchen found the privy and relieved himself while he thought when he went back outside mrs paxton was standing at the kitchen window her upper body was bare and she was washing herself with a cloth from the sink she stopped when she saw him then lowered her right hand so that her breasts were exposed to him her body was very white burke looked at her for just a second longer then slowly she turned away her back a pale expanse against the shadows and disappeared from view burke skirted the side of the house returning to the main room through the front door upon his return waters and stokes stood and the four men walked together into the front yard paxton spoke to the constable about local matters and stokes ambled onto the road taking the air suddenly burke found mrs paxton by his side im sorry he said i didnt mean to embarrass you she blushed slightly but burke felt that the only real embarrassment was his own it wasnt your fault she said i do have just one other question he said to her she waited did you like mal trevors it took a moment for the answer to come no sir she said eventually i did not may i ask why he was a brute of a man and i saw the way he looked at me our land adjoined his and i made a point never to be alone in the fields when he was around did you tell your husband of this no but he knew how i felt right enough she stopped talking suddenly conscious that she might have said something to incriminate her fred but burke reassured her its all right mrs paxton neither you nor your husband is a suspect here she remained suspicious of him though so you say listen to me whoever killed mal trevors would have been covered in blood afterward i hardly think that description applied to your husband that night did it no she replied i see what you mean i dont think fred has it in him to kill mal trevors or to kill anyone come to that hes a good man but you felt distressed at trevorss death despite what you felt about him said burke again there was a pause before the reply came burke could see her husband over her shoulder no longer distracted by waters but now coming to his wifes aid there was little time left i wished that he was dead said mrs paxton softly the day before he died he brushed against me when we were in mr littles store together he did it deliberately and i felt him push into me i felt histhing he was a pig and i was tired of being afraid to walk in our own fields so for a moment i wished him dead and then a day later he was dead i suppose i wondered if somehow you might have caused his death yes fred paxton was now beside them is everything all right love he asked placing a protective arm around his wifes shoulders everythings fine now she said she smiled at her husband but it was to reassure him rather than to express any real emotion on her own part and burke caught a glimpse of the real power behind their marriage the strength hidden inside this small pretty woman and he felt a surge of unease everythings fine everythings fine now that mal trevors is dead sometimes you do get what you wish for dont you my love by now it was growing dark stokes remarked that winter seemed to be extending its reach far into february for although the winter solstice had long since passed daylight was in short supply in underbury and its surrounds constable waters counseled the detectives against visiting the warden family after dusktheyre an uneasy lot and like as not the old man will have a shotgun in his hand to greet visitors at this hourand so the policemen returned to the village where stokes and burke ate stew together in one corner of the inn untroubled by inquiries after their health burke announced that he wished to visit dr allinson and politely declined his sergeants offer of company on the road he wished to have some time alone and although stokes generally knew when to keep quiet in the presence of the inspector burke nevertheless found the presence of others distracting when he was trying to think he secured a lamp from the innkeeper and then once the directions offered were clear in his head he took to the road and walked to the allinsons house which lay about one mile north of the village it was a starless night and burke was oppressed by unseen clouds all of the windows were dark when he arrived at the house save one at the very highest eave he knocked loudly and waited expecting a housekeeper to open the door instead after some minutes and to his surprise the lady of the house herself greeted him mrs allinson wore a very formal blue dress that extended from her ankles to her neck where it ended in a faint ruffle beneath her chin it was somewhat dated to burkes eye but she carried it off with aplomb aided by her height and her fine features not least of which were the flawed green eyes now regarding burke with polite inquiry and he felt not a little amusement inspector burke this is a surprise she said my husband had not told me to expect you i regret any imposition said burke i take it that your husband is not at home mrs allinson stepped back and invited the policeman inside after an almost imperceptible pause burke accepted the invitation and followed her into the drawing room once mrs allinson had illuminated the lamps im afraid he was called out suddenly such are the duties of a village physician he shouldnt be very long may i offer you tea burke declined i rather expected you to have a housekeeper or a servant of some sort he said as mrs allinson took a seat on a couch and waved him toward an easy chair i gave her the night off said mrs allinson her name is elsie warden shes a local girl have you met elsie inspector burke replied that he had not yet had that pleasure youll like her said mrs allinson a lot of men seem to like elsie once again burke was aware of mrs allinsons distant amusement an amusement that he believed she felt at his expense although he was unable to guess why this might be so i understand you were with her on the night mal trevors died mrs allinson raised her left eyebrow slowly an action followed closely by the hint of a smile on the left side of her mouth as though a wire extended from eye to jaw linking their movements i was with my husband inspector she replied do you usually spend your saturday nights at the village inn you sound almost disapproving inspector dont you believe that ladies should socialize with their husbands doesnt your good lady accompany you on the occasional evening im not married that is a shame said mrs allinson i believe that a wife tames a man wonderfully a good woman like the alchemists of old can make gold from the lead of most men except the alchemists failed in their efforts said burke lead remained lead i expect the late mal trevors might have been construed as a man of lead dont you think mal trevors was corrupted metal said mrs allinson dismissively in my view he is of more benefit to the earth now that he lies beneath it than he ever was when he walked upon it there at least he will provide food for worms and nourishment for plants poor eating admittedly but sustenance for all that burke did not remark upon this display of feeling it appears that few people have a good word to say about the late mr trevors he said i expect it will be a short eulogy i believe succinct is the word and any eulogy would be more than he deserves do you have any theories yet on how he might have died they talk in the village of a wild animal although my husband scoffs at the possibility we are keeping an open mind on the subject said burke nevertheless we appear to have become sidetracked from the subject of miss elsie warden my understanding is that she was taken ill on the night that mal trevors died she had a moment of weakness said mrs allinson i took care of her as best i could may i ask the cause you may ask elsie warden if you choose its not my place to tell you such details i thought it was only doctors who took the hippocratic oath women have their oaths too inspector and i doubt if even hippocrates himself could rival them for their fastness when they choose to be silent i am curious though as to whom it was that spoke to you of elsie wardens illness im afraid i cant say replied burke policemen too have their secrets never mind said mrs allinson i expect i will find out soon enough elsie warden clearly trusts you a great deal for one so recently arrived in the village mrs allinson tilted her head slightly and regarded burke with renewed interest rather like a cat that suddenly finds the mouse with which it is toying making an unexpected but ultimately doomed break for freedom all the while with its tail pinned firmly beneath the felines paw elsie is a strong young woman answered mrs allinson with what burke construed as a degree more caution than she had previously exercised this is not a village known for its tolerance of strong women im afraid i dont understand said burke they hanged witches here many years ago said mrs allinson three women died at the heart of the village and more languished in jail until they too began to die the hanged women still bear the name of underbury when they are spoken of and their bodies lie buried beyond the cemetery walls the three stones said burke so youve seen them i didnt know what they were although i suspected that they marked graves of some kind said burke i was surprised to see plots beyond the wall commemorated in any way i dont believe the stones were placed there to commemorate three murdered women said mrs allinson there is a cross carved in the underside of each stone facing down the superstition that caused their deaths followed them into the ground how do you know about the crosses the village records in a small place like this one has to entertain oneself as best one can yet these are more enlightened times and underbury is no longer as it once was would you have considered mal trevors an enlightened man inspector i never met him except to look upon his remains all i have is the testimony of others as to his character why are you not married inspector asked mrs allinson suddenly why is there no woman in your life now it was burkes turn to answer cautiously my job takes up much of my time he began uncertain why he was even attempting to explain himself to this woman except that in doing so he might learn more about her perhaps too i have never met the right woman mrs allinson leaned forward slightly i suspect she said that there is no right woman for you im not entirely sure that you like women inspector i dont mean in the physical sense she added quickly for i am sure that you have appetites like most men have rather i mean that you dont like them as beings you perhaps distrust them maybe even despise them you dont understand them and that makes you fear them their appetites their emotions the workings of their bodies and their minds all are alien to you and you are afraid of them for that reason just as the men of underbury were afraid of the women whom they named witches and hanged amid the winter snow im not afraid of women mrs allinson said burke a little more defensively than he had intended she smiled before she spoke again and burke was reminded of the faint smile on the face of mrs paxton as she reassured her husband earlier that day he heard the sound of footsteps approaching the house their rhythm slightly distorted and knew that dr allinson had returned yet he found himself staring only at mrs allinson caught in the depths of those green eyes really inspector i dont know if thats true she said apparently untroubled by any offense that she might be causing him in fact i dont believe thats true at all dr allinson joined them and after a suitable period had elapsed his wife announced that she was retiring for the evening i know ill be seeing you again inspector she said as she left them i look forward to it burke spent another hour with allinson learning little that was new but content to bounce theories back and forth with someone whose knowledge of physiology was so intimate allinson offered to take him back to the village but burke declined consenting only to a little brandy to warm him on the journey burke almost instantly regretted taking the brandy once he set out for the village for while it was undoubtedly warming it clouded his head and the cold was doing little to sober him twice he almost slipped before he had even made it to the road and once upon it he kept to the center fearing for his safety if he drew too close to the ditch he had been walking for only a few minutes when he heard movement in the bushes to his right he stopped and listened but the presence in the undergrowth had also paused burke like stokes was every inch the city dweller and supposed that there must be a great many nocturnal animals in these parts yet whatever was on the other side of the bushes was quite large perhaps it was a badger he thought or a fox he moved on the lamp raised and felt something brush past his coat he turned suddenly and caught a flash of black as the creature entered the bushes to his left it had crossed the road behind his back so close to him that it had touched him as it went burke reached behind himself and brushed at his coat his fingers came back coated with something dark and flaking like pieces of charred paper he brought them closer to the lamplight and examined them lifting them to his nose to sniff them as he did so they smelled of burning right enough he thought but not of paper burke recalled an incident some years earlier when he had been forced to enter a house about to be engulfed by fire in an effort to extract any survivors before the building collapsed he found only one a woman and her body was already badly burned when he discovered her she expired upon the road outside but burke remembered the way that fragments of her skin adhered to his hands and the smell of her had never left him it was why he rarely ate pork for the smell of roasting pig was too close to that of human meat burning that was the smell that now lay upon his fingers he brushed it away on his coat as best he could and continued toward the village faster now his footsteps slapping upon the road as he ran and all the time he was conscious of being followed from the undergrowth until at last he came to the margins of underbury itself and the creature stopped before the first house burke was breathing heavily as he scanned the blackness in the bushes he thought for an instant that he saw a darker shape within it a figure within the shadows but it was gone almost as soon as he registered it still its shape stayed with him and he saw it in his dreams that night the shape of its hips the swelling of its breasts it was the figure of a woman the next morning stokes and burke accompanied by waters drove across the village to the farmhouse occupied by elsie warden and her family burke was quiet on the journey he did not speak of what had occurred the night before on the road back to the village but he had slept badly and the stink of charred meat seemed to cling to his pillow once he awoke to the sound of tapping at his window but when he went to check upon it all was still and silent outside yet he could have sworn for a moment that the smell of roasted fats was stronger by the sill he dreamed of mrs paxton watching him through the glass with her breasts exposed but in his dream her face was replaced by that of mrs allinson and the green of her eyes had turned to the black of cinders elsie wardens brothers too young to enlist were out in the fields and her father off on some business of his own in a neighboring town so only elsie and her mother were in the kitchen when the policemen arrived they were offered tea but they declined in truth burke was not entirely certain why they had come except that there had clearly been bad blood between the warden family and the late mal trevors mrs warden remained sullen and unresponsive in the face of their questions and burke saw her glance occasionally through the window that looked out over the familys fields hoping to catch sight of her sons returning from their labors elsie warden was more forthcoming and burke was a little surprised at the level of assurance exhibited by a young woman brought up in a household largely composed of menfolk we were all in the pub that evening she told burke me my mum and dad and my brothers all of us thats the way around here saturday nights are special but you knew mal trevors he tried to court me she said her eyes dared burke to dispute any mans reasons for pursuing her the detective was not about to argue with her elsie warden had lush dark hair fine features and a body that sergeant stokes was doing his very utmost not to notice and how did you respond to his advances elsie warden pursed her lips coyly whatever do you mean by that she asked burke felt himself redden stokes appeared to be suddenly afflicted by a fit of coughing i meant burke began wondering what exactly he had meant when stokes came to the rescue i think what the inspector means miss is did you like mal trevors or was he barking up the wrong tree so to speak aaah said elsie as if she were only now beginning to understand the direction the conversation was taking i liked him well enough to begin she always was attracted to bad sorts said her mother speaking a full sentence for the first time since they had arrived she kept her head down as she spoke and did not look at her daughter burke wondered if the old woman was scared of her elsie warden seemed to radiate life and energy and it was clear that she had the capacity to arouse strong feelings in men there was something fascinating about her especially seeing her seated next to the wornout figure of her mother in the gloomy kitchen was mal trevors a bad sort asked burke elsie tried the coy look again but it faltered a little on this occasion i think you know what mal trevors was she said did he hurt you he tried what happened i struck him and i ran and then he came looking for me and took a beating for his troubles said burke i wouldnt know anything about that she replied burke nodded he took his notebook from his pocket and flicked through the pages although he had no need of its contents to guide his thoughts sometimes he found that the very act of checking the written word was enough to disconcert an individual under police scrutiny he was pleased to see elsie warden crane her neck slightly as though in an effort to discern what might be contained within im told you took ill the night mal trevors was killed he said elsie warden flinched it was a small reaction but enough for burke he waited for an answer and watched as elsie appeared to analyze the possible answers she might give burke felt a shift in her and was aware of the charm slowly seeping out of her disappearing between the cracks on the floor to be replaced by what he could only regard as a form of restrained ferocity thats true she said before or after you heard about mal trevors before may i ask what ailed you you may ask she said if you want to embarrass yourself ill take that chance said burke i had my visitor she said the monthly guest are you happy now burke gave no sign of happiness or unhappiness underbury was giving him muchneeded practice in hiding any embarrassment he might feel and mrs allinson assisted you she did she took me home later and tended to me it must have been most severe to require her ministrations he was aware of a sharp intake of breath from stokes and even waters felt compelled to intervene now sir dont you think weve gone far enough he said burke stood for the moment he said suddenly he staggered overcome it seemed by a moment of weakness he stumbled and brushed against elsie warden then found purchase on the mantel are you all right sir stokes had come to his aid burke waved him away im fine he said just a little lightheadedness elsie warden now had her back to him im sorry miss he said i hope i didnt injure you elsie shook her head and turned to face him burke thought she was a little paler than before and her hands were folded across her chest no she said you didnt he took a breath thanked the women then left mrs warden saw them to the door youre a rude man she said to burke my husband will hear of this i dont doubt it he replied i should tend to your daughter if i were you she looks ill he said nothing to stokes or the disapproving waters as they returned to the village instead he thought of elsie warden and the look of pain that had crossed her face as he brushed against her body and of the new speckles of blood upon her blouse that were almost but not quite hidden by her folded arms mal trevors was buried in the churchyard the following day many turned out for his funeral despite his reputed failings as a human being for in a village such as underbury a funeral served a greater social purpose than that represented by the mere interment of a body it was an opportunity to exchange information to gather and to speculate as burke looked around the graveside he could see faces familiar to him from his brief time in the village the wardens were there the family making its dislike of burke clear only through hostile glances in his direction rather than outright force so too were the allinsons and the paxtons as the ceremony concluded burke saw emily allinson leave her husband who made his way over to join burke and stokes mrs allinson walked by the wall of the cemetery staring out over the fields toward the spot where mal trevors had died she exchanged a few words with elsie warden as she passed her by and they both looked for a moment in burkes direction and laughed before going their separate ways mrs paxton seemed to be keeping her distance from both of them but emily allinson cornered her and laid a hand on her arm a gesture simultaneously intimate and somehow threatening for it effectively held mrs paxton in place while the tall elegant mrs allinson leaned down to talk to her what do you think thats about sir asked stokes a little friendly greeting perhaps doesnt look too friendly to me no it doesnt does it perhaps we need to have another talk with mrs paxton by now allinson was almost upon them any progress on your investigation he said slow and steady said burke who felt a sudden stab of guilt as he recalled the appearance of the doctors wife in his dream i hear you stirred up the wardens theyve spoken about our visit the mother has spoken of little else she seems to think youre somewhat improper in your manner shes suggesting that someone ought to teach you a lesson any candidates for the role no shortage apparently the warden family is large extended and very male id watch my back if i were you inspector i have sergeant stokes here to watch my back said burke it leaves me free to watch other people allinson grinned good im rather hoping that you wont have any reason to call on my services in a personal capacity you know said burke im rather hoping that too tell me does your wife know a little of medicine many doctors wives do mrs allinson is trained as a midwife and her skills now extend considerably beyond that she cant practice medicine of course but she knows what to do in the event of a crisis the women of underbury are fortunate to have her then said burke very fortunate indeed the rest of the day added little to the sum of knowledge accumulated by the two policemen with the help of constable waters they completed their questioning of all those who had been present at the inn on the night of mal trevorss death and began talking to many of those who were not present while few had a good word to say about the dead man there was nothing to link them to the events of that night and by the time evening came burkes natural silence had deteriorated into sullenness he bid waters a curt goodnight paused for a time to exchange some words with his sergeant and then ascended to his bedroom where he remained seated on his bed for the rest of the evening rising only to receive his supper at the door in time he must have fallen asleep for the room was darker than he remembered when he opened his eyes and the inn was quiet he was not even aware of why he had awoken until he heard voices speaking softly beneath his window burke left his bed and walked to the glass concealing himself in the shadows as best he could two women stood in the yard below and in the dim light filtering from the inn he could make out the faces of emily allinson and mrs paxton the women appeared to be arguing for he could see mrs allinsons finger stabbing the air before the smaller darker mrs paxton burke could not make out their words but then mrs allinson abruptly walked away some seconds later mrs paxton followed but by then burke was already on his way downstairs he left the inn moved through the yard and soon found himself following the two women along the road that led out of the village they were heading toward the paxton house but as soon as mrs paxton caught up with mrs allinson they left the road and made their way across the fields they seemed to be heading for the place in which mal trevors died until burke saw them reach a small gate in the fence open it and move toward the wall of the churchyard the inspector kept low as best he could aided by the clouds that obscured the moon he was almost at the gate when the women stopped and turned to face him welcome inspector said mrs allinson she did not look surprised to see him in fact burke thought she looked rather pleased and he knew then that he had stepped firmly into the trap they had set for him mrs paxton said nothing but kept her head down unwilling even to look in his direction burke heard footsteps approaching from behind he turned to see elsie warden moving slowly through the grass her hands brushing the tips of the weeds as she walked she stopped when she was some twenty feet from him mrs paxton in turn moved away from mrs allinson so that burke found himself at the center of a triangle formed by the three women is this how you finished off mal trevors he asked we never laid a hand on mal trevors said mrs allinson we didnt have to said elsie burke tried to keep turning always holding two women in his sight and hoping that he might be fast enough to prevent an attack by the third i suspect there are wounds on your chest miss warden said burke and on my scalp she said he fought back he always was quick with his hands was mal so you attacked him in a manner of speaking it was mrs allinson im afraid i dont understand oh said mrs allinson but you will burke felt the ground shift slightly beneath his feet he leapt away fearful of plummeting into some terrible depths over by the cemetery wall fragments of stone shot a foot into the air leaving gaping holes where they once lay he heard a howling sound like wind rushing through a tunnel and then something scratched his face opening parallel wounds across his cheek and nose he stumbled backward raising his arms to protect himself and watched as the front of his coat was torn open by unseen claws he smelled foul breath and thought for a moment that he caught a disturbance in the air as of heat rising from summer ground slowly its form became clearer allowing burke to see however indistinctly the shape of breasts and hips faced with a target burke struck he pounded his fist into the figure before him there was slight resistance before his fist passed through it but he saw emily allinsons head jerk backward blood spurted from her nose burke tried to punch again but he was attacked from behind before he could do so his scalp was torn apart and he felt liquid warmth upon his neck he tried to rise but his right hand was wrenched away from him and forced into the air a sharp pain ran through three of his fingers and the impression of teeth appeared upon the skin of his knuckles over by the fence he saw elsie wardens teeth gritted elsie shook her head furiously the pain increased and the fingers were severed from burkes hand his eyes closed and he prepared to die then from somewhere in the darkness he heard a booming sound and a familiar voice said thatll be enough now burkes eyelids felt heavy and blood dripped from the lashes when he finally managed to force them open sergeant stokes stood by the cemetery wall and he held a shotgun in his hands you took your bloody time thought burke he caught sight of a disturbance in the air once again moving quickly toward stokes once again it seemed to him to approximate the shape of a woman its body was blackened and long fair hair trailed behind it as it crawled along the ground to attack stokes he tried to warn his sergeant but no words came instead his own head was pulled back by the hair and he felt teeth upon his neck stokes saw the presence when it was almost upon him instinctively he swung the shotgun around and fired for a moment nothing happened then slowly emily allinsons mouth opened and a great gush of red poured from it she rocked upon her feet and the front of her green dress darkened burke heard a scream that seemed to come from the ground beneath him echoed in turn by elsie warden his hair was released and he fell to the dirt a weight upon his back as he was used as a stepping stone by an unseen presence burkes left hand reached out and grasped a rock upon the ground with the last of his strength he rose up and straddled the thing bringing the rock down with all the force that he could muster upon its head he could feel it moving beneath him although he saw it only as a shimmering in the air the stone hit its target and it spasmed beneath him behind him elsie wardens skull cracked her eyes rolled back in her head and she fell down dead stokes was running toward him now reloading the shotgun as he came he was watching mrs paxton but she was retreating from them her face a mask of horror and disgust she turned from them and ran across the fields making for the little cottage that she shared with her husband stokes shouted after her warning her to stop let her go said burke we know where to find her and then he sank back on the ground unconscious summer came and the streets grew bright with the plumage of women the two men met in a bar close to paddington it was quiet the lunchtime drinkers now departed and the evening crowd yet to arrive one man was thinner and perhaps a little younger than the other and wore a glove on his right hand his companion placed two beers on the table before them then took a seat against the wall how is the hand sir asked stokes it hurts a little still said burke its odd i can feel the ends of my fingers even though theyre no longer there strange dont you think stokes shrugged his shoulders to tell the truth sir i dont know anymore whats strange and what isnt he raised his glass and took a long draft you dont have to call me sir any longer you know said burke doesnt seem natural calling you anything else sir said stokes i do miss being called sergeant though im trying to get the missus to call me it just so i can hear it again but she wont agree how is the bank quiet he said dont care much for it to be honest but it keeps me busy the money helps though yes im sure it does they were silent then until stokes said you still think we did right not telling them what we saw the two men had not met in many months but they had never been ones to dance around a subject of concern to them yes said burke they wouldnt have believed us even if we had mrs allinson had my blood and skin in her nails and the bite marks on my hand matched those of elsie warden they attacked me thats what the evidence said and who were we to disagree with the evidence killing women said stokes i suppose they had no choice but to send us on our way no i suppose they didnt burke looked at his former sergeant and laid his good hand upon the older mans arm but never forget you didnt kill women you never fired at a woman and i never struck one let your conscience be clear on that score stokes nodded i hear they let the paxton woman go he said she supported our story without her testimony it would have gone much harder for us doesnt seem right though she wished a man dead i dont think she expected that wish to come true and i dont believe that she wanted a part of what the other women were offering she was weak but she did nothing wrong nothing that we can prove at any rate stokes took another draft from his glass and that poor beggar allinson yes said burke poor allinson the doctor had taken his own life in the weeks that followed the incidents at underbury he had never uttered a word of blame toward stokes or burke for the part they played in his wifes death burke spent most of his waking hours thinking about that night juggling facts with suspicions but never able to make them fit to his satisfaction into a cohesive theory a village depleted of its men the arrival of a strong woman mrs allinson from outside the threat posed to elsie warden and perhaps mrs paxton by mal trevors and the response to that threat which had led to trevorss death and the subsequent attack on burke and stokes burke had not yet been able or willing to put a name to that response he now knew more about the underbury witches and their leader ellen drury burned as she hanged possession the term that stokes had used in the aftermath was one possibility but it seemed inadequate to burke to him it was something more he believed with all his heart that it came from within the three women not solely from some outside force but then he would have been the first to admit that he had never enjoyed a great understanding of the fairer sex they finished their drinks then parted on the street with vague promises to meet again although both men understood that they would not burke walked in the direction of hyde park while stokes stopped at a flower stall to buy some carnations for his wife neither saw the small darkhaired woman who stood in the shadows of a lane watching them closely the air shimmered around her as though distorted by the summer heat and a faint smell of roasting meat could be scented by passersby mrs paxton made her choice and slowly began to follow burke toward the park the inkpot monkey mr edgerton was suffering from writers block it was he quickly grew to realize a most distressing complaint a touch of influenza might lay up a man for a day or two yet his mind could continue its ruminations gout might leave him racked with suffering yet his fingers could still grasp a pen and turn pain to pennies but this blockage this barrier to all progress had left mr edgerton a virtual cripple his mind would not function his hands would not write and his bills would not be paid in a career spanning the best part of two decades he had never before encountered such an obstacle to his profession he had in that time produced five moderately successful if rather indifferent novels a book of memoirs that in truth owed more to invention than experience and a collection of poetry that could most charitably be described as having stretched the capacities of free verse to the limits of their acceptability mr edgerton made his modest living from writing by the yard based on the firm but unstated belief that if he produced a sufficient quantity of material then something of quality was bound to creep in if only in accordance with the law of averages journalism ghostwriting versifying editorializing nothing was beneath his limited capabilities yet for the past six months the closest he had come to a writing project was the construction of his weekly grocery list a veritable tundra of empty white pages stretched before him the gleaming nib of his pen poised above them like a reluctant explorer his mind was a blank the creative juices sapped from it to leave behind only a dried husk of frustration and bewilderment he began to fear his desk once his beloved companion but now reduced to the status of a faithless lover and it pained him to look upon it paper ink imagination all had betrayed him leaving him lost and alone at first mr edgerton had almost welcomed the opportunity to rest his creative muscles he took coffee with those less successful than himself safe in the knowledge that a brief hiatus in production was unlikely to damage his reputation among them as a prolific producer of adequate material he attended the best shows making sure that his presence was noted by taking his seat at the last possible moment when questioned about his latest endeavors he would merely smile mysteriously and tap the side of his nose with his index finger a gesture employed by mr edgerton to suggest that he was in the midst of some great literary endeavor but which instead gave the unfortunate impression that a particularly irritating fragment of snuff had stubbornly lodged itself in his nostril but after a time mr edgerton stopped attending musical performances and his peers were forced to find other sources of amusement at the citys coffeehouses conversations about writing began to pain him and the sight of those whose creative juices flowed more freely than his own compounded his agony he found himself unable to keep the bitterness from his voice as he spoke of such blessed souls arousing immediately the suspicions of his fellow less prolific scribblers for although they were more than willing to skewer anothers reputation with a barbed witticism or unflattering anecdote they avoided the use of brute insults or indeed any form of behavior that might lead a casual listener to suspect that they were not their rivals superiors in talent success and critical acclaim mr edgerton came to fear that even his silences now gave him away clouded over as they were with brooding and frustration and so his social appearances grew fewer and fewer until at last they ceased altogether in truth his colleagues were not unduly troubled by his absence they had reluctantly tolerated his modest success now with the taint of failure upon him they relished his discomfort to further complicate matters mr edgertons wallet had begun to feel decidedly lightweight of late and nothing will dampen a mans ardor for life more than an empty pocket like a rodent gripped in the coils of a great constricting snake he found that the more he struggled against his situation the tighter the pressure upon him grew necessity wrote ovid is the mother of invention for mr edgerton desperation was proving to be the father of despair and so once again he found himself wandering the streets trawling the citys great rivers of people in the hope of netting a single idea in time he came to charing cross road but the miles of shelved books only depressed him further especially since he could find none of his own among their number head down he cut through cecil court and made his way into covent garden in the faint hope that the vibrancy of the market might spur his sluggish subconscious into action he was almost at the magistrates court when something caught his eye in the window of a small antiques shop there partially hidden behind a framed portrait of admiral nelson and a stuffed magpie was a most remarkable inkpot the inkpot was silver and about four inches tall with a lacquered base adorned by chinese characters but what was most striking about it was the small mummified monkey that perched upon its lid its clawed toes clasped upon the rim and its dark eyes gleaming in the summer sunlight it was obviously an infant of its species perhaps even a fetus of some kind for it was no more than three inches in height and predominantly gray in color except for its face which was blackened around the mouth as if the monkey had been sipping from its own ink it really was a most ghastly creature but mr edgerton had acquired the civilized mans taste for the grotesque and he quickly made his way into the darkened shop to inquire about the nature of the item in question the owner of the business proved to be almost as distasteful in appearance as the creature that had attracted mr edgertons attention as though the man were somehow father to the monkey his teeth were too numerous for his mouth his mouth too large for his face and his head too great for his body combined with a pronounced stoop to his back his aspect was that of one constantly on the verge of toppling over he also smelled decidedly odd and mr edgerton quickly concluded that he was probably in the habit of sleeping in his clothes a deduction that briefly led the afflicted writer to an unwelcome speculation upon the nature of the body that lay concealed beneath the layers of unwashed clothing nevertheless the proprietor proved to be a veritable font of knowledge about the items in his possession including the article that had brought mr edgerton into his presence the mummified primate was he informed the writer an inkpot monkey a creature of chinese mythology according to the myth the monkey provided artistic inspiration in return for the residues of ink left in the bottom of the inkpot as he spoke the dealer placed the inkpot on the counter before him like an angler skillfully spinning a lure before a hungry fish in the hope of drawing it onto his hook mr edgertons limited ability like that of so many of his kind was inversely proportionate to his sense of selfregard and he was therefore generally unwilling to entertain the possibility that his genius could be attributed to any outside agency nevertheless he was a man profoundly in need of inspiration from any source and had recently been considering opium or cheap gin as possible catalysts having heard the story of the inkpot he required no further convincing he paid over money he could ill afford for the faint hope of redemption offered by the curiosity and made his way back to his small apartment with the inkpot and its monkey tucked beneath his arm in a cloak of brown paper mr edgerton occupied a set of rooms above a tobacconists store on marylebone high street a recent development forced upon him by his straitened circumstances while mr edgerton did not himself partake of the noble weed his walls were yellowed by the fumes that regularly wended their way between the cracks in the floorboards and his clothing and furnishings reeked of assorted cigars cigarettes pipe tobaccos and even the more eyewatering forms of snuff his dwelling was therefore more than a little depressing and would almost certainly have provided him with the impetus necessary to improve his finances were he not so troubled by the absence of his muse that evening mr edgerton sat at his desk once again and stared at the paper before him and stared and stared before him the inkpot monkey squatted impassively its eyes reflecting the lamplight and lending its mummified form an intimation of life that was both distracting and unsettling mr edgerton poked at it tentatively with his pen leaving a small black mark on its chest like most writers he had a shallow knowledge of a great many largely useless matters among these was anthropology a consequence of one of his earlier works an evolutionary fantasy entitled the monkeys uncle one newspaper had described it as largely adequate if inconsequential mr edgerton grateful to be reviewed at all was rather pleased yet despite searching through three reference volumes he had been unable to identify the origins of the inkpot monkey and had begun to take this as a bad omen after another unproductive hour had gone by its tedium broken only by the spread of an occasional inkblot upon the paper mr edgerton rose and determined to amuse himself by emptying and then refilling his pen still devoid of inspiration he wondered if there was some part of the arcane ritual of fueling ones pen from the inkpot that he had somehow neglected to perform he reached down and had gently grasped the monkey in order to raise the lid when something pricked his skin painfully he drew back his hand immediately and examined the wounded digit a deep cut ran across the pad of his index finger and blood from the abrasion was flowing down the length of his pen and congregating at the nib from which it dripped into the inkpot with soft regular splashes mr edgerton began to suck the offended member meanwhile turning his attention to the monkey in an effort to ascertain the cause of his injury the lamplight revealed a small raised ridge behind the creatures neck where a section of curved spine had burst through its tattered fur a little of mr edgertons blood could be perceived on the yellowed pallor of the bone the wounded writer retrieved a small bandage from his medicine cabinet and bound his finger before resuming his seat at his desk he regarded the monkey warily as he filled his pen from the well then put pen to paper and began to write at first the familiarity of the act overcame any feelings of surprise at its sudden return so that mr edgerton had completed two pages of close script and was about to embark upon a third before he paused and looked in puzzlement first at his pen then at the paper he reread what he had written the beginnings of a tale of a man who sacrifices love and happiness at the altar of wealth and success and found it more than satisfactory it was in fact as fine as anything he had ever written although he was baffled as to its source nevertheless he shrugged and continued writing grateful that his old imagination had apparently woken from its torpor he wrote long into the night refilling his pen as required and so bound up was he in his exertions that he failed entirely to notice that his wound had reopened and was dripping blood onto pen and page and at those moments when he replenished his instrument into the depths of the small chinese inkpot mr edgerton slept late the following morning and awoke to find himself weakened by his efforts of the night before it was he supposed the consequence of months of inactivity and after tea and some hot buttered toast he felt much refreshed he returned to his desk to find that the inkpot monkey had fallen from its perch and now lay on its back amid his pencils and pens gingerly mr edgerton lifted it from the desk and found that it now weighed considerably more than the inkpot itself and that physics rather than any flaw in the inkpots construction had played its part in dislodging the monkey from its seat he also noted that the creatures fur was far more lustrous than it had appeared in the window of the antiques shop and now shimmered healthily in the morning sunlight and then quite suddenly mr edgerton felt the monkey move its arms and legs stretched wearily as if it were waking from some long slumber and its mouth opened in a wide yawn displaying small blunt teeth alarmed mr edgerton dropped the monkey and heard it emit a startled squeak as it landed on the desk it lay there for a moment or two then slowly raised itself on its haunches and regarded the writer with a slightly hurt expression before ambling over to the inkpot and squatting down gently beside it with its left hand it raised the lid of the inkpot and waited patiently for mr edgerton to fill his pen for a time the bewildered writer was unable to move so taken aback was he at this turn of events then when it became clear that he had no other option but to begin writing or go mad he reached for his pen and supplied it from the well the monkey watched him impassively until the reservoir was filled and mr edgerton had begun to write then promptly fell fast asleep despite his unnerving encounter with the newly animated monkey mr edgerton put in a most productive day and quickly found himself with the bulk of five chapters written none of them requiring more than a cursory rewrite it was only when the light had begun to fade and mr edgertons arm had started to ache that the monkey awoke and padded softly across a virgin page to where mr edgertons pen lay in his hand the monkey grasped the writers finger in its tiny paws then placed its mouth against the cut and began to suck it took mr edgerton a moment to realize what was occurring at which point he rose with a shout and shook the monkey from his finger it bounced against the inkpot striking its head soundly against its base and lay unmoving upon a sheet of paper at once mr edgerton reached for it and raised it in the palm of his left hand the monkey was obviously stunned for its eyes were now half closed and it was dazedly moving its head from side to side as it tried to focus instantly mr edgerton was seized with regret at his hasty action he had endangered the monkey which he now acknowledged to be the source of his newfound inspiration without it he would be lost torn between fear and disgust mr edgerton reluctantly made his decision he squeezed together his thumb and forefinger causing a droplet of blood to emerge from the cut and then his gorge rising allowed it to drip into the monkeys mouth the effect was instantaneous the little mammals eyes opened fully it rose on its haunches and then reached for and grasped the wounded finger there it suckled happily undisturbed by the revolted mr edgerton until it had taken its meal whereupon it burped contentedly and resumed its slumbers mr edgerton gently laid it beside the inkpot and then taking up his pen wrote another two chapters before retiring early to his bed thus it continued each day mr edgerton rose fed the monkey a little blood wrote fed the monkey once again in the evening wrote some more then went to bed and slept like a dead man his rest only occasionally disturbed by the memories being dredged up in the course of his work as old lovers and forgotten friends found their place in the narrative now taking shape upon his desk the monkey appeared to require little in the way of affection or attention beyond its regular feeds of blood and the occasional ripe banana mr edgerton in turn decided to ignore the fact that the monkey was growing at quite an alarming rate so that it was now obliged to sit beside him on a small chair while he worked and had taken to dozing on the sofa after its meals in fact mr edgerton wondered if it might not be possible to train the monkey to do some light household duties thereby allowing him more time to write although when he suggested this to the monkey through the use of primitive sign language it grew quite irate and locked itself in the bathroom for an entire afternoon in fact it was not until mr edgerton returned home one day from a visit to his publisher to find the inkpot monkey trying on one of his suits that he began to experience serious doubts about their relationship he had noticed some new and especially disturbing changes in his companion it had begun to molt leaving clumps of unsightly gray hair on the carpets and exposing sections of pinkwhite skin it had also lost some weight from its face that or its bone structure had begun to alter for it presented a more angular aspect than before in addition the monkey was now over four feet tall and mr edgerton had been forced to open veins in his wrists and legs in order to keep it sated the more mr edgerton considered the matter the more convinced he became that the creature was undergoing some significant transformation yet there were still chapters of the book to be completed and the writer was reluctant to alienate his mascot so he suffered in silence sleeping now for much of the day and emerging only to write for increasingly short periods of time before returning to his bed and collapsing into a dreamless slumber on the twentyninth day of august he delivered his completed manuscript to his publisher on the fourth day of september which was mr edgertons birthday he was gratified to receive a most delightful communication from his editor praising him as a genius and promising that this novel long anticipated and at last delivered would place mr edgerton in the pantheon of literary greats and assure him of a most comfortable and wellregarded old age that night as mr edgerton prepared to drift off into contented sleep he felt a tug at his wrist and looked down to see the inkpot monkey fastened upon it its cheeks pulsing as it sucked away at the cut tomorrow thought mr edgerton tomorrow i will deal with it tomorrow i will have it taken to the zoo and our bargain will be concluded forever but as he grew weaker and his eyes closed the inkpot monkey raised its head and mr edgerton realized at last that no zoo would ever take the inkpot monkey for the inkpot monkey had become something very different indeed mr edgertons book was published the following year to universal acclaim a reception was given in his honor by his grateful publishers to which the brightest lights of london s literary community flocked to pay tribute it would be mr edgertons final public appearance from that day forth he was never again seen in london and retired instead to the small country estate that he purchased with the royalties from his great valedictory work that night speeches were made and an indifferent poem recited by one of mr edgertons new admirers but the great man himself remained silent throughout when called upon to give his speech he replied only with a small but polite bow to his guests accepting their applause with a gracious smile and while all those around him drank the finest champagne and feasted on stuffed quail and smoked salmon mr edgerton could be found sitting quietly in a corner stroking some unruly hairs on his chest and munching contentedly on a single ripe banana the shifting of the sands the decision to reopen the rectory at black sands was not one made lightly the church of england it was felt was not welcome in that place although antipathy was not directed toward the kings church alone the community had resisted the presence of organized religion since its inception some four hundred years earlier true chapels had been built there both catholic and protestant but without worshippers what was a chapel one might as well have erected a small hut close to the shore for at least then bathers could have made some use of it the small catholic church had been deconsecrated at the turn of the century and subsequently demolished after a fire consumed its roof and turned its walls as black as the very grains that gave the village its name the protestant house of worship remained but was in a state of shameful neglect there was no living to be had at black sands the people of the village when asked pointed out that they had no need of clergymen that they had survived and even prospered through their own efforts and there was some truth to what they said this was a treacherous coastline with riptides and hidden fatal currents yet in its entire history not one soul from black sands had fallen victim to the sea and not a single ship from its small fleet of fishing vessels had been lost to the depths without the support of the community the chapel at black sands had to be resourced entirely from diocesan funds and only the worst and most desperate of clergymen were dispatched there to eke out a miserable existence by the sea most drank themselves quietly into oblivion troubling the natives only when they were found unconscious by the side of the road and had to be carried back to their beds there were exceptions of course the last rector the reverend rhodes had approached his assignment with a veritable missionary zeal for the first six months but slowly communications from him became less and less frequent he indicated that he was having trouble sleeping and while he had experienced no outright hostility the lack of enthusiasm from his prospective parishioners was wearing him down finally in the last letter he ever sent he confessed that the loneliness and isolation were taking their toll on his sanity for he had begun to hallucinate i see shapes in the sand he wrote in that final letter i hear voices whispering to me inviting me to walk upon the shore as if the very sea itself is calling my name i fear that if i stay here any longer i will do as they request i will take that walk and i will never return yet he persisted in his efforts to encourage the villagers to change their ways he began to take an interest in the history of the community to inquire about its past packages arrived from bookshops packed with obscure tomes they were found in his study after his death the pages prodigiously marked and annotated the reverend rhodess body washed up upon the shore at black sands one week after his last missive was received but the circumstances surrounding his death were never fully explained for you see the reverend rhodes had not drowned but suffocated when his body was opened his lungs were found to contain not water but sand but that was decades ago and now the decision had been made to reopen the church at black sands there was a duty upon the church and its clergy not to allow a community to exist without the light of the true faith to guide it even if the villagers chose to turn their backs to it still that light would shine upon them and it was given unto me to be its bearer the chapel stood on a rocky promontory close by the seashore scattered around it were the weathered graves of those clergymen who had come here down the centuries and had breathed their last against the sound of the waves crashing the reverend rhodes was buried close by the western wall of the church a small granite cross marking his final resting place a path led from the rear of the chapel to the rectory itself a modest twostory residence built from local stone from my bedroom window i could see the ghosts of the waves descending upon the dark shore white on black when they broke it was as if the very sands had devoured them the village itself was little more than a huddle of small houses spread over five or six narrow streets there was a shop devoted to the sale of whatever the residents might require from a cap to a cartwheel beside it stood a small inn i gave my custom to each in that first week and found that i was treated with a respectful caution but made to feel neither welcome nor unwelcome both premises were owned by the unofficial mayor of black sands a mr webster he was a tall cadaverous man with the manner of an undertaker measuring up a particularly impoverished client for a cheap casket he politely declined my request to post times of services in both the inn and the shop as i said to your predecessor we have no need of your presence here he informed me with a halfsmile as he walked with me along the main street of the village he was greeted warmly as we made our way i on the other hand received only cursory nods on occasion when i glanced over my shoulder i caught those who had passed us watching me and exchanging words i disagree i said those who exist without god in their lives are always in need even if they are unaware of it themselves i am no theologian said webster but it seems to me that there are many religions and many gods i stopped short this after all was heresy yes there are many gods mr webster but only one true god all else is superstition and the misheld beliefs of ignorant men really said webster am i an ignorant man mr benson i i cannot say i stammered in most things you seem to me to be a most cultured man yet in matters of religion you exhibit an almost willful blindness the people of this village look up to you were you only to use your influence to to do what he interrupted and for the first time i saw real anger in his eyes although his voice remained frighteningly calm to encourage them to follow a god that they cannot see who promises nothing but pain in this life in exchange for the hope of some idyll in the next as i have said perhaps there are other gods than yours mr benson older gods i swallowed are you telling me that the people of this village are engaged in pagan worship i asked the anger left his eyes to be replaced by his customary calm i am telling you no such thing all i am trying to say is that you have your beliefs and others have theirs each has a place in the order of things that i do not doubt unfortunately the place for yours is not here i choose to stay i replied he shrugged then we may yet find a use for you that is my fervent hope i concluded websters smile widened but he said no more i held my service that sunday in an empty church as was my duty and i sang the lord is my shepherd accompanied only by the cries of seagulls that night i sat by the window of the study staring down on the strange black sand that gave the village its name surrounded by my predecessors meager possessions now coated in many years of dust unwilling yet to retire to my bed i spent an unproductive hour rummaging through old seafaring histories topographical studies and anthologies of supposedly factual supernatural encounters more suited to the archives of penny dreadfuls than the library of a clergyman it was only when i began to search the writing desk that i discovered the notebook it had been placed flat at the end of one of the drawers among the corpses of dead insects no more than twenty of its pages contained writing but the neat script clearly matched that of the reverend rhodes contained in the various church documents bequeathed to me the notebook was an account of rhodes s investigations into the history of the area most of it was of only passing interest tales of foundation of feuds of myths rhodes had learned that black sands was far older than a casual perusal of its history might have suggested true the village itself had only been in existence since the early seventeenth century but the lands had been in use for long before that rhodes believed that he had ascertained the location of a stone circle that had once stood close by the shore its position now marked by a raised slab that might once have served as an altar but what purpose had the altar served it seemed that to this question rhodes was willing to offer an answer what rhodes had discovered was this once every twenty years within one week either side of the anniversary of the communitys official founding on november somebody drowned in the waters off black sands the records were incomplete and there were years for which rhodes had been unable to provide entries but the pattern was clear every two decades a stranger somebody from outside the community died at black sands true there were other drownings in the intervening years other accidentsalthough once again it should be stressed that none involved the citizens of black sandsbut there was a strange consistency to the november deaths the final entry in the notebook was for one edith adams on november but hers was not the last such death at black sands that distinction would fall to rhodes himself that night i did not sleep but found myself listening to the sound of the sea at other times it might have lulled me to rest but not at this time and not in this place the whispering began on the night of november the day of the saints at first it sounded like the wind in the grass but when i went to my window the branches of the trees appeared unmoving still it came sometimes soft sometimes keening speaking words i could not understand i returned to bed and clasped my pillow to my ears but the noise did not begin to fade until first light and each night thereafter as the anniversary of the foundation of the community approached i heard those voices and it seemed to me that they grew louder and more insistent i found myself awake in the dead of night my blanket wrapped around me as i stood at my window and stared out at the black shore and though the air was still i thought i saw trails of sand rise up from the shore twisting sinuously in the air like wraiths i tried to make up for my lost rest during the day but the resources of my body and mind were not to be so easily replenished i was troubled by headaches and strange waking dreams in which i stood on the black sands and felt a presence behind me only to turn and see the empty strand stretching toward the sea one of these dreams was so disturbing that i awoke thrashing at my sheets and was unable to resume my rest i rose and went to my little kitchen in the hope that some warm milk might restore my composure as i sat at my table i glimpsed a light moving on the promontory to the north where the old stones lay leaving my milk i dressed hastily and wrapped in my dark coat made my way through the fields toward the path that led to the ancient site i was almost within sight of the track when some instinct made me fall to the ground two shadows fell across me the forms of men marching silently in the direction of the stones i followed them staying away from the path until i came within sight of the altar there webster stood waiting a lantern resting upon the stone he was dressed in his usual tweeds the tails of his overcoat flapping in the breeze do you have it he said one of the two men who had joined him a dour farmer named prayter handed over a brown paper bag webster reached inside and removed something white a clerical stole one had gone missing from my laundry basket earlier in the week and i had been driven almost to distraction trying to guess what might have happened to it now i knew webster picked up his lantern instantly his face was illuminated but it seemed to me that i saw regret there or so i now hope in light of what was to occur later it has to be done said prayter its the way of things webster nodded there will come a time when it will no longer be possible he said soon it will be too dangerous to continue and what then asked the third man whose name i did not know then perhaps the old gods will die said webster simply and we will die with them he picked up the stole and he and his companions walked down to the beach there they dug a hole in the sand and placed the vestment within before carefully filling in the depression once again then they returned to the village i stayed where i was for a time until i was certain that they would not return then followed the path that they had taken down to the shore it was the work of only a few moments to find the little mound they had left beneath which lay the remains of my church garment i stood there for a time uncertain of how to proceed i believed in god my god and yet images from my troubling dreams came back to me and the deaths discovered by my predecessor and prayters reference to the way of things i was terribly afraid and prayed for guidance but none came and so feeling that i was betraying the very faith that i had so ardently defended to webster i began to dig with my hands until i found my stole i removed it from the hole shook the black sand from it and was about to make my way back to the rectory when i turned and refilled the hole once again as i did so i became aware of the sands gently drifting around me forming shapes and patterns that to my troubled mind appeared almost purposeful and i redoubled my efforts to disguise my excavations for the rest of the night i did not sleep but mulled over what i had seen and what i had heard the next day i rose early and made my way into the village i bought some bread and cheese then stopped by websters inn as he was making his preparations for the day he found it hard to meet my gaze but i gave no indication that i recognized his unease i was wondering i said if i could trouble you for a cup of tea i must confess i feel a little weak this morning and in need of something to fortify me for the walk home webster grinned i could give you something stronger than tea if you like he said i declined his offer tea will be fine i said and watched as he disappeared into the kitchen behind the bar in order to heat the water he was gone for only a couple of minutes but in that time i did all that i needed to do from the pocket of his jacket which always hung on a hook behind the bar i removed a worn white handkerchief praying to god to forgive me as i did so then once webster returned i sat with him and drank my tea maintaining a pretense of normality while fearing throughout that he might sniffle or sneeze causing him to search for his handkerchief when i was done i offered him money for the tea but he refused on the house he said just to show there are no hard feelings none whatsoever i said i left him and took a walk upon the beach only when i was certain that i was unobserved did i get down upon my knees and commence digging a hole in the coarse dark sand i did not sleep that night so that when i heard my name being called i was almost expecting the summons mr benson mr benson wake up webster was below my window a lamp in his hand you must come quickly he shouted there is a body on the seashore i left my bed pulled on my clothes and shoes and descended to the door but webster was already running ahead of me by the time i got it open i could see the light bobbing as he moved across the grass toward the sands themselves come on he cried hurry i paused and drew a stout birch stick from my umbrella stand i liked to carry it when i walked enjoying the feel of the bark on my hand but now its weight and heft offered me a kind of reassurance i followed websters light until i stood at the edge of the dunes looking down on the beach where the waves were breaking a black bundle lay it looked like a childs body perhaps i was wrong to doubt webster and there really was someone hurt or dead laying aside my fears i stepped onto the strand the sand felt soft and yielding and my feet sank unpleasantly into it to the depth of about an inch i began to walk ahead of me webster was beckoning calling me closer but the bundle at his feet remained unmoving even when i knelt down beside it in the light and probed gently at it slowly my hands shaking i drew back the damp black cloth that covered it beneath the cloth was hair and a muzzle and a long pink tongue it was a dog a dead dog i looked up to find websters light beginning to recede from me as he tried to leave me alone on the beach mr webster i said what does this mean i was about to stand when i was momentarily distracted by a stinging sensation against my face i brushed at the spot and my fingers came away with a coating of black sand all around me the grains were moving shifting shapes rose and fell forming columns that held their shape for an instant before disintegrating into dark clouds that fell back upon the beach below they might almost have been human except that they were strangely hunched their features almost hidden beneath thick folds of hair i thought i discerned horns emerging from their heads warped and twisted growths that appeared to curl around their skulls ending almost at their necks the whispering began and i understood that it was not language that i had heard in the past but the movement of the sands the individual molecules brushing against one another reconstituting themselves in strange configurations briefly uniting to create for a moment ancient lost forms now webster was running making for the safety of the dunes and the raised stone slab that rested on the promontory his light held high before him so that he might not stumble on seaweed or driftwood i followed him my progress arrested by the strange spongelike quality of the terrain behind me i sensed a form rising high and then sand was filling my eyes and mouth like fingers clasped suddenly across my face i spat and wiped at my face with my sleeve but did not look over my shoulder or stop running ahead of me webster was tiring i was closing on him but i would not reach him before he gained the dunes i waited narrowing the gap between us by another five or six feet then threw my stick with all the force i could muster it struck him firmly on the back of the head and he fell awkwardly to the ground the lamp tumbling away from him and the oil it contained igniting on the beach in the sudden glare i saw his eyes grow wide and staring yet he was looking not at me but at what lay behind he tried to rise but i caught him a glancing blow with my foot as i leapt over his prone form he fell again and then i was approaching a steep rise my feet sliding in the lighter sand of the dunes i clutched at a patch of marram grass drew myself up and looked down on the black sands you cant escape he called these are the old gods the true gods he stood and rubbed the sand from his clothes he appeared wary of the approaching forms but not fearful embrace it webster continued this is your death no i cried it is not my death and these are not my gods i removed from my pocket the bundledup form of my stole and displayed it to him check your pockets mr webster i think youll find youre missing something and as realization dawned webster was surrounded by what appeared to be five or six columns of swirling grains i saw him try to break through but the intensity of their movement increased blinding him and forcing him back and then of a sudden they disappeared and all was still websters thin form was left standing alone in the dying light from the burning oil all movement had ceased on the beach he raised his head uncertainly to me and reached out a hand instinctively i stretched out my own hand to him in return whatever he had tried to do to me i could not leave him in peril our fingers were almost touching when a shape appeared close by websters feet i saw an oval of sand rise up with two holes about midway down its form like the sunken sockets of eyes the bridge of a ruined nose stretched between them framed on either side by a pair of jagged cheekbones and then around websters feet a maw opened i saw lips and a brief glimpse of what might have been some kind of tongue all carved from black sand webster looked down and started to scream but the thing began to suck him down he struck at the shape his fingers clawing as he attempted to arrest his descent but soon he was submerged to his chest then his neck his mouth opened wide once more but any further sound he made was silenced by the grains that stilled his tongue as his head disappeared beneath the sand and then the face collapsed leaving only a shallow depression where the hole had swallowed the life of a man there is no salvation without sacrifice god himself sent his only son to prove the truth of that lesson but there are others who have learned it in their own way an archaeological dig at the site of the stone altar revealed a mass of bones dating from before the time of christ to the foundation of the village an appeasement to whatever strange gods these people worshipped the chapel at black sands once more lies empty and the village has a new leader a german bomb landed on the beach in but it failed to explode instead it sank into the sands and attempts to recover it proved fruitless if a bomb could sink into those sands the argument went then why not a person so barbed wire has since been erected around the beach and warning signs have been posted advising people to stay away webster was wrong the old gods will not so easily be forgotten sometimes the wind blows along this desolate stretch of coastline and causes shapes to rise up from the beach phantasms of sand that hold their form for just an instant too long before falling in small heaps to the ground it may take years even decades to complete the process but they will succeed for slowly and surely they are obscuring the warning signs some children wander by mistake the circus seldom came to the towns in the north they were too scattered their populations too poor to justify the expense of transporting animals sideshows and people down neglected roads in order to play to sparsely filled seats for a week the bright colors of the circus vehicles looked out of place when reflected in the rainfilled potholes of such places and the big top itself seemed to lose some of its power and vibrancy when set against gray storm clouds and relentless drizzle occasionally some forgotten television star would pass through for a week of pantomime or a onehit wonder from the seventies might attempt to rustle up a weekend crowd in one of the grim boxlike clubs that squatted in the larger suburbs but the circus was a rare visitor william could not recall a circus ever coming to his town not in the whole ten years of his life although his parents sometimes spoke of one that had played early in the year of his birth in fact his mother said that she had felt william kick in her womb as soon as the lights went down and the first of the clowns appeared as though he were somehow aware of the events taking place outside his red world since then no great tent had occupied the big field out by the forest no lions had passed through here and no elephants had trumpeted there had been no trapeze artists no ringmasters no clowns william had few friends there was something about him that alienated his peers an eagerness to please perhaps that was the flip side of something darker and more troubling he spent much of his spare time alone while school was a tightrope walk between a desire to be noticed and a profound wish to avoid the bullying that came with such attention small and weak william was no match for his tormentors and had developed strategies to keep them at bay mostly he tried to make them laugh mostly he failed there were few bright spots to life in that place so it was with surprise and delight that william watched the first of the posters appear in shop windows and upon lampposts adding a splash of color to the dull streets they were orange and yellow and green and blue and at the center of each poster was the figure of a ringmaster dressed in red with a great top hat upon his head and mustaches that curled up at the ends like snail shells surrounding him were animalslions and tigers and bears oh myand stilt walkers and women in spangled costumes soaring gracefully through the air clowns occupied the corners with big round noses and paintedon smiles sideshows and rides were promised and feats never before witnessed in a big top from europe announced the posters for one night only circus caliban the performance would take place on of all dates december the date of williams tenth birthday it took william only minutes to track down the circus folk responsible for distributing the posters he found them on a side street using a stepladder to put up the advertisements for their great show a cold north wind threatened to make off with a dwarf in a yellow suit who teetered at the top of the ladder as he tried to staple a pair of posters together around a lamppost while a strongman in a vinyl cape and a thin man in a red coat held the ladder steady william sat on his bicycle watching them silently until the man in the red coat turned to look at him and william saw those great curly mustaches above a pair of bright pink lips the ringmaster smiled you like the circus he said his accent was funny like became lak and circus became sowcoos his voice was very deep william nodded awestruck you dont speak said the ringmaster william found his voice i like the circus at least i think i do ive never been the ringmaster staggered back in mock surprise releasing his hold upon the ladder the dwarf at the top stumbled a little and only the actions of the bald strongman prevented the ladder from coming down dwarf and all you have never been to the circus said the ringmaster well you must come you simply must come and from the pocket of his bright red coat he produced a trio of tickets and handed them to william for you he said for you and your mother and your father one night only circus caliban william took the tickets and held them tightly in his fist unsure of the safest place in which to put them thank you he said youre welcome said the ringmaster will there be clowns asked william there are clowns on the posters but i just wanted to be sure the strongman stared at him silently and the dwarf on the ladder grinned there are always clowns said the ringmaster and william thought that his breath smelled very sweet like bullseyes and gumdrops and jelly babies all mixed together it would not be a circus without clowns the dwarf descended from the ladder and the three men moved on to another lamppost and another street after all they were here for one night only and there was much work to be done if that night was to be as special as it could possibly be over the course of the next week more and more circus folk began to arrive in the town rides were assembled and sideshow booths appeared there was the stink of animals and many children gathered at the edge of the field to watch the circus take shape although the circus folk kept them back behind the wall by warning them that the animals were dangerous or by telling them that they did not want the surprise to be spoiled william tried to spot the clowns but they were nowhere to be seen he supposed that they looked like ordinary people most of the time until they put on their makeup and their big shoes and their funny wigs until they did that there was no way of telling if they were clowns or not until they dressed up and made you laugh they were just men not clowns on the night of the performance while his tummy was still full of birthday cake and fizzy drinks william and his mother and father drove into town and parked their car at the edge of the great field people had come from all around to see the circus and a house full sign stood beside the ticket caravan william could see the grownups clutching yellow admission tickets williams ticketsthe special free tickets given to him by the ringmasterwere blue he did not see anyone else holding blue tickets he suspected that the ringmaster couldnt afford to give out too many tickets without charge if the circus was only in town for one night the big top itself stood at the center of the field it was black with red trim and a single red flag flew from the topmost support behind it were the performers caravans the animals cages and the vehicles used to transport everything from town to town most of them looked very old as though the circus had somehow transported itself from the middle of one century to the beginning of the next traveling through time and space its animals ageing but unchanging its trapeze artists now very ancient but blessed with the bodies of younger people william could see rust on the bars of the empty lions cage and the interior of one of the caravans glimpsed through an open door was all red velvet and rich dark wood a woman looked out at william then pulled the door closed to prevent him from seeing anything more but william briefly caught a glimpse of others within a sullen fat man whose naked body was reflected in a mirror as a young girl bathed him by candlelight her own figure barely concealed by the thinnest of slips for an instant william locked eyes with the girl as her hands moved upon the older man and then she was gone and he was left with an unfamiliar feeling of disgust as though he were somehow complicit in the commission of a bad deed he followed his parents through the sideshows and rides there were shooting ranges and hoop toss games of skill and games of chance men and women called out from behind the stalls promising wonderful prizes but william saw nobody carrying the big stuffed elephants and teddy bears that stood arrayed on the topmost shelves of the game booths their glass eyes gleaming emptily in fact william saw nobody win anything at all shots were missed by those who regarded themselves as fairground marksmen darts bounced from playing cards and hoops failed to land around goldfish bowls all was disappointment and broken promises william could almost see the smiles beginning to fade and the cries of unhappy children carried on the breeze the hucksters exchanged glances and sly grins with one another from their booths as they called to the new arrivals the ones who still had hope and expectations of success william was not aware of drifting away from his parents one minute they were beside him and the next it was as if the whole circus had shifted slightly moving silently in a great circle so that william no longer stood among the rides and games but at the very periphery of the performers caravans he could see the lights of the sideshows and could hear the sound of the children on the merrygoround but they were hidden from him by vehicles and tents these looked more dirty and worn than those close to the big top the fabric of the tents shabbily mended where it had torn the panels of the caravans slowly decaying into rust there were puddles of waste on the ground and a stale smell of cheap cooked meat hung on the air uncertain and a little afraid william began to pick his way carefully back to his parents stepping over guy ropes and avoiding the tow bars of the caravans until at last he came to a single yellow tent that stood apart from the others outside stood a red jalopy decorated with balloons its wheels misshapen and its seats balanced on huge springs william could hear voices speaking inside the tent and knew that he had found the clowns he crept closer and lay down on his belly so that he could peer beneath the bottom of the tent for if he was seen at the entrance then they would surely send him away and he would learn nothing more about them william saw battered dressing tables with brightly lit mirrors above them the bulbs powered by a humming unseen generator four men sat at the tables dressed in suits of purple and green yellow and orange they had oversized shoes on their feet their heads were bald but they wore no makeup william was faintly disappointed they were just men they were not yet clowns then while william watched one of the men took a cloth and doused it in liquid from a black bottle he looked at himself grimly in the mirror then drew the cloth across his face instantly a line of white appeared and the rim of a big red mouth the man wiped himself again harder now and circular red cheeks appeared finally he hid his face in the cloth rubbing furiously and when the cloth came away it was covered in fleshcolored makeup and a clown stared back from the mirror the other men were engaged in similar activities rubbing away the cosmetics that concealed the clown faces beneath but those faces were not in the least bit funny or engaging true the men looked like clowns they had big smiling mouths and oval shapes around their eyes and big red circles fixed on their cheeks but their eyeballs were yellow and their skin looked puckered and diseased their bare hands were very white reminding william of cheap sausages or lengths of uncooked dough the clowns moved listlessly and they spoke in a language william had never heard before more to themselves than to one another the tongue sounded very old and very foreign and william felt himself grow increasingly afraid a voice in his head seemed to echo their words as though someone close by were translating for his benefit children the voice said we hate em foul things they laugh at what they doesnt understand they laugh at things they should be afraid of oh but we know we know what the circus hides we know what all circuses hide foul children we make them laugh but when we can we take em and then the nearest clown turned and stared down at william and the boy felt moist hands gripping his own as he was dragged beneath the canvas and into the tent two clowns unseen until now knelt by him holding him down william tried to cry out for help but one of the clowns placed a hand over williams lips stilling any sound within quiet child he said and although he still spoke in that strange language william understood each word the clowns painted mouth smiled but his other mouth his real mouth remained grim the other clowns crowded around some with a little of their old makeup still in place so that they seemed half human and half other their irises were entirely black and their eye sockets were rimmed with bright red flesh one of them now with an orange wig upon his head placed his face very close to williams and sniffed at the boys skin then he opened his mouth revealing very white very thin and very sharp teeth they curved inward at the bottom like hooks and william could see great spaces of red gum between them a tongue emerged long and purple and covered with tiny barbs it unfolded like a flys or the end of a paper whistle slowly uncurling from deep in the clowns mouth the tongue licked at william tasting his tears and it felt to william like having a thistle or a cactus rubbed against his face the clown stepped back preparing his tongue to lick again but another clown with blue hair bigger and taller than his fellows grabbed it between his thumb and forefinger and squeezed it so hard that his stubby nails punctured the flesh and yellow liquid dripped from the wound look said the clown the others drew closer and william could see a streak of something pink upon the orange clowns tongue before it was released to slide back into its owners mouth with a slapping sound the blue clown raised his finger so william could see what was upon it it looked like pink makeup instantly william was dragged to his feet and brought to one of the dressing tables he was forced into a chair and an old cloth handkerchief was stuffed into his mouth william struggled and tried to cry out but the cloth smothered the sounds and the clowns held him in place there were hands on his shoulders on his legs on the top of his skull and beneath his jaw keeping his mouth closed on the gag and then the clowns descended upon him their long tongues unfolding from their mouths their breaths stale with the lingering taste of tobacco and alcohol he felt their tongues upon him licking his face scouring his eyelids and his cheeks with their tiny barbs exploring his ears and his lips and his nostrils as they covered him with their saliva william closed his eyes tightly as his skin began to burn the pain like the stinging of nettles just as he felt sure that he could take no more the clowns stopped they stared down upon him and now there were real smiles beneath the painted ones as their tongues withdrew into the cages of their mouths they backed away revealing williams reflection to him another william stared back at him from the mirror this one palefaced and yelloweyed with a fixed smile and rosyred cheeks the blue clown rubbed williams head gently and a handful of williams dark hair came away in his hand the other clowns joined in running their sharp nails through williams hair until there was nothing of it left but a few stray strands williams face crumpled the tears flowing freely now but the clown smile never left his face so that he seemed to be laughing even as he cried crying harder than he had ever cried before crying for all that he had now lost and that would never be his again i want my mum whimpered william i want my dad no need said the blue clown his accent was thick and foreign like the ringmasters he looked very old no need for family new family now why are you doing this to me said william why have you done this to my face done asked the blue clown and there was real surprise in his voice what done done nothing clown not learned clown chosen in the mudderwomb clown does not become clown is clown is not made clown is born and the show went on that night while williams parents searched and searched for him and the police came and laughter rose from the circus tent as the clowns drove on in their happy jalopy and gave balloons to the children the hated children and when they left there were smiles on the faces of nearly all of those in the audience except for the very clever children who sensed that there was more to clowns than bright suits and funny cars and oversized feet and that if you were wise you didnt laugh at them and you stayed out of their way and you never pried into their business for clowns are lonely and angry and want company in their misery they are always seeking always searching always looking for new clowns to join them the circus caliban was gone the next day and there was no sign that it had ever visited the town the police looked but william was never seen again and a new clown was added to the act of the circus caliban when next it appeared at the edge of a forest in a country far far from this one he was smaller than the rest and seemed always to be looking into the laughing audience searching for the parents that he still hoped would find him but they never came and his teeth fell out and were replaced by sharp white hooks that were kept hidden behind shields of plastic and his nails decayed to hard yellow stumps at the end of soft pale fingers he grew tall and strong until at last he forgot his name and became only clown and a great clown he was his tongue grew like a snakes and he tasted children with it as they laughed for clowns are hungry and sad and envious of humanity they travel from town to town looking for those that they can steal away always marking the child that kicks in the womb and always finding him upon their return for clowns are not made clowns are born deep dark green we should never have gone near baals pond we should have stayed far away from it as we were told as we had always been told but young men will follow young girls and do their bidding that is the way of things and it will always be the way hindsight is worse than blindness and pleasure and regret walk hand in hand and so we had gone to that place catherine and i i had been lured by the promise in her eyes deafened by the demands of my own appetites i was young i did not understand what those appetites could create how they could be transformed mutated degraded how they could find form in the being that dwelt in baals pond i think of catherine often now that the hour of my own passing approaches i find myself staring at my reflection on the surface of the lake near my home i throw a stone and watch my face come apart in ripples one visage briefly becoming many as i am drawn back to the last day that i spent with her it becomes harder and harder to depart from such places now for since her death part of me has always been lost in dark water the pain of the disease that is eating away at my insides is relentless but i think that i shall not wait for my body to betray me instead i will join her in the depths and hope that she will come to me her mouth against mine as i breathe my last and yet i have lived with her loss for so long that the thought of being reunited with her is almost too much to bear there have been other women since catherine although none remained by my side for very long i was not entirely sorry to see them go in truth i found that i came to fear them and so was unable to open myself fully to them i was afraid of their desires their rapaciousness their ability to draw a man inside them and make him lose himself in the promise of their flesh is that not a terrible confession for a man to make sometimes i feel that it is at other times though i believe that perhaps i am merely more honest than most of my fellows my eyes have been opened and i have seen the worm that coils in the apple of temptation so i am alive and catherine is dead and her body will never be found it lies at the bottom of baals pond far in the tainted reaches down where it is green deep dark green there had always been something strange about that place a long time before so long ago that none of those responsible or their children or their childrens children remained alive to tell of it the river was redirected through a small glen somehowit was said that stolen kegs of gunpowder were usedthe banks were blown apart and the waters rushed downhill into the little valley flooding it completely before resuming their original course half a mile farther on people from distant villages gathered to watch the event and the only sound to be heard before the gunpowder exploded was the soft uttering of prayers the rattle of the beads and the dull clanking of a chain from the cottage far below as a presence within tried desperately to free itself those who stood listening and praying had lost children to what lay below it had drawn them in through its small wooden gate luring them with the wondrous colors of its flowers and their strange intoxicating scents like flies attracted to a pitcher plant they had entered and died drowning in strange desires that they could not comprehend afterward their bodies were interred in the garden and the flowers grew sweeter still then as the tale would have it the prayers stopped a fuse was lit and a great mass of earth exploded into the air the waters surged forth exploiting the breach and descended into the glen whatever had once lived in that placethe animals the insects the trees and plants every living thinghad died on that day in a brown muddy torrent or so they must have hoped now this place that they named baals pond was deeper than any other stretch of the river no sunlight penetrated to its depths and no fish swam there the water was so dark as to be almost black like oil it even felt different on the skin it was viscous and when clasped in cupped hands it dripped like honey through ones fingers nothing could live in such an environment i still do not believe that anything lives down there for whatever is down there is not alive it exists but it is not alive i was sixteen years old on the morning that we went there together for the first and last time catherine and i she too was sixteen but so far beyond me that the months between us were really years and i felt awkward and powerless around her i know now that i was already in love with her with what she was and with the promise of what she would become she stood at the edge of that dark place and her brightness appeared to mock it her hair was blond and hung loosely on her back and shoulders and the sunlight made her tanned skin glow but when i looked into the water there was no reflection of her on its surface as though she had already been devoured by the blackness she turned to me as she cast aside her clothing and said are you afraid and i was afraid i was afraid of the stillness of the water it should have moved swiftly fast as the flow that poured into it from the higher ground above but it did not instead there was a sluggishness about it a lethargy at its eastern extreme where the flooded glen ended and the slope of the hill began the river regained some of its lost energy but it seemed that the water had been tainted by its contact with this place for a thin film of oil was now revealed by the sunlight upon it i was afraid too of what our parents would say if they discovered that we were in this place if they knew what we were planning and if they suspected what my thoughts of her were that in its turn led me to my greatest fear my fear of her i wanted her badly so very badly my stomach tightened every time i looked upon her now seeing her naked for the first time it was all that i could do to stop myself from trembling i shook my head im not afraid i said in my mind i replayed fantasies of a life we might have together of marriage and children and love and the touch of her skin against mine we had kissed catherine and i and i had tasted her before she pulled away from me laughing yet with each kiss she lingered a little longer her laughter a little more uncertain her breath a little shorter and i lived and died in every kiss are you sure she stood on the bank and glanced at me over her shoulder she was smiling and there was that promise in her smile she could tell what i was thinking she could always tell then with one short peal of laughter she took a deep breath and arced into the pond there was no splash the surface simply separated to allow her passage then bound itself together again behind her no ripples appeared and the rhythm of the water lapping at the bank remained undisturbed but i did not follow her i looked into that black pool and my courage left me instead i waited for her shivering the grass sharp beneath my feet the wind cold against my skin and willed her to emerge once again from the water her laughter baiting me and her eyes calling me to her but she did not return seconds passed then an entire minute i stared into the pool hoping to see her golden form just below the surface but there was nothing there was not even birdsong in this place and no flies buzzed i thought of the warnings the old tales others had descended into those depths and some had never been seen again the riverbanks had been searched in the hope that the waters might yield up their bodies but they never did now only the bravest or most foolhardy came here young men who hoped that their youthful displays would be rewarded by an embrace or more and when at last they walked away from this place their hands entwined with those of another they promised themselves that they would never return for they were the lucky ones they knew that others had not been so fortunate and so my love for her overcame my fear and i closed my eyes and followed her into the depths the water was unimaginably cold so cold that i felt my heart would stop beating and freeze within my body and its strange thickness made it difficult to swim i looked up and could not see the sun yet there was a light of sorts i could perceive my hands in front of my face but the palms were lit from below not above i twisted in the water facing the bed of the pond and kicked back with my legs moving toward the source of the illumination there was a house at the bottom of the pond it was built of stone and had two windows one at either side of the door and a roof that might once have been thatched but was now no more than slats and struts the remains of a low stone wall curled like arms around what might once have been a garden a gap in the middle where a gate had once hung and a ruined chimney stack pointed an accusing finger toward the bright blue unseen world above the light came from behind the windows of the dwelling moving slowly from side to side as if what was bearing it were somehow trapped and like a caged animal had bound up its madness in relentless motion around the house tall thick weeds grew each fifteen or twenty feet in length and swaying gently in the flow i had never seen anything like them before it seemed to me that there was something wrong with them for their swaying made me uneasy it took me only seconds to realize what it was about them that troubled me their rhythm was not being dictated by the current of the river instead they moved independently of it seeking probing spreading themselves through the dark waters like the tentacles of some great sea creature searching for prey and at the end of one weed something golden thrashed and a broad halo of hair was briefly burnished by the light from below catherine looked up at me her cheeks swollen as she tried to hold in the last of her air and shook her head desperately her hands reached for me the fingers grasping i began to swim to her but the weed wrapped itself once more around her body twisting her in a circle as it did so tightening its grip upon her catherines mouth opened sending a stream of precious bubbles toward me her eyes grew wide and her lips seemed to form my name as the dark green water entered her body her thrashings increased in intensity and her hands lashed out at the weed her fingers wrenching wildly at it then her lungs flooded her struggles became feeble and she grew still as she drowned she hung in the depths her arms outstretched and her eyes open staring into eternity even then i thought that i could save her that somehow i could bring her to the surface and pump that foul water from her that i could fill her with life from my body and taste once again her breath in my mouth but as i tried to swim to her she began to recede from me i thought at first that it must be some illusion that the water was simply deeper than it at first seemed but the ruined cottage continued to grow nearer even as she drew farther away from me i watched helplessly as the weed pulled her deeper and deeper down until with one final jerk she was yanked through the doorway and i understood at last that the weeds were growing not around the house but from within it inside the cottage the light stopped moving through the wreckage of the roof i saw catherine anchored to the bed of the river the weed still tight around her waist there came the muffled distorted sound of an old chain clanging on stones as the light approached and surrounded her then wrapped her in its embrace it assumed a shape arms and legs formed thin and pale the muscles wasted and the skin hanging loose upon the bones i saw long white hair writhing in the water i caught a glimpse of naked flesh wrinkled by the relentless flow of the river and pitted with ugly red sores old female breasts flat and lifeless pressed themselves against the still form of my beloved catherine as it bent as if to kiss her i was almost within reach of the roof now and for the first time the being seemed to sense my approach it twisted toward me raising its face to mine and i saw its mouth where lips and teeth should have been there was instead the round sucking hole of a lamprey red and engorged it opened and closed pulsing quickly already tasting the girl it had ensnared above the mouth black lidless eyes regarded me blankly before its hunger finally overcame it and it turned away to begin its work i tried to wrench one of the struts from the roof to use as a weapon but my strength was failing and my head ached from the effort of holding my breath i felt certain that i had only seconds of air left but i would not leave catherine to this thing yet as i gripped the wood i sensed movement around me white things shimmered at the periphery of my vision i looked to my left and found that the length of weed closest to me no longer moved gently in the flow it could not for the burden it held constrained it strands of green had wrapped themselves around the legs of the boy holding him in place even as he seemed to be reaching for the surface but this one was long dead there were dark patches around his unseeing eyes and the edges of his bones showed like knives beneath his skin his lips were torn and bruised where that lamprey mouth had attached itself to his for one final kiss all around me boys and girls hung unmoving in the water each anchored securely by the weeds that emanated from the ruined house below some were naked while tattered clothing still clung to the bodies of the others their hair shifted softly in the current and their hands moved in small strokes imitating life even in death they were all here all of the lost all of the young dead their shades lingering in the depths waiting to welcome another to their ranks i felt a huge surge of pity and fear and my mouth opened with the shock of what i was seeing immediately water rushed into my nose and mouth i panicked and thrashed my legs catherine now forgotten in the urge to save my own life i did not want to die down there to be touched in my final moments by the thing that dwelt in the old house before joining the ghosts of children in the waters of that place it was my panic that saved my life i felt something rubbery lashing at my heel as the weed tried to gain some purchase on my body but i was already leaving it behind as the light below me faded and the dark water filled my lungs until the sky at last exploded above me and the sweetness of the air dazzled my senses for two days they dragged the river and probed with poles the depths of baals pond but they never found her she was lost to us lost to me and she dwelt thereafter in a place where black waters flowed and the ghosts of the young hung in the current and watched her unspeaking she still waits for me there and i will join her soon enough i have been back there many times since although now it is fenced and gated and the land around it has been sown with briers and poisonous plants to discourage the incautious the surface of the pool still devours the light and the thing below still waits pacing hungrily a being of pure appetite as it was in life as it is in death it lives in a world of only two colors red the color of lips and lust and green deep dark green miss froom vampire to begin it is a matter of record that miss froom enjoyed a reputation as a gardener of some note her roses were the envy of many a retired army man who after a lifetime of inflicting destruction on others now believed that he had found an outlet for his hitherto unexplored creative urges the impulse to cultivate roses being one that traditionally strikes males in the autumn of their years and is generally encouraged by their weary spouses as it gets their husbands out of the house for long periods of time it is a littleremarked fact that many a retired gentleman has unwittingly avoided a messy death at the hands of his wife by the simple expedient of picking up a pair of pruning shears and departing for greener pastures had miss frooms expertise extended solely to roses she would still have been assured a permanent place in the gardening lore of the county but the lady in question also produced wonderful marrows marvelous carrots and cabbages with the otherworldly beauty of alien sunsets at the annual fair in broughton which was to the countys gardeners what crufts is to besotted dog owners miss froom was the yardstick by whom others measured their successes and their failures curiously miss frooms accomplishments aroused little ire among her male peers a circumstance not unrelated to her general attractiveness her age was largely indeterminable but most suspected that she was in her early fifties her hair was very dark and unstreaked with gray a condition that led the more uncharitable women of the village to suggest that her color was only natural if the good lord had a palette that included midnight haze or autumn night her face was quite pale with full lips and eyes that appeared alternately dark blue or deep green depending upon the light her body was full although she tended to dress rather conservatively and rarely exposed more than an ivory neck and the faintest hint of bosom a restraint that merely added to her allure miss froom was in short the kind of woman of whom men spoke favorably when they were freed from the constraints of censorious female company she was also the kind of woman of whom other women spoke and perhaps not always kindly although there were those among them who might have felt something of their menfolks baser admiration of miss froom were they capable of admitting it to themselves a lane ran behind miss frooms cottage on the outskirts of the village from which she could sometimes be glimpsed in her garden digging and pruning in order to maintain the quality and beauty of all that grew there she would always refuse offers of male help with even the most taxing of labors arguing with a smile that she liked to believe that whatever awards accrued to her as a result of her work were entirely hers and hers alone the men would tip their hats and go about their business regretting that an afternoon spent in the company of the very lovely miss froom was to be denied them once again and so it might have come as a surprise to these gentlemen had any of them been present to witness the occurrence when miss froom hailed a young man who was bicycling by her garden one bright spring afternoon the gentleman who came from the neighboring village of ashburnham and was largely unfamiliar with matters horticultural and therefore with the reputation of miss froom stopped and leaned his bicycle against the wall peering over he saw a woman in beige trousers and a white shirt resting on a spade the young man whose name was edward allowed himself a brief moment to take in the womans appearance although the sun was shining it was still a chilly day but the woman seemed untroubled by the cold her hair was tied up loosely on her head and her lips were very red against the pallor of her complexion she was quite stunningly attractive edward thought for a woman three decades his senior in fact her face looked vaguely familiar and edward wondered if one of his more private fantasies had somehow come to life before him for he felt certain that a woman with just such a face had occupied his imagination in a most pleasant way at some point in the past i was wondering said the woman if you might have a moment to spare im trying to break the soil in order to sow but im afraid theres still a touch of winter to it edward dismounted opened the gate and entered miss frooms garden as he drew closer she seemed to grow in beauty so that edward felt his jaw drop slightly in her presence her lips parted and edward caught a glimpse of white teeth and a hint of pink tongue he tried to speak but only a hoarse croak emerged he coughed and managed to compose a relatively coherent sentence id be happy to help you maam he said it would be my pleasure miss froom seemed almost to blush at least she approximated the movements of one who was a little embarrassed but only the faintest rose of blood bloomed at her cheeks as though she had only a little to spare my name is miss froom she said but you can call me laura nobody calls me maam laura was edwards favorite name although he could not recall himself ever noticing that before he gave laura his own name and introductions complete she handed him the spade it shouldnt take long said miss froom i do hope im not keeping you from anything edward assured her that she was not by now he could not even remember why he had come to the village to begin with whatever it was it could wait and so they worked side by side in miss frooms garden sharing small details of their lives but largely silent edward occupied mainly by thoughts of the woman close beside him and the faintest scent of lilies that emanated from her person and miss froom well suffice it to say that miss froom was thinking of edward in return as the light began to fade miss froom suggested that they finish up and inquired if edward might like to step inside for some tea edward readily agreed and was about to take a seat at miss frooms kitchen table when she asked him if he wouldnt like to wash his hands first now it was edwards turn to be embarrassed but miss froom hushed him and led him by the hand up the stairs where she showed him into her spotlessly clean bathroom and handed him a towel a washcloth and a bar of clear soap remember she said right up to the elbows and dont neglect your face and neck youll feel better for it once she had left the room edward removed his shirt and cleaned himself scrupulously the soap smelled a little funny he thought rather like a hospital floor after it has been disinfected nevertheless it was undoubtedly effective for edward believed that he had never been cleaner once he had finished drying himself off there came a knock at the door and a hand appeared at the end of which hung a crisp white shirt wear this said miss froom no point in being clean in a dirty shirt ill let the other soak while we eat edward took the garment and put it on it felt a little rough against his skin and there were small rustcolored stains upon the sleeve and the shoulders but compared to his own shirt it was spotless truth be told edwards shirt had not been entirely fresh before he began his labors on behalf of miss froom and he rather hoped that the lady in question would ascribe its unfortunate state to his exertions in her garden and not to any lapse in personal hygiene on his own part when he returned to the kitchen edward saw that there was an array of cheeses and cold meats displayed upon the table there were also assorted pastries and biscuits and finally there was a large fruitcake that still steamed slightly from the oven were you expecting someone edward asked actually it looked to edward as if miss froom was expecting a whole team of someones and that he had seen less lavish spreads at the end of village cricket games oh said miss froom you never know when company will drop by she poured him some tea and edward famished began to eat he was finishing his third sandwich before he noticed that the woman on the other side of the table was not joining him arent you eating he asked i have a disorder said miss froom it limits what i can eat edward didnt press the lady further he was largely ignorant about the female body but he had learned from his father that such ignorance was only right and proper there was he gathered nothing worse for a man than to inadvertently set foot in the minefield marked womens troubles edward decided to make for less dangerous territory you have a nice house he said thank you said miss froom there was another lull in their discourse edward unused to taking tea with strange ladies in their kitchens while wearing unfamiliar shirts was struggling to keep the conversation going youre not er he began um i mean is there a no said miss froom cutting him off at the pass im not married oh said edward right miss froom smiled at him the temperature in the kitchen appeared to edward to rise a couple of degrees have a bun said miss froom she extended the plate of pastries toward him edward opted for a lemon tart it disintegrated as soon as he bit into it showering him with crumbs miss froom who had stood to pour him some more tea placed the teapot back on its stand and brushed softly at edwards shirtfront with the palm of her hand edward nearly choked on his tart let me get you some water said miss froom but as she turned she staggered slightly apparently about to fall edward rose swiftly and held her shoulders then helped her back to her seat she looked even paler than before he thought although her lips were redder yet im sorry she said ive been feeling a little weak lately the winter was hard edward inquired if she needed a doctor but miss froom told him that she did not instead she asked him to go to the refrigerator and retrieve from it the bottle that stood beside the milk edward did as he was told noting as he opened the door that the interior of the fridge was very cold indeed and returned with a red wine bottle pour me some please said miss froom edward poured the liquid into a cup it was more viscous than wine and had a faint but decidedly unpleasant smell it reminded edward of the inside of a butchers shop what is it he asked as miss froom took a long mouthful rats blood said miss froom wiping a little dribble from her chin with a napkin edward felt certain that he had misheard but the stench from the cup told him that he had not rats blood he asked unable to keep the disgust from his voice why are you drinking rats blood because it is all that i have said miss froom as though the answer were obvious if i had anything of higher quality then i would be drinking that instead edward wondered how hard it could be to acquire something tastier than rodents blood and decided that it couldnt be very difficult at all what about er wine he suggested well wine isnt blood is it dear said miss froom gently in the tone teachers are accustomed to use with the slower children in the class the kind who sup from ink pots and misjudge the time it takes to get to the toilet but why blood at all asked edward i mean you know its not what people usually drink miss froom was now sipping delicately if distastefully at her glass i suppose youre right but it is all that i can drink its all that gives me sustenance without it i would die any blood will do really although i dont care much for goats blood it tastes a little strong and rats blood naturally is a last resort edward sat down heavily all a bit much for you is it asked miss froom she patted his hand lightly her skin was almost translucent edward thought he could see bones through it what kind of person drinks blood asked edward he shook his head at the awfulness of it not a person said miss froom i dont think i can call myself that any longer there is another word for what i am although i dont like to hear it used it has suchnegative connotations it took edward a moment to figure out the word for himself he wasnt very smart but then miss froom liked that about him is the word va edward began but miss froom interrupted him before he could speak it flinching slightly as she did so yes she said thats the one edward quickly moved away from miss froom putting as much distance between them as he could until he realized that he had backed himself into a corner stay away from me he said he rummaged under his shirt and removed a small silver cross it was about half an inch long and he had trouble holding it between his thumb and forefinger without hiding it altogether oh dont be silly said miss froom im not going to hurt you and put that away it doesnt work anyway edward kept the cross outstretched for a moment or two more then rather sheepishly put it back inside the shirt nevertheless he stayed as far away as possible from the now faintly threatening woman at the table his eyes cast around for possible weapons to use in the event of an attack but the only heavy object he could see was the fruitcake so its not true then about crosses and suchlike he said no said miss froom she sounded a little offended what about only being able to come out at night edward she said patiently weve just spent an afternoon working in the garden oh said edward right stake through the heart thatll work said miss froom but then it would work on anybody wouldnt it i expect the same would go for cutting my head off but i cant say ive tried that either what about swiftflowing water i have swimming medals said miss froom from when i was a girl garlic asked edward hopefully never cared for it said miss froom except in casseroles sleeping in a coffin be serious said miss froom edward thought for a moment look he said apart from the drinking blood thing are you sure youre a well a youknowwhat well said miss froom the drinking blood thing as you put it is rather a large part of being a you know what in addition im very old older than i look older even than this village i am what i am and have been for a very long time but er your kind attack people dont they not me said miss froom i like a quiet life you start biting people and drinking their blood and frankly someone is going to notice after a while its easier to prey on forest animals the odd cat maybe even sip from the neck of a cow or two although its not very hygienic she sighed loudly unfortunately my scruples about preying on people mean that my strength has been gradually failing over these last decades im not sure i could even hold on to a cow any longer so now im reduced to rats you know it takes about fifty rats to equal the nutritional value of even one pint of human blood do you know how hard it is to trap fifty rats edward opined that it was probably very hard indeed but i can live for a few months on a pint if im careful she said at least i could in the past but i am weaker now than i have ever been soon i will begin to age and then she fell silent as edward watched a single tear trickled down her pale cheek it left only a trace of moisture behind it like a diamond slowly sliding across a patch of ice thank you for your help with my garden she said softly perhaps youd better leave now edward stared at her unsure of how to respond and edward she added i beg of you to say nothing of this to anyone i felt that i could trust you but it was weak and unfair of me to do so all i can hope is that you are as honorable as you are handsome and as decent as you are kind and with that she buried her head in her hands and spoke no more edward left his corner and walked to her he laid a hand gently on miss frooms shoulder she felt very cold a pint he said at last miss froom slowly stopped sobbing what she asked you said that a pint of blood could keep you going for months his voice was very soft and a little hesitant a pints not much is it he said miss froom looked at him and he drowned in her eyes i cant ask you to do that she said you didnt ask said edward i offered miss froom didnt speak instead she ran a cold hand across edwards face and touched his lips with her fingers thank you she whispered perhaps theres something i can offer you in return her hand touched her chest and a button on her shirt popped open exposing a little more of the fabled bosom that had kept many a frustrated rose grower awake at night edward swallowed hard as gently she made him sit down once again on the kitchen chair would you mind if i drank a little now she asked no not at all said edward although his voice trembled slightly where do you want to take it from it doesnt matter said miss froom the neck is good but i dont want to leave a visible mark perhapsyour wrist and she rolled up his sleeve revealing his clean freckled arm edward nodded will it hurt he asked just a sting at first said miss froom then you wont feel anything else miss frooms mouth opened and he saw that her canines were a little longer than a normal persons her tongue flicked at them and edward felt a surge of fear her mouth descended on him and twin needles of pain shot through his forearm he gasped but then the pain faded and he felt a kind of warmth and a sleepy pleasure his eyes closed and beautiful images came to him he dreamed that he was with miss froom together in a wonderful intimacy and that she loved him dearly even as he drifted into a deep shadowy redness when edward was dead miss froom her strength now restored carried him to the cellar there she worked on him removing the major organs before placing his body in a large wine press when he was fully drained she removed what was left of him separated the bones and put them through a grinder she took the fine powder and placed it in jars so that she could mix it into the soil over the coming weeks assuring herself of another fine crop of vegetables and roses for the coming year lastly she disposed of edwards bicycle by tossing it into a patch of marshland a short distance from her home when all was done she treated herself to a little tipple from her new stock her fingers lingering at her neck as she remembered the first taste of the young man men thought miss froom to herself they really were the sweetest of creatures nocturne i dont know why i feel that i must confess this thing to you perhaps it is because i do not know you and you do not know me you have no preconceptions about me we have not spoken before and it may be that we will never speak again for now we have nothing in common except words and silence lately i have been thinking a lot about silence about the spaces in my life i am i suppose a contemplative man by nature i can only write when there is quiet any sound even music is an unwelcome distraction and i speak as one who loves music no let me rephrase that i speak as one who loved music i cannot listen to it now and the quiet that has taken its place brings me no peace there is an edge to it a constant threat of disruption i keep waiting to hear those sounds again the lifting of the piano lid the notes rising from the vibration of the strings the muffled echo of a false key being struck i find myself waking in the darkest spell of the night just to listen but there is only the threatening stillness it was not always this way audrey and jason died on august it was a sunny day so the last time i saw them alive audrey was wearing a light yellow summer dress and jason was dressed in shorts and a tshirt the tshirt was yellow too audrey was taking jason to swimming class i kissed audrey goodbye and ruffled jasons hair and she promised to bring back something for lunch audrey was thirtyfive jason was eight just one year older than his brother david they died because a truck driver swerved to avoid a fox while he was coming around a bend only a mile or two from our home it was a stupid thing to do but looking back almost understandable he ran straight into their car and they were killed instantly about a month ago shortly after the second anniversary of their deaths a job was offered to me a council far to the north had received an unexpected boost to its arts funding in that it had gone from having no arts funding to having a little fearing that even this small allowance might not materialize the following year if it were not used in this one the wise burghers advertised for someone to teach their citizens the rudiments of creative writing to speak at local schools and to edit in the course of the year a volume of work reflecting the talents that the presence of a writer in the town would undoubtedly uncover and nurture i applied for the post and was duly accepted i thought that it might help us every day on his way to school david had to pass the place where his mother and brother had died i had to pass it too whenever i was required to leave the house i thought that taking a break from it all might be good for us both but it wasnt of course our troubles began about two weeks after we arrived at the new house or rather at the old house for it was a little dilapidated the cost of its rental was to be paid in addition to my salary and a local man was engaged to take care of some basic refurbishments it had been sourced for us by an estate agent back in the city who assured us that it was a fine property at a price that would not exceed the councils budget the laborer a man named frank harris had already commenced his renovations before we arrived but it was still a workinprogress it was built of gray stone on two levels with a kitchen living room and small toilet downstairs and three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs most of the walls remained unpainted and some of the floors were still sticky with varnish we brought some furniture with us but it looked lost and uncomfortable in this unfamiliar setting like guests who had somehow wandered into the wrong party yet in the beginning david seemed to enjoy the experience of moving to a new place children are so very adaptable in that way he explored made friends decorated his room with paintings and posters and climbed the great trees at the bottom of the garden i by contrast was seized with a terrible loneliness for i found that the absence of audrey and jason was exacerbated rather than reduced by the strangeness of my surroundings i took to writing in the garden in the hope that sunlight might dissipate my mood it worked sometimes i can remember clearly the first night that it occurred i woke in darkness to hear the piano being played in the living room it was one of only a few pieces left by the houses previous owner along with the great oak table in the kitchen and a pair of handsome mahogany bookshelves that occupied twin alcoves in the living room i arose my head fuzzy with sleep and the noise of the outoftune piano hammering at my nerves and went downstairs to find david standing in the room alone i thought that he might have been sleepwalking but he was awake he was always awake when it happened id heard him talking to himself as i descended but he stopped as i reached the room and so too did the piano music still i caught snatches of his conversation as i descended mainly yes and no as if somebody were asking him questions and he were giving out reluctant answers in return he talked the way he talked to people he didnt know very well or of whom he was shy or wary but the onesided conversation wasnt the strangest part of it it was the piano playing that was so strange you see david never played the piano it was jason his lost brother who had played david didnt have a note in his head david i said whats going on he didnt reply for a moment and had the room not been empty apart from we two i would have said that someone had just warned him to say no more i heard music he said i heard it too i said was that you playing no he said then who was it he shook his head as he pushed past me and started back up the stairs to his bedroom his brow was deeply furrowed i dont know he said its nothing to do with me the next morning i asked david over breakfast what he had seen when he was in the room in the daylight he seemed more willing to talk of what had occurred a little boy david replied after a time he has dark hair and blue eyes and he is older than me but only a little he talks to me youve seen him before david nodded once at the back of the garden he was hiding in the bushes he asked me to join him he said he knew a game we could play but i wouldnt go then last night i heard the piano and i went down to see who was playing i thought it was jason i forgot he trailed off i reached out to him and ruffled his hair its okay i said sometimes i forget too but my hand was trembling as i touched his head david laid his spoon in his bowl of untouched cornflakes and resumed his story the boy was sitting at the piano he asked me to come and sit with him he wanted me to help him to finish a song then he said we could go away and play together but i didnt go to him why david i asked why didnt you go because im afraid of him said david he looks like a boy but he isnt david i asked does he look like jason davids face froze as he looked at me jasons dead he replied he died with mum in the crash i told you i just forgot but you miss him he nodded i miss him a lot but the little boy isnt jason he maybe looks like him sometimes but he isnt jason i wouldnt be frightened of jason with that he stood and placed his cereal bowl in the sink i didnt know what to say or to think david was not the kind of boy who made up stories and he was a very bad liar all i could guess was that he was enduring some kind of delayed reaction to his brothers death it was frightening enough but nothing that we could not deal with there were people we could talk to experts who could be consulted everything would work out in the end david stayed at the sink for a time then turned to me as if he had decided something dad he said mr harris says that something bad happened in this house is that true i dont know david i replied and it was the truth i had seen david talking to frank harris as he went about his work in the house sometimes he allowed david to help him with little tasks he seemed like a nice man and it was good for david to work with his hands but now i began to have second thoughts about leaving my son alone with him mr harris says that you have to be careful with some places david continued he says they have long memories that the stones hold those memories and sometimes without meaning to people can make them come alive again i tried to keep the anger from my voice as i responded mr harris is employed as a handyman david not as a professional frightener im going to have a talk with him with that david nodded unhappily picked up his jacket and sports bag from the hallway and walked down the garden path to wait for the bus the local school where david would begin studying in the autumn was running summer events for children three days each week and david had enthusiastically embraced the opportunity to play cricket and tennis in the sun i was about to join david when i saw another figure kneeling beside him obviously talking to him his face serious and concerned he was an elderly man with silver hair and there were paint stains on his blue overalls it was frank harris the handyman he stood and patted davids head gently then waited with him until the bus pulled up and whisked david away i intercepted harris as he opened the front door with the spare key he looked a little confused as i began to speak im afraid that i have to talk to you about a serious matter mr harris i said its these stories youve been telling david about the house you know hes been having nightmares and you may be the cause of them mr harris laid down his paint tin he regarded me evenly im sorry you feel that way mr markham i never meant to give your son bad dreams he says you told him that something bad had happened here in the past all i told your son was that he should be careful careful of what just that well older houses have histories some good some bad and as new people enter them and bring new life into them the history of the house is altered and modified that way bad histories can slowly over time become good histories its the way of things but the house where you now live hasnt experienced that kind of change it hasnt had time now it was my turn to look confused i dont understand i said the people who found this property for you didnt check on its history said harris it was just in the right area at the right price and the local agent was so happy to rent it he didnt see any point in spoiling a good deal by opening his mouth nobody from around these parts would ever have considered renting or buying this house or even recommending it to a nonlocal in fact i was the only person who would agree to work on it its not a good house in which to be raising a child mr markham its not good to allow a child to live its life in a house where another child had its life ended i leaned back against the wall i welcomed its support a child died in the house a child was killed in the house he corrected me thirty years ago this november a man named victor parks lived here and he murdered a child in his bedroom the police caught him trying to bury the remains down by the river lord i said i didnt know ive never even heard of victor parks nobody told you mr markham so you couldnt have known continued harris by the time youd rented the house it was already too late as for parks hes dead he had a heart attack in his cell on the very night he was sentenced to life imprisonment maybe the thought of an existence spent trapped in a small cell far away from what was familiar to him was too much for him to bear something changed in his voice it tightened as if fighting off some unwanted emotion he was an unusual man victor parks he said he worked as a verger in the church and helped train the local football teams in many ways he was a model citizen people respected him they trusted him with their children he paused and those old eyes were filled with a remembered grief what he said next caused my hands to tense involuntarily he also gave lessons mr markham he taught piano to the children i couldnt speak i didnt want to hear this it was foolishness harris had told david this story and david had picked up on some details of it to create a fantasy that mixed up his dead brother and the victim of this victor parks i tried to salvage some semblance of sense from all of this to return us to reality all of this may be true but it doesnt change the fact that these stories are obviously troubling david last night i found him in the sitting room he thought there was a little boy at the piano and that the boy spoke to him harris bent down to pick up his paint tin once again i was about to tell him not to bother that his services were no longer needed when he spoke again mr markham he said as he straightened i didnt tell david what happened in this house he doesnt know anything about victor parks or what was done here if hes heard something about it then it was told to him by someone else david says he sees a little boy and you think that he believes that its the child who was killed but parks didnt kill a boy he killed a little girl whatever your son is seeing mr markham figment of his imagination or not it isnt the girl parks murdered i stood aside to let him pass and the next question came so unexpectedly that i thought for a moment that an unseen third person had asked it what was her name mr harris what was the name of the girl who died here but even as the words left my lips i already seemed to know part of the answer and i understood at last why it was that he had agreed to do the work on this house lucy he replied her name was lucy harris i did not ask frank harris to leave i could not not after what he had told me i could not even imagine what it must be like for him to work in the place in which his daughter had lost her life what brought him back here day after day why would he torment himself in this way i wanted to ask him but i did not in a way i think that i understood it was the same instinct that made me find excuses to drive past the spot where audrey and jason had died it was a means of maintaining some kind of contact with what they once were as if some part of them remained there and would find a way to reach out to me or perhaps i hoped that someday i would drive by and see them however briefly caught between living and dying before they faded away forever for a time david had no more bad dreams and there were no more nocturnal wanderings frank harris finished most of his work on the house and departed temporarily but not before he tried to speak to me once again of his concerns for david i brushed them away it was over the trouble had passed and david was himself once more helped by warm days spent playing with other children in green fields far from the house in which a little girl had died i taught my classes and my own writing progressed soon david would commence school and the normal rhythms of our new life would be established at last but the night before school began david came to me and woke me to listen to the sound of the piano its him he whispered i could see his tears glistening even in the darkness he wants me to follow him into the dark place but i dont want to go im going to tell him to go away im going to tell him to go away forever with that he turned and ran from the room i jumped from my bed and followed him calling to him to stop but he was already racing down the stairs before my foot even hit the first step he had entered the living room following the sound of the piano and seconds later i heard his voice raised go away you have to leave me alone i wont go with you you dont belong here and a second voice answered it said this is my place and youll do as i tell you to do when i reached the bottom of the stairs there was a boy seated on the piano stool david was right he looked somewhat like jason as though someone had been given a fleeting description of my lost son and had constructed an imperfect imitation on that basis but all of the good in jason all of the brightness was gone from this being instead there was only the shell of a boy who might once have been mine and something dark moved inside it he wore the same yellow tshirt and shorts that jason had been wearing on the day he died except they didnt fit quite right they looked too tight and there was dirt and blood on them and the voice wasnt a childs voice it spoke in a mans tone deep and threatening it sounded obscene coming out of this small figure it said play with me david come sit beside me help me finish my song then ill show you my special place my dark place do as i tell you now come to me and we can play together forever i stepped into the room and the child looked at me as it did so it changed as if by distracting it i had somehow broken its concentration it was no longer a boy it was no longer anything human it was old and stooped and decayed with a balding skull and pinched white skin the shreds of a dark suit hung on what was left of its body and its eyes were black and lusting it raised its fingers to its lips and licked the tips this is my place it said the children come to me suffer the children that come unto me i grabbed david and pushed him behind me back into the hallway i could hear him crying the thing smiled at me and it touched itself as it did so and i knew what i had to do there was a sledgehammer in the hallway harris had left it there along with other tools that he planned to take away at a later time i reached for the sledgehammer my eyes never leaving the thing on the piano stool it was already fading away when i took the first swing and i saw the hammer pass through it as it hit the piano i struck at the wood and ivory again and again and again screaming and howling as i did so i kept swinging the hammer until most of the piano lay in pieces on the ground then i took the remains outside and in the darkness i set them alight david helped me we stood side by side and we watched it turn to ash and blackened wood and i thought at one point that i saw a figure writhing in the flames a man in a dark suit slowly burning in the night air until at last he was dispersed by the wind now it is i who have the nightmares and i who lie awake listening in the dead of night i hate the silence but more than that i fear what may disturb it in my dreams i see a thing in a ragged suit luring children into dark places and i hear the sound of nocturnes playing i call to the children i try to stop them sometimes frank harris is with me for we share these dreams together and we try to warn the little ones mostly they listen to us but sometimes the music plays and a little boy invites them to play a game and they follow him into the darkness the wakeford abyss the two men stared down into the void below behind them the sun was slowly rising a counterpoint to the journey that they were about to undertake larks called but the sound of them seemed to come from far away here among these desolate hills no birds flew the only sign of life that they had encountered upon their ascent was a single goat that had somehow found itself alone on the side of bledstone hill and was now making a concerted effort to rejoin its fellows in more hospitable surroundings they could still see it moving gingerly among the rocks and scree when they turned toward the sun surefooted as it was it seemed to evince a distrust of the ground beneath its feet and with good cause both of the men had taken nasty tumbles on their approach and molton the older and stouter of the two had lost his compass during one particularly painful fall it was molton who now removed his cap and holding it firmly by the brim began to fan himself gently feels like its going be a hot one he said from where they stood they could see green fields and stone walls slowly emerging from the nights gloom as the light rose the distant spire of wakefords only church was revealed to them surrounded by the small redbrick houses of its worshippers soon there would be people moving and the noise of carts upon its narrow streets but for now the village was still molton who was born and raised in london and considered himself very much the city gent wondered how anyone could live in such a place it was too quiet for him too provincial and without any of the distractions on which he depended for his amusement a bleating noise came to him and he shielded his eyes as he attempted to assess the goats progress he saw it poised on a small rock testing the ground ahead with its hoof each time it tried to place its weight down shingle slid away raising dust as it went poor beggar said molton hell be hungry soon he tugged at his mustaches and finding them colonized by small pieces of grit began to clean them with a small comb the other man did not take his eyes from the maw at their feet he was smaller than molton by about six inches and his face was clean shaven but like his companion his bearing betrayed his military origins his name was clements and it was largely at his instigation that the two men had made their way to wakeford both had some experience of climbing mainly in the alps but it was clements who had suggested that those skills might serve them just as well below ground as above whos a poor beggar asked clements the goat said molton looks as if hes stuck up here hell find his way down they always do molton looked doubtful he had always been the more cautious of the two men and sedentary by nature at least when compared with clementss more robust approach to life nevertheless the two men had found a common bond in their fascination with ascents and descents a bond strengthened by their shared belief in the value of a good strong rope the skills required by mountaineers and the equipment they used had advanced little in three hundred years of climbing a stout alpenstock was essential while the continentals also favored crampons britons clements and molton among them eschewed crampons in favor of two rows of tripleheaded tacks in the soles of their boots but most parties agreed that ropes simply werent the sort of thing that a gentleman ought to be using they were considered vaguely unmanly as well as potentially dangerous clements and molton had become believers in the merits of rope following an encounter with the legendary irish scientist and climber john tyndall in london some years earlier in tyndall had successfully completed his first solo ascent of monte rosa without the aid of guides porters or provisions and with only a ham sandwich and a bottle of tea to sustain him only the most foolhardy of critics would dare to impugn the bravery of such a man in he had aroused considerable controversy when he ascribed the blame for the deaths of two englishmen and a guide on the alpine slope of col du geant to inadequate use of ropes clements and molton had read tyndalls letter to the times concerning the accident and the correspondence that quickly followed when in the spring of tyndall invited the alpine climber and guide auguste balmat to speak at the british museum the two men were in attendance and later enjoyed a supper with tyndall by the time he was finished with them it was all that they could do not to seek out the nearest rope maker and set him to work on miles of stout line thus it was that clements and molton were clad in what was for the time considered more than suitable attire for a descent beneath the earth stout boots strong tweeds and stiff leather gloves lengths of rope lay coiled at their feet alongside two packs filled with water some roast chicken two loaves of freshly baked bread and a flask of burgundy they had brought four lanterns with them and enough fuel to give them light for about twelve hours although they expected to be belowground for no more than half of that time moltons gaze drifted across the rocky landscape then alighted like a crow on a vertical wooden stave that stood off to his right i say what do you think that is he said pointing with his right hand clements squinted then walked toward the pole it was about three feet in height and was set deeply into the ground a metal ring hung from the top adorned with strands of old rope it looks like a tethering post said clements odd place to tether an animal molton replied clements shrugged theyre odd people he rubbed his hands together and headed back to the opening in the rock right then he said lets get started while clements anchored the rope molton checked the kit and tested the lamps how deep did you say this was he asked dont know clements replied couple of hundred feet maybe huh a few hundred feet doesnt sound like much of an abyss its merely an estimate said clements it could be more nobody knows its virgin territory the wakeford abyss as it was known locally extended for about fifty feet along the south face of bledstone hill like a scar in the earth that had never quite healed at its widest point it opened to about twenty feet narrowing at either extreme to mere inches before losing itself among the bare rocks by standing on its very edge one could see only the first fifteen feet of the interior before the curvature of the rock blocked out the sunlight it was not entirely clear what had caused this geological anomaly and in truth few in the region cared much to discover more about it clements and molton had dined at wakefords sole inn the night before and made efforts to plumb the depths of local knowledge about the hole torn in the hillside for their troubles they received a hodgepodge of myth tall tales and regional superstitions the abyss was said to be the lair of a dragon in ancient times according to one regular at the bar another claimed that it was formerly known as the devils hole a name as much bound up with the locals penchant for earthy humor as with any satanic origins there was talk of druidic sacrifices of longdead lords tethering animals to the rocks as a means of appeasing the appetites of whatever lay within as the evening wore on and the beer flowed more freely the stories grew more and more extreme in their details until a credulous listener might have felt that bledstone hill contained every form of devilment known to man and more besides finally while they were finishing their ales in preparation for bed a farmer took the seat nearest to the two exsoldiers he was a small man with the dark worn features of one who has spent most of his life outofdoors confronting the harshest of elements the other men and women at the bar did not greet him by name although they followed his progress carefully as he crossed the floor to join the two strangers i hear you gentleman are intent upon visiting the abyss tomorrow he said molton advised him that yes that was indeed the case have you another tall tale to add to our collection asked clements we seem to be accumulating quite a number the impatience was audible in his voice clements had earlier hoped for some useful information that might have aided them in their exploration but two hours spent in the best company that wakeford could offer had left him no wiser than before although slightly poorer and considerably more weary no im not much of a one for telling tales replied the farmer but my fields lie at the base of bledstone hill and youll be passing through them tomorrow on your journey i dont doubt well take care to close the gates said molton you dont have to be concerned the farmer took a sip of his beer im not concerned about gates he said i told you i dont have any tall tales to share with you but i do know this there was a time when flocks grazed on the lower reaches of bledstone they do so no longer clements shrugged weve seen it from afar it doesnt look as if there would be much grazing there sheep and goats more will find food in the barest of places said the farmer this is hard land and we cant be choosy about how we fill the bellies of our livestock but ive lost animals on bledstone and never found them again and now id be hard pressed to make even sheep graze on that hill they dont like it so i leave them where they are molton and clements exchanged a glance and the farmer picked up on their skepticism i dont expect you gentlemen to listen to much that i have to say youre from the city army men too i should say you think youve seen it all and it may be that youve seen much its true but ive found substances on the rocks sticky in the morning sun as though something had passed that way in the night ive found the bodies of birds drained of life you talk to other people here the ones who kept their own counsel tonight and youll hear the same from them nonsense scoffed clements molton ever the diplomat attempted a more conciliatory tone has anyone ever seen anything he asked i mean its all well and good telling us these things but clements here has a point there could be a hundred explanations for what youve just told us and none of them stranger than the next the farmer shook his head he seemed untroubled by the doubts expressed by the two men as though he were so certain of the truth in his own mind that he had long since learned to hide his frustration with those who chose not to listen no he said ive not seen anything and anyway there are precautions taken now to keep it at bay whatevers down there knows better than to show itself too for fear of being exposed or hunted id say it tries to venture out only when its desperate and can live long on the poorest of suppers its been in the abyss for a long long time and must be old now older than any of us can imagine why should that be so hard for you to believe from what i hear theyre finding new creatures all the time animals that nobody could ever have imagined existed living quietly in remote places why not here under the ground despite his better judgment clements found himself drawn into the debate i accept that such things can be he said but why has nobody ever encountered one surely such an animal would be glimpsed even at a distance even the shyest of nocturnal creatures exposes itself to view at some point because its not like them said the farmer simply theyre poor dumb animals some may be more cunning than others but in the end theyre just no match for us whatevers down there knows how to keep hidden id say its sensitive to us its learned how to wait and with that he departed leaving molton and clements to finish their beer alone before tipping a small bow to the landlord and heading to bed now they were on the brink of the abyss and the tales of ribald drunks and fearful farmers were almost forgotten when clements had completed his work the two men exchanged roles each examining the others preparations upon finding that all was in order molton took to the rope and after pausing for a moment or two upon the lip of the chasm slipped over the edge after some time had elapsed clements felt a double tug on the rope he moved to the rim and shouted down all well splendid came the reply molton was invisible to him due to the nature of the incline at the entrance to the abyss although clements thought he could discern the faintest hint of artificial light you have to see this old chap continued molton in your own time of course within minutes clements had joined his companion on a wide lip of rock that jutted out from the side of the chasm the twin lights of their lamps hanging in the blackness neither man spoke both overawed by their surroundings they were in a cathedral of stone the abyss narrow at its entrance began to widen at the point where no further sunlight could penetrate quickly extending to hundreds of feet in circumference in the light of their lanterns they saw wondrous stalactites hanging like melted wax crystals gleamed surrounded by great frozen waterfalls of stone it was wonderfully cool with a hint of moisture to the air careful old man said molton as his companion drew perilously close to the edge of the shelf clements stopped his heels almost on the very rim of the stone his eyes shone brightly in the flickering light my god he whispered look the walls of the cavern were covered in paintings reaching almost to the cleft in the earth that had enabled them to enter clements could see images of men and women some running others lying torn and half consumed their remains shaded in pale yellows and faded reds the depictions were crude almost symbolic there were triangles for faces and blurs for clothing so that seen from close up the images would have been almost unintelligible but viewed at some distance they were more easily understood molton joined the smaller man his own lantern lifted the combined light revealed more of the paintings confirming the great extent of the work who did this asked molton more to the point how was it done said clements as he began walking to his left attempting to find the limits of the artwork these look very old a man would need scaffolding to paint that rock face maybe even he stopped he was now at the farthest extreme of the outcrop yet the paintings continued despite a sheer drop barely inches from where he stood the images extended both vertically and horizontally incredible he said what a find said molton its amazing simply amazing clements didnt reply instead he lay on his belly attached a rope to the ring of his lantern and slowly lowered it down after another fifty feet the lantern came to rest upon what they could see was a much larger ledge which appeared to run around at least half the circumference of the cavern what do you think old man he asked molton did you get that smell as we were descending like oil but worse said molton nasty stuff it was fresh as though it had been poured over the rim recently now why do you suppose someone would do that he hefted his ax in his hand to discourage us molton suggested to discourage something answered clements perhaps thats what was meant by precautions it would take us a long time to get back to the village said molton even then what would we tell them nothing that they dont already know i expect said clements well were here now molton concluded might as well take the shilling tour as the tuppenny one once again he assumed the lead puffing slightly as he made his way down the rope clements watched his light grow smaller and smaller like a life force slowly dwindling he swatted the thought away nearly there now he thought another ten feet another five suddenly the rope was wrenched from his hands almost dragging him over the side with it pressing the sole of his boot against a hollow in the base of the rock he attempted to arrest his progress the smell of burning leather assailing his nostrils somehow molton must have fallen perhaps he had missed the ledge or they had misjudged its weightbearing capacity hold on he shouted hold on molton ive got you but then almost as soon as it had begun the rope stopped its movement breathing hard clements tied it firmly around a stalagmite and scrambled to the edge he leaned over the lantern in his hand and saw moltons light on the ledge below the rope was there too winding into the shadows where the lantern could not reach molton he shouted there was no reply he tried again and thought he detected sounds of scuffling from below hello molton the noises ceased clements thought for a moment it was clear now that molton was injured or worse although clements had no idea how the accident had occurred he would have to descend and tend to his companion as best he could before seeking assistance from the world above most of the food was in moltons pack but clements had the firstaid kit as well as some of the chicken he would leave it all with molton before ascending he thought as he checked the rope before making his way down to his friend he carefully descended wary now of what lay beneath three feet from the ledge he paused the stone face of the chasm was more uneven here with hollows and crevasses the ledge itself though was relatively smooth moltons cap rested upon it beside the remains of his lantern which had shattered upon impact clements allowed himself to slide down the remaining feet of rope and touched the rock gingerly with his feet it felt firm as he had expected it would after all he had heard no sound of collapse when the rope began to burn through his hands whatever had occasioned the accident it was not the ledge giving out beneath moltons weight clements placed his feet firmly on the rock then tried to find some trace of his friend he picked up the rope and began to follow it tracing it across the ledge and behind a rocky outcrop there it disappeared into what appeared to be a narrow cavern accessible through a cleft in the rock face lantern raised clements approached the entrance molton he called again he heard sounds of movement he extended his arm attempting to illuminate the space within and caught sight of the upper half of moltons body lying flat upon the ground his face was turned toward clements and his eyes were wide open blood flowed from the corners of his mouth but his lips appeared gummed up by a white sticky material molton reached out his right hand and clements was about to enter the cavern to take it when the older mans body shuddered and he slid some inches to his right as clements raised the lantern he saw that moltons legs had almost entirely disappeared into a hole at the base of the cavern wall drawn inward by some unseen force there were more paintings here but clements barely registered their presence as he laid down the lamp and gripped his companion beneath the arms neither did he take time to examine the bones strewn upon the floor the corrosion upon them a testament to the age of those from whom they had come ive got you he said ive got you there came another tug on moltons body this time drawing him forward almost to the level of his waist where any further progress was arrested by his girth whatever was pulling him toward it paused in its efforts either disturbed by the sound of clementss voice or by the fact that it was unable to haul its catch farther into its lair molton held on tightly to clementss arm its not taking you anywhere old man said clements dont worry i wont let you go he took a firmer grip on moltons chest on three he said one two molton tensed himself as clements pulled three a warm spray struck clementss face and he was momentarily blinded as molton was freed the two men stumbled back against the wall molton shaking uncontrollably as clements struggled to clear his vision slowly clements felt molton grow still he looked down and saw the life leave the remains of his companion whatever was drawing molton into the hole had proved reluctant to cede its prey for his lower body was almost entirely missing apart from a section of his left leg which already appeared to be rotting on the bone turning to fluid even as clements watched clements scrambled away trying hard to keep his breakfast down christ he shouted oh christ and in the light of the lantern he glimpsed motion through the hole at the base of the rock a sprinkling of black eyes gleamed and clements saw palps test the air and venom drip from elongated fangs a great stink seemed to rise from inside the chamber and then legs appeared spiny and jointed each more than two feet long as the spider began to force a way through the gap clements could see others moving behind it could hear the dull scraping of their bodies as they brushed against one another he responded with the best weapon he had to hand gripping the lantern he flung it as hard as he could at the emerging creatures the lantern shattered instantly sending flames shooting up the cavern wall and dousing the spiders in burning oil as clements fled using the light from the flames to spy the rope dangling before him he gripped it and began to climb listening for any sounds coming from below until he felt the upper ledge beneath his fingers there he paused and with his pocketknife he cut the rope that led down before lighting his remaining lantern in preparation for the last ascent back to the world he knew he stood and gave the dangling rope a single pull there was a momentary resistance before it fell from above and landed in a heap at his feet clements looked up and heard a goat bleating poor beggar hell be hungry soon sounds rose from below the faintest contact of flesh upon stone and he knew the creatures were starting to scale the rock face he clutched his ax to his chest as a scratching noise came from above him clements looked up and thought he could detect movement in the shadows a rock dislodged far to his right and although he listened hard he could not hear it strike the base of the cavern now there was movement all around him slowly drawing closer to the ledge upon which he sat in the light of the lantern he fell to his knees and listened to the approach of the creatures venom already dripping on him from the unseen fangs above clements rose to his feet he sensed the creatures had stopped and knew that they were preparing to strike he thought of molton and their times together we should have stayed in the mountains old man he said aloud we should have stayed where there was daylight and with that he stepped from the lip of the ledge the lantern still clutched in his hand as he brought light at last to the depths of the wakeford abyss the reflecting eye a charlie parker novella the souls dark cottage batterd and decayd lets in new light through chinks that time has made stronger by weakness wiser men become as they draw nearer to their eternal home leaving the old

uniform tree line some twenty feet from the house so that nature itself appears reluctant to extend its reach any closer it is a simple twostory arrangement with a gabled attic window above the second floor a porch runs along three sides a decrepit swing chair to the east hanging askew by a single rope dead leaves lie curled inward like the remains of insects piled up against the windows and doors the mummified husk of a wren is buried beneath them its body sunken and its feathers fragile as ancient parchment the windows of the grady house have long been covered over with wood and the front and back entrances have been fortified by the addition of steel doors nobody has damaged them for even the most daring of pranksters steer clear of the building itself some come out to look and to drink beer in its shadow as if to goad its d√¶mons into taking action against them but like small boys taunting a lion through the bars of its cage they are brave only as long as there is a barrier between themselves and the presence in the grady house for there is a presence there perhaps it does not have a name or even a form but it exists it is composed of misery and hurt and despair it is in the dust on the floors and in the fading paper that peels slowly from the walls it is in the stains on the sink and in the ashes of the last fire it is in the damp upon the ceiling and in the blood upon the boards it is in everything and it is of everything and it waits it is strange how john gradys name is rarely spoken except in reference to killings committed by others no books have been written about him even in this age of insatiable curiosity about the darkest among us and the nature of his crimes remains unexplored in the popular imagination true if one is prepared to delve into the journals of criminology or the textbooks of violent crime then there will be attempts to come to grips with john grady but all of them will fail john grady is inexplicable for to explain him one must first know about him there must be facts a background a personality there must be schoolmates and fellow workers an absent father an overbearing mother there must be trauma and conflicted sexuality for john grady there are none of these things he arrived in maine in and he bought a house his neighbors dropped by and he invited them inside to take a look around the house was old but john grady clearly had some experience in construction for he was tearing out walls laying new floors filling in cracks and replacing old plumbing his neighbors never stayed long as john grady was clearly a busy man albeit one with dubious taste the original expensive wallpaper was already gone and a cheap unadorned replacement had been put up in its stead the paste grady used was of his own creation and it stank giving visitors another reason not to prolong their stay grady was doing all the work alone he would talk about his plans for the house and it was clear that he had already created it in his mind he spoke of red drapes and deep velvet couches of clawtoed bathtubs and mahogany dining tables it was he said a labor of love yet people looked up at that cheap paper and smelled the rank substance that he had used to raise it and quickly put grady down as a fantasist john grady stole children he took the first little mattie bristol from north anson in the autumn of the second evie munger from fryeburg in the spring of the third nadine lincoln from south paris in the summer of denny maguire the fourth victim and the only one to survive as he walked from school in belfast in the third week of may and his final victim louise matheson while she was walking from her home in shin pond to the house of her best friend amy lowell on may that was his mistake for amy was so excited about her friends impending arrival that she was hiding in the woods at the verge of her house hoping to leap out and surprise her she watched gradys lincoln pull up alongside her friend saw the man inside lean over to speak to her and then found herself unable to move as gradys big hand grabbed louise by the hair and dragged her into the car amys parents heard her screaming and within minutes the police were on their way already mounting a search for a red lincoln they did not have to look far the abduction of louise matheson was a crime of opportunity for john grady his previous victims had been taken from towns elsewhere in the state then brought west to be killed but shin pond was barely ten miles from the grady house john gradys appetites had become increasingly hard to sate and the release that he gained from their appeasement did not last as long as it once had it is possible to imagine him on the day that louise matheson was abducted prowling the roads his hunger gnawing at him perhaps promising himself that he was only trying to distract himself from his appetites by taking a ride that he did not really intend to seek out another victim john grady was a tall thin man his hair was graying prematurely and cut close to his scalp which served only to make his face seem even longer than it was a calcium deficiency in his youth had given his chin an unfortunate prominence one that he tried to hide by keeping his head low he always wore a suit when out in public set off by a bright bow tie and dark suspenders there was something dated about him his suits though clean gave the impression of having dwelt for some time in an attic or a thrift store the shirts were a little frayed at the collars and cuffs the bow ties looked faded rather than fresh and bore wrinkles and stains that suggested many years of use john grady had long fingers and large hands amy lowell told the police that when he gripped her friends head the mans fingers had closed on it entirely like the talons of a great bird extending almost to her eyes despite her shock amy lowell gave the police a good description of the individual who had taken louise matheson and the vehicle that he drove there were those who recalled john gradys ownership of a red lincoln and the police arrived at the grady house and found the car nobody answered their knocks to the door and a debate ensued on the porch steps of the grady house concerning the nature of probable cause it was curtailed by the sound real or imagined of a childs cry and the door was kicked in john grady was standing in the hallway of his house his great work remained uncompleted and there were ladders and drapes everywhere his left hand was on the handle of the door to his basement and he held a gun in his right before he could be stopped he darted through the basement door and locked it behind him he had reinforced it specifically for such an eventuality replacing the flimsy original with sturdy oak and strengthening it with steel bands and a security bar it took the police twenty minutes to break it down when they entered the basement louise was dead slumped on the floor beside her was another child a little boy he was still alive but unconscious from hunger and dehydration this was denny maguire john grady stood over them both with his gun to his head his last words before he pulled the trigger were this is not a house this is a home ii winter was here the north wind had almost stripped the last of the leaves from the trees leaving only a sprinkling of foliage to threaten the dominion of the evergreens clusters of young beeches trembled beneath the canopy and sugar maple seedlings lay sprinkled through the forests like lost gold there was a kind of silence now in the woods as animals prepared to slumber or to die in portland the trees of the old port were festooned with white lights and a christmas tree burned brightly farther up on congress it was cold although not as cold as the winters i recalled from my childhood when i was young we would spend new years at my grandfathers house in scarborough he and my father would share whiskey and war stories for they were both policemen although my grandfather had retired many years before my mother would listen indulgently to tales that she had heard told over and over again then hustle me off to my bed outside the snow would gleam with a bluish tinge lit by a bright moon in a clear dark sky i would sit at my window wrapped in a blanket and stare at it following its contours basking in the otherworldliness of it even on the darkest of nights when the moon was invisible the snow seemed to hold light within it to the child gazing at it from his window it glowed from deep inside and i would fall asleep with the curtains open so that its unsullied beauty was the last thing i saw before my eyes closed the voices of those whom i loved distantly rising and falling in low cadence in time those voices from my past would be stilled my grandfather my parents all were gone now i found that i became what i had most feared when i was a child a man whose blood ran only in his own veins a figure without visible ties to those who had brought him into this world and when i tried to anchor myself with a family of my own that too was taken from me and i drifted and was lost for a time in places without names yet at last i learned to recognize that i was not entirely alone and that there were deep connections binding me to all that i had known i had to come back to this place to find them to reveal them where they had always lain waiting beneath fallen leaves and compacted snow in the memory of a child seated by a window my past and my present were here in this northern place and i hoped my future too soon i would be a father again for my lover rachel was due to give birth in the coming weeks i felt part of a circle slowly completing itself in this region of my childhood and i thought that i would always remain here during the long winter months i would bitch and moan with the best of the old men i would complain when my wheels became mired in mud during the spring thaw or when filthy piles of iced snow upon shady corners continued their slow melt into march sullying the streets in a futile rearguard action against the coming of spring i would strike out at mosquitoes and greenheads during the summer and watch my lawn disappear beneath brown leaves in fall occasionally even now i would hear one of my neighbors joke about heading for florida that this was the last damn winter he could endure in the cold northeast but i knew that the speaker would never leave it was part of the game we all played the dance of which we were all a part i could not live without seasons for in seasons are reflected the rhythms of our existence of birth and maturity of decline and decay yet always with the promise of renewal for those who remain perhaps i would alter my attitude as i grew older as the winters took a greater toll upon me and the north wind brought with it a reminder only of my own mortality i wondered sometimes if that was part of the appeal of florida or arizona for those in their later years cut off from the seasons it was possible to forget the rhythm that governed ones life even as ones feet still moved to complete the final steps of the dance my prospective client was late but i didnt really care up on middle street the half moon jug band was playing carols to cheer the shoppers i could hear the music from where i sat in javanet on exchange surrounded by kids playing with the computers i kind of liked javanet even if the geek quotient tonight was a little greater than i would have preferred it had decent coffee and some comfortable armchairs it was also a pretty good place to meet people as most of those sharing space were too caught up with internet dating or email to bother with what was happening around them its window was also a good spot for peoplewatching and outside of newbury street in boston or just about anywhere below th street in manhattan the window of javanet on exchange was one of my favorite places from which to watch the world pass by i had already counted at least three women who if i hadnt been perfectly happy with rachel would probably have refused to have anything to do with me and rightly so i had also seen maurice pronounced maurreese gardner who was something of a local celebrity among those of us with a blacker than average sense of humor since maurice had once shot and superficially wounded a santa claus at the mall maurice claimed that santa had snuck up on him while santa when he gave evidence at maurices trial claimed that he had merely been heading for the mens room beside the mall office since maurice was hopped off his head at the time on coke riffed with persian brown a combination likely to make even buddha a little edgy the judge sided with santa claus and maurice was locked up for a while for his own protection and to ensure that christmas did not become a time of mourning for traumatized junior patrons of the mall stores maurice was now clean taking his medication and working as second mate on a lobster boat in a nice circularity of events he volunteered each christmas to play santa claus at some outoftown childrens charity from what i heard he felt it was the least that he could do to make up for his past sins i like portland it has all the advantages of a city but still feels like a small town theres an eccentricity to it and a strength of character it has more coffee shops than maybe any city its size rightfully needs and there are one or two bars that could slide into the sea and make this a classier place by their absence but thats okay it has a little movie theater that plays mostly foreign imports and the downtown nickelodeon has promoted itself back to firstruns the public market is still going and there are decent bookstores and a big library all told its not such a bad place to have on your doorstep and when it preyed on my nervesas it sometimes didi had the reassurance that i didnt actually live here i could retreat back to my house on the scarborough marshes within minutes and watch the sun set on still waters some clown in a bad suit waved at me from the street and i gave him a noncommittal nod in return it took me about three minutes to recall him as the real estate salesman who had once tried to convince rachel and me that our lives would be improved by living in his sinkhole new development out saco way since then he had experienced some misfortune in his life he had been screwing his secretary on the side and when his wife found out she screwed him his business went to the wall and he was threatened with jail when it emerged that he had been frugal with the information he had provided to the irs both his wife and his secretary gave evidence against him which says a lot about the kind of person that he was a couple of the saco houses had also subsided when a passing child sneezed too loudly and all kinds of legal storms were now brewing on that front as well but there he was a shopping bag from country noel in one hand waving to a man he barely knew but had once tried to rip off with a bad property deal really you had to love exchange street my client was now twenty minutes late and counting but it still didnt matter there was life around me life and the promise of new life to come most of those on the streets were locals reclaiming the old port from the tourists now that summer was gone and the leaf watchers had departed i could see a group of skater kids dressed in hooded sweats and oversized jeans trying to pretend that the encroaching cold wasnt bothering them i guessed that about half of them would be receiving antibiotics and tlc from their moms before the week was out but they wouldnt share that fact with their buddies i had dropped some cash over at bull moose earlier and now flicked idly through my purchases some of them would probably be okay with rachel i guessed the notwist and maybe thee more shallows i wasnt too sure how she would feel about and you will know us by the trail of dead but id heard some of their stuff on one of the more vibrant local radio stations and liked it a lot it was also a cool name for a band which counted for something i figured that if i could find a tshirt with the bands name on it i might be allowed to hang out with the slacker kids for a while at least until the cops came by and decided to haul me in for my own safety my client arrived at pm i knew him by his clothing he had told me to expect a man in a gray suit with a grayblack tie a black overcoat protecting him from the cold and that was what i got he looked younger than i expected although i guessed that he was probably close to seventy by now i decided not to share my trail of dead cd with him i thought it might be pushing things a little on our first meeting i raised a hand to let him know who i was and he threaded his way through the computer stations to take a seat with me at the window casting some suspicious glances at some of the well more sheltered patrons its okay i said they wont hurt you he looked a little uncertain but gave them the benefit of the doubt frank matheson he said stretching out his hand it was a big hand scarred in places a huge callus stretched across his palm from the base of his thumb i could feel it as i shook his hand matheson owned a machine tool company over in solon and was a reasonably wealthy man but he had clearly come by it through hard graft i bought him a coffeeblack no sugarand rejoined him at the window im surprised that you dont have an office he said if i had an office id have to paint it then buy chairs and a desk id have to think about what to put on the walls people would judge me on the quality of my furnishings and what do they judge you on now the quality of other peoples coffee its pretty good in this place you meet all of your clients here depends if im not sure about them i meet them in starbucks if im really not sure about them i meet them at a gas station maybe offer them a couple of milk duds to break the ice a look of confusion crossed his face as though a small warning light had just tripped in his brain i get that look a lot you come highly recommended he said apparently to reassure himself rather than to compliment me probably people i brought to this place plus ive read about you in the newspapers yet still youre here he made a wavering gesture with his right hand ill admit that not all of it was complimentary i believe its called balanced reporting matheson allowed himself a smile although i still wasnt certain that the little warning light had extinguished itself entirely he sipped his coffee lifting the cup with that callused right hand it trembled slightly his left had never ceased clutching the leather attach√© case on his lap i should tell you why im here he said i suppose i should start with my family my i interrupted him is this about your daughter mr matheson he didnt look too surprised i guessed that it happened a lot it probably took a little while for the name to register with some people but theyd get there in the end i imagined frank matheson sitting in his office with a prospective customer seeing the eyes narrow the hands move awkwardly was your daughter louise matheson jesus im sorry that was a terrible thing that happened death was too good for that guy what was his name grady yeah john grady in a way said matheson he opened his case i brought some material along just in case you didnt know about what happened or needed some background inside i could see a plastic folder it contained copies of newspaper clippings and photographs he didnt remove it i know about it i said it was a long time ago you must have been very young when it occurred it was a famous case and people here dont forget things like that too easily they stay in the memory and get passed along maybe its right that they should he didnt reply i knew that his daughter was always in his memory frozen in death at the age of ten i wondered if he ever tried to picture what she might have been like had she lived how she might have looked what she might be doing with her life i wondered if he ever saw other young women on the street and in their faces caught glimpses of his own departed child a faint trace of her as though she were briefly inhabiting the body of another trying to make contact with her family and the life denied her because i saw my own dead child in the children of others and i did not believe that i was alone in experiencing my loss in such a way i know about you as well said matheson thats why i want to hire you i believed youd understand understand what mr matheson he reached into his case and withdrew a brown envelope he slid the envelope toward me it was unsealed inside was a single piece of unfolded paper glossy on one side i removed it and looked at the copy of the blackandwhite photograph on the sheet it showed a child a little girl the photo had been taken from a distance away but the childs face was clear she was holding a softball bat her attention focused on an unseen ball beyond the limits of the picture the girl wasnt wearing a helmet and her brown hair hung loose around her shoulders even at a distance and allowing for the relatively poor quality of the photo she was a beautiful child who is she i asked i dont know i looked at the photograph again there was nothing in it to indicate where it might have been taken there was just the girl the bat and grass and dark trees in the distance i turned the sheet over but the reverse side was blank wheres the original the cops at two mile lake have it you want to tell me how you came by it he took the photograph from me and carefully placed it on the counter ledge before putting the envelope on top of it so that it was entirely covered you know who owns the grady house no but i could hazard a guess which would be that you own the grady house he nodded the bank put it up for sale about two years after my louises murder there were no other bidders i didnt pay very much for it under other circumstances you might even have said that i got a bargain you left it standing what would you have expected me to do raze it its what a lot of folks would have done not me i wanted it to remain as a monument to what was done to my daughter and to those other children i felt that if it was removed from the earth then people would start to forget does that make sense to you it doesnt have to make sense to me it doesnt have to make sense to anyone but you and your family my wife doesnt understand she never has she thinks that all traces of john grady should have been wiped away she doesnt need anything to remind her of what happened to louise its always with her every single day matheson seemed to retreat from me for a moment and i watched his relationship with his wife reflected in his eyes like a rerun of a desolate old movie in some ways it was a miracle that they had stayed together both as a policeman and as an investigator i had seen marriages disintegrate under the burden of grief people speak about a shared sorrow but the death of a child is so often not apportioned in the same way between a father and a mother it is experienced simultaneously but the grief is insidious in its individuality couples drown in it sinking beneath the surface each unable to reach out and touch the other incapable of seeking solace in the love that they feel or once felt for each other it is particularly terrible for those who lose an only child the great bond between them is severed and in some cases they simply drift away into loneliness and isolation i waited can i ask you what you did with your house after what happened he asked i knew the question would come i sold it have you ever been back there no you know who lives there now a young couple they have two children do they know that a woman and a child were killed in that house i guess that they do you think it troubles them i dont know maybe they feel that what happened there once can never happen again but theyd be wrong life doesnt abide by such simple rules do you feel that way about the grady house mr matheson his fingers trailed across the envelope seeking to find the lineaments of the face of the unknown girl hidden beneath i thought again of newfallen snow and how i once believed i could see the outlines of faces beneath it like the shapes of skulls beneath white skin that was later when i left behind the child i once was and those whom i loved began to fall away you asked me where i found the photograph mr parker i found it in the mailbox of the grady house it was in a torn envelope the envelope had been sealed then opened by someone to get at what was inside judging by the marks on the envelope id guess there was more than one photograph in it originally the shape of the remaining photograph didnt quite match the marks of the bulge in the envelope thats how i knew do you check the mailbox often nope just occasionally i dont go to the house much anymore when did you find the photograph one week ago what did you do i took it to the police why it was a photograph of a little girl placed in the mailbox of a house once owned by a child killer at the very least someone has a sick sense of humor is that what the police think they told me that theyd see what they could do i wanted them to go to the newspapers and the tv people get this little girls picture shown across the state so that we could find out who she is and and warn her he drew a breath and his eyes closed as he nodded and warn her he echoed you think shes in danger because someone put a photo of her in gradys mailbox like i said at the very least the person who put that picture there has a disturbed mind who would even want to link a little girl with that place i slipped the envelope away and looked at the print of the childs picture again was the photograph old mr matheson i dont think so it looked recent to me and the photograph itself was blackandwhite not just the copy that you made thats right anything on the back to indicate that it came from a lab you know any identifying marks brand names it was kodak paper thats all i know that paper could be purchased in any camera store in the country whoever took the photograph had probably developed it in his own home or garage it was simple enough to do with the right equipment that way there was no chance of a curious lab worker spying suspicious photographs of playing children and calling in the cops to investigate the individual behind the camera the child really was beautiful she looked happy and healthy and the intensity of her concentration on the ball about to head her way made me smile what would you like me to do mr matheson i want you to see if you can discover who this girl is i want you to talk to her parents ill come with you when you find them they should know about this thats going to be difficult have you spoken to the police they wont tell me anything except that its under investigation and that i shouldnt worry they said it was probably nothing maybe they were right there were those who might find amusing or arousing the idea of associating a little girls image with the memory of a child killer but their actual potential for harm was likely to be limited and yet someone had gone to the trouble of snapping at least one photograph of an unsuspecting little girl and if matheson was right in his suspicions then there were probably more photos some perhaps of this child but some possibly of other children i was also wondering if you might watch the grady house for a while just in case the person who left this picture comes back wintering at the grady house didnt sound like the best way to get into the christmas spirit i tried not to let my reluctance show but it was hard have you seen any signs of damage to the house i asked any indications that someone might have tried to get inside nope its sealed up good and tight i have a set of keys and the police at two mile have another set i gave it to them after some lunatic tried to get onto the roof and start a fire there a couple of years back i dont know if theyve been inside since i gave them the photograph i touched the picture of the little girl with my fingertips my fingers brushed the image of her hair its kind of an obvious question but have you seen anybody hanging around the property or has anyone displayed excessive interest in what went on there well we had some trouble with a man named ray czabo but the chief warned him off i dont think hes been back since you know him matheson couldnt have missed the pained look that crossed my face voodoo ray czabo was a death tourist from maine a haunter of crime scenes he liked taking pictures of places in which people had died when the cops were finished with their work he would sometimes remove souvenirs from the location and try to hawk them on the net ray czabo and i had history he had visited the house in brooklyn in which my wife and daughter were killed and had stolen from outside the door the carved wooden block upon which the house number was engraved i got it back though since then ray had kept out of my way even though he now lived up in bangor in a small house off exit close by husson college yeah i know ray czabo i said the grady house would appeal to someone like ray i felt pretty certain that hed been down there on more than one occasion he must have found it galling to be denied access to its secrets was ray the only one matheson was holding something back i wasnt sure why perhaps he wanted to be certain that i was going to take the case before he told me but id learned that lesson the hard way now i liked to know what i was getting into before it all began to fall down around my ears there was another man a few days ago he came to the plant you should understand mr parker that very few people know about my ownership of the grady house officially the title is held by a company that shares its address with a particularly litigious firm of lawyers in augusta theyre not even my own lawyers they were sourced independently yet this man arrived at my office and told my secretary he was interested in placing a large order he seemed to know what he was talking about so she called me i was out on the floor at the time and i came back to meet him the first thing that struck me was that he wasnt there to buy anything from my company he was dressed in a threadbare coat there were stains on his trousers and the sole was coming away from his left shoe i couldnt tell the last time his shirt had been properly washed and he wore a dead mans tie dont get me wrong in my business i see a lot of people who work with their hands and im not afraid to get my own hands and clothes dirty but thats i dont know honest dirt hard won and nothing for a man to be ashamed of this guy though he was just plain filthy i almost threw him out of my office before he had a chance to open his mouth maybe i should have what did he look like tall taller than you his hair was black and long it was hanging over his shirt collar it was receding pretty badly and he hadnt shaved in a couple of days his skin was very white dont recall the color of his eyes if thats the kind of detail you need to know his fingertips and nails were stained yellow i guess he was a smoker but he didnt light up while he was with me he give you a name no i introduced myself shook his handalthough i kind of regretted doing itbut he didnt give me a card or a name he just told me he had come about a delicate matter i believe that you are the owner of the grady house i dont know what youre talking about i think that you do there is a debt outstanding upon the house an opportunity is about to arise for its payment i told you i think you have the wrong man i tried to convince him but the guy just didnt want to listen he knew that the grady house belonged to me i dont know how but he did when i checked with the lawyers they told me that there had been no formal inquiries about the house for years apart from a couple of media hounds howling down the phone on the anniversary of gradys death next thing i know hes rattling off details of the purchase the price the date the final agreement was signed even the name of the bank manager at the time it was like he had a file in front of him and was just reading the stuff from it i was so surprised i couldnt even speak for a minute then i started to get angry i mean what business did this guy have coming in to my office and demanding payment for bills that were nothing to do with me anyway it was all that i could do to stop myself climbing over the desk and dragging him out of the office by his collar why didnt you i asked matheson looked like he could still handle himself im not that kind of man he replied but there was an unspoken and hanging in the air i waited it came he didnt look like much thin dirty unhealthy but i got the feeling that he was stronger than he looked i think that if id tried to lay a hand on him he would have hurt me not badly maybe but he would have enjoyed humiliating me there was a malice to him yknow this all probably sounds cockeyed to you but once my anger started to die down i began to get worried scared even i told him it didnt sound cockeyed at all that i had met men like that they wanted you to descend to their level and once you were down there they would try to finish you if you were going to take them on then you had to be prepared to endure some pain and to inflict it back in spades matheson continued so i told him that even if what he said was true he should call up the farmers mutual bank and ask them about it payments owing to him from john grady were no business of mine he didnt seem to agree i am a collector mr matheson i collect debts but i also have an interest in other items in lieu of the debt left outstanding by the previous owner i will accept some small item of furniture from the house it will barely cover my expenses but in this case a token gesture will be sufficient the house contains a number of ornate mirrors if you give one of them to me i will consider you to have discharged any responsibilities you may have in this matter that was exactly how he spoke said matheson he spoke like a damn lawyer well id had enough of him by then so i told him to get the hell out of my office or id call the cops he had any more questions he could discuss them with my legal people or with the farmers mutual but i didnt want to see him again what did he say he didnt move he just looked at his fingernails for a while before he stood said that he was sorry i felt that way and told me that he would deal with the matter through other channels then he left did you get a look at his car there wasnt one he left on foot and he gave you no contact name no number nothing he just told me he was a collector did you talk to the police about this i told chief grass in two mile but he said there were probably a whole lot of debts left unpaid when john grady died he took down the description i gave him but he said there wasnt much that he could do unless the collector came back or used threats did you feel as if he was threatening you in your office he did speak of going through other channels for his payment i suppose it could have been a threat i didnt take it that way and he never mentioned what the debt was or whom he was representing no do you think this man might be the one responsible for placing the photograph in the mailbox its possible but i cant see why he would do it he certainly didnt mention anything to do with pictures matheson asked if i wanted another coffee i said yes if only to give me a little time to think his story about the collector made me uneasy and i didnt particularly want to sit in my car watching an old house night after night waiting for some lowlife in old clothes who got kicks from planting the pictures of children in a dead child murderers mailbox but something about that photograph of the girl was drawing me in i had this much in common with matheson both of us had lost a daughter and neither of us was prepared to stand idly by if another child was potentially in danger looking back i guess i knew i would take the case as soon as he showed me the picture of the little girl with the bat in her hands when he came back i told him my rates he offered to pay me in advance but i explained that id bill him after the first week if i was making no progress after two weeks then id have to leave it to the cops matheson agreed and prepared to depart he left the photograph of the unknown girl with me i made lots of copies he said if you hadnt agreed to do this i was going to post them in stores on telephone poles anywhere they might be seen how many copies did you make i asked two thousand he replied theyre in the trunk of my car you want some i took one hundred of them and left him with the rest i just hoped that we wouldnt have cause to use them iii the house was silent and dark when i returned home rachel was attending a meeting of the friends of the scarborough public library and i didnt expect her back until later i stood at the door for a moment and looked out upon the marshes the great migratory exodus was almost complete and the quiet of the grasses was now relatively undisturbed for much of the day the sounds of the birds that remained with us stood out more clearly than before as a consequence and in recent days i thought i had heard grackles and cowbirds and goldfinches i wondered if there was an added lightness to their calls now triggered by an awareness that the population of raptors was now depleted as some of the hawks and harriers would inevitably have followed their prey south then again the hunters that had stayed would now be competing for a more limited food supply when the snows came hunger would start to gnaw at them the move here following the sale of my grandfathers old house a few miles away was a good one tarnished only by an incident earlier in the year that had led to the drowning of a man out on the marshes rachel didnt like to talk about it and i didnt push her on the subject i wanted very badly for us to be happy here perhaps after all that had gone before i wanted that happiness too much as i opened the door walter our lab retriever emerged guiltily from my little office where i was pretty certain hed been curled up on the couch then tried to divert my attention by covering me with dog spit i briefly considered shouting at him for putting hairs on my favorite resting place then realized from his slightly shameful posture that he already knew he wasnt supposed to be on it and that frankly we both understood that if he hadnt been deep in dog sleep when i arrived he would have been smart enough to make a dash for his basket before i even managed to get my key in the lock instead i contented myself with letting him out into the yard then closing the door behind him while i made a sandwich from cold cuts i put a history of sport fishing the album id bought by thee more shallows on the cd player in the kitchen before sitting down at the table to eat until the sound of walters paw plaintively scratching at the glass caused me to relent and head out onto the porch instead walter had me down pat he knew i couldnt stay mad at him for long pretty soon hed be throwing sticks and id be running to fetch them i fed him about a quarter of my sandwich even as i recalled rachel reading me an article about dog training that said that you shouldnt feed your dog scraps from the table or allow him to jump up and lick you because that made him believe he was the alpha male walter doesnt think hes the alpha male i protested at the time sort of lamely now that i come to think of it i looked to walter for confirmation which probably wasnt the smartest move on my part if i was trying to claim superiority walter hearing his name was looking back and forth between us as if trying to figure out which one of us was going to relent first and just hand over a set of keys and the deed to the house hah was rachels response she has a way of saying hah that pretty much skewers any possible dissent like a skeptical python thats just been told to cough up the rabbit and send it merrily on its way rachel had patted her bump and said i hope youre listening to this thats your daddy talking he thinks hes the alpha male but just shoot googoo eyes at him and hell buy you a car i didnt buy you a car i pointed out and you shot googoo eyes at me all the time i didnt want a car she said i have a car so why did you shoot googoo eyes at me because i wanted something else and what was that i wanted you i thought for a moment you know i said that would be really cute if it wasnt kind of sinister yes she said smiling it would wouldnt it i glanced at my watch rachel would be back soon the house always felt very empty when she wasnt around in the background a track from the album faded out the singer repeating over and over something about the people we choose to leave being the ones whom we see all the time all the time i fed walter my last piece of sandwich just dont let rachel know i did that i told him please the grady house was quiet a breeze stirred the trees and disturbed the pile of dry leaves beneath which the dead wren rested matheson stood at the bottom of the steps leading up to the porch and shined his flashlight upon the house he checked the locks on the doors and the wood that covered the windows there was a sig compact in a holster on his belt he had begun carrying it shortly after the man he now thought of as the collector came to his office and demanded payment of an old debt the sound of approaching footsteps came to him but he did not turn around the beam of a second flashlight joined his own everything okay asked the patrol cop he had seen matheson pull up at the grady house and had offered to accompany him up the dark road matheson had been grateful for the offer i think so said matheson its getting colder yes snow is coming itll make it easier to tell if anyones been snooping around here matheson nodded then turned to go the cop followed him then stopped short he turned his flashlight upon the woods what is it asked matheson i dont know he inched forward his hand already drawing his gun matheson added his own light to the cops and together they scanned the trees suddenly there was the sound of movement in the undergrowth and a gray shape with red underparts darted through the low greenery before disappearing into the shadows both men let out a long relieved breath fox said the cop that wasnt good for my nerves he replaced his pistol and headed back to his car matheson remained staring into the woods for a moment more then followed him they made their farewells and both cars drove away there was silence for a time before the figure of a man detached itself from a bank of pines in the darkest reaches of the woods and approached the grady house he stood at the very edge of the tree line then began circling the building never once straying from the safety of the woods as though the ground beyond them was somehow unsafe to tread upon he made one full circuit of the property then a second slower this time seemingly searching for something that had been lost eventually he stopped as he faced the eastern side of the house he knelt and using a pocketknife commenced digging beneath a small cairn of pebbles that lay almost hidden by grass at the verge of the yard after he had dug about six inches into the earth a pale totem was revealed the skull of a dog symbols and lettering had been carved into the bone the man sat back on his haunches but he did not touch the skull instead he let out a suppressed hiss of anger and disgust carefully making sure that his hands did not come into contact with the dogs remains he replaced the earth upon it then folded the knife and put it back in his pocket in total the collector had counted eight such cairns each representing a compass point it was as he had suspected the house was impregnable he retreated into the forest and then was gone later that night i watched from our bed as rachel undressed in the moonlight she eased the straps of her slip over her shoulders and let it fall to the floor then stared at her reflection in the mirror turning first to one side then the other the moonlight touched the swelling of her belly and cast the shadow of her breasts upon the wall im big she said bigger i ducked my head just in time to avoid being hit by a shoe i look like a whale whales are lovable everybody loves whales except the japanese and the norwegians and im neither come to bed she finished undressing and slipped under the covers then lay awkwardly on her side looking at me did you meet your client yep did you take the job yep want to talk about it not tonight its nothing bad so dont start worrying itll keep until the morning rachel grinned so whatcha wanna do now she said she leaned forward and kissed me lightly on the lips softly i kissed her back its okay she said i cant get pregnant very funny ill even let you be the alpha male i am the alpha male her hand moved slowly down my chest and on to my stomach of course you are darling she whispered of course you are iv the town of two mile lake lay in the middle of hardscrabble land three miles northeast of the towns of bingham and moscow here the kennebec river fed into wyman lake before proceeding on its way toward the coast enlarged further by countless small streams and tributaries this area was part of the bingham purchase named after a philadelphia landowner named william bingham who owned so much of the state at the end of the eighteenth century as to be able to bequeath his heirs sufficient to cover half of massachusetts there was even a territory dam named after him on the kennebec which put him right up there with hoover north of two mile lake up by the confluence of the kennebec and dead rivers lay the forks one of those strange maine places where the past and the present appeared to have reached an uneasy accommodation the forks was still technically a plantationin maine terms an unorganized townshipand had once been the center of a resort area in the nineteenth century now rafters came here attracted by the effect of the harris hydroelectric station on the water flow new inns and stores stood alongside the old marshall hotel with its neon cocktails sign and the stuffed animals in berrys general store from the forks headed north to canada along the arnold trail striking out into the wilderness just like old benedict himself did on his way to quebec at the end of the eighteenth century with jackman as the only decentsized stop along the way two mile lake must have envied some of the comparative prosperity enjoyed by its northern neighbor it wasnt entirely clear how the town had come by its name as there was no body of water worthy of the name closer than wyman lake two mile had a kind of standing pond on the northern edge of town and if you were particularly foolhardy you might take a chance on swimming in it or eating something that came out of it but it was no more than a couple of hundred feet at its widest point instead the only conclusion that anyone could reach about the towns name was that if you headed north from it then youd head right back south again after two miles because there was nothing there to see in essence two mile lake was two miles away from nowhere i followed through kingsbury and mayfield corner then headed up dead water road a ways until i reached the towns southern limits i kept my foot to the pedal and pretty soon i was at the towns northern limits in between i passed a couple of stores a school a pair of churches a police station and the remains of a dead dog i wasnt sure what had killed the dog but boredom seemed like a good guess i parked beside the gray municipal building and headed inside the local cops shared the premises with the town council a fire truck a garbage truck and what looked like a charity store its windows grimly festooned with old mens suits and old womens bingo dresses at the little office inside the door i gave my name to the elderly secretary who looked old enough to remember william bingham in pantaloons then i gave it to her again as shed managed to forget it somewhere between hearing it and looking for a pen with which to write it down behind her an overweight woman with frizzy black hair typed slowly on a computer the expression on her face suggesting that someone had forced her on pain of death to suck repeatedly on a sour lemon they seemed like the kind of women who considered it their sacred duty to be unhappy and regarded anyone with a smile on his face as mired in unimaginable vice i smiled and tried to give the impression that i only engaged in imaginable vices in return the secretary directed me to an uncomfortable plastic chair when i sat on it it teetered to the left forcing me to shift my weight to the right or tumble straight back out the door after a couple of minutes a man appeared in the doorway of the room to my left he wore a brown uniform shirt and neatly pressed brown trousers according to the badge at his breast his name was grass the local stoners probably laughed themselves blue in the face at least until grass got up close and personal with them he was a big man in his fifties and he still looked fit there was no paunch and when he shook my hand i felt one of my knuckles pop his face was deeply tanned making his gray mustache and hair seem all the more startling he should have lost the mustache i thought without it and wearing a hat he could have passed for early forties im wayne grass he said chief of police charlie parker i said im a private investigator i know who you are he said pleased to make your acquaintance i followed grass into his office it was tidy with flowers growing in pots on the windowsill there was a picture of a woman and two children on his desk the woman was very pretty and looked a lot younger than grass the kids a boy and a girl were in their early teens my family he said spotting the direction of my glance recent picture just last year why no reason i said my wife is a little younger than i am if thats what you mean nice work i said grass grinned and reddened he offered me coffee i declined and he settled back into his chair so what can i do for you mr parker ive been hired by a man named frank matheson hes worried about a photograph that he found in the mailbox of a house that he owns its the photograph of a child the house is the old grady house i waited watching the smile on grasss face melt away im disappointed he said at last why would you be disappointed i told frank matheson that id take care of it and i will but im not going to let him scare some little girl and her parents half to death and maybe start a panic among others just because he found a picture in a mailbox you think thats what he wants to do i dont know what he wants but that will be the result we need to tread softly on this thing well circulate the picture see what comes up hell it may not even have been taken in the state that photograph could have come from anywhere but if frank matheson or anyone else goes to the newspapers and the tv stations and starts telling them that this little girls picture was placed in a dead child killers mailbox what do you think is going to happen maybe youll find the girl or maybe well be accused of starting a panic over nothing of overreacting to whats probably just a sick practical joke next thing ive got the media down here showing images of the grady house and then the freaks will start to arrive maybe the whole shitstorm will give one of them an idea and then we really will be looking for an endangered child like i said were going to work at getting the photograph out to local and state law enforcement then school boards we find that little girl then we can just take her parents quietly to one side and tell them what we know which is squat in one way i knew grass was right the whole affair had to be handled delicately and there was no point in frightening a little girl and her family over what might be nothing but i realized that grass was approaching the issue from one perspective and matheson was approaching it from another grass believed that the child probably wasnt in any danger because there was no evidence to suggest otherwise but heightened or perhaps tormented by his own loss mathesons instincts told him that the child was at risk i was stuck in the middle wanting to believe grass but half persuaded by mathesons concerns were there any prints on the envelope none apart from mathesons and we dont suspect him of putting an envelope in his own mailbox and then bringing it to us i agreed that it didnt sound likely mainly in an effort to diffuse what felt like growing tension between us smalltown cops dont like people questioning their decisions even bigcity cops dont like it very much but they tend to be less protective of their patch have you been out to the grady house recently i asked grass we check it pretty regularly the place is locked down tight i was back there after frank matheson found the photograph there was nothing out of the ordinary when you say we we have four officers in total myself included three male one female theyre good people so sometimes one of them will go by there and open up the house well occasionally mostly i do it myself easier that way i dont have to worry about the keys getting lost or someone getting spooked spooked you know what happened in that house its not a place to visit unless you have to its got a bad feel about it and always will have it stinks too something in the paints and pastes that grady used it just seems to get worse and worse after twenty years im used to it it doesnt get to me so much someone else someone new he trailed off we sat like that in silence until i stood and thanked him for his time like i said it was my pleasure but i dont know what more you can do for mr matheson im not sure either i said i think ill just nose around if i find out anything ill let you know id appreciate it if you could see your way clear to doing the same i gave him a card he placed it carefully in his wallet then gave me a card of his own in return from a little dispenser on his desk you going to take a look at the grady house while youre up here he asked i think i will since ive come all this way you want me to go out there with you i believe ill be okay he nodded to himself like a man who feels secure in the conclusion that he has just reached i guess this is the point in the conversation where you tell me that you dont scare easy he said being scared isnt the problem i replied its not running away thats the hard part the grady house was much as i remembered it from the news reports of the time a little more overgrown with ivy perhaps its windows now boarded up and a pair of padlocked steel doors preventing access through either the front or back of the house but these were relatively cosmetic changes the grady house was ugly when it was built even foreboding in its way although i felt certain that this impression was mostly a consequence of my knowledge of its past i circled the house checking the windows and the doors to see if they had been tampered with in any way then returned to the mailbox and gave it a cursory check it was empty apart from some dead insects and a faded flyer offering free soda and fries with every pizza delivery i walked back up to the house and took a set of keys from my pocket frank matheson had given them to me when i agreed to take on the job i unlocked the outer steel door and pulled it open the door behind it had a fan of stained glass dominating its upper third and opened easily to the touch inside the hallway was covered with a coating of dust and cobwebs draped the chandelier in the center of the ceiling there were no bulbs in its sockets to my right i caught my reflection in the mirror on a battered coatrack the sole furnishing in the hallway footsteps had disturbed the dust relatively recently i guessed that grass or matheson had left them when they came to check on the house to my left was what would once have been a receiving room it contained no furniture but an ornamental marble fireplace against the far wall had been left untouched there was another mirror here although its reflection was slightly off i approached it and saw that it was angled toward the covered window a length of shiny new chain led from the back of the mirror to an old nail driven into the plaster maybe the original chain had broken and someone had seen fit to rehang the mirror it seemed like an odd thing to do a pair of sliding doors led into what was probably once the dining room again empty of furnishings apart from a fireplace matching the one in the receiving room and another mirror this time angled to the floor and once again with a new chain there were mirrors too i discovered on the back of the kitchen doorway facing into the hallway in the kitchen itself on the first and second landings of the upper floors and in every bedroom there were mirrors on the walls of the upper floors in the bathroom and even in the attic when i checked it using a rickety stepladder most were old but some looked like more recent additions untainted by the decay of the nitrates i went back downstairs and checked the kitchen and the downstairs bathroom the sink in the kitchen was stained and reeked of stagnant water and rotting matter in the pipes by contrast the sink in the bathroom was comparatively clean nobody would be drinking from it in a hurry but compared to the kitchen sink it was a model of good hygiene someone had wiped it down in recent months or had at least allowed the faucets to run maybe someone had used it to wash up after checking the house because my own hands were already black with dust and filth the only door in the entire house that appeared to be locked was the door leading down into the basement where john grady had made his last stand before shooting himself i tried all of my keys on the lock with no result then made a mental note to ask frank matheson about it when next we spoke a fulllength mirror hung on the basement door i checked my reflection in it i was going kind of gray i thought old age was going to be a gentle slide for me as i turned i felt my head swim a little i had been conscious of a vague chemical scent in the air when i entered the house but now it seemed to have suddenly grown stronger this would be a bad place to stay for any length of time i thought with the windows boarded up and the doors sealed there was no fresh air to dispel whatever miasma hung about the house after only fifteen minutes i was already experiencing the beginnings of a headache i was about to leave when a noise from the front of the house alerted me there was a man on the step his hand on his gun it took a moment for my eyes to distinguish his brown uniform against the afternoon sun he was in his forties and running to seed his stomach bulged over his belt and there were sweat stains beneath his armpits who are you he said instinctively i raised my hands my names charlie parker ive been employed by frank matheson the owner of this house to look into some things i spoke to chief grass earlier today hell vouch for me okay i want you to step outside here he backed away from me his hand still poised on the butt of his gun you got some id i nodded walking slowly toward him my hands still raised its in my jacket pocket outside left i always kept it there at the risk of being pickpocketed it meant that i was never in danger of making a nervy cop or security guard any more nervous than he already was by reaching inside my coat i got to the doorway moved on to the porch then took the three steps down to the yard take your id out said the cop slowly the cop still hadnt drawn his gun i took out my wallet flipped through it to my pis license then let him take a good look at it when he was satisfied he allowed his hand to drift from his weapon for the first time he introduced himself as ed odonnell one of the parttimers from two mile lake chief grass told me youd been asking questions he said i just didnt expect to find you in the house so soon i got the impression the chief would be happier if you didnt spend too much time nosing around in there either why would that be i think hed prefer it if this house was gone its a reminder of the past you go in a lot nah although i met frank matheson here last night when we were both taking a look over the place i saw your car parked down the road as i was passing you seen enough pretty much i said cellar door is locked though you wouldnt know anything about that would you nothing except that its where they found gradys body the other kid he took denny maguire was down there too i suppose its something that grady didnt kill him as well it was chief grass who took him out of the house wrapped up in his jacket he was just a state trooper then a photographer got a snap of them coming out its kind of a famous picture around here since then the chief has always kept an eye on this place its personal for him after what he saw you have any idea what happened to the maguire kid denny sure he works down in moscow at a bar called the desperate measure its over on main he doesnt talk much about what happened that day though no i dont imagine he would i looked back at the house its boardedup windows reminded me of closed eyes on the brink of an awakening you ever see anyone hanging around here he shrugged kids mostly but they tend to stay away from the house itself mostly what you said kids mostly sounds like there might have been others tourists thrill seekers ray czabo couple of times hes harmless what about a guy taller than me thin long dark hair he probably looked kind of dirty odonnell shook his head doesnt ring any bells i thanked him for his time he watched me lock the door then waited until i was in my car and driving away before he followed me from the property the desperate measure was the kind of bar most people wouldnt set a fire in never mind a foot a green shamrock barely stood out from the dirty white of the illuminated sign outside and the bars windows were small beveled panes of blue and orange it was a place where men went to drink and think about hitting other men and where women went to drink and think about hitting men as well inset into the door was a small square of glass barred like the entrance to a keep presumably so those within could check on anyone seeking entry once the door was locked it wasnt clear why they felt the need to check nobody outside could be any more threatening than the people who were drinking inside half the seats at the bar were already taken although it was not yet four in the afternoon the customers were mainly men between their late thirties and late fifties seated alone or in pairs there was no conversation a tv was bolted to the wall at the far end of the bar further anchored in place by a pair of steel rods that partially obscured the edges of the screen it was tuned to a news channel but the sound was down most of the people in the desperate measure looked as if theyd heard just about all the bad news they wanted to hear in their lives a sad lineup of domestic beers stood above the register like deserters waiting for the firing squad with a single dusty bottle of zima bringing up the rear as out of place here as one of the patrons might have been on castro street during gay mardi gras there was a pretty good selection of bourbon a couple of bottles of brandy and one bottle of tia maria that didnt appear to have been touched since the cold war i took a seat at the end of the bar nearest the door two stools away from a man in a lumberjack shirt who kept flicking at the loose fingernail of his middle finger with the end of his thumb each time he did so the nail raised up from the skin barely held in place at the cuticle i wondered if it hurt in another life i might have been tempted to ask but id learned that a man who doesnt care much about idly inflicting pain on himself sometimes considers it a pleasant change to inflict pain on somebody else i figured the nail would come out eventually and then he could start on another finger it would never be the same though theres nothing like losing your first nail the barman made his way down the counter what can i get you you got coffee we got it but you dont want to drink it he indicated a pot of something stewing away on a hot plate it looked as though it might have gone on fire at some point in the past and was currently considering reigniting just to break the monotony oj is fine then he poured my juice into a clean glass and placed it before me im looking for denny maguire i said he around you found him said the barman i tried to keep the surprise from my face my guess was that denny maguire must be in his thirties by now but the guy behind the bar looked twenty years older than that in a way he was the flip side of chief grass if the chief like dorian gray had a bad portrait of himself hidden in the attic then denny maguires appearance gave some indication of what it might look like my names charlie parker i said for the third time that day im a private investigator you need to see some id i asked because when youre in a place like the desperate measure then producing anything that might lead the customers to mistake you for a cop and showing it to the barman was likely to lead to some awkward questions or worse for both of you i believe you he said why would a man lie about something like that i could be doing it to gain the esteem and respect of strangers itll take a little more than a piece of card and some attitude to get that here maybe i should have shot a bear maybe you want to tell me why a private investigator is asking after me i could see that fingernail man had found something to divert his attention from his own decaying fingers so i suggested to maguire that maybe we could talk somewhere away from the bar he agreed and summoned a woman who was reading a magazine at one of the deuces over by the mens room i got five more minutes she said bill me said maguire the woman shook her head in disgust killed her cigarette and made her way slowly to the bar you have to keep them motivated i said motivated its all i can do to keep her moving he made his way along the bar grabbed a soda from the cooler and patted the woman on the ass as he went by im gonna bill you for that an all she said uhhuh said maguire you got change of a dollar asshole maguire took a seat across from me lit up a cigarette and laid its tip beside the stillsmoldering remains of the waitresss butt so ive been hired by a man named frank matheson i said maguire gave me nothing you know who frank matheson is i said i know whats it to me hes concerned that someone with knowledge of the history of the grady house may have gotten some ideas from what happened there in the past hes afraid that the someone in question may have targeted a child like i said whats it to me what happened there took place before my time i got some of it from the newspapers a little more from matheson a little less from the chief over in two mile lake i was hoping you could tell me more because i was there you mean yes because you were there you were there when john grady died maguire waited for a while before answering he watched the woman moving behind the bar joshing sourly with one or two of the regulars who had perked up some now that they were being exposed to a little female company he seemed to take in the grim walls the faded posters on the walls the hole that someone had punched in the door of the mens room you know i own this place he said at last bought it three years ago from a man named gruber he was a german jew never could understand why he had a shamrock on the sign when i asked him he told me that nobody ever lost money on a bar that looked irish didnt matter what happened once you got inside kind of people who come into a place like this theyre not too concerned about decor they want to drink drink some more have one for the road then stagger home and be left to themselves from start to finish so when gruber said he was going to retire i bought it because it suited my disposition i like being left to myself i dont like people asking about my present or my past why do you think id make an exception for you now it was my turn to pause before answering there was a game being played and i think maguire knew it i had come here in part to find out what he could tell me about the grady house because to understand the present you have to understand the past but i also wanted to take a look at him he was the only child to have entered the grady house and survived and i didnt like to think about the kinds of scars that experience had left upon him while those who have been abused in the past or who have suffered in the way that he had do not automatically themselves become abusers it does happen and it was something that needed to be considered i came here to look into your eyes i said maguire met my gaze levelly and what do you see i know what i dont see i dont see a man who has been transformed by his own pain into the very thing that caused that pain to begin with you thought i might have been behind whatever is troubling frank matheson he said it softly but without blame or anger i had to consider it he took a long pull on his cigarette releasing the smoke slowly through his nostrils along with the fumes some of the suspicion seemed to ease from his body what made him hire a private investigator i handed him one of the copies of the photograph the unknown girl caught in her pose ready and waiting for the ball to be released for her chance to strike at it maguire picked it up and examined it for a time do you recognize her i asked no where did it come from matheson found it in the mailbox of the grady house he doesnt know why it was left there he thought that it might be some kind of tribute to john grady maguire was quiet for a long time i knew that at the end of his silence he would either stand up and tell me to leave or open up to me the decision would be his to make and if i spoke before he reached it i felt certain i would get nothing from him an offering said maguire perhaps he used that word you know when i was with him he called the matheson girl that he said she was an offering an offering to what i dont know maybe to whatever he believed made him do the things that he did he talked all the time i was there but only some of it was addressed to me i dont remember so much of it i was too scared to listen while i was conscious and when i came to he was dead ive blanked out most of the rest i didnt do so good in high school so they sent me to a doctor a shrink and he said i needed to confront what happened in that house but i prefer it the way it is hidden locked up just like i was it wasnt for me to comment on how he chose to deal with what he had endured but i had a brief flash of a barred cellar door and inside a small boy was being tormented by john grady over and over again whatever front he presented to the world that was the reality of what was hidden inside denny maguires head he retrieved his cigarette from the ashtray took a drag on it and continued mostly he said he spoke to something that i couldnt see what else do you remember the mirrors there were mirrors on every wall i could see him reflected in them it was like the room was filled with john gradys i remember that and i remember the remains of the other children they were sitting over by the far wall i dont like to recall how they looked he talked to them too sometimes in a way do you recall anything about louise matheson he shook his head i think i heard the shot that killed her but i was pretty far gone by then why did he keep you alive maguire pretended to think about the question but i guessed it was one that had troubled him all his life ever since grass had led him from that terrible place i was the only boy he took he said he spoke to me some told me about himself about the house he wanted to create he hated the little girls but me i was different i still think hed have killed me in the end or maybe just let me fade away and die could be he saw something of himself in me i hope to jesus he was wrong but i think thats what he believed the cigarette had almost burned down to the filter a column of ash toppled like a condemned building and exploded into dust upon the tabletop can you remember anything else that he said i asked he looked at me then stubbed out the cigarette and rose like i told you i dont remember the details i do recall that he didnt talk directly to the other children he said it sounded as if there was dust caught in his throat he talked to their reflections in the mirrors he talked to them like they were inside the mirrors and if those policemen hadnt come then hed have been talking to me that way too id have been lost in there with them and in the gloom of his grim little bar denny maguire began to cry the streets around the desperate measure were quiet as i walked back to the parking lot at the rear of the bar i wasnt sure that i was learning much that i hadnt already suspected john grady was a vile human being and all those who had come into contact with him remained tainted by his touch when i turned the corner i saw a man leaning against the hood of my mustang he was smoking a cigarette in his right hand while the fingers of his left tapped a delicate rhythm against the bodywork i knew who he was even as he watched my approach his eyes lost deep in his domed skull and his lank hair hanging like an afterthought at the back of his head can i help you i said the collector had turned to watch my approach he looked sickly in the yellow glow of the single light that illuminated the lot and appeared to be dressed in the same clothes that he had worn to his interview with matheson i could see the sole of his shoe gaping like a fishs mouth i think you can he said and perhaps i can help you in return i can give you the address of a good tailor i said he might also know someone who can fix your shoe after that youre on your own the collector glanced down as if noticing his ruined sole for the first time well well he said look at that he shot a plume of smoke into the night air it went on for a long time as though he were manufacturing it deep inside his lungs you want to step away from my car the collector considered it for a moment just when it seemed as if id have to drive off with him draped across the hood he tossed his cigarette to the ground and stamped it out with his good shoe then moved a couple of feet away from my car my apologies he said you work for mr matheson i think we have a misunderstanding i said i wasnt offering to exchange information in return for you finding someplace else to rest i stood by the mustang but i didnt take out my keys if i tried to open the car door then i might have to take my eyes off the man in the lot for an instant and i didnt want to do that matheson was right the collectors appearance his greasy hair combined with his filthy clothes was a distraction a ruse to fool the unwary his movements were slow and precise because he chose to make them that way when he wanted to i sensed he could move very quickly indeed and his old coat and tattered trousers concealed strong bones and lean stringy muscles i suspect mr matheson told you about me i didnt reply i wasnt going to reveal anything to him i know about the picture he said everything changed what picture the picture of the little girl do you know who she is he shook his head do you know who took the photograph again he shook his head then youre no use to me go find another dark place to haunt i made a show of fiddling with my keys shes at risk said the collector if you give me what i want some of that risk will diminish i wondered if he had taken the photograph if its placement in the mailbox was all part of his efforts to receive payment for whatever old debt he believed he was owed the collector was smart he was waiting for me when i reached that conclusion but she is not at risk from me he said i have no interest in children i merely want my debt paid i took a couple of steps toward him he didnt appear threatened and what debt is that its a private matter are you working for somebody we all work for somebody mr parker suffice it to say that john grady attempted to secure a certain asset before he died he partially succeeded a token gesture will be enough to undo the damage your client is unwilling to make that gesture the debt is not his to pay he has no obligation to you and even if he had i dont see how paying it diminishes the risk to the girl in the photograph the collector lit another cigarette in the flare of the match his eyes filled with flames this is an old and wicked world john grady was a foul man and the grady house is a foul place such places retain a residue that can pollute others if you help me then some of that pollution may be removed what do you want a mirror from the grady house it has many mirrors one will not be missed why dont you just take one yourself the house is secured not so secure that a man couldnt get into it if he wanted something badly enough i am not a thief said the collector it was more than that for the first time his eyes shifted from mine he was scared of the house no not scared but wary for whatever reason he was unable to enter the house himself i think you need to talk to the lawyers or the bank i said talk to somebody anybody but just dont talk to me again i cant help you as i spoke i opened the car door he remained standing isolated in the middle of the lot watching me i closed the door and put the key in the ignition when i looked up the collector was gone or so i thought until the tapping came at my side window he was close to the glass so close that i could see the lines in his face and the veins running beneath his pale skin it looked too thin as though only the slimmest of membranes concealed the bloody redness beneath i will collect he said remember that i gunned the engine and pulled out so quickly that he was forced to throw himself back against the big toyota in the next space he hung in the rearview mirror like an infected wound in the flesh of the night and then i turned the corner and he disappeared from my sight there was no moon over scarborough as i drove home great swaths of cloud hid the light soon the marshes would flood and a fresh round of feeding and dying would begin i wondered what effect that cycle might have on me and if the water in my own body might somehow be prey to the revolutions of a chunk of dead rock in space perhaps it affected my behavior making me act in odd and unpredictable ways then i thought of rachel and what she might say if i shared those thoughts with her she would tell me that my behavior was odd and unpredictable anyway and that nobody would notice a difference if they tried to make a lunar connection our first child was due and every time my cell phone buzzed i expected to hear rachels voice telling me that it was time i had long given up cosseting her for not only was she fiercely independent but she saw in my actions an attempt to guard against the loss of another child my daughter and my wife had been stolen from me only a few years before i was not sure that i could live if another was taken from me sometimes that made me overprotective of those i now held dear i stopped my car before entering the driveway to our home i thought of matheson and his wife how did they see themselves now i wondered was one still a father a mother when ones child was dead a wife who has lost her husband becomes a widow and a husband bereaved of his wife a widower but there was no name for what one became when ones only child was wrenched from this world but perhaps it didnt matter in my own mind i was still her father and she was still my child and regardless of the world in which she now dwelt that would always be i could not forget her and i knew that she had not forgotten me for she came to me still in the lost time in the pale hours in those moments between waking and sleeping when the world was still forming around me she was there sometimes her mother was with her cloaked in shadows a reminder of my duty to them and to those like them i used to dream of being at peace of no longer experiencing these visions now i know that it is not meant for me not now and that my peace will only come when i close my eyes and at last take my place beside them in the darkness rachel was lying on the couch reading her hand resting on her belly and her long red hair descending in a braid across her left shoulder i kissed her forehead then her lips she placed my hand alongside hers so that i could feel the child within you think the kid is planning to leave anytime soon i asked if the baby stays there any longer we can start charging rent get used to saying that she said youll be asking the same question until our child goes to college anyway im the one who has to carry another person around inside me its about time you started shouldering some of the burden i went to the kitchen and took a soda from the fridge yeah what about all the ice cream i have to keep bringing home it doesnt float here on its own i heard that i stood at the kitchen door and waved a carton of len libbys orange sherbet at her tempted huh do we want a little spoonful for the road she threw a cushion at me how i ever allowed you to get close enough to impregnate me i really dont know i guess it was a moment of weakness literally a moment in your case harsh i said youre not including cuddling time i sat down beside her and she folded herself into me as best she could i shared my soda with her despite her hurtful comments about my alleged lack of stamina so how did it go she asked i told her about my day the cops the grady house my conversation with maguire none of it added up to very much rachel had spent some time going through the files matheson had left with me now that the birth was imminent she was not taking on any new academic or professional work and consequently the grady case offered her an opportunity to stretch some underused psychologists muscles mirrors said rachel conversations with an unseen other a display of victims yet without any real interaction no actual sexual or physical abuse of the children beyond the final act of taking their lives even then he seemed determined to put them through as little pain as possible a single blow to the head to render them unconscious then suffocation then theres the house i said he had great plans for it yet never did much to improve it from what i can see all he did was start wallpapering and put too many mirrors on the walls and what do you think he saw in them asked rachel he saw himself what does anyone see in a mirror she pursed her lips and shrugged do you see yourself when you look in a mirror i had the feeling that i often got with rachel that she had somehow moved three steps ahead of me while i was being distracted by a passing cloud i i stopped as i tried to consider the question properly well i said at last i see a version of myself your reflection is informed by your own selfimage in effect you create part of what you see we are not as we are we are as we imagine ourselves to be so what did john grady see when he looked in the mirror i saw again the house i saw its unfinished walls its filthy sinks its decaying carpets i saw the cheap sticks of furniture the empty bedrooms the warped boards and i saw the mirrors he saw his house i said he saw his house as he wished it to be or as he believed it to be in another place in the world beyond the glass and maybe that world was more real to him than this one so if the house was more real in that world then then so was he perhaps thats who he was talking to while he was waiting to kill denny maguire maybe he was talking to john grady or what he perceived to be the real john grady and the children what did denny maguire say that he never spoke directly to them he said that grady spoke to their reflections in the glass rachel shrugged i dont know ive never heard anything quite like that before she moved in closer to me you will be careful wont you she asked hes dead i said theres a limit to the harm dead men can do in the grady house something stirred dust was raised in ascending spirals papers rustled in empty grates it was the north wind whistling through rotting frames and broken boards that created the sense of movement in the silent rooms it was the north wind that made doorknobs rattle and doors creak it was the north wind that caused coat hangers to jangle against one another in locked closets and dirty glasses to clink in closed kitchen cupboards and it was the north wind that made the trees move creating faint shadows that fell through cracks in the boarded windows their shapes drifting across the old mirror above the fireplace in the dining room the world reflected in its depths subtly different from our own the shape moving within it finding no companion in the old house there should have been photographs on the mantel for there were photographs in its reflection in the glass instead the mantel within the house itself was empty it was the wind then that had carried these blackandwhite images of unknown children through the glass and into another world it was the wind just the wind v surveillance is difficult work even the worst doughnut head the kind of guy who wore a hockey helmet to school in case he fell over is going to catch someone whos watching him regularly for any length of time the cops are lucky its harder for a suspect to spot a handful of people on his tail than just one and cops can split the job up between them give one another a break and generally help the other guy to remain on alert throughout because surveillance as well as being difficult is also tedious and the mind tends to wander a good surveillance detail therefore requires a lot of manpower which is why even the cops tend to sit on their hands some when the subject comes up taking two or more cops off regular duties to watch some jerk who may or may not be worthy of the attention has a knockon effect on morale overtime and probably crime in general private investigators generally dont have the luxury of surveillance teams and their clients arent always so wealthy that they can afford to hire a whole bunch of operatives to cover a job so checking up on someone can be difficult work the grady house detail was different the house wasnt about to go anywhere or attempt to make a break for freedom through the woods nevertheless watching it continuously was going to be a problem which meant that someone would have to be found to share the burden to be done well even a simple task like monitoring an empty old house required someone with patience selfdiscipline a steady nerve and an eye for detail someone who didnt spook easily and who would know how to handle himself if anything went down in the absence of such an individual i needed someone with a lot of time on his hands i knew just the person surveillance huh said angel angel and his partner louis were the closest thing to real friends that i had admittedly they were morally suspect and angel had the kind of temperament that might have been helped by a little pharmaceutical intervention but then i couldnt claim to be perfect either most men end up with the friends that they deserve but i figured that i could probably get away with a lot during the rest of my life and still have some cause for complaint about the ones that id been handed most of the time they lived together in an apartment on the upper west side where louiss natural tendency toward order and minimalism fought a valiant but losing battle against his partners fascination with clutter and bargain clothing it was all very yin and yang but when i offered that theory to angel he pretended that i was talking about siamese twins and regaled me with anecdotes of a sexually fascinating if politically incorrect nature when i shared a similar view with louis he threatened to send angel to stay with me just to see how long rachel and i would tolerate a little of angels yang given that rachel sometimes made louis look like a slob i imagined that wouldnt be very long i could hear music playing in the background as angel and i spoke it sounded terrible what the hell are you listening to a progressive rock compilation im trying to get in touch with my muse by listening to music from my past i was almost afraid to ask almost you have a muse what is she some kind of community service muse did the court order her to help you angel chose to ignore me im considering writing my memoirs i mean im gonna have to change some shit around maybe alter names to protect the guilty play with dates and timescales and stuff i bought a book one of those how to write a bestseller guides theres some good advice in there guy who wrote it is a bestselling writer himself knows what hes talking about you ever hear of the guy who wrote it there was a pause nope least not until i bought his book so why do you think hes a bestselling writer if you havent heard of him theres a lot of people i havent heard of doesnt mean to say that theyre not what they say they are says on the cover hes a bestselling writer so whats he written there came the sound of pages being flipped in a thin overpriced book hes written yep hey im looking hes writtenokay hes written a bestselling book on how to write bestsellers that what you wanted to hear happy now i heard the sound of a book being cast to one side with some force still i figured hed retrieve it as soon as i hung up the phone but he probably wouldnt get much further on his memoirs than the first chapter i certainly hoped that he wouldnt this surveillance thing you want me to do its on a house uhhuh an empty house yes what did the house do spy on its neighbors i suspect it of stealing underwear from clotheslines knew a guy who did that once hed steal them clean them fold them then deliver them back to the house with a note describing all the work that hed done with some care tips for the owners he told the judge he was worried about hygiene judge advised the prison governor to let him work in the laundry we had the cleanest overalls in the state starchy too angel had spent too long in prisons a lot of hard time he rarely spoke about them and it was rarer still that he joked about them it meant that he was happy in his life for the moment and for that i was grateful he had endured a lot in recent months thats a nice story you about done doesnt sound like a job looking at an empty house has too many prospects if you turn out to be good at it well promote you to a job watching occupied houses look no offense meant but youve burgled enough properties you must have some experience of watching them nice you call me up ask for my help and now you insult me got any other skeletons from my past you want to throw in my face it would be like emptying a crypt i dont have that kind of time how much does this job pay a dollar a day and all the peanuts you can eat salted or roasted salted sounds good when can i start and hey can i bring a friend my next call was to clem ruddock clem retired from the state police a couple of years back and like some cops do bought himself a bar in a place where the temperature never dipped below seventy in winter unfortunately for clem he was living testament to my belief that some people are just born to die in maine he never quite settled in boca so he sold a half share in the bar to an excop from coral gables and headed back north now he divided his time between florida and a duplex in damariscotta near his daughter and his grandchildren clems answering machine told me that he wasnt home but left me with a cell phone number to try instead what are you a surgeon i asked him when i eventually got through to him what does a retired guy need a cell phone for anyway he was driving i could hear the purr of his engine in the background i guess you didnt hear said clem i took up pimping to make ends meet got me some girls in a trailer off im thinking about franchising you got some money to spare im sorry my moneys all tied up in monkey porn its a growing market you got time to talk as it turned out clem was on his way down to portland to meet with his lawyer sometimes things work out that way i arranged to meet him for a hamburger lunch in rosies down in the old port he told me i was cheap i told him that he was paying so i was even cheaper than that after all i wasnt the one with two homes and a bar in florida rachel was sitting at the kitchen table flicking through a magazine and nibbling on a bagel walter was waiting midway between his basket and rachel clearly keen to try his luck at scamming some food from her plate but reluctant to risk being shouted at for his trouble when i came in he seemed to decide that the balance had suddenly tipped in his favor and used sniffing my hand as a pretext to close in on the table youve been feeding him scraps again said rachel without looking up what did you do shine a light on him until he broke down and confessed were sending out mixed signals its confusing him hes just confused by why you dont love him as much as i do i said oooh thats low is that how you plan to earn the love of your child with bribery and treats start as you mean to continue it worked with the dog and with you i leaned over and kissed her on the lips i have to go i said ill be back for dinner and ill keep the cell on her eyes drifted toward the inside of my jacket the butt of the gun was just visible to her but she made no comment just be careful she said and returned to her magazine as i left the house i looked back and saw her slip a piece of bagel into walters mouth he rested his head on her lap in return and she stroked him gently her eyes no longer on her reading but staring through the kitchen window at the marshes and the trees beyond as though the glass had turned to water and she could see once again the face of the drowning man beneath its surface the collector was looking for ray czabo the name had come up in the course of the collectors own investigation into the grady house and he was anxious to talk to the man in question he made no moral judgments on voodoo rays gruesome hobby in his experience human beings were capable of far worse than stealing mementos from crime scenes what interested him was the possibility that ray had found a way into the house and that perhaps he had managed to secure a trinket for himself in the process if it was the right kind of souvenir then the collectors work would be done but ray czabo was proving difficult to find and there was now a stranger in his house the collector usually believed in adopting the direct approach but the young man who appeared to be servicing mrs czabo in her husbands absence looked troublesome more to the point the collector had discovered that this was a case of like father like son and that mrs czabos lover enjoyed the protection of a small but efficient criminal operation the collector had been careless assuming that his old car and his rundown appearance would allow him to pass unnoticed unless he chose otherwise he was beginning to wonder if mrs czabo might have conspired with her boyfriend to remove her husband from the scene whether through threats or actual violence he was thinking this over as he returned to his car having followed the lover back to his fathers base when a man emerged from behind a dumpster and blocked his progress you want to tell me what youre doin said the man he was slightly overweight and wore a black leather jacket and blue jeans his face bulged in all the wrong places as though every bone had been broken and then badly reset his name was chris tierney and he had a reputation as a hard man an enforcer the collector had no time for this he tried to slip by but tierney pushed him back advancing a step as he did so i asked you a question he said the collector remained silent fuck you said the man finally youre coming with me he moved in on the slim greasylooking individual with the yellowed fingers this stick figure dressed in rags who had tried to bulldoze his way past him but instead of backing away the raggedy man moved forward to meet him tierney felt an impact at his chest and his body was raised up until only the tips of his toes remained on the ground he curled over his attackers hand as the shock of the blow began to dissipate only to be replaced by a sharp pain tierney tried to speak and blood ran from his mouth and flowed over his lips and chin his fingers clutched at the collectors hand and found the hilt of the knife he tried to say something although there was nothing to be said the collector touched his left hand to the dying mans lips shhh he said hush its all right nearly there now nearly there the knife thrust hard once more and the life left tierney in a rush of air and blood clem hadnt changed since last i saw him his hair had turned white while he was in his thirties so he appeared not to have aged much apart from the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth he still had the remnant of a tan from his most recent trip south and hed lost a little weight you look good i said i eat healthy when i have no other option he said then ordered a cheeseburger with extra fries hold the mayo its the mayo that kills you he added clem was one of a network of cops who had remained friends with my grandfather after he left the force and who had extended their goodwill to his grandson back in manhattan there were cops who would cross the street to avoid me even if that street was mined up here there were other older loyalties to be considered we spoke about nothing in particular until after we had eaten then sat back in our chairs by the window and watched the cars and people passing by nobody seemed in too much of a hurry to get anywhere and it was still early enough in december for the prospect of christmas to seem more welcome than stressful you remember john grady i said at last it struck me that i hated saying his name it seemed to pollute the very air seeping out through the window frame to poison the festive atmosphere outside john grady said clem he took a mouthful of beer then held it for a time as though using it to wash the mention of grady from his mouth you have a habit of resurrecting old ghosts he said i think you have a morbid interest in dead killers well some of them didnt turn out to be quite as dead as people believed you do seem to enjoy a gift for waking them thats for sure john grady though hes not coming back i watched him die you were there i knew clem had been involved in the investigation but not that hed witnessed gradys final moments when the little matheson girl was taken we got the first halfdecent lead in months it was a foolish thing for him to have done pulling her like that but i guess by then he couldnt control his appetites anymore we got to the house but it was too late for her he took another sip of beer and looked beyond me to where his own reflection lay suspended in the window that one stays with me i cant remember more than a handful of cases in twentyfive years that make me want to break my fist against a wall but thats one of them too many if onlys if only wed been quicker to make the connection with gradys car if only wed been able to break that door down if only anyway we got there and found grady with the gun already pointed at his head if it wasnt so horrible it might almost have been funny after all there we were with our guns pointed at him threatening to shoot and there he was with a gun in his hand ready to blow his own head off and save us the trouble only one way it was going to end i guess i remember what he said before he died this is not a house this is a home still dont know what he meant by that the place looked less like a home than anywhere ive ever been sticks of furniture halfpainted walls cheap wallpaper already starting to peel there was dust and filth and damn mirrors on every wall those mirrors they completely threw me it seemed like there was movement everywhere our reflections the reflections of our reflections ive never been so jumpy in all my life i was pretty close to grady when he pulled the trigger i recall his face and his eyes you know what he did was beyond belief as terrible a thing as ive seen in all my life but he was a tormented man i could see it on him his skin was covered with some kind of rash there were sores all over his mouth and his eyelids were swollen and puffy he was just this haunted sick creature i was the closest man to him i saw myself reflected in his eyes and i swear i knew what he was about to do and i wanted to stop him not because i cared if he lived or died but because i had this feeling that if he died at that moment then somehow hed take a part of me with him because i was trapped in his gaze makes no sense does it i was so wired at the time so freaked out by all those mirrors that the fear just kind of hit me i didnt think it through suddenly it was just there anyway he kind of looked to his right and saw his reflection in the mirror and his face changed he looked almost relieved then he pulled the trigger and the mirror just disappeared in a shower of blood and glass that was it for him we found the bodies with him in the basement and the little maguire kid who was drifting in and out of consciousness the best thing that can be said about what happened to those kids is that the me figured they died quickly but this is children were talking about jesus what are we reduced to when we have to console ourselves with the idea of a fast end to their sufferings he raised his bottle for another beer i was on coffee i dont drink much anymore i dont have the taste for it i cant believe all that stuff just came out said clem strange what you keep inside almost without knowing i thought of denny maguire carried from the house in the arms of a policeman wrapped in a strangers coat i got the feeling that he probably hadnt slept well after he closed up the bar on the night that we spoke then again i guessed denny maguire had rarely slept peacefully since the day john grady stole him from his family and brought him to that house he had kept it all inside too and it had turned him into an old man before his time clems beer arrived but he didnt touch it i just told you all that and i dont even know why youre asking about him i briefed him on matheson and the photograph of the little girl children he said quietly its always children with you i didnt respond i didnt want to some cops they have a thing he continued cases of one kind just seem to come their way more than others they dont go looking for them they just kind of happen upon them with some its domestics others its rapes they develop a way of looking at them thats different from the rest and then its like they attract them with you i guess its children must be hard for you after what happened sometimes i said you believe in god i dont know if he exists then i dont understand what hes doing if he doesnt exist then were lost i look around i think about men like grady and what he did and i wonder sometimes if theres anybody beyond this who really cares and then its like the fog clears for a couple of seconds and i see a pattern no not even a pattern just the possibility of one you see the hand of god he laughed and tapped his cheekbone with his finger cops eyes i see his fingerprints i see patterns on the glass you get older you start thinking about these things if there is a god then you and he are going to be having a serious talk in the near future so you start thinking about what you might say mostly you figure youre going to be saying sorry a lot clem seemed to remember what he was doing here im rambling you say grass is looking into this thing hes skeptical he says he wants to be discreet in case he freaks out some family for no good reason or starts a panic among parents grass is a straight arrow he was a young man when the grady thing happened but like me he was there at the end i dont think it will ever leave him from what i hear he takes his stewardship of the place pretty personally he doesnt want to remind people of what happened there and i suppose hes right to take that view next thing you know its on a death trip tourist trail or somebody takes it into his head to torch the place no bad thing if you ask me i dont understood why matheson wanted to keep the house to begin with but like i said the grady house is now grasss patch hes taken on the burden of it i wondered if clem was right grass denny maguire even clem himselfall seemed to carry with them some remnant of what had taken place in the grady house like a splinter in the soul perhaps wiping it from the earth would help to bring some relief to them and to all those whose lives had been touched by john grady even matheson must have begun to reconsider his urge to preserve it as a monument now that it had found a way to extend its reach into an unknown girls life anything else you can tell me i asked theres not much more to tell he said grady was a blank slate i dont even know if that was his real name his fingerprints werent on record and nobody came forward after his death to claim his body he cost the state a funeral and a cheap cross he pushed the bottle of beer away from him dont know why i ordered this i drink more than one bottle in the afternoon and im napping for the rest of the day im already finding it hard to think of details that might be helpful to you i suppose the only thing i can add is that we took some material from the housebooks mostlythat was kind of odd odd how it was woowoo stuff you know witchcraft d√¶mons pictures of those star things pentagrams yeah trust you to know the name for them it wasnt lowend stuff either some of those books were pretty old i hear they made some money for the widows and orphans when they were sold they were sold off well there was no reason to hold on to them in the first place since grady was dead and it wasnt like there was going to be a trial or anything someone put them to one side and forgot about them and they lay around in a basement for twenty years then there was that big clearout last fall i went over to take a look just in case there was anything worth holding on to as a souvenir those books turned up and someone decided to get a valuation on them the word went out to some of the dealers in the state and literally the next day a guy showed up to take a look at them he offered a thousand dollars for the lot and walked out with them five minutes later do you know who bought them i can find out for you right now if you want he took out his cell and tapped in a phone number see i did have a use for this after all he said as his call was answered hi can you put me through to detective brian harrison please i didnt know harrison he came on the line and he and clem exchanged greetings for a while and caught up on news of mutual friends eventually clem asked him about the sale of the grady books after a lot of uhhuhs he thanked harrison promised to meet him for a drink then hung up wouldnt you know it he said there had to be a woowoo angle the guy who bought the books claimed to be working for bowe amp heinrich he said he was milton bowes nephew bowe amp heinrich was a wellknown firm of rarebook dealers based in bangor let me guess i said bowe amp heinrich never heard of him milton bowe arrived at state police headquarters a day later to take a look at the books himself but they were already gone by then he was pretty pissed at what happened he didnt like the idea of some weirdo impersonating his nephew or stealing books from under his nose weirdo he looked like a tramp some of these collector types do i hear they spend more money on books and antiques than they do on clothes this guy had an old coat and a shoe that was speaking to him he paid in cash though ten hundreddollar bills which was probably more than bowe would have paid the cheap bastard if this guy committed a crime it was a victimless one i didnt need to ask clem any more about the buyer i knew who he was you decided how youre going to handle this thing clem asked i gave a noncommittal reply i wasnt sure yet what i could do other than dig up old memories and watch as the dust they raised settled itself on the grady house well you need help you let me know said clem we stood to leave i picked up the check despite ribbing clem earlier about his wealth its taken care of he said i left my credit card behind the bar you didnt have to do that hey it was good to see you i dont get to talk to someone thirty years younger than me so often now makes me feel like less of an old fart the weather had turned chill my breath hung like an unfulfilled promise in the afternoon air have you ever been back to the grady house i asked clem as we walked to our cars nope no cause to go there even if i had to go back i wouldnt stay too long theres something unhealthy in the atmosphere of the place youve been there you know what im talking about i didnt know better id say that there were chemicals in the walls and the floors in the days after grady killed himself most of the men who spent time in the house complained of nausea and vomiting i had headaches for weeks afterward that was more than twenty years ago it could be that its not as strong now but i dont doubt that its still there his words brought back my own disorientation after spending a little time in the grady house clem was right whatever had infected the house was still present engaged in a process of slow decay like the halflife of radioactive waste we parted on commercial clem gripped my hand tightly in both of his no if onlys he said remember that dont let anything happen to that little girl there are too many lost children you know that better than anyone else there are just too many lost children vi i drove up to bangor that afternoon voodoo ray czabo and his wife had moved back up to maine so that she could be closer to her mother which proved that not only was ray kind of unpleasant he was also dumb as well when a woman like edna czabo says she wants to be closer to her mother then you might as well start packing your bags and looking for a bachelor apartment because no good can come of it the talk was that ray czabos marriage was on the rocks ray was a skinny guy who dressed neatly smelled nice and could be superficially charming when the necessity arose but his fascination with suffering and the vicarious pleasureand actual profithe derived from it left him a couple of rungs below blowflies on the moral ladder id never had the joy of making mrs czabos acquaintance but from what i heard she made ray seem like good company there were two vehicles in the driveway a sensible nissan and a soupedup firebird when i pulled up outside the czabos nondescript singlestory house surrounded by similarly anonymous houses with marginally newer paintwork the grass in the yard was patchy and unkempt and the trees and bushes that bordered their property hadnt been pruned that year light was already fading as i walked up to the door and pressed the buzzer after a couple of minutes the door was opened by a woman in a pale blue bathrobe her feet were bare her hair was tousled and she had the smoking butt of a cigarette in her hand i picked out the remains of lipstick at the corners of her mouth and her chin and cheeks were red and irritated mrs czabo i said thats me she finished the cigarette seemed to look for somewhere to put it out then contented herself with tossing it onto the step by my feet i stamped it out for her i was looking for your husband who are you i showed her my license my names charlie parker im a private yeah i know all about you you broke rays nose i didnt break his nose he ran into a wall he ran into a wall because he was running away from you i conceded the point i still need to talk to him whats he done now dug up a corpse i just have some questions for him hes not in any trouble yeah well ray dont live here no more he moved out a couple of months ago you know where he is she picked at something between her teeth her fingers emerged clutching a short hair i tried not to think of its possible origins he does his thing i do mine i dont pay no heed to his business i heard a toilet flush in the house and a man appeared in the hallway with a towel wrapped around his waist he was younger than mrs czabo by a decade which made him about my age but he looked bulkier and stronger than i was he glanced at me then asked her if everything was okay ill holler if i need you she said her tone made it clear that it would be a sorry day when she needed his help i just want an address i said she shook her head cocksucker she said you hear me her voice was low and i could smell the staleness on her breath ray said you were a cocksucker and he was right thats all you are so why dont you just get the fuck out of here and leave us all in peace gee i said youre a nice lady she made a gesture using her tongue and her right hand just in case i wasnt clear on what being a cocksucker entailed then closed the door in my face my cell phone rang as i walked down edna czabos garden path i didnt recognize the number on the caller display it turned out to be denny maguire can you talk he asked i leaned against my car and looked at the czabo house a drape twitched in one of the front windows sure i said look this could be nothing you asked me if i remembered anything that grady said while i was in that basement like i told you i was pretty out of it before they rescued me so most of its a blur but i do recall him telling me that he was afraid afraid of what he said that he was going to be punished for what hed done to those kids and for what he was going to do to me eventually i guess he said that he was damned but that he wouldnt go without a fight he told me that hed taken precautions i didnt know what he meant i thought later that he was talking about the way hed reinforced the basement door but now im not so sure the drape twitched again in the front window this time with a little more force there was always black paint on his hands denny continued and he was hanging paper and working on the house all of the time i remember that most of the walls had been covered while i was kept in the basement because hed nearly finished the job when the police came for him there were other things odd things during the first days there was a pile of bones in the corner of the basement he told me that they came from dogs later he took them away and buried them he told you this yeah his hands were dirty and he must have seen me looking at them he said that hed been working in his yard burying the bones that was when he first began talking about the precautions he was taking and about how he wasnt going to be pulled from his home without a fight the front door of the czabo house opened and the bulky young man appeared on the step he was now dressed in baggy jeans and a hooded sweat top there were scuffed sneakers on his feet i dont know if any of that is helpful said denny it may be i said listen denny i have to go but thanks for that ill let you know how things work out i killed the connection just as the man i took to be edna czabos lover reached the end of the path who were you talking to he asked his voice was a little high and softer than id expected your mother i replied she says youre to come home and stop screwing around with other mens wives oh and she wants you to pick up some milk along the way he didnt look too pleased at the reply but he didnt make a move either although i could see his hands almost involuntarily tense into fists he was probably smarter than he looked which made me wonder what he was doing with edna czabo why are you looking for ray he asked i have some questions for him ray doesnt come around here much did you scare him away its all over between him and edna he moved out so she told me do you know where he is edna says hes in bangor someplace i dont know where thats not very helpful i said so if you didnt come out here to help why did you come out his head jerked back slightly in the direction of the house and the woman within did she send you out to frighten me i asked he had the decency to look embarrassed we just dont want any trouble i dont want any trouble i sized him up a man who says he doesnt want trouble has usually experienced trouble before and has a pretty good expectation of experiencing it again if ray czabo had done something wrong then i could just be the first of any number of people who might come knocking on his wifes door the cops among them you got a name i said tillman he said casey tillman anything to gunnar tillman he nodded hes my old man i thought i saw a resemblance gunnar tillman was bad news the kind of minorleague hood that places like bangor threw up occasionally like a piece of rotten fish he was involved in drugs prostitution and maybe a little smuggling of immigrants across the canadian border if the stories were to be believed i could understand now why his son didnt want the cops sniffing around his affairs you see much of him i asked as little as i can i didnt know if that was true from what id heard of gunnar tillman he made the decisions on the extent of his involvement in peoples lives it seemed unlikely that hed accept any form of rejection from his own son i handed casey tillman my card you think of anything or if you hear from ray let me know i wasnt lying to you rays not in any trouble that i know of but i do need to talk to him if youre being straight with me then i wont say anything about you to the cops unless circumstances change and theres no way to avoid it tillman slipped the card into a pocket of his jeans nice car he said pointing with his chin at my mustang i run an auto shop in orono you ever need some work done you give me a call its under my name in the book with that he turned and walked back to the house edna czabo met him at the door i wondered if we should have staged a fight just for appearances sake i settled for trying to look shaken she seemed happy with that but shot me another orally suggestive gesture before she slammed the door just in case id forgotten my place i got ray czabos new address from a detective named jeff weis over in the bangor pd ray had a habit of leaving his business cards around in the hope that someone might give him a call if something juicy came up they rarely did as most maine cops regarded voodoo ray as low enough to ride a rat but you had to admire his capacity for optimism since his separation he had been living in a firstfloor apartment over by the bangor municipal golf course it was the kind of place where kids rode bicycles down the hallways and there was a constant smell of burnt fat in the air there was no reply when i rang his doorbell so i headed around to the front of the building and peered in through his window i saw a tv some truecrime magazines on a coffee table and stacks of cardboard boxes filled with files some of the top boxes had been overturned and their contents left on the floor that wasnt like ray czabo he was a meticulous man i knew that from my own personal encounter with him when i had forced him to hand over the souvenir he had taken from my house his nose still bleeding upon the floor there had been nothing out of place in his office then everything was clean and dusted the top window was open to allow a little air in i looked around to make sure nobody was watching then slipped on my gloves and hoisted myself up onto the sill i reached in to open the latch on the main window then entered voodoo rays apartment it was cold inside the bed in the apartments sole bedroom was neatly made and the kitchen was tidy apart from a cup soaking in the sink the dishcloth on the rack was bone dry and so was the towel hanging on the back of the bathroom door maybe ray didnt take a lot of showers or maybe he hadnt been home in a while i examined the papers on the floor they were mostly reports of serious crimes clipped from newspapers and magazines some of them with handwritten pages of notes appended by ray one or two of the cases were familiar to me most being out of state were not apart from the disordered files there was nothing suspicious about rays apartment i closed the window and went to the front door to let myself out my foot hit something light which spun across the carpet and bounced against the wall i picked up the black plastic case from the floor it was an empty film canister papers spilled on the floor and a film canister by the door they were small things and could be dismissed as the carelessness of a man in a hurry if it was rays doing then i wondered why he had been in such a rush to leave and if the photographs he had taken included one of a little girl with a baseball bat in her hand i hadnt seen any developing equipment in rays closet but that didnt mean that he wasnt responsible for the picture the other possibility was that someone had searched rays house before me and that among the items that person had removed was at least one roll of film i left the apartment closing the door gently behind me then stuck my card underneath it in case ray came back i still had questions i wanted to ask him about the grady house as i stood the door across from rays opened and an elderly man in a clean blue shirt peered out from across a security chain ill call the police he said why i said he squinted at me you shouldnt be in there thats mr czabos apartment i had to admire the old guy there were few neighbors in this kind of place with the courage to stand up for those around them i showed him my id im a private investigator i got no reply from inside so i thought id leave my card for ray the old man gestured with his hand i handed him my wallet he looked at it for a time pursed his lips while he considered its authenticity then handed it back to me i guess youre straight he said thanks i said have you seen mr czabo around lately the old guy shook his head not for a while last time i saw him it was when he had the trouble trouble two men came a little fella and a big fella the little fella was older but younger than me they shouted some at mr czabo then went outside and kicked in the side of his car i was going to call the police then as well but mr czabo told me not to he said it was a misunderstanding when was this a while back could have been three weeks maybe more do you remember anything else about the men involved the older one was small with white curly hair and too many gold chains for a man his age the other one was just huge no neck looked like a throwback to the cavemen the older man sounded like gunnar tillman i figured his companion for the hired help i thanked voodoo rays neighbor again well he said as his door began to close i give a damn this place will go to shit if people dont look out for each other youre a dying breed i said maybe but im not dead yet he replied and then he closed the door a few minutes from rays place was a strip mall anchored by a large drugstore it was a slim chance but i pulled into the lot and parked outside the store the photo desk was beside the registers staffed by a boredlooking teenager in a bright yellow polo shirt hi i said i think my wife left some photos in here maybe a week ago we cant find the receipt but wed really like our pictures you sure she left them in here i did my best impression of a frustrated husband she thinks this is where she left them to be developed shes distracted at the moment were expecting our first baby i wasnt sure which was worse lying or embellishing the lie with the truth the photo guy didnt seem to care much either way whats the name he said czabo he flicked wearily through the envelopes behind the counter about halfway through he stopped and removed two of them from the cabinet czabo he said two rolls he didnt ask for id i thanked him and paid for the pictures then walked out of the store feeling like a spy i opened the envelopes in the car one batch of photographs contained pictures of rays buddies in a bar a couple of empty landscapes that might have been a crime scene or an attempt by ray to get in touch with nature and two photos of some damage to the wing of a green car that was probably rays i guessed it was the result of gunnar and his goon kicking in the wing the damage didnt look too serious and the pictures were probably for insurance purposes the second set of photographs began with five scenes of rays house the one currently occupied by his wife and her toy boy casey tillman was in each of the pictures mostly getting into or out of his car or greeting edna czabo with a kiss and an embrace it looked like ray wasnt as happy about staying out of his wifes affairs as she appeared to be about staying out of his casey was also in two more photographs this time taken outside the garage that bore his name there were two other men in the pictures with him one looked like the missing link assuming the missing link had learned to tie its own shoelaces the other was gunnar tillman he was much smaller than his son and any weight he was carrying was still more muscle than fat his hair was white and curly and contrasted nicely with his winter tan he was wearing a golf sweater and shiny sweat pants gold jewelry glittered in the sunlight at his wrist and around his neck gunnar tillman clearly shopped at hoodsrus it wasnt a good idea for ray czabo to be shooting clandestine photographs of tillman but maybe he hoped to win back his wife by showing her that her lover hadnt entirely cut off relations with his criminal father somehow i felt ray was clutching at straws edna czabo had a new man in her life one that was a lot younger than the old one and with a little grit to him since she wasnt running for the presidency or leading her local girl scout troop i didnt think she would be too concerned about him meeting up with his old man occasionally the last photographs were all images of the grady house taken from every possible angle short of dangling upside down from the drainpipe according to the digital date imprinted in the righthand corner of the frames they were all shot a couple of weeks before in the space of about fifteen minutes ray had even managed to photograph the interior of the house through cracks in the window boards i quickly flicked through them once and saw nothing to make them stand out in any way i went through them again this time more slowly and found a detail in the secondtolast photo that made me pause it was the photograph ray had taken by pressing the camera to the boards most of the image was obscured by the reflection of the flash on the glass but the lefthand side was relatively clear it showed the mirror on the wall of the reception room the same mirror that i had seen when i first entered the house reflected in the glass was the shape of a man i could just make out his back which was clothed in a dark jacket but his face was not visible his reflection was turned away from the camera i flicked back through the images one more time to confirm what i had seen then laid them to one side in ray czabos photographs all the doors and windows in the grady house were clearly padlocked from the outside there was no way that anyone could be inside yet someone was that night rachel complained of pains in her stomach so i took her to maine medical and spent two hours in the waiting room while the doctors looked her over i read the newspapers for a time but they seemed to be filled with suffering and i didnt need to read about people dying while rachel was in pain eventually the doctors let her out they told us that there was nothing to be concerned about and that everything looked fine we got home at about am and rachel began crying shortly after i couldnt console her and she couldnt seem to bring herself to speak so i held her in my arms until her crying stopped and she at last fell asleep her final moments of wakefulness punctuated by small hiccuping sobs the next morning she acted as if nothing had happened and i didnt know what else to do except to let her be vii they arrived at the portland airport shortly after am its official title was the portland international jetport which had a kind of buck rogers ring to it although futurism and portland werent concepts that sat easily together i kind of liked it that way they were getting older i realized we all were true the changes in angel the new pain lines in his face and the creeping gray in his previously sootblack hair were too sudden to go unnoticed but his partner was also graying slightly louiss satanic beard was slowly speckling with white and there was now also a considerable dusting of it in his hair he caught me looking at him what he said youre going seriously gray i said i dont think so hate to break it to you like i said i believe youre mistaken you can take steps you dont have to just sit back and let it happen i dont have to sit back and do nothin because theres nothin to let happen okay if you say so but you know you let that hair grow out some and you can sign on as morgan freemans stunt double he has a point chipped in angel morgan aint as young as he used to be studios would probably pay good money for a younger guy who just looks as old as morgan freeman louis stopped at the door leading out of the terminal building you going to sulk i asked him maybe hes just forgotten where hes going that happens as you get for an older man angel could still move pretty quickly when he wanted to so louiss cole haan missed him by an inch the first time we sat at a table in the bayou kitchen a tiny little diner over on deering that until recently had only opened for lunch but now did weekend dinners as well it could seat maybe twenty people and its counter was piled high with sauces that carried warnings advising that they shouldnt be used by pregnant women or people with heart complaints the food was good and in winter it was mainly locals who went there angel was still rubbing his shin occasionally and casting hurt glances at louis so it was left to me to do most of the talking i told them a little more of the history of the grady house and about my encounters with chief grass denny maguire and gunnar tillmans boy among others you sure maguires clean asked louis i didnt get anything bad from him you tell matheson about him no i had spoken with matheson that morning he told me that he had a key for the basement in the house and he thought that the cops had one too but he hadnt realized that there was no copy on the set of keys he had given to me he promised to get one to me by the end of the day he also told me that hed had a shouting match with chief grass after grass had questioned the wisdom of hiring me matheson is edgy enough as it is i said the last thing i need is for him to start bothering maguire about the past what about czabo id call him a suspect but there hasnt been a crime still the photo in the mailbox isnt his style hes a watcher not a doer and the antiques guy the collector i had begun to think of him by that name after all i had no other he told me he had nothing to do with the photograph he said he just wanted a mirror from the house but he knows something could be hes a grave robber like voodoo ray said angel maybe if you just gave him a mirror hed tell you what he knows suggested louis i dont think so anyway nothing in the house is mine to give away you think hes a threat i put my hands up in the air a threat to what to us we havent done anything for once were free and clear nobody hates us on this case yet said angel always happens though said louis if only they took the time to get to know us a little better said angel ive taken the time to get to know you a little better i said and look where it got me youre on the payroll by the way so its not a charity case matheson signed off on the surveillance louis finished off his jambalaya soaking up the last of the sauce and rice with some fresh bread for how long as long as it takes was what he said i told him wed give it a week then review our options sounds like it could be nothing said louis a photograph in a mailbox thats all you got thats all i reached into my pocket and removed a copy of the matheson picture i carefully unfolded it then pushed it slowly across the table but do you want to take the chance the two men looked at the image of the young girl angel answered for both of them no he said i guess not later that afternoon they stopped by the house to say hi to rachel she was a little distant but neither of them remarked upon it i thought that she was just tired after the night before but it was the first sign of troubles to come the pain and danger that she had endured by remaining with me and the fears that she felt for herself and our child seemed to her to be rendered more acute by the presence of two men who were friends yet who always carried with them a potential for violence they reminded her of what had befallen her in the past and what might befall the child she carried looking back perhaps they also caused her to reflect on my own capacities and the possibility that i might always draw violent men to me she had attempted to explain these things to me before and i had tried to reassure her as best i could i hoped that in time her worries would fade i think she hoped so too even though she feared that they would not i wanted to ask her again about the visit to the hospital and the tears that followed but there was no time instead i held her and told her id be home before midnight and she squeezed me and said that would be fine i drove to two mile lake as the afternoon light began to dim angel and louis following behind it was dark by the time we arrived and the bare trees slept over us as we passed the grady house and took the next turning on the right the road led up to a rundown singlestorey farmhouse like the grady house itself it had been bought by matheson after his daughters disappearance it seemed to me that he wanted to seal off the whole area from the possible depredations of strangers as though his loss were inextricably tied up with the very fabric of the grady house with its surrounding fields and with the buildings that had silently borne witness to the events that had occurred in their purview perhaps he envisaged her lost and alone desperately trying to seek a doorway back into the world that she knew and felt that any change to the place from which she had vanished would make it impossible for her to return or maybe this was all simply one great monument an ornate offering upon which her name and the names of the other children were deeply inscribed yet never seen i opened the door to the farmhouse and led angel and louis inside it had been cleaned recently for there was little dust on any of the surfaces most of the rooms remained empty apart from the kitchen where there was a table and four chairs and the sitting room which contained a sofa bed and a radiator in one of the bedrooms there were some ladders and tins of varnish and paint an envelope on the table addressed to me contained a set of keys to the grady house for angel and louis and a single key with a note from matheson identifying it as the one for the basement nice said angel as he took in his surroundings very minimalist who knows that were here asked louis we do and so does matheson the cops no anyone asks you tell them youre here to do some work on the house and matheson will back you up but this place is pretty much invisible from the road so we shouldnt be bothered you two will take the lions share of the dutytwentyfour on twelve off theres a motel about three miles out of town ive rented a room there for the next week this place has no hot water and we cant risk too many lights there are blackout shades in the kitchen so if you want to read then thats the place theres a radio and tv in there too i led them to the back bedroom there a single window looked down upon the grady house framed by a gap in the trees it would be hard for anyone to approach it from north south or east without being seen and the west side of the house had no point of entry there it is i said you been in there asked angel yes do you want to check it out among the items left by matheson was a plan of the house louis spread it out on the floor and examined it is this accurate i looked it over looks like it theres not much to add mirrors on the walls some old furniture but most of it is stacked away so the floors are clear louis shrugged maybe well take a look in daylight if we get bored we watched the shape of the house darker yet against the night sky so we wait he said we wait nothing happened that night i drove home to rachel after a couple of hours then returned the following evening it set the pattern for the week that followed sometimes i would stay with them for a couple of hours after they arrived to relieve me sitting at the window and talking with angel while louis rested or read the grady house before us like a dark hand raised against the sky conversations with angel were not always a good idea are me and louis the only gay men you know he asked on the second night youre certainly the most irritating gay men i know we bring color into your life seriously you got any other gay friends i considered the question i dont know its not like you all wear lavender loon pants and village people tshirts or introduce yourselves with hey im dan and ill be your token homosexual for the evening just like i dont walk up to people shake their hands and tell them im charlie and im proud to be a heterosexual it worries people it would sure worry me well you wouldnt be my target market you have a target market what is it the needy needy heterosexuals the needy heterosexuals it sounds like a band anyway in answer to your question i dont know how many of my acquaintances are gay men maybe a couple plus i dont have gaydar i think thats a gay preserve i think gaydars a myth its all kind of confusing now that straight men are dressing nice and using skin care products kind of muddies the waters i looked at him but youre a gay man and you dont dress nice plus if you use skin care products youre using them on a part of your body that i cant see and you have no idea how happy i am to be able to say that you telling me i look straight if i look straight how come straight women never hit on me youre lucky anybody ever hit on you looking the way you do dont blame straight women for keeping their distance angel grinned but still youre happy to call me friend he reached over and patted my arm i didnt say i was happy about it and get your hands off me i have a suspicion about where theyve been he backed off you and rachel okay he asked we had a scare the other night she had pains the doctors took a look at her and told her she was fine she was kind of funny with us distant it was a long night you sure thats all it was yes i said pretty sure when i was alone i kept myself alert with a radio and caffeine or cleared my head a little by taking a walk around the property when i was certain everything was quiet once or twice i saw officer odonnell make a cursory check of the grady house but he didnt even glance up at the farmhouse on the slope above on the seventh day as i was heading home i got a call from detective jeff weis the cop who had given me voodoo rays new bachelor address bet you didnt have any luck finding ray czabo he said howd you know because they just found him i pulled over to the side of the road something tells me that hes not about to be talking to me anytime soon not unless youre psychic somerset county sheriff called it in about an hour ago his body was buried over by little ferguson brook mile or two east of harmony looks like hes been there for a while so youre probably off the hook i wasnt aware that i was on the hook there you go you were innocent and you didnt even know it i thanked weis for the tip then got back on the road and headed for harmony it wasnt too hard to find the location of the discovery i just followed a state police patrol car until i came to a cluster of vehicles by a small metal bridge off main stream road i tried to pick out someone i might know but they were all unfamiliar faces instead i settled for showing my license to the somerset county deputy who was trying to move me on and asked to speak to the detective in charge after a couple of minutes a balding man in a blue windbreaker broke away from the group standing by the riverbank and came over to talk to me help you he said charlie parker i said he nodded one thing about gaining a reputation in maine for better or worse was that most of the cops at least knew my name bert jansen he said youre off your turf i get around i gestured toward the riverbank i hear you may have found ray czabo jansen didnt respond immediately then seemed to decide what the hell and echoed rays name whats your interest in czabo i went looking for him about a week ago his wife said hed moved out but when i called by his new place there was no reply i left my card youll find it underneath his door when you search his apartment why were you looking for him to begin with i decided there was no percentage in not being open with jansen im working for a man named matheson his daughter died in the grady house matheson thinks someone may be developing an unhealthy interest in the house and the local cops told me that theyd rousted ray from the property a couple of times i wanted to ask him what he was doing or what he might have seen when he was there jansen took out his notebook and began writing and this was when a week ago wednesday he made some more notes then asked me if i minded hanging around for a while i told him i had no problem with that you have any idea how long hes been down there i asked nope my guess would be a week or more hes pretty bloated up cause of death shot in the head three close entry wounds no exits scoop his brains out and you could use his head for a bowling ball probably a twotwo id never cared much for ray czabo but he didnt deserve to end up dead three shots to the head also sounded like overkill one shot with a will leave the bullet rattling around inside tearing up tissue until it runs out of steam ray must really have annoyed someone to end up with three of them in his skull i guess he wasnt shot here wouldnt think so its a long way to transport someone just to shoot them our guess is he was killed someplace else then driven out here and buried in a shallow grave a dog dug up his hand it hasnt rained in a while but theres a whole bunch of it due i knew what jansen was saying the rain would come and the river would rise covering the burial site then with winter settling in it would freeze over until march maybe even april by the time the thaws came there would be no evidence left that the ground had ever been disturbed i went back to my car turned on the radio and listened to npr until the me arrived i watched her descend to the body and then finally the corpse was taken from the riverbank in a white bodybag jansen came over to speak to me shortly after and told me that the me estimated that czabo had been in the ground for up to two weeks then let me go i called rachel told her id be a little late then headed for orono orono is a college town housing part of the university of maine it has an intimate feel to it and most people know one anothers names so the first guy i stopped was able to direct me to casey tillmans garage the second thing i noticed once i got there was the lexus parked outside the first thing i noticed was the missing link who had to step aside before i could see the lexus link wasnt much more than six feet tall but he was probably the same width across his head looked too small for the rest of his bodyin fact it looked too small periodbut i suspected that he hadnt been hired for his brain power he had slightly asian features and his dark hair was tied back in a ponytail he also seemed to have shopped in the same hoods store as his boss except his clothes came from the big man section were closed he said when i stepped from the mustang come back later im here to see casey i told him you havent eaten him have you link blinked i figured him for the kind of guy who heard a joke at midnight and started laughing at about am i kept walking until i was standing in the garages entrance link lumbered after me and stopped me from going any farther by the simple measure of standing in front of me and tapping me in the chest with his index finger it barely involved him stretching a tendon but it nearly sent me sprawling in the gutter you got a problem with your hearing he said inside the garages office i could see gunnar tillman talking to his son his voice was raised and he was doing a lot of finger pointing casey looked over his fathers shoulder saw me and raised a hand to stop the older mans diatribe gunnar turned around and glared at me he didnt look happy but i didnt think it was personal gunnar tillman wasnt someone whose smiling muscles got a lot of exercise casey stepped from behind his desk and walked toward me what are you doing here he asked ray czabos dead i said i know edna called me and you called your father i figured he should know link stood beside us looking from me to casey and back again he reminded me of my dog but without the capacity to learn i was about to ask him to give us a little breathing space when the issue became redundant gunnar tillman pushed his way between casey and link i had five or six inches on him but it didnt make me feel any better gunnar pretty much sweated bad vibes who the fuck are you he asked its okay pop hes caseys intervention was cut short by gunnars left hand which slapped his son hard on the right cheek casey took a step backward his eyes teared with pain and humiliation i wasnt talking to you said gunnar his voice was perfectly even as though he had not even registered the blow he had delivered to his son he turned his attention back to me you see what you made me do he said hes my son and i care about him but you made me hit him i dont even know you so you better believe that ill fuck you up good if you dont start answering my questions now who are you my names parker im a private investigator so ray czabos dead and your son is seeing czabos wife you saying he had something to do with this i dont know did he gunnar reached behind his back and pulled a gun on me the muzzle looked very big and very black youve got some fucking mouth he said casey tried to calm his father down jesus pop come on dont do this you got no right to say things like that you hear me said gunnar his son reached out and patted him on the back gradually forcing the gun down with his right hand its okay he said he didnt mean anything by it let me talk to him gunnar was slowly coming off the boil he let out some deep breaths you watch your mouth he told me he put the gun back in the waistband of his trousers and walked over to a dodge with a yawning hood he slammed the hood down and leaned his hands upon it his head bowed his son watched him until he was certain that gunnar had regained control of his temper then said in a low voice i had nothing to do with it your old man visited czabo from what i hear he threatened him there were witnesses casey swallowed and shook his head in frustration i knew ray was following me around i saw him take some pictures i tried to warn him off but he wouldnt listen he said i was coming between him and his wife my pop found out found out or was told casey reddened he was i realized an even weaker man than he seemed i thought he could get billy over there to talk some sense into ray you know i do some things for my pop i look after cars for him some of them well they may have ownership issues you know what im saying ray needed to be warned off or else things would get really bad for him things did get really bad for him someone shot him in the head my pop didnt do it youre sure caseys voice lowered he doesnt need that kind of heat hes getting older now the stuff they say about him most of its not true anymore he only has a couple of guys on the payroll and mostly what they do is drive my old man to lunch he fences some cars distributes a little pot for the college kids but thats about it hes small time now but if they caught him theyd put him away and he doesnt want to die in jail he didnt kill ray czabo neither did i when the cops come calling well tell them that i looked over at gunnar he was coughing it was suddenly clear that what i had mistaken for his efforts to control his temper were actually attempts to get his breathing back in order he sounded sick billy was now beside him holding a cup of water to the old mans lips he can be a prick but hes still my father said casey his eyes pleaded for understanding and casey put a hand on my shoulder as though to guide me away from the garage i let him do it we lost a guy chris tierney he said when week or so back stabbed in the heart the name sounded vaguely familiar i recalled a story from the press herald about a stabbing in orono it hadnt mentioned gunnar tillman the story i read said tierney was mugged in the parking lot of a bar his body was hidden under trash bags thats where they found him so where did he die near here my father had him moved it explained why gunnar was so jumpy any idea who might have done it casey shook his head nobody has that kind of problem with my pop like i told you hes not into all that stuff now i didnt believe casey but it didnt matter there was a guy said casey billy said hed seen him around thin kind of greasy long coat looked like a bum but a bum couldnt have taken out chris no way i let him think that even as i walked to my mustang and remembered the sound that the collectors fingers had made as they danced upon its body detective jansen called again later that day when i was about to head over to two mile lake to relieve angel and louis you say you were over at czabos place he asked thats right and you left your card i slipped it under the door why there was no card there when we searched the apartment the landlord says that he hasnt been near the place and his wife told us that she doesnt have a key by the way she spoke highly of you ill bet do you like her for this i dont like her period if czabo hadnt been hit more than once i would have put this down as a suicide does she have an alibi yeah his names casey tillman hes a mechanic he claims they went to new hampshire a few weeks back for a couple of days r amp r if the dates match they may be in the clear were checking it tillman says there was no bad blood between him and czabo im inclined to believe him the only thing suspect about him is his taste in women i wondered if jansen had made the connection between casey tillman and his father i recalled my promise to tillman not to mention it unless i had to i decided to keep it for the present neither did i mention the photographs taken by ray czabo that i had in my possession i hadnt yet figured out a way to tell jansen about them without landing me in serious trouble instead i thanked him for keeping me informed jansen replied by letting me know that he wasnt doing it out of the goodness of his heart and he expected me to reciprocate i told him that sharing was at the heart of any good relationship he said hed rather have a relationship with ray czabos old lady then hung up i thought about ray czabo on the way to two mile he was no angel and his actions in the past had led to him being beaten up more than once usually with some justification but it was unlikely that his ghoulish tendencies would lead someone to kill him i recalled the collector standing in the flickering light behind denny maguires bar i wondered if he kept a gun under those layers of old clothes along with a knife then again jansen might be wrong about rays estranged wife but i didnt think so a woman who has just killed her husband or conspired in his death is not going to be too concerned about an old injury to him caused by someone else when mrs czabo reminded me of my first encounter with her husband the one that had left him with a broken nose she seemed genuinely aggrieved on his behalf she could simply have been putting on an act for my benefit but i could see no percentage for her in that all i knew for sure was that ray czabos death roughly coincided with the appearance of the photograph in the mailbox of the grady house and that someone had returned to his apartment after id been there maybe to resume the search for something that had been missed the first time or to ensure that there was no evidence left lying around my guess was that when the cops arrived the apartment was neat and tidy and the boxes that i had seen dislodged had been restored to their rightful place if all of those events were linked then a possible conclusion was that one of rays excursions down to two mile had coincided with the appearance of the individual responsible for the photo in the mailbox and that person had killed ray in order to ensure that he didnt tell anyone what he had seen if that was the case then matheson had been right all along to worry pranksters dont shoot people with a because its hard to laugh with holes in the top of your head the manand i had no doubt that it was a manwho placed the picture of an unknown girl at the grady house was deadly serious about what he was doing it was time to talk to chief grass again but when i called i was told that he wasnt available i left a message for him but he didnt call back viii by the tenth day the surveillance was taking its toll upon me unlike angel and louis i could not take a break and divide the duty with someone else and my body clock was completely confused even though i slept when i returned home to rachel or grabbed a couple of hours on the sofa bed once angel and louis arrived i still found myself drifting at times colors appeared too bright and sounds were either muffled or painfully clear sometimes i was unable to tell if i was dreaming or waking i spoke to matheson once or twice and informed him that what we were doing was untenable in the long term i agreed to complete the second week of surveillance once i had spoken to angel and louis and secured their consent but it seemed like a lost cause i was considering taking up clem ruddock on his offer of some help especially as rachel was due any day now and i wanted to be with her i spent most of my time worrying about her my cell phone was always close at hand its ring tone muted but still audible even in sleep on the tenth night i saw a figure moving among the trees beside the grady house i had heard no car approach although in my shattered state i couldnt be certain that i had not simply missed its approach i rose and made my way through the farmhouse stopping to retrieve my gun from the holster hanging on the back of the unmade sofa bed it felt both strange and familiar in my hand for it had been months since i had held it with even the vaguest intention of putting it to use finally i made a call to angel and louis if i was just being jumpy the worst they could do was shout at me a little i left through the front door pulling it closed silently behind me so that the wind would not catch it and alert the presence in the woods to my approach i made my way down the slope sticking close to the trees until i could smell the rotting of timbers and faint odor of smoke that hung about the place i circled the trees hoping to come up on the intruder from behind but when i reached the spot where i had seen him he was gone and there was only a stampedout cigarette butt where i felt certain that the collector had recently stood i retreated to the periphery of the forest shielding myself behind a tree and scanned the property i could see no sign of movement it didnt make me feel any less nervous after a while i made my way to the grady house keeping my back to its walls i checked the sides then approached the window of the old receiving room at the front of the house to the left of the door i thought of the figure in the mirror caught by ray czabos flashbulb but when i pressed my face to the crack in the wood i could see nothing in the darkness i stepped away and aimed my flashlight at the steel door barring entry to the house the padlock was gone i moved closer and tested the door by pulling it toward me it opened with some resistance and a lot of noise the main door behind it was already ajar i pushed it open a little farther and stepped back not sure what to expect but there was no sound from within after a couple of seconds spent debating my choice of career i stepped inside the smell of rot was stronger now as was the chemical stench of the wallpaper pastes a large strip of paper had come loose from the wall of the entrance hall since i had been there last and it hung at an angle like a bookmarked page exposing the damp plaster beneath i shined the flashlight on it and saw what looked like fragments of letters and drawings beneath the paper i pulled the strip away the wall was covered in writing and symbols none of them familiar to me i thought that the language might have been latin but the script was so faded it was impossible to tell i tore another strip from the wall and more writing was revealed this time adorned with circles and stars there was a purpose to this but i could not guess what it might be the smells of the house seemingly intensified by my action in pulling away the paper made me feel ill i jammed a handkerchief to my nose and tried to breathe shallowly through my mouth as i moved toward the diningroom door i pushed at it with my foot and entered the connecting doors between the two rooms were open as though in expectation of some great party that would now never take place the mirrors stared down upon dusty floors and torn drapes they should have reflected what i saw but they did not instead i saw in their decaying glass the gleam of lighted chandeliers and expensive handprinted paper on the walls the drapes were no longer faded and ripped but vibrant and fresh there were thick carpets upon the floors and a dining table set for two people i felt my shoe scuff the dust upon the bare boards under my feet there was nothing in this room but filth and dead bugs yet in the mirror i saw the house as it might have been i passed through the connecting doors into the receiving room and there glimpsed thick couches and matching smoking chairs and walls lined with books all reflected in the depths of the mirrors upon the walls its his house i thought its gradys house as he saw it in his own mind i felt a presence behind me but when i turned i saw only my own reflection in the mirror in the hallway set against the wonders of the ornate rooms at my back but something else was there waiting in the glass i sensed it even as my vision swam and a coughing racked my body as the stench of old glue and damp seemed to grow stronger then i noticed for the first time that the door to the basement was no longer closed and locked i knew there was another mirror on the door and that if i looked into its face i would see more figments of john gradys imagination somehow wheedling their way into my consciousness whos there i called and a voice answered and i thought it sounded like the voice of a little girl im here it said can you see me i moved the flashlight trying to find the source of the voice here im here behind you and when i spun there was a mirror and in the mirror i saw a child her hair matted and dirty her red dress torn farther back i saw another little girl with pale cheeks and torn skin the girl who had spoken pressed herself to the mirror as though it were glass and i saw her skin flatten against it hes here she said he never left from the corner of my eye i saw a darkness pass across the mirror in the dining room it was the figure of a man blurred like a bad projection it moved quickly shifting from mirror to mirror progressing toward the hallway hes coming said the little girl and then she and her companion were gone i raised my gun it seemed that everywhere i looked there was movement and i thought i heard a childs voice raised in fear i shook my head now the sounds came from below me from the basement and i made my way toward them in the mirror upon the door i saw myself trapped in the grady house that never was the stairs to the basement descended before me the flashlight beam illuminated strands of cobweb the stone floor and a single chair that stood beneath the empty light socket it was small too small for an adult to use but the perfect size for a child there were more mirrors on the walls here but they showed no beautiful furnishings no carpets or drapes this was gradys killing place and he had no need of beauty here i passed from mirror to mirror my light angled away from the glass i saw myself reflected again and again and again and for a brief instant i saw another mans face suspended behind mine before it retreated once again into the shadows i raised my gun aimed it at the glass then stopped there came the sound of footsteps above me approaching the cellar door through the main hallway i killed the flashlight and retreated into the darkness just as another light came from above i heard a mans breathing and the creaking of the banister rail as he placed his weight upon it and then his figure came into view he was a big man and over his left shoulder he carried a sack the sack was moving almost there he said the flashlight jogged in his hand as he reached the floor of the basement gently he placed the sack on the ground then unscrewed the head of the flashlight so that its bulb became a candle and in its glow i saw his face dont move i said as i emerged from the darkness by the stair chief grass didnt look as surprised as he should have done under the circumstances instead his eyes had a slightly glazed look to them i saw the gun in his left hand previously hidden from me by the sack it was lodged against the head of the child inside you shouldnt be here he said he wont like it who wont like it i said mr grady he doesnt like strangers in his home what about you arent you a stranger too grass snickered it was an unpleasant sound oh no he said ive been coming here for a long long time it took a while for mr grady to begin to trust me but once he did well everything was fine we talk a lot hes lonely i brought him some company some new blood he kicked the sack and the child within gave a muffled cry whats her name i asked lisette replied grass shes very pretty but then youve seen her picture pretty i heard a distant voice echo the word and in the mirror at grasss back i saw john grady reflected his fingertips pressed against the glass flattening as the dead childs skin had done and he stared down at the shape of the little girl moving feebly in the sack i saw his prominent chin curved and jutting his neat hair the little stained bow tie at his neck his lips moved constantly in a litany of desire the words now unintelligible but their import clear its the house grass i said its making you do this its wrong you know its wrong put the gun down grass shook his head i cant he said mr grady grady is dead i said no hes here listen to me grass something in this house has affected you youre not thinking clearly we need to get you out im taking the girl and then were all going to leave for the first time grass looked uncertain he told me to bring her he chose her out of all the girls i showed him he chose this one no i said you imagined it youve spent too long here everything about this place is poisonous and somehow its burrowed into your mind grasss gun wavered slightly he looked from me to the girl on the ground then back again its infected your thoughts grass you dont want to hurt this little girl youre a cop you have to protect her just like you protected denny maguire let her go you must let her go but i was not sure that i believed all that i was saying for i saw john gradys eyes turn upon me in the mirror and his lips formed the single word no grass seemed to hear it and the doubt left his eyes he forced the gun harder against the girls skull then lifted the sack up holding his prize beneath his arm as he began retreating up the stairs i followed him all the way reaching the top of the steps as he moved into the hallway his back to the wall as he made for the safety of his vehicle parked outside two figures blocked the doorway now where do you think youre going said louis he stood on the porch with his gun raised before him angel knelt below him his own gun pointed at grass seconds later i added a third grass stopped caught between us let her go i said its all over grass was shaking his head muttering something that i couldnt understand he stared straight ahead and saw his reflection in the mirror i couldnt see what he was looking at because the angle was wrong but it was clear from the expression on his face that i wasnt the only one hallucinating in the grady house chief you rescued denny maguire from here i said i could hear the desperation in my voice remember you brought him out you saved his life you saved a childs life youre not a killer this is not you its the house listen to me its not your fault its something in the house slowly grass released his grip on the sack and let it fall to the floor although his gun remained pointing at it i could hear the girl crying but i thought that i could also hear another voice it was whispering spilling foul words into grasss ear dont listen to him i said please just put the gun down grasss face crumpled he began to cry and i was reminded of denny maguire weeping in his bar two men linked by the evil of john grady chief i said he raised the gun and pointed it at the mirror before him put it down i said grass was sobbing now this is not a house he said he cocked the pistolthis is not a house he repeatedand turned to look at me as the gun suddenly swung toward him the muzzle coming to rest against his temple this is he pulled the trigger and the walls went red ix the figure behind the mirror stared at me as i knelt down and undid the rope that held the sack closed the girl from the picture lay inside her hands and feet tied and a red bandana gagging her mouth i undid the gag first then her hands and feet but i did not let her look at the mirror behind me or at the body of the man who had brought her to this place i want you to go with my friends i said theyll take care of you until i come out she was crying and she tried to hold on to me but i forced her gently away into angels arms its okay he said as he led her away nobodys going to hurt you now i watched her until she was gone from sight louis remained in the doorway waiting i approached the glass my gun raised john gradys dead eyes grew large and his lips moved faster and faster lights out i said then fired and the mirror shattered as the process of erasing john gradys image from the world began x two days later i watched as a team of workmen removed every remaining mirror from the grady house and placed them in the back of one of mathesons trucks matheson himself was beside me watching all that was being done one of the workmen approached us and said we were pretty careful with those mirrors theyre antiques could be worth some money you was to restore them some theyre going to be destroyed i said the workman looked to matheson in the hope of an alternative response you heard the man said matheson the workman shrugged then returned to loading the mirrors you think he really believed that grady wanted him to bring a child to the house asked matheson yes i said i think he really believed it what about ray czabo grass had a twotwo my guess is it will match the bullets that killed czabo well know tomorrow for sure two workmen came out carrying one of the basement mirrors you never did tell me what you saw in there said matheson i looked at him i recalled the face of john grady and the children in the dark reaches of the glass fumes and tiredness i thought just fumes and tiredness i saw reflections i said he stared at me for a time then nodded okay then reflections we counted the mirrors to make sure none was missing when we were done matheson climbed in the cab and drove off i followed him back to his plant over in a brownstone building at the back of the lot was an industrial fumace matheson parked the truck outside it you sure about this asked matheson i think so i replied ill get some of the boys to give us a hand he left me and headed for the main building i leaned against the truck and watched the light fade already it was growing dark the wind was colder now soon the snows would arrive i didnt even see the blow coming one moment i was looking at the sky and the next i was lying on the ground bright flashes exploding in my vision i started to rise but my balance was shot i fell back upon the ground and tried not to retch the collector stood above me there was an old leather blackjack in his hand im sorry he said i opened my mouth to speak but nothing emerged instead i watched in silence as he took a small gilded mirror from the back of the truck i reached out a hand i think i managed to say no whatever sound i made it caused him to look down on me burning wont be enough he said he will still be free he knelt down beside me and turned the glass toward me look said the collector i couldnt focus my image swam in the glass but it did not swim alone i saw john grady but not as he once was not as he was in his pictures or as he looked before my bullet struck the mirror in his basement i thought i saw fear or perhaps it was my own face that i saw i do not know he owes a soul said the collector he was damned and his soul is forfeit who are you i asked but he did not reply later i would find the paperwork that the collector had completed when he bought john gradys old books at the police sale the name at the bottom was written in marvelously ornate script it was quite beautiful the man who claimed to be a nephew of one of maines leading book merchants had signed himself mr kushiel curiously the address he gave was that of the old state prison at thomaston which now no longer stands i was tempted for a brief moment to look up his name to discover its derivation but i did not instead i prayed only that i would never see him again for any jail in which kushiel played a part lay far deeper than the ruins of thomaston but that was later for now i was lying bleeding on the ground and the collector was standing above me the mirror tucked firmly beneath his arm by the time matheson returned he was long gone and john gradys debt was about to be paid for eternity xi on december rachel gave birth to our daughter we named her samantha sam for short i was there when she was born i held her in my arms and smelled the blood upon her as the past and the present came together interweaving combining binding me to what i was and what i had become one child born another saved perhaps clem ruddock was right it is children with me and there is a pattern to be seen if i choose to look closely for it there is a pattern and i am part of it she also has a role to play for my new daughter will share her birthday with the anniversary of her halfsisters death and the death of the woman who was once my wife there is a pattern i am not afraid i tell myself i am no longer afraid acknowledgments this book is something of a labor of love and a great many people have played a part in its publication offering support encouragement and advice over the long period of its gestation nocturnes might never have appeared at all had bbc northern ireland not approached me shortly after the publication of my first novel in and asked if there was anything i might be interested in writing for them i had always been fascinated by supernatural stories ever since i was a young reader and i was curious about writing for radio it seemed to me that there was something very appealing about the thought of a voice reading a ghost story aloud to a driver alone in a car or to someone curling up in bed before turning off the light in the end i wrote five tales for the bbc which were broadcast on radio four in and read by a very wonderful actor named tony doyle now sadly no longer with us as i write another five stories are scheduled to be broadcast in nine of those tales are contained in this volume i owe an immense debt of gratitude to lawrence jackson the producer of both sets of stories for the bbc lawrence was the first to read them the first to offer suggestions on how they might be improved and the first to reassure me when i felt my confidence in them flag without him and without the willingness of the bbc to offer them a home they would not exist in this form i am also indebted to emily bestler and sue fletcher my wonderful and very faithful editors at atria and hodder amp stoughton respectively short story collections are difficult propositions for publishing houses but from the very beginning both emily and sue were unstinting in their support for nocturnes to emily her associate editor sarah branham and to all those at atria who continue to publish my books i am eternally grateful finally i will always be thankful that i have found myself in the care of my agent darley anderson who must sometimes wonder at precisely what he has let himself in for by taking me on his friendship has quite literally changed my life i would be lost without him and without his marvelous staff to darley lucie julia emma heather and elizabeth thank you finally to my family to jennie and to cameron and alistair thanks for putting up with me
