jo clayton drinker of souls a thief and his sister aituatea shifted the bend in his legs to ease his aching hip careful as he moved to keep the bales piled under him from squeaking the bales of raw unwashed fleeces that were a stench in his nostrils but sheltered him from noses and teeth of the patrollers rathounds he raised his head a little and stared at the curls of mist drifting across the calm black water of the bay a wandering breeze licked at his face tugged at his slickedback hair carried past his ears just enough sound to underline the silence and peace of the night this is a bust he whispered to the one who stood at his shoulder she wont come the man on the mountain said his sisters voice was the crackling of ice crystals shattering look there she pointed past the huddling godons beyond the wharves their rambling forms lit from behind by torches burning before the allnight winestalls the joyhouses the cookshops of the water quarter the wounded moon was rising at last a broken round of curdled milk behind the spiky roof of the temple she swung round an arm colorless and transparent as glass outlined with shimmers like crystal against black velvet and pointed across the harbor and there she said she was all over crystal even the rags she wore out beyond the wodaan a blind ship from phras dropping anchor he looked instead at the woda livingboats shrouded in the thickening mist their humped roofs like beetle shells catching bits of moonlight a blind ship the wodaan hated them those blind ships there were torches flaring up here and there among the boats as the wodaan grewaware of the visitor clanking raffles starting up growing louder fading sounding and fading in another place and another as they invoked the protection of the godalau and her companion gods against the evil breathed out by the black ship that had no eyes to let her see her way across the seas he sneered at them with hina scorn for the superstitions of other races theyll be thick as fishlice at the temple tomorrow wheres that curst patrol i want to get out of this she wont come not this late he propped his chin on his fists and watched the ship he drowsed the wounded moon creeping higher and higher behind him the guard patrol was late hanging round the winestalls let them stay there lets get out of this he whispered that ships settled for the night wont no one be coming ashore he twisted his head around so he could see his sister she took her stubbornness into the water with her he thought she stood at his left shoulder as shed stood since the night she came swimming through water and air and terror to find him while her body rocked at the bottom of the bay the black glitters that were her eyes stayed fixed on the phras ship as if she hadnt heard him the man on the mountain said shed come she said doubletongue old fox she turned on him stamping her crystal foot down beside his shoulder her crystal hair flying out from her head be quiet fool he could curse you out of your body and whered i be then aituatea rubbed oily fleeces between his palms shivered at the memories her words invoked old man kneeling in his garden on the mountain digging in the dirt clean old man with a skimpy white beard and wisps of white hair over his ears tending rows of beans and cabbages old man in a sacking robe and no shoes not even straw sandals and eyes that saw into the soul aituatea jerked his shoulders trying to shake off a growing fear went quiet as he heard the faint grate of bale shifting against bale he stared unhappily at the blind ship whispering to himself itll be over soon has to be over soon trying to convince himself that was true that hed be through dealing with things that horrified him the kadda witch dead and hotea at rest which she would be now but for that bloodsucker and me rid of her scolding and complaining and always being there no way to get free of those curst eyes he wanted to climb down from the bales and get off selt for the next dozen years but he couldnt do that if he did that hed never get rid of hotea shed be with him the rest of his life and after he suppressed a groan out on the water the torches scattered about the wodaan watercity were burning low and the rattles had gone quiet behind him on selt islands single mountain where the temple was rocket after rocket arced into the darkness hissing and spitting and exploding to drive off the enemies of the godalau and her companion gods part of a counting rhyme for a fetes fireworks blue glow for the godalau seas lady skys queen red shine for the gadajine storm dragons spitting fire yellow flash for jahtakash lady ladling out surprise green sheen for isayana birthing mistress seed and child purple spray for geidranay gentle giant grooming stone moonwhite light for tungjiiluck male and female in one form luck he thought my lucks gone sour these past six months aituatea repeated to himself with some pleasure fool fool fool woman she never thinks before she does something going to the temple the day after yearturn when she knew temueng pressgangs would be swarming over the place sucking up hina girls for the new years bondmaids she shouldve thought first she shouldve thought what happened he said where you been all this time thanks a bunch for worrying about me she said he heard her as a cricket chirp in his head an itch behind his ears i was working the temple court she said reproach in her glittering glass eyes you were off somewhere brother joyhouse or gambling with those worthless hangabouts you call your friends and the money was gone when i looked in the housepot and there wasnt a smell of food or tea in the place whatd you want me to do starve it being the day after yearturn i knew every hina with spare coin and unwed daughters would be burning incense by the fistfuls i spotted a wool merchant with a fat purse dangling from his belt and started edging up to him i get so busy checking out running room and easing through his herd of daughters i forget to look out for pressgangs hadnt been for those giggling geese i mightve heard them and took off i dont hear them and they get us all they take us me and the wool merchants daughters across the causeway me hoping to be put in some little havalars house where i can get away easy and take a thing or two with me for my trouble but i see we are heading all the way up the high hill to the tekoras palace i am cursing you brother and thinking when i get home i am going to peel your skin off a strip at a time she was much calmer at this point in the story drifting about the room touching familiar things with urgent strokes of her immaterial fingers as if she sought reassurance from them she hovered a moment over the teapot smiling as she absorbed its fragrance i know i can get loose again easy enough but the tekoras a mean bastard with girls that run away you wouldnt know that would you brother only women you bother about are those nogood whores in the joyhouses aituatea scowled dying hadnt changed his sisters habits in the least as far as he could see shut up about that he said get on with what happened branded on the face brother branded runaway and thief whod let me get close enough to lift a thing so when the temueng housemaster puts me to work in the tekoras nursery i am ready to act humble before those temueng bitches when id rather slit their skinny throats she grimaced in disgust you know what they do to me hauling slops picking up after those temueng nits not lifting a finger to help themselves running my feet to the bone fetching things they could just as easily get for themselves her chirp sounded bitter and full of rage she was madder than hed ever seen her even when he turned fourteen and ran off with the housemoney to buy time with a joygirl what was her name he shook his head couldnt remember her name or what she looked like after a month of that hotea said i am about ready to skip out even if it means i have to get off utarselt live low the rest of the year you could take care of yourself brother dear though i did mean to warn you they might connect you with me if your luck went sour as mine the nursery garden has a high wall but there are plenty of trees backed up against that wall on its other side is the guard walkway and a pretty steep cliff but i am not fussing about that i can climb as good as you brother and swim better and the causeways near i am thinking about going over the wall that night or the one after depending when fat old tungjii heesh jabs me in the ass again the tekoras youngest daughter disappears hotea beat her fist several times on aituateas shoulder making him wince at the stinging touches he jerked away then clutched at his head as the sudden movement woke his hangover and started the demon in his skull pounding a maul against his temples hotea laughed the scorn in the soundless whisper raising the hairs along his spine fool she said youll kill yourself you go on like this you need a wife thats what a good woman wholl keep you in order better than i could give you sons you dont want our line to die with you do you brother she shook herself her form shivering into fragments and coming together again listen she said you got to do something about that witch as long as she lives i wont rest she wrung her hands together darted in agitation about the room gradually grew calmer as the grandmother ghost patted her arm ragged lips moving in words that were only bursts of unintelligible noise she drifted back to hover in front of aituatea the tekoras youngest daughter she said three years old and just walking a noxious little nit who shouldve been drowned at birth on the eve of the new moon they turn the place upside down double the work on us i dont think much about it except that id strangle her myself if i come across her she is wrecking my plans because she took off three days later they find her facedown in the nursery fountain shriveled and bloodless like a bug sucked dry not drowned but dead for sure f i was scared of leaving before well tekora would tear silili brick from plank looking for me or thats what im thinking then the other maids are as jittery as me we are hina in the house of the temueng that makes us guilty even if we do nothing and the other bondmaids are too stupid and cowed to say boo to a butterfly housemaster beats us but his heart isnt much in it and things go on much the same as before on the eve of the next new moon another daughter goes and i am there to see it they order us bondmaids to sleep in the nursery to make sure the daughters dont just wander off this night is my turn a bondmaid brings me a cup of tea i sniff at it when she goes out herb tea anise and something else cant quite place it i take the cup to the garden door and look at it but cant see anything wrong i sniff at it again and i start getting a touch dizzy i throw the tea out the door and carry the cup back and put it by my pallet so it looks like i drank it i stretch out im scared to sleep but i do up before dawn running like a slave for those bitches im tired to the bone something wakes me i dont move but open my eyes a slit and keep breathing steady a minute after that i see the tekamin standing in the doorway the tekoras new wife she is he set her over the others and they are mad as fire about it but what can they do heiya brother i have to listen to a lot of bitching when i am fetching for the other wives they dont get a sniff of him after he brings that woman back with him from andurya durat no one knows where she comes from who her family is or her clan even the wives are scared to ask and there she is in that doorway slim and dark and lovely and scaring the stiffening out of me she comes gliding in touches the second youngest daughter on her face and the daughter climbs out of the bed and follows her and i know what she is then shes a kadda witch a bloodsucker i lay shivering on my pallet wishing id drunk the drugged tea my head going round and round as i try to figure out what to do i think of skipping out before morning and trusting i can keep hid but i think too of the kadda wife i dont want her sniffing after me i have a feeling she can smell me out no matter where i hide well brother i raise a fuss in the morning what else can i do and you better believe i dont say one thing about the tekamin the other daughters howl and scream and stamp their skinny feet and the old wives they go round pulling bondmaids hair and throwing fits when the housemaster beats me again it is just for the look of the thing and for himself i suppose he is scared himself and happy to have my back to take it out on i keep my head down the next month you can believe that i try a couple times to sneak out of the handmaids dorm but the damn girls arent sleeping sound enough and keep waking up when i move anyway im not trying too hard not yet the kadda wife isnt bothering meexcept sometimes she looks at melike she is wondering if i was really asleep that other time im thinking maybe i can last out the year and get away clean and all the fetching and carrying and cleaning up dont bother me near so much then the wounded moon starts dribbling away faster and faster till it is the eve of the new moon again and curiosity is eating at me till i cant stand it you told me more than once brother my nose would be the death of me hotea giggled and the other ghosts laughed with her a silent cacophany of titters giggles and guffaws aituatea sat slumped in his chair waiting morosely for them to stop he wasnt amused by a situation that meant either he had to go after a bloodsucking witch or face having an overbearing older sister at his elbow for the rest of his life another girl is sleeping in the nursery this night the gndalau be praised for that but i decide to sneak in there and watch what happens i tell myself the more i know the easier i can get away without the witch catching me well its an argument like it happens sometimes when old tungjii gets together with jahtakash and they wait for you to put your foot in soft shit up to your ears everything is easy for me that night the other bondmaids go to sleep early snoring ive half a mind to join them but i dont i make myself get out of bed moving about helps some clears the fog out of my head i sneak down to the nursery jumping at every shadow and there are lots of those the wind has got in the halls and is bumping the lamps about but that is just the sort of thing you expect in big houses at night so instead of scaring me more it almost makes me feel like im at home prowling a house with eldest uncle in the nursery the nits are sleeping heavy the bondmaid is stretched on a pallet snoring she doesnt so much as twitch when i step over her and duck under the bed of one of the dead daughters it is close to the door into the garden and i figure if anything goes wrong i can get out that way the door is open a crack wedged to let the air in and clear out the strong smell of anise i lie there chewing my lip thinking things will happen soon sounds of wind and fountain whoop through the room i almost cant hear the bondmaid snoring there is a lot of dust under the bed no one checks there and we dont do more than we have to but i am sorry about that now because some of that dust gets into my nose makes it itch like i dont know after a while i start getting pains jumping from my neck to between my shoulders i stand it some minutes more then i have to stretch and wiggle if i want to be able to walk without falling on my face i am just about ready to crawl back to my bed muttering curses on tungjii and jahtakash when i hear a kind of humming i stop moving hoping the wind noise had covered the sounds i was making i cant tell you what the humming was like ive never heard anything like it my eyelids keep flopping down i am fighting suddenly to kep awake then more dust gets in my nose i almost sneeze but dont one good thing the itch releases me from the witchs spell i ease myself toward the end of the bed and crick my neck around so i can see the door i am hidden by the knotted fringe on the edge of the coverlet and feel pretty safe the kadda wife is standing in the door the humming stops the tekora moves out of the shadows to stand beside his wife i stop breathing he looks hungry i feel like throwing up the kadda wife looks around the room i get the feeling she can see me i close my eyes and pretend im a frog hopped in from the garden even with my eyes closed i can feel her looking at me im sure shes going to call me out from under the bed im thinking its time to scoot out the door and over the wall but nothing happens and i cant resist sneaking another look the kadda wife smiles up at the tekora and takes her hand off his ann its like shes taken the bridle off him he walks to his daughters bed he looks down at the little girl then over his shoulder at the witch she nods he bends over and whispers something i couldnt make out that hurts my ears anyway the girl gets up follows him out of the room his own daughter hoteas voice failed as indignation shook her her form wavered and threatened to tatter but she steadied herself closed her hand tight about her brothers arm he winced but didnt pull away this time the witch looks around the room one more time then leaves too i stay where i am flat out under the bed i am thinking hard you better believe no wonder the tekora is neglecting his other wives i see he is looking younger his skin is softer and moister he is plumper moving more like a young man i see thats how she is buying him then i think hes running out of daughters hes going to start on the bondmaids too soon for me and i think what odds the kadda wife doesnt make me the first one to go none of us hinas are going to finish out this bond year i wait under the bed for a long time afraid shes going to come back and sniff me out but nothing happens i creep out from under the bed when i hear the first sleepy twitters of the warblers in the willows outside the door a warning that dawn is close if i have to spend the rest of my life exiled i am going down that cliff now no more this and that and the other out away far away as i can get fast as i can get there the last daughter is still sleeping so is the bondmaid but she is going to wake soon and start screeching the minute she sees the third daughter is gone i kick the wedge away and whip out the door into the garden the kadda wife is waiting in the garden for me i get maybe two steps before she grabs me i try to jerk loose but her cold hands are hard and strong as iron chains and they drain my strength away somehow it is as if she sucks it out of me i am scared witless i think she is going to drink me dry right there she doesnt she pushes me back into the nursery and across it into the hallway i go without making a sound i cant make a sound though i try screaming something is pulling strings on my legs as if i were a puppet in a holy play no an unholy play she takes me high up in the palace to a small room under the roof shoves me inside and a minute later there is this pain in the back of my head when i wake its dark againor still dark i dont know which i am hanging on an iron frame like a bed stripped and set on end my wrists and ankles are tied to the corner with ropes there is a gag in my mouth probably because of the open window high in the wall on my right and a strong smell of anise i am getting very tired of anise the mix smells stale as if it had been floating round the room a long time and that scares me all over again more than if itd been fresh they hadnt eaten the daughter yet looks like im going to take her place this month my wrists and ankles are burning my mouth is like leather my head feels like someone kicked it after a short panic i start fiddling with the ropes and go a little crazy with relief when i find i know more about knots than whoever tied me i get myself loose and start looking for some way out there is no latch on the inside of the door just a hole for a latchstring or maybe a pin key nothing in the room i canuse on it i push the frame over to the window and climb up to look out i climb carefully the frame creaking as if it will collapse if i breathe too hard i get halfway out the window and look down there is nothing much between me and the water except a lot of straight upanddown cliff and the surf is white wrinkles about black rocks way way down the wind is blowing against my face cold and damp but it feels good fingers touch my ankle i know its her i kick free before she can drain away my strength again somehow i keep myself from falling as i wiggle out the window so scared all i know is that i have to get away fast i hear cursing behind me and the squeal of metal as the frame collapses under her i stand in the window and look down at the waves crashing against the rocks no joy there i look up the endhorns of the eaves are close but not close enough so i can reach them behind me i hear curses and other noises as she drags something to the window shes coming for me i take a chance and jump my hands slap around a horn and i am hanging free i start pulling myself up fingers close about my ankles i kick hard harder but cant get loose my hands slip so here i am and here i stay till the kadda witch is dead down in the water with me dead you hear me brother you hear aituatea winced as he felt a nip in his left shoulder look her crystal arm sketched in touches of moonlight hotea jabbed her finger at the phras ship the ships dark bulk was suddenly alive with lanthorns shining red and gold behind horn sides dozens of them lighting up the deck and the swirl of dark forms moving over it he could hear snatches of speech too broken for understanding the blast of a horn as one of the figures leaned over the rail to call a water taxi from the wodaan the hornblower had to repeat the signal several times before the slide of a red lanthorn marked the passage of a taxi from the watercity to the blind ship a slim energetic figure swung over the rail and went down the netting with skill and grace aituatea swallowed the sourness in his throat a woman by outline alone even at this distance a woman the drinker of souls he cursed under his breath the weight of centuries of custom of his sisters shame and fury of his own battered selfrespect all this pressed down on him shoving him toward the thing that twisted his gut he pressed his hand over his mouth stifling an exclamation as two more forms balanced a moment on the rail then followed the woman down small forms children or dwarves or something the old man on the mountain hadnt said anything about companions he glanced up at hotea she was staring hungrily at the woman bent forward a little her hands closed into fists her form shivering with a terrible urgency the strength of that need he hadnt understood before despite all those scolds all those bitter accusations of cowardice and shame repeated so often he ceased to listen he squirmed uncomfortably on the fleece the taxi came swiftly toward the wharf the stern sweep worked by a young woda girl the lanthorn on the bow waking coppery highlights on sweaty skin the color of burnt honey her short black hair held off her face by a strip of red cloth knotted about her temples she swayed back and forth in a kind of dance with the massive oar her muscles flowing smoothly her face blank and blandly animal as if she lived for that moment wholly in the body aituatea stared at her his tongue moving along dry lips a tension in his groin reminding him how long itd been since hed had a woman a stinking woda bitch he ground his teeth together and went on watching her frog ugly in his hina eyes she was a dirty beast beastly with her strong coarse features her broad shoulders her short crooked legsbut she roused him until he was close to groaning six months since hed been to a joyhouse hed tried it once after his sister fell in the bay but he couldnt do anything there hoteas ghost followed him everywhere as if a string tied her to his left shoulder he tried to drive her off for a little bit but she wouldnt go he thought maybe he could ignore her long enough to get his relief but when he was with the girl he could feel hoteas eyes on him those damn judging angry eyes and he shriveled to nothing and had to pay the woman double so she wouldnt spread talk about him the taxi bumped against the wharf the strange woman laughed at something one of the children said a rippling happy sound that jarred against his expectations drinker of souls conjured dour and deflating images the childrens giggles echoed hers then she was up the ladder and swinging onto the wharf the children followed in the moonlight they looked like twins pale little creatures dancing about the woman flinging rapid bursts of their liquid speech at her receiving her terse replies with more laughter after a last exchange that left the woman grinning the twins capered away disappearing into the maze of boxes and bales piled temporarily on the wharf waiting for the godalau fete to pass before they were tucked away into the godons aituatea heard the children chattering together then the high rapid voices faded off down a grimy alley the woman turned to look across the water at the phras ship where the lanthorns were going out as it settled back to sleep then she gazed along the curve of selt toward the manyterraced mountain of utar he saw her follow the line of torches burning along the causeway the lampions that marked the course of the looping roadway her head tilting slowly until she went quiet stood with a finger stroking slowly and repeated alongside her mouth contemplating the topmost torches those that burned on the gate towers of the tekoras palace she had long straight hair that gleamed in the strengthening moonlight like brushed pewter the front parts trimmed to a point the back clasped loosely at the nape of her neck she was taller than most hina wider in the shoulders and hips though otherwise slim and supple her skin was very pale in the moonlight it looked like porcelain she wore loose trousers of some dark color stuffed into short black boots a white fullsleeved shirt with a wide collar that lay open about her neck over this was a sleeveless leather coat when a gust of wind flipped it back for a moment he raised his brows seeing two throwing knives sheathed inside she wasnt phras or any of the many other sorts of foreigners that passed through the port of silili but he wasnt too surprised at that seeing what she was behind him he heard the stomp and clatter of the godon guards and the whining of their rathounds he took a chance and watched the woman to see what she would do poking long spears into crevices to drive out drunks or sleepers sounding their clappers to scare away ghosts and demons whooping to keep up their courage the godon guards came winding along the wharves the woman stirred slightly touchmenot spun out from her like strands of mist real mist spun up out of the water until she was a vertical dimness in a cocoon of white aituatea watched uneasily fascinated until the guards got close then dropped his face into the fleece and waited as soon as the patrol had clattered past he looked up again the cocoon out by the water unraveled with a speed that startled aituatea then his stomach was knotting on itself as she came sauntering toward him as unstoppable and selfcontained as the wind whats she doing here whyd she come to silili he hadnt thought about it before but now he saw her whats waiting for her here old man you didnt tell us nothing except she was the one who could face the witch what else didnt you tell us what else do you know crazy old fox said nothing worth salt the old man settled onto his haunches his dirtcrusted hands dropping onto his thighs eyes the color of rotted leaves touched on aituatea shifted to hotea and ended looking past them both at the woolly clouds sliding across the early morning sky hotea drove her elbow into aituateas ribs he lurched forward a step bowed and held out the lacquer box filled with the rarest tea he could steal ah the old man said he got stiffly to his feet took the box from aituatea come he said he led them into the single room of his small dwelling it was painfully clean and quite bare except for a roll of rough bedding in one corner and a crude table with a chair facing the door and a bench cobbled from pine limbs opposite he went to some shelves mere boards resting on wooden pegs driven into the wall set the box beside a jumble of scrolls and a brush pot shuffled back to the chair sit he said aituatea glanced over his shoulder morning light cool as water filled with dancing motes poured through the door and flooded across the table picking up every wrinkle wart and hair on the old mans still face thought he was uneasy with emptiness at his back aituatea slid onto the bench and sat plucking nervously at the cloth folds over the knee of his short leg he wanted to shut the door but he was afraid to touch anything in the but and afraid too of shutting himself in with the old man he twitched but didnt look around when he felt the cold bite of hoteas hand on his shoulder his eyes flicked to the serene face across from him flicked away came slowly back the old man looked harmless and not too bright but there were many stories about him and brash youths who thought they could force his secrets from him some said it was always the same old man temueng to the temuengs and hina to the hinas or whatever he chose to be the but was filled with a faded tang of cedar and herbs the breeze wandering in from outside brought with it the sharp aromas of pine and mountain oak the dark damp smells of the earth the lighter brighter scents of stone dust and wild orchids it was warm and peaceful there the tranquility underlined by the whisper of the breeze the intermittent humming of unseen insects in spite of himself aituatea began to relax hotea pinched him stubbornly he said nothing this visit was her idea something she came up with when she couldnt drive him into action with bitter words or shame if she wanted help from the old man let her do the talking the sunlight sparked off her outflung arm im drowned by a kadda witch she burst out her voice made no impression on the drowsing sounds of the small room but the old man looked at her hearing her i want her dead she cried in the water with me dead the old man blinked pale brown eyes opening and closing with slow deliberation with his shaggy brown robe the tufts of white hair over his ears his round face and slowblinking eyes he looked to aituatea rather like a large horned owl the tip of a pale pinkishbrown tongue brushed across his colorless lips all things die in their time he said hotea made a small spitting sound aituatea looked at his hands feeling a mean satisfaction this wasnt what shed come to hear platitudes she could read in any book of aphorisms not that woman she said her voice crackling with impatience not while theres young blood to feed her even her he said i want her dead old man she said i want to see her dead hoteas hands fluttered with small quickly aborted movements as if she sought to uncover with them some argument to persuade him to interfere against his inclination look she said temueng children have died do you think hina wont pay for those deaths ten for one they will were guilty old man whether we do anything or not they can do no wrong theyre the conquerors arent they besides leave the witch alone how long before she eats everyone on utarselt hotea went still a moment then her voice was a thread of nosound softer than usual in aituateas head teach us old man she said teach us how we can front and kill a kadda witch the old man stared at her a dozen heartbeats then turned those pitiless eyes on aituatea they swelled larger and larger until they were all he could see he began to feel like weeping softly and sadly as they searched his soul as they spaded up fear and waste and the little niggling meannesses hed done to his friends and to his sister and all the ugly things hed buried deep and refused to remember as he stared into the old mans eyes he was finally forced to see that he would never do anything about the kadda witch without someone to take the brunt of the witchs attack that he would keep putting it off and putting it off growing more wretched as the years passed as hotea grewmore caustic the old man leaned back his worn face filled with pain as if he had absorbed from aituatea all that selfdisgust and fear he slumped his body shrinking in on itself his eyes glazing over kadda witch he murmured blood drinker knows no will but her own evil recognizing no right beyond her own needs i see theres a counter i see he flinched drew further into himself powerful he said another power comes an ancient enemy his eyes moved in a slow sweeping arc but he was seeing nothing in the hut aituatea felt his stomach knot one comes the old man said husky voice reduced to a whisper a woman something between her and the witch like the witch no not the same drinker of life not blood not evil not good drinker of souls she comes the eve of the godalau fete set her on the track let her sniff out the witch buy her with dasn vuor and point her at the witch she comes with the rising of the wounded moon will leave before the rising of the sun the drinker of souls come back to silili after years and years a hundred years ah her purposes mesh with yours angry ghost he muttered some more but the words were unintelligible intermixed with sudden chuckles it was as if he had to wind back down into his customary taciturnity and something amusing he saw was retarding this return aituatea sat frozen sick three months respite then he had to face the witch or face himself he glared at the old man silently cursing him for setting the limit so close the old man lifted his head looked irritably at him thats it he seemed to say you got what you came for now get out of here shadow spread out from him dark and terrible killing the light the warmth aituatea scrambled back knocking over the bench the smell of cedar choking him he ran from the hut another nip in his shoulder hotea getting impatient go after her stop her she shrilled dont lose her fool you wont find her again you know it and weve only got till sunup muttering under his breath aituatea swung down from the bales and limped after the woman his hip hurt but he was used to that and almost forgot the pain as he hurried past the godons and stepped into the street of the watermen she was making no effort to hurryit was almost as if she wanted to be followed had set herself out as bait trolling for anything stupid or hungry enough to bite he kept back as far as he could without losing sight of her the peculiar lurch of his walk wastoo eyecatching even in the leaping uncertain light from the torches burning in front of businesses still open casting shadows that lurched and twisted as awkwardly as he did she circled without fuss about the knots of gambling watermen and porters crouched over piles of bronzes and coppers tossing the bones into lines chalked on the flagging she slowed now and then head cocked to listen to flute and cittern music coming in melancholy brightness from the joyhouses ignored insults flung down at her from idling women hanging out secondstory windows walked more briskly past shops shuttered for the nighta herbalist a shamans den a fishmonger a geengrocer a diviner and others much like these some cookshops were closed for the night others were still open with men standing about dipping noodles and pickled beans and pickled cabbage from clay bowls or crunching down fried pilchards he watched her careless stroll and felt confirmed in his idea she was bait in her own trap maybe shes hungry he told himself and shivered at the thought he dropped back farther his feet dragging for no reason he wondered suddenly where the children were now and then it seemed to him he heard them calling to each other or to the woman but he was never sure and she never responded to the calls wheres she going he muttered and got hoteas elbow in his ribs for an answer that she was heading the way he wanted her to go uphill and vaguely north made him nervous it was just too convenient as hotea said it happens sometimes that everything goes easy for a while but old tungjiis getting together with jahtakash and theyre waiting for you to put your foot in it but he kept limping after her eaten by curiosity and buoyed up by nervous excitement she sauntered past a lighted cookshop the ownercook was leaning on the counter pots steaming behind him tossing the bones with a single customer the two men stopped what they were doing to stare after her then went back to their game talking in low tones discussing the woman probably a shadow drifted from behind the cookshop a moment later a clumsy shift and aituatea saw a part of the shadows face the hulk of his body then the follower was in the dark again djarko he snorted with disgust took the bait like a baby he limped after them careful not to be seen djarkos equally cretinous cousin djamboa had to be somewhere about they hunted as a team he spotted the second shadow and smiled grimly better them than me the godalau grant they satisfy her so shell be ready to listen before she jumps me the woman turned into one of the small side lanes that wound through closepacked tenements of the poorer players artisans and laborers djarko and djamboa turned after her almost running in their eagerness aituatea followed more warily trying to ignore the nips in his shoulder as hotea urged him to catch up and defend the woman from those louts defend her godalau defend me he slowed his uneven gait until he was slipping through shadow near as much a ghost as his sister was avoiding the refuse piles and their uncertain footing gliding over sleepers huddling against walls for the meager shelter they offered from the creeping fog he edged up to blind turns listening for several heartbeats before he moved around them apart from the sodden sleepers the lane stayed empty and quiet inside those tall narrow houses leaning against each other so they wouldnt fall down hina had been asleep for hours most of those living here would have to rise with the sun to get in half a days work before they left for the feteday the players and nightpeople were gone for now though theyd be coming home at dawn to catch a few hours sleep before working the streets to ease coppers from the purses of the swarming revelers hotea pinched his shoulder look she said there huh on the ground there hotea pointed at a filthy alley between two of the tenements aituatea squinted but saw nothing choking over the lump rising in his throat he crept into the alley he kicked against something a body he dropped to one knee and twisted the head around so he could see the face djarko he pressed his fingers against the meaty neck under the angle of the jaw very dead a little farther up the alley he could see another long lump of refuse he didnt bother checking only one thing it could be both dead so fast not a squeak out of them big men stupid but strong dangerous not even a groan he got creakily to his feet and shuffled back from the body step by step lurch and swing soles grating against the hardpacked dirt hotea touched his arm he exploded out a curse swung round and would have fled but for the dark figure standing in his way why follow me she had a deep voice for a woman danger in it he could hear as surely as he heard the pounding of his heart he swallowed his mouth was too dry for speech hotea jigged at his shoulder almost breaking up in her impatience she dug her fingers into him spat a gust of words at him so fast it hurt his head he jerked away from her and flattened himself on the rutted dirt in front of the womans boots she made a soft irritated sound stand up hina i wont talk to the back of your head the sharpness in her voice warned him her patience had narrow limits he scrambled to his feet drinker of souls he said will you listen to me she shook her hair out of her face that silvergray hair that caught the moonlight in slanting shimmers as she moved her head brann she said not that other i dont like it it isnt true anyway aituatea glanced over his shoulder at the blob of dead flesh turned back to the woman saying nothing letting the act speak for him she shrugged i didnt tell them to come after me fish to bait he said and was surprised at his daring im not responsible for all the stupidity in the world she rubbed a finger past the corner of her mouth frowning a little as she looked from him to hotea standing a step behind him you were on the wharf watching me you saw me not me she snapped her fingers a soft whirr overhead then two large horned owls swooped past him low enough he could smell the fogdampness on their feathers they beat up again to perch on the eaves of a house across the street blinking yellow eyes fixed on him he knew then what had happened to the children he straightened out of his defensive crouch keeping his eyes on the womans face so he wouldnt have to look at the owls the man on the mountain said you would come ashore tonight ah then hes still there someone is you want something yes i want you to do something for hotea and me ive got something the old man says you want ill give it to you if youll do a thing for us what thing aituatea fidgeted slanting a quick glance at the owls one of them hooted softly at him not here not safe he dropped onto a knee bowed his head honor my home saхri brann there will be tea once the water boils tea a raised brow a warm chuckle well if theres tea ive an hour or so to kill she smoothed her hand over her hair and whos waiting for me in your home a few ghosts thats all do you mind ghosts i dont mind he nodded and started back down the lane walking slowly and trying to minimize his lurch the woman walking easily beside him theyre family in a way he said she made him nervous and he spoke to fill the silence the owls whirred past gliding low then circling up until they were lost in the fog family all my blood kin except hotea died in the plague ten years ago he turned into a side street heading more directly north theyre company those ghosts though theyre not actual kin they go when their times up but there are always more drowned and killed and suicided to take their places they wont like me a corner of her mouth twisted up the dead never do theyre ready for you i told them i was going to bring you if i could old man been busy about my business hotea and me we went to see him about our problem this mysterious problem mmmh i thought no one would be left to remember me we asked him for help and im it thats what he said they walked in silence past the crumbling houses hotea drifting beside him the tenements degenerated into crowded hovels built of whatever debris their dwellers could find or steal in the distance a baby wailed two men were shouting their words hushed and unintelligible a woman shrieked once and no more but the street they were on was sodden with silence theres a story about where were going aituatea said a score of years ago there was this silk merchant djallasoa he built himself a godon up ahead not far from the wodaan well he sold eternity robes know what those are no well you find yourself some young girls without a blemish on their bodies to weave the silk then get enough strong and healthy pregnant women to embroider the robes so the force of the new life will be transferred to them a thousand gold pieces is cheap for the simplest hundredyear robes thats what old djasoas robes were called even the temueng emperor bought from him talk was you never even caught a cold wearing one of his robes the fog wrapped the three of them in a dreamlike world where the ragged huts on either side of the lane faded in and out with the shifting of the mist djallasoas eldest son was a bit of a fool so the story goes kicked a woda shaman or something like that old dja tried to smooth things over didnt work the woda shaman came ashore built a fire in front of the godon and slit the throats of djas wife and seven children then his own after that there were nine angry ghosts infesting the place no hina priest of any sort could drive them off not even those belonging to the judges of the dead the gods refused to get involved the lane ended he circled a thornbush and began picking his way through the scrub along an unmarked path so familiar he paid little attention to where he was putting his feet and the other woda shamans sat out there on the water enjoying the fuss and refusing to interfere all the eternity robes djallasoa had stowed in that godon no one would chance buying them not with a woda curse on them the wasteland they were passing through was a mixture of thornbush bamboo scattered willow thickets and a few stunted oaks with the fog obscuring detail an arms length away the silence broken only by the drip of condensation from limbs and leaves the crackling of dead branches and weeds underfoot it was like walking through one of the elder laksodeas spiky ink paintings come alive in a dream aituatea had a fondness for laksodea and had several of his paintings souvenirs of successful nights why are you telling me all this he turned to stare at her startled by the acerbity of her words have we much farther to go i have better things to do with this night than spend it wandering through drip and scrub he pointed at the thinning growth ahead to where this stops then a bit farther he rubbed at the side of his neck your pardon saхr and your patience if you will but no one knows where hotea and i live its safer that way and i merely thought to help pass the time with the story if you dont want to hear more oh finish it and lets get on he bowed started walking again guards wouldnt stay around the godon at night the silks inside were safe enough not even eldest uncle wanted to face those ghosts and he was the wildest thief in silili finally old djasoa and the rest of the clan fetched a gaggle of exorcists and deader priests waving incense sticks hammering gongs popping crackers making so much noise and stink they drowned out the ghosts for long enough to haul out the silk the eternity robes they burned in a great fire by the woda well the rest they took away to sell to foreigners whod haul them out of tigarezun the farther the better and the godon was left to rot old djasoa wanted to burn it but the other merchants raised a howl it was an extra dry summer and they were afraid the fired get away from him so he didnt burn it so there it sat empty till the plague you know about the plague you said ten years ago she shook her head pushed aside a branch about to slap her in the face i was half a world away he stepped onto the crescent of land picked clean of vegetation we turn east here it was bad the plague i mean the temuengs ran like rats but they made sure no hina got off utarselt ships out in the bay rammed anyone who tried to leave and they put up barricades on the causeway he pointed out a low broad mass its details lost in the darkness and the fog the woda well this is woda land no one else comes here now when there was sickness in a house the authorities burned it temuengs sent orders in and hina asslickers did the work so when our family started getting sick and oldest grandmother died and hotea knew it wouldnt be long before someone came with fire she sneaked me out and brought me to that old godon figuring the ghosts wouldnt get sick being already dead and would keep snoops away they were getting ragged those woda ghosts already been around longer than most earth souls itd been what ten years more but they made life hard for a few nights we couldnt sleep for the howling the blasts of fear the cold winds that blew out of nowhere the stinks the pinches and tickles but nothing they could do was worse than what was happening outside were almost there you can just about see the godon now hotea had to go out and leave me alone a lot so she could scare up food and clothes for us with nothing to do shut up in that place i started playing with the child ghosts even if they were wodaan and after a while we made our peace with the adults and by the time the wodaan ghosts wore out others moved in with us no one likes ghosts hanging around its a scandal and a disgrace if they can affird it they have the exorcists in to chase the ghost away a loose ghost about the house makes gossip like you wouldnt believe so there are usually a lot of homeless ghosts drifting about they hear about us and come to live in the godon he heard a scrabbling behind him swung around two mastiffs came trotting from the fog and stopped in front of him mouths open in twin fierce grins eerie crystal eyes laughing at him with a shudder he couldnt quite suppress he forced himself to turn his back on them and start walking toward the small door in the back wall but he couldnt forget they were there he could hear the padscrape of their paws imagined a rhythmic panting convinced himself he could feel the heat of their breath on the backs of his legs he shoved the door open and went inside there was a narrow space between the guardwall and the godon itself space filled with clutter slowly rotting back into the earth bits of bone boxes rope paper silk scraps fish bones scraps of canvas old leaves the godon itself was a hollow square with red brick walls and a roof of glazed black tiles shiny with wet drops of condensation dripped from fungusblackened endhorns plopped desultorily into the decay below aituatea dealt with the puzzle lock on a small side door held it open for brann and the mastiffs followed them inside at the end of a cold musty passage moonlight was a pearly flood lighting the open court beyond playing on mist that had crept inside or been sucked in by the breathing of the old godon brann stood silhouetted against it a moment as aituatea pulled the door shut and barred it but was gone by the time he turned around when he reached the end of the passage he saw her standing in the center of the court looking up the moonlight dropping like watered milk on her pale porcelain face the ghosts were diving down at her bits and fragments of mist themselves flicking through her and dashing away she stood quite still letting this happen as if it were a ritual that bored her but one she was willing to endure for the calm she expected afterward the mastiffs were chasing each other and any rats they could scare up in and out of the swirls of fog in and out of the dank caverns of the ground floor bins they came and sniffed at his knees then flipped around and went to circle brann second floor to your left aituatea said and started for the stairs the mastiffs trotted past him and went thumping up the stairs dog mastiff bitch mastiff paw matching paw on the soggy slippery wood aituatea went a short way along the second floor gallery unbarred a door and swung it open the room inside was dark warm odorouscedar and sandalwood lacquer and spices smoldering peat and hot metal from the covered brazier he bowed spread his arms enter my miserable rooms saхri brann he swung around and went into the dark turning back the shutters on the window opening on the court lighting the lamps scattered about on wall and table he dipped water from the covered crock set the kettle on the coals blew them alive came back to his guest brann was settled in a low armchair one leg tucked up under her the other stretched out before her her hands resting on her thighs her hair was darker in the rosy lamplight more gray than silver her eyes were a clear light green like willow leaves in early spring the mastiffs were children again sitting crosslegged at her feet staring with the owleyed directness of real children they had ashblond hair one a shade darker than the other bowlbobbed fine very straight as hed thought before they looked like twins so asexual in these forms that it disturbed him to remember one of the mastiffs had definitely been a bitch my companions she said jaril she leaned forward and touched the head on her right yaril she stroked her hand lightly over the paler head on her left this is a nice little nest tkk friend hina its more than enough to hang you her eyes moved over the scrolls on the walls the jewel rugs on the floor the other fine things visible in the lampglow ill be dead anyway if the temuengs get this far she tapped fingers on her thigh its rather crowded in here he dropped into the chair by the brazier and sat watching her she saw them all that was obvious moonfisher drifting in rags near the ceiling used to be a powerful fishcaller brought in heavy boatloads until a storm caught him and drowned him in sight of land eldest grandmother crouching by the door a tattered patchy ghost shed fade out soon poisoned by a daughterinlaw who was tired of being run off her feet elder brother sitting in front of the window strangled by a sister of the cord when he blundered into a forbidden ritual little brother drowned hovering behind the chair peeking out at the shapechangers the headless woman no one knew about the gambler the dancers the several whores the little sister even the crabby old temueng who sat in gloomy silence in the corner though eldest grandmother started muttering angrily beside the door glaring at brann who ignored her after a flicker of a smile in her direction the others came drifting around her circling gradually nearer one by one they darted to her stroked her tasting her through their fingers as if the taste pleased them they quieted grew content the frazzled edges smoothed away aituatea checked the pot but the water wasnt close to boiling then he sat staring down at his hands reluctant now the time was on him to speak the words that would commit him to the attack on the kadda witch the ghosts gathered around him his family patting him murmuring to him giving what strength and support they could why not get it over with i dont know why you came to sill no she smiled drew her thumb along her lower lip you dont well it doesnt matter theres a kadda witch in the tekoras palace his wife then the mans a fool i wont argue with that anyway shes the one responsible for hoteas drowning we want you to help us get rid of her the tekoras palace she laughed a warm savoring sound and he remembered the way she looked at the gate torches he got to his feet and crossed to the back of the long room going behind the screen that shut off the corner where his bed was the dark red lacquer box sat where hed left it among the hills and hollows of the crumpled quilts he looked at the unmade bed and wondered if hed ever get back bit his lip lifted the box and carried it to brann he set it on the low table by the arm of her chair then backed away he glanced at the brazier but saw no steam and resettled himself in his chair the old man said that would buy you she lifted the box set it on her legs after eyeing it warily a moment she lifted the lid her indrawn breath was a small whispery sound dasn vuor she lifted the black pot from its nest of fine white silk and ran her fingers over it a strange tense look on her face she turned it over and passed her fingers across the bottom his mark she whispered the last firing she set the pot back and lifted one of the cups sat cradling it in both hands that you found this one this one i remember slya bless oh i remember i held this cup in my hand after my father took it from the kiln i went up tincreal with my father we carried the last cups to their firing we stayed there all day and all night and the next day till just after noonsong the first three he took from the kiln he broke they werent good enough this was the fourth he set it in my hand and i knew what perfection was for the first time i knew what perfection was she shook her head as if to clear away fumes of memory old man said it would buy you he repeated those words knowing he was being crude perhaps angering her but he was shocked at seeing her unravel he wanted her to be powerful unshaken by anything as she was when he first saw her otherwise how could she stand against the witch old man hes right damn his twisty soul she eased the cup into its nest and folded the lid shut youve bought me hina ill fight the witch for the pot and for more reasons than youll ever know mmm tell you one thing would have done it without the pot she grinned at him her hand protectively on the lid dont try to take it hack ill bite seriously im a sentimental bitch when i let myself be hina and ive been watching you and your sister you could have worked yourself free of her easily enough a little thought and gathering the coin for an exorcism who would ever know my companions tell me you didnt even think of exorcism i like that well thats enough what are you planning can you climb hotea pinched him so we hear from you again he grumbled with a spitting crackle of indignation she pointed at the steam shooting from under the kettles lid i was born on the side of a mountain that makes the hills round here look like gnat bites brann said and laughed good he chose a teapot he thought of as his garden pot the one with bamboo and orchids delicately painted round the five flat sides as he rinsed the pot he glanced at her her head was against the back of the chair her eyes half closed her hands relaxed on the chair arms he measured out two scoops of black tea added hot water took the pot to the narrow table by the screen set out the shallow dishes for the ghosts why are you doing that her voice came to him lazy relaxed when he looked at her she seemed half asleep for the family he said a wave of his hand took in the hovering ghosts clustering over the bowls lapping up the fragrance he came back to the table filled two cups frowned at the children do they want tea she shook her head no she took the cup he handed her sniffed at the coiling steam mmmm green eyes laughing at him she said steal only the best right he dropped into his chair gulped a mouthful of the tea old man said you and the witch are ancient enemies oh her eyes narrowed do you know her name no yes hotea darted forward yes the other wives they cursed her by name and worse its an odd name cant tell clan or family from it ludila dondi ah the dondi you do know her we met briefly a long time ago not love at first sight she rolled the fivesided cup between her palms she was just a fingerling then but nasty she emptied the cup set it carefully on the table talk young hina im due back on the ship by dawn and ive other games to play she set the box on the table leaned forward her eyes bright with curiosity and anticipation im listening the willows tilted out over the water their withes dissolving into mist the boat was a miniature of the flatbottomed water taxis with barely room for two and a ghost but the children had shifted form again and gone whiffling away as owls brann seated herself in the bow settled the box at her feet on dry floorboards aituatea fumbled at the sodden rope finally working the knot loose his hands were shaking but excitement outweighed his fear with hotea floating at his side he shoved the boat into deeper water and swung in a few minutes later he was propelling them through mist with nothing visible around them but the grayeddown wavelets of dark water kissing the boats sides after half an hours hard rowing hed rounded utars snout and was struggling south along the cliffs the rougher chop on the weather side of the small island making the going hard the fog was patchy shredding in the night wind finally hotea pinched his arm and pointed there she said the nursery garden is up there bout time with brann fending the bow off the rocks he eased the boat through the tumbled black boulders to the beach while brann held the boat he tied the painter to a knob on one of the larger rocks then pulled a heavy cover over it canvas painted with rough splotches of gray and black that would mask the boat shape from anyone chancing to look down as he waded beside brann to the tiny beach the owls swooped down hooted a note of urgency in their cries and swept up again a moment later voices the stomp of feet the sounds of a body of armed men moving came dropping down the cliff brann dodged into a hollow that hid her from above aituatea joined her there all too aware of the heat of her body through the thin silk of her shirt the strong life in her more frightening than arousing how long before they come round again she whispered when hotea was in the palace the round took about an hour no reason to change that plenty of time to get up the cliff the cliff was deeply weathered but most of the hand and footholds were treacherous the stone apt to crumble in spite of that aituatea went up with reckless speed showing off his skill he wasnt a cripple on a cliff he reached the top ahead of brann stood wiping the muck off his hands and examining the garden wall as she pulled herself onto the guard track the wall was twice his height the stones polished and set in what had once been a seamless whole but a century of salt wind and salt damp had eaten away at the cracks opening small crevices for the fingers and toes of a clever climber he kicked off his sandals shoved them in a pocket of his jacket looked at brann then started up as soon as he reached the broad top he crawled along it until he was masked from the nursery door and windows by the bushy foliage brann came up with more difficulty needing a hand to help her over again he felt the burning as his hand closed about hers she smiled at his uneasiness then sat on the wall and pulled on her boots the owls circled overhead dipped into the garden flowing into mastiff form as they touched ground the dogs trotted briskly about nosing into shadow until they were satisfied the garden was empty then they came silently back and waited for brann to come down which she did slithering down the foliage with ease and grace aituatea climbed down as well dropped the last bit to land harder than hed expected limped toward the doors hotea a wisp fluttering beside him though she was silent now he could feel her agitation this was where the witch had caught her sister he whispered scout for us hotea slipped through the wall emerged a few minutes later empty she cried no children no wives no bondmaids all gone not one left her crystal form trembled the bottom of the bay must be solid with bones just as well he took a long slim knife from a sheath inside his jacket slid it through the space between the doors wiggled it until he felt it slip the latch loose and the door swing inward brann touched his arm a jolt like a shockeel swallowing a yelp he looked around let yaril and jaril run ahead he nodded the mastiffs brushed past him and trotted inside their nails making busy clicks on the polished wood floor brann glanced about the garden moved inside silent as the ghost she followed aituatea pulled the door shut behind him and limped after them the air in the maze of corridors was stale and stinking a soup of rottenness thick with the anise hotea had learned to hate mingled with other spices those corridors crawled with shadow and dust rolls that tumbled along the grass mats driven by vagrant drafts that were the only things wandering the palace most of the rooms were empty there were a few sleepers some court parasites men and women drugged by ambition and stronger opiates refusing to know what was happening about them aituatea moved through this deathinlife his fear and reluctance banished by the demands of the moment there was no turning back and a kind of peace in that up one flight of stairs to the public rooms the eerie emptiness was the same the same death smell the same staleness in air that was paradoxically never still they went swiftly through this silence to the stairs leading up to the rooms the tekora kept for himself the mastiffs sat on their haunches beside brann stubby tails thumping against the mat hotea flitted back to them guards she said standing on either side of the tekoras sleeproom door brann touched the corner of her mouth they alert not very hotea said but awake mm means hes inside but is the witch with him ill see before brann or aituatea could stop her hotea flitted back up the stairs tkk young hina pray the dondi is sleeping or not there otherwise your sister could bring the roof down on us she wont think before she does and you think too much eh aituatea ignored that as he gazed up the stairs anxious about hotea seconds later she was back a streak of subdued light plunging down the slant a waterfall of woman ghost halting before them in a swirl of crystal fragments that rapidly reassembled themselves into hoteashape theyre in bed both of them asleep i think i only poked my head in for a second they ate someone tonight the smell of it is sickening thick in there asleep good let them stay that way she led them around beneath the stairs so the sound of their whispers would not carry to the guards she settled herself with her back to the wall waited until aituatea was down beside her squatting fingers rubbing at his sore hip preferring the pain to the thoughts in his head it was almost a sufficient distraction bit of luck brann murmured finding them asleep and sated a quick wry smile not so good for whoever they ate but we cant change that i am very glad indeed that the dondis asleep even so be warned she limits me i dont want to stir up resonances that would wake her too soon when aituatea indicated he didnt understand she sighed but didnt try to explain first thing is taking out the guards she flipped back the edge of her leather vest showed him the twin blades sheathed inside i can pick them off but i cant be sure of silencing them takes time to bleed to death any ideas aituatea nodded reached inside his jacket felt a moment among the pockets sewn into the lining took out a section of nested bamboo tubes carry this for tight holes havent had to use the darts yet but i can hit a hand at twenty paces sister where are they what armor hotea knelt beside him about a dozen paces from the landing my paces not yours she held out her arms wrists pressed together hands spread at an angle thats the shooting angle youll have from the nearest shelter theyre not looking toward the stairway didnt the whole time i was watching them though that wasnt very long she shifted restlessly its a tight shot brother even youll have trouble theyre trussed in studded leather and iron straps and wearing helmets she framed her face with her hands her brow and chin covered thats all you got hands i forgot gloves tungjiis tits they dont make it easy he pulled the tubes out until he had a pipe about a foot long he looked over his shoulder at the dogs they were on their feet crystal eyes bright and interested tongues lolling he breathed a curse brought out a small lacquer box held it in the hand that held the pipe them if i miss can they take out the guards without answering brann pushed onto her feet and went around to the foot of the stairs the mastiffs sniffed at aituateas legs as he stood beside her then went padding up the stairs as quiet as cats slow and flowing so their nails wouldnt click on the wood near the bend in the flight they misted out of shape and reformed into long brindle snakes that flowed silent and nearly invisible up to the landing aituatea followed them up the steps narrowing himself to the need of the moment on the top step he knelt and eased around the corner concealed in the shadow not lit by the lamp suspended above the sundoor picking out gleams in the many layered black lacquer and the gilt sunshape inlaid in both halves of the double door he popped one of his poison thorns in the pipe careful not to touch the gummy tip got a second dart from the box and set it on the floor by his knee ache in his hip forgotten chill in his belly forgotten he focused on the expanse of cheek and sent the dart winging with a hard puff as soon as it was on its way he reloaded the pipe and sent the second at the other guard one then the other slapped at his face eyes popping gave a small strangled gasp and started to crumple aituatea was on his feet and running as soon as he saw the first man waver knowing he wouldnt get there in time to catch both the shape changers flowed up from the floor by the guards feet children again caught the collapsing men and eased them down quietly aituatea touched his brow and lips in a gesture of congratulation they grinned and bobbed their pale shining heads he stepped over a recumbent guard and eyed the double door brushed his hand along the center line felt the door yield a little to the pressure sister he breathed what sort of latch hotea oozed partway through the door then pulled back out turnbolt youll have to cut the tongue he scowled at the gilt sun and hope the noise doesnt wake them some hope brann touched his shoulder he jumped i wish you wouldnt do that she ignored that as foolishness be ready she whispered yaril will throw the bolt for us but her presence in the room will wake the witch the fairer child changed into mist and flowed under the door a second later he heard a muted tunk as the bolt tongue withdrew then a wild piercing yell brann leaped at the door hit the crack with the heel of one hand slamming the doors open she charged in to stand in front of yaril who crouched on the rug eyes steady on the witch ludila dondi arose from the bed her face ugly with rage her naked body yellowed ivory in the dim light like a tiger in her ferocity and the vigorous agility of her leap when she saw brann she checked her lunge along the bed so suddenly she was thrown off balance you she slid off the bed and came toward brann feral yellow eyes fixed on her ignoring the others jaril took yarils hands after a brief silent consultation they rose as spheres of amber fire lighting the room with a fierce gold glow the tekora kicked loose from the quilts and rolled off the bed standing naked as the witch but not so readily awake and alert aituatea watched him with a burning in his belly no old man any longer the temueng was firm fit supple a man in his prime a vigor bought with the blood of his own children a hideous vigor that had cost hotea her life the tekora eyed the two women reached up and with a soft metallic sibilation drew from its sheath the long sword hanging above the head of the bed he swung it twice about his head limbering his arm a glance at aituatea a head shake dismissing the hina as negligible he started for the woman the dondi and brann were moving in an irregular double spiral gradually working closer to each other each focused so intently on the other no one else existed for them hotea fluttered about them turning in wider loops silent but radiating fury the fire spheres vibrated more rapidly then one of them darted straight at the tekoras face he lifted his free hand to brush it aside yelled as his flesh began to blister swung round and swiped at the sphere with the sword slicing through it but doing no damage it settled to the floor in front of him a mastiff as soon as it touched down the dog came at the man growling deep in her throat bitch mastiff yaril aituatea snapped the knife from the sheath up his sleeve sent it wheeling at the tekora it sliced into the large artery in his neck there should have been an explosion of blood and a dead man falling should have been the tekora plucked the knife out easily and flung it away the wound in his neck closed over he lifted the sword and started for aituatea aituatea looked rapidly around caught up a small stool and hurled it at the temueng it caught his elbow his fingers opened involuntarily and the sword went flying to land in the tumbled covers on the bed the yaril mastiff went for his throat but he got his arm up in time and the curving yellow teeth closed on that instead of his neck yaril began gnawing at the arm kicking at his gut with her powerful hind legs aituatea backed off ludila dondi was chanting as she circled a drone of ancient words with a compelling complex rhythm when the doors flew open and he saw her coming up out of the bed he thought she was completely naked but now he saw the mirrors on the silver chain about her neck the tinier mirrors dangling from her earlobes others set in wristlets on each arm she moved her body her arms her head in counterpoint to the rhythm of the words dancing the glitters in a web about herself trying to weave a web about brann brann stalked her avoiding the wild yellow eyes avoiding the mirror lights gradually tightening the spiral firesphere jaril darted at the dondi shattering the rhythm of her lights and each time he dived brann got a little closer the tekora flung off the mastiff his torn flesh closing he threw himself at the bed came curling up with the sword rolled onto his feet again with a grunting roar he charged at brann the mastiff yaril was suddenly a long snake that whipped itself up and around the tekoras legs wrenching him off his feet dissolving before he could cut at it with the sword he still held firesphere jaril came an instant too close to the witch touching one of the mirrors the sphere tumbled through the air melting through a dozen shapes before it was a boy curled in fetal position on the rug his fall distracted the dondi for a second only but it was enough branns hands slapped about the dondis ribs she hugged the smaller woman tight against her caught her mouth held her mouth to mouth muffling the witchs shriek of rage and despair as yaril melted aituatea was on the tekora the foot of his good leg jammed between arm and shoulder hands in a nerve hold on the temuengs wrist the tekora writhed and struggled but couldnt break the hold aituatea dug his knuckles in the tekoras fingers opened aituatea caught the sword as it fell leaped back took the temuengs head off as he surged up the sword answering his will like an extension of his arm he swung it up whirled it about grinning suppressing an urge to whoop but all too fast his elation chilled the tekoras headless body stirred hands groping as it got clumsily to its knees something bumped against his foot the tekoras head mouth working teeth gnashing as it tried to sink them in his flesh he kicked the head away wanting to vomit a hand brushed against him tried to grab hold of him he sliced through the bodys knees kicked the severed legs in separate directions the body fell lay still a moment then the stumps began moving they found no purchase on the silken rug until the torso raised itself onto its elbows and pulled itself toward him he cut off the arms at the elbow groaned as the hands started creeping toward him he kicked them away but they started crawling for him again the kiss went on and on the witch withering in branns armsbut withering slowly too slowly there was too much life in her yaril landed beside jaril changed she reached toward the boy fire snapped between them then jaril was up looking around a look a nod then they joined hands and two firespheres darted into the air they threw themselves at the souldrinker merged with her until her flesh shimmered with golden fire and the three of them finished drawing the life out of the dondi brann dropped the womans husk the fire flowed out of her and divided into two children sated and a bit sleepy she stared down at the thing crumpled at her feet and shuddered aituatea kicked away a creeping hand walked over and stared down at what was left of the kadda witch an ancient mummy leathery skin tight over dry bones never seen anyone deader hotea came from the shadows put her in the water she has to go in the water she rushed to the nearest window and tried to pull the drapes aside but her hands passed through the soft dark velvet she shrieked with frustration and darted back at them in the water she cried enraged brann nodded this ones too strong to he careless of let the water rot her and the tides carry her bones away open the window for me or would you rather carry that she waved a hand at the husk gahh no he stepped over a wriggling leg a crawling hand circled the silently mouthing head pulled the drapes aside and opened the shutters wind boomed into the room cold and full of seatang blowing out the lamp stirring the silken quilts almost snatching the shutters from him it caught at the shorter hair by branns ears teased it out from her face bits of bluewhite fire crackling off the ends she wrinkled her nose brushed impatiently at her hair her hand lost among the snapping lights hold your head on she muttered at hotea who was chattering again and jigging about her she lifted the husk grunting with the effort carried it to the window and eased it through hotea at his shoulder aituatea stood beside her and watched the husk plummeting toward windwhipped water as hotea had half a year ago watched it sink hotea gave a little sigh of satisfaction tapped her brother on the cheek a wife she said mind me now get you a wife brother another sigh and she was gone aituatea rubbed at his shoulder rid of her he stared out the window seeing nothing hed cursed her silently and aloud since shed come back dead and hed cursed her alive and resented her shed taught him most of what he knew stung him into forgetting his short leg scolded him comforted him kept him going when times were bad always there and now he was rid of her alone hina he heard the word but it didnt seem important hina sharper voice a demand for his attention what he turned his head searching vaguely for the speaker that sword the one youve got the death grip on may i see it he looked down he was leaning on the long sword the point sunk into the rug into the floor beneath he had to tug it free before he could lift it he gazed at it remembering the aliveness of it in his hands shook his head not understanding much of anything at that moment and offered it to her she looked down at her hands they glowed softly in the rooms shadowy twilight no better not lay it on the bed for me she hesitated a moment hina let me touch you why apprehensive still holding the sword he backed away from her slyas breath man you think i want more of this in me got too much now listen youre tired sore weve still got to get out of this and down the cliff i can give as well as take youll feel like youve been chewing awsengatsa weed for a few hours thats all all you have to do is take my hand she held out a hand palm up waited he looked at her she seemed impatient his hip was a gnawing pain hed used himself hard this night his shoulders and arms ached he had toothmarks on one foot and cold knots in his stomach the weed huh with no hangover i could use a look at jahtakashs better side he tossed the sword on the bed closed his hand about hers a feeling like warm water flowing into his body gentle soothing heating away his aches and pains washing away his weariness only a breath or two then she was pulling free he didnt want to let go but was afraid to cling to her he opened his eyes i owe the lady of surprises a fistful of incense he looked from the sworda long glimmer on the silk of the quiltto the sheath on the wall above the bed thats what you came to silili for isnt it he climbed on the bed pulled the sheath down and slid the sword into it jumped back onto the floor right the serpents tooth sulinjoas last sword the one he forged for whatshisname your last hina king it always cuts the hand that owns it so the story goes his wife she was supposed to be a demon of some sort she cursed the sword when he quenched it the last time in the blood of their youngest son she took the sword from him no hesitation now pulled it from the sheath clucked at the bloodstains along the blade used the edge of the drape to wipe it clean moving the velvet cloth gently over it then held the blade up to the moonlight clucked again at the marks the blood had left have to work on this once im back on the ship she slid the blade with slow care into the sheath your king took off sulinjoas head with it so hed never make a finer sword for someone else the temueng who made himself emperor he used it on the king and gave it away to a supporter he didnt much like she chuckled that one didnt last long either whod want it with that history aituatea eyed the sword with revulsion then remembered how itd felt in his hand he shook his head the man whos going to pay me five thousand gold for it she looked down grimaced and kicked away the hand that had brushed against her foot no friend of mine which is just as well looks like the curse is still going strong aituatea grunted and went hunting for his knife unwilling to leave any piece of himself in this place when bright light suddenly bloomed about him he glanced up a firesphere floated above him thanks he muttered he found the knife leaning against the side of a cabinet wiped it on the rug and tucked it away the light vanished brann was leaning out the window when he straightened she drew back inside dawns close we better get out of here giggles flitted by aituatea from a shimmering point above the bed fingerlong gold bars silver bars rings and bracelets cascaded in a heap on the silk yours brann said courtesy of yaril and jaril they thought you ought to have some compensation for your latest loss an owl was suddenly in the room hovering over the bed a plump leather sack clutched in its talons its hoots like eldrich laughter it sailed through the window and disappeared into the night a second owl with a second pouch appeared flew after the first aituatea passed a hand across his face disconcerted in the events of the past moments hed forgotten the sense of dislocation that had chilled him when hotea vanished now he resented both things being reminded of that loss and having his feelings read so easily but this was no time for indulging in resentments or grief he shucked a case off one of the pillows raked the gold and gems into it tied the ends in a loop he could thrust his arm through leaving both hands free back the way we came unless you know how to get past the causeway guards she tucked the sword under her arm and started for the door you can take me out to the ship if you will shes due to lift anchor with the dawn the fog was blowing out to sea the wind changing from salt to green the smell of day and land and coming storm on it as aituatea worked the boat toward the willow grove he saw the sky flush faintly red behind the temple roof more than one kind of storm coming he thought when someone steels himself to look into that room and finds the tekora in still wiggling pieces heiyo godalau grant they blame the kadda wife for it since she wont be around no way to tie me to it not now not with hotea all the way gone he tied the boat up splashed through the shallow water to the shore in the distance he could hear drums and rattles the wodaan celebrating the departure of the blind ship drinker of souls youre not a bad sort but i hope i never see you again tungjii bless you though never thought id miss hotea like this aching with loneliness he pushed through the dangling withes and trudged up the slope toward the abandoned godon in the warm and scented room he sat with the brazier providing the only light a bowl of wine in one hand a stone jar of wine on the table beside his feet hed put his dirty bare feet on the table deliberately meaning to provoke eldest grandmother into scolding him the sounds she made in his head were no longer words but they were comfortably familiar he sipped at the wine thinking about brann wondering who the fool was who sent her after that cursed sword he thought about hotea shes right i should find me a wife someone who could stand to live here definitely someone who knows how to keep her mouth shut he stretched out in the chair until he was almost lying flat crossed his ankles and balanced the wine bowl on his stomach not till the storms blown out both storms he took a mouthful of wine let it trickle its warmth down his throat smiled sleepily at the ghosts that were gathering about him he thought he could see some new faces among them but was too lazy to ask its over he thought really over me aituatea i killed the temueng tekora sort of killed him he grinned let me go off a little while and look what happens drunk disgustingly drunk he jerked up spilling the wine looked wildly about hotea her crystal form was hovering over the brazier picking up red light from the coals you got another sister i dont know about i thought you were gone to rest not a chance brother not till i get you safely wed to the right woman she gathered in several female ghosts and led them to surround him listen kellavoes youngest word is her hands are almost as good as mine can strip the eyelashes off a dozing dragon living with her uncle these days since the temuengs hanged her father and you know old kezolavoe meaner than a boar in rut but she doesnt complain good girl loyal to her kin be doing the child a favor getting her away from him ohheh slow down ill take a look at the girl but after the storm if you dont mind sister he got to his feet went to set out the dishes for the ghosts why dont we all celebrate sniff some wine and help me tell the tale of the raid on the tekoras palace he began filling the dishes with wine feeling his body and spirit relax into a familiar irritated contentment plenty of time good friends and a growing family he looked about counted shapes and set out another of the shallow bowls definitely new faces in the mix some hina some temueng and a wodaan he stepped back lifted his bowl to family ties he said old and new the ghosts sighed bathed in the wines fragrance and exuded a contentment to match his own branns questthe flight from arth siva brann sits awake bleeding into memory all the sounds about her water sounds muted shouts from deck and masts ship sounds board and rope talking to the dawn wind sounds sighs and long wails she sits at a small table dawns light creeping in painting images across her body the mix of sound and smell reinforces the quiet melancholy that awakened her and drew her out of bed and to the chair her hair falling about her face the dasn vuor pot held between her hands black deeps on a base as thin and singing as fine porcelain the true dasn vuor from the fireheart of tincreal she breathed on the pot rubbed at the surface with a soft rag whoever had you took good care of you well why not youre a treasure my pot ancient though you are almost as old as me a hundred years more doesnt feel like its been that long the years have flown oh how theyve disappeared she put the rag down and held the pot tilted so she could look down into the black of it seeing images the faces of father brothers sisters cousins uncles aunts of her mother suckling long dead ruan saw herself a thin energetic girl with mousecolored braids leaking wisps of fine hair a long time ago so long she had trouble remembering that brann she drew a finger across the black mirror leaving a faint film of oil behind is the road to arth slya open again are the croaldhine holding the triyear fair in grannsha id like to see it again jupelangi think hes the onesaid you cant step in the same river twice even so id like to see the valley again no matter the changes or the hurt no place for me there but id like to walk the slopes of tincreal again and remember that young brann she smiled with quiet pleasure at chandro shipmaster when he rolled over halfawake more memory sammang my old friend you gave me a weakness for sailing men ive never regretted blinking chandro laced his fingers behind his head and grinned at her his teeth gleaming through a tangle of black the elaborate corkscrews he twisted into his beard at every portcall raveled into a wild bramble bush he yawned savoring these last few minutes in the warm sheets smelling of both of them a musky heated odor that mixed with memory to make a powerful aphrodisiac she started to put the pot down and go to him but the mate chose that moment to thump on the door chuckling chandro rolled out of bed stood stretching and groaning with pleasure as he worked sleep out of his big supple body he patted at his beard looked at her with sly amusement save it for later bramble love wont hurt for keeping she snorted picked up the rag to clean her fingerprints off the pot when he was dressed his beard combed he came over to her and looked down at the gathered blackness in her hands dasn vuor i could get you a thousand gold for that she snorted again and he laughed i know you wouldnt part with it for ten thousand he brushed her hair aside kissed the nape of her neck and went out whistling a saucy tune that brought a reluctant fond grin to her lips quietly content she burnished the pot in the black mirror her womans face framed in white silk hair blurs elongates into a skinny coltish girl with untidy mousecolored braids and grubby hands that look too big for her arms she sits in a grassy glade among tall cedars a sketch pad on her knee jotting down impressions of a herd of small furry coynos playing in the grass on the day of arth slyas destruction tincreal burped brann leaned over and flattened both hands on the grass beside her feeling the rhythmic jolts of the hard red dirt relishing the wildness of the mountain she tossed her drawing pad aside gabbed for a lowhanging limbtip and pulled herself to her feet her eyes opening wide as she felt the uneasy trembling of the tree around her the cedars were groaning and shuddering as the earth continued to shift beneath them and birds spiraling into air stiller for once than the earth a mounting thickening cloud red black blue mottled browns flashes of white chevinks and dippers moonfishers redbirds and mojays corvins tarhees streaks and sparrins spiraling up and up filling the air with their fear she gripped the cedar twigs and needles starting to be afraid herself as the groaning shift of the earth went on and on shivering after an eternity it seemed the mountain grew quiet again the rockfalls stopped the shudderings calmed and slya went back to her restless sleep she opened her hand looked at the sharpsmelling sticky resin smeared across her palm and fingers grimaced ran across the grass to the creekbank and her sunning rock a flat boulder jutting into the water she stood in the middle of it watching the otters peel out of their shaking pile and begin grooming their ruffled fur watching the birds settle back into the treetops leaving the sky empty except for a few fleecy clouds about the broad snowcovered peak of tincreal this was the first time shed been alone on the mountain during one of the quakes that were coming with increasing frequency these warm spring days a warning of bother to come the yongala said pack what youll need if we have to run from her wrath and eldest uncle eornis told stories of his greatgrandfathers time when slya woke before with an uneasy giggle she clapped her hands began the yongalas dance on the rock singing the sleep song to the mountain and the mountains heart arth slya slyas ground to slya who protected who warmed the springs and kept the valley comfortable in winter to slya who made fire for her fathers kilns to slya the sleeping lady powerful protector and dangerous companion slya wakes she sang slya wakes mountain quakes air thickens stone quickens ash breath bringing death slya sleep sleep slya yongala dances dreams for you slya turns stone burns red rivers riot around us day drops dark around us beasts fly men fear forests fry sleep slya slya sleep yongala dances dreams for you at once exhilarated and afraid singing to celebrate and to propitiate brann danced her own fears away then went hunting soapweed to wash the blackened cedar resin off her hands go back start again at the days beginning the last morning arth slya was whole on that last morning that seemed much like any other morning brann came into the kitchen after brealcfast and her morning chores were done gingynexttobaby stood on a stool by the washtub soapweed lather bubbling up around his arms scrubbing at pots and plates he looked round snapped a glob of lather at her you he said hunk its your turn mouse i did em yestereve she wiped the lather off her arm went over to ruffle his short brown curls giggled as he shuddered all over and whinnyed like a little pony then went to the food locker shara mmm her younger sister sat at the breakfast table tending a smallish plant nipping off bits of it stirring the dirt about its roots she was only nine but her choice was clear to her and everyone else she was already though unoficially apprenticed to uncle sabah the fanner and spent most of her days with him now working in the fields silent sunburned and utterly content she set the pot down looked around her green eyes half hidden by heavy lids that made her look sleepy when she was most alert what did mama order more bread from uncle djimis no she held up the hard end of an old loaf well this is all we got left and im taking it she put the bread in her satchel it was stale but uncle djimiss bread had a goodness that stayed with it to the last crumb she added a chunk of cheese and two apples slipped the satchels straps over her shoulder and danced out her long braids bouncing on her shoulders be good younguns she warbled and kicked the door shut on their indignant replies went running through the quiet house to the back porch where her mother sat in her webbing hammock swinging gently back and forth as she nursed baby ruan humming a tuneless wordless song im off brann told her mother anything special you want accyra reached out and closed a hand about branns fingers squeezed them gently take care brambleallthorns the mountains uncertain these days she closed her eyes keeping hold of branns hand hummed some more smiled and looked up coynos as many different views as you have time for some of your other fourfoots im thinking of a tapestry celebrating the mountain she lifted a brow and be back to help with supper brann nodded then clicked her tongue i forgot i was going to tell shara to order some more bread ive got the last in here she patted the satchel shall i stop in at uncle djimiss on my way out her mother lifted heavy eyelids and sighed ill never remember it without cairn here to remind me what do we need well a couple loaves of regular bread and some honeynut rolls for breakfast tomorrow hmmmm please her mother chuckled all right a dozen honeynut rolls tell shara to fetch them before you leave thanks mum she started toward the door be just a little careful whirlwind dont let the mountain fall on you wont she dashed back through the house stuck her head into the kitchen shara mama says you should fetch the bread and stuff went charging on through the house singing wont wont wont let the mountain fall on me wont wont wont but went more sedately down the white sand road waving to uncles and aunts and cousins by courtesy and blood who passed her walking along to the workshops that lined the river uncle migel was at his forge a pile of work already finished it was his day to turn out all the finicky little bits the valley needed nails and rivets arrow points fishhooks scissor blades screws and bolts and suchlike his apprentices were scurrying about like ants out of a spilled nest the two elder journeymen wreathed in clouds of steam ehbramble he boomed bring your old uncle a drink she tossed her braids impatiently at the delay but valley rules definitely dictated courtesy to adults she lifted the lid off the coolcrock her fathers apprentice immer had made and brought migel a dripping dipperful he gulped down most of it and emptied the rest over his thinning black hair made your choice yet bram times getting short she nodded he pulled a braid grinned at her not talking eh he laughed when she looked stubborn his breathy allover laughter then sobered on the mountain are you good venstrey there he jerked his head at one of the journeymenthe wants a sleeping otter for the hilt of a knife hes working on stretched out straight mind you one curled up nose to tail would make an odd sort of hilt she nodded hung the dipper he gave her by the thong in its tail and went on down the road as she came kalumping down uncle djimiss steps her mothers apprentice marran rounded a corner of the house with a pair of hot sweet rolls ehbram catch he looped one of them at her she stretched up to catch the rolland nearly fell off the bottom step keeping her face out of the dust with a flurry of arms and legs a clownjig that didnt improve her temper marran you idiot you make me break my neck and ill haunt you the rest of your days he gave her his slow sweet smile but said nothing he seldom had much to say but few valley folk male or female young or old could resist that smile this was his third year in arth slya and he was settling in nicely her mother said he was going to be the best weaver and tapestry maker arth slya had seen in an age of ages if her mother did decide to make a mountain tapestry using branns sketches itd be marran who drew the cartoon and did much of the work hed turned fifteen only a month ago and was young for it but her mother was planning to make him journeyman on the centenary celebration for eldest uncle eornis branns choice day her eleventh birthday going to be a busy day she kicked some sand sneaked a glance at marran who grinned when he caught her at it then went stalking away down the road stuffing the roll into her satchel hmphing and grumping halfannoyed and halfdelighted at the attentions he kept pushing on her her mother and some of the aunts were beginning to plan things she caught them time after time looking at her and marran with heavy significance that made her want to bite she climbed to her fathers workshop and looked inside cousin immer was in one of the rooms fussing over designs for a set of plates one of the uncles wanted for his daughters marriage chest problem was the uncle and the daughter had very different notions of what each wanted and immer who was inherently kind was struggling to design something both would agree on he was a fusser and sometimes snappish but brann was very fond of him even when he was impossibly busy he always found time and patience for a pesty little girl she went to stand at his elbow watching him patiently flowing color into outlines he was putting the same design through various color combinations to show the embattled pair she patted his arm slya bless maybe this will work he sighed if it doesnt i surrender bramble the yongala can arbitrate for i dont think either will settle for less she patted his arm again and went to putter about the workshop cleaning tools straightening the storage niches sweeping up the small accumulation of dust and the large accumulation of cobwebs enjoying herself no one to fuss at her for getting in the way no impatient older brother chasing her out as she maneuvered the pile of debris toward the door the floor trembled and sent dust jiggingonly a tiny twitch of the mountain soon over sleep slya slya sleep she sang as she pushed the pile of dust and scraps together again swept it out the door enjoying the bright crisp morning she stood in the doorway looking up through the green lace of birch leaves to a sky clear as the water in the creek singing past the workshop she breathed the cool air shook the broom and leaned it against the wall fetched her satchel and went climbing up the creek hopping from rock to rock heading for her favorite sunning place where the boulder pushed the creek aside she could lie there her head hanging over the edge and watch the bright fish dart about or sit watching her fourfoots coming down to drink when she was sitting still as the stone beneath her even the fawns came down with their mothers and played on the grassy banks on the morning of arth slyas destruction she sat on the stone and watched bright blue moonfishers darting about in a screaming fight two after the flapping fish in the talons of a third it seemed to brann they always found more delight in stealing from each other than in catching fish for themselves though to have those thieving fights some moonfisher had to abandon principle and snag his own fish when the fight was over and the triumphant moonfisher flew off with his prize she dipped up water and splashed it over her face the sun was starting to get a bit too hot she moved into the glade where the shadows were cool and the air tangy with cedar took out her sketch book and waited for the family of coynos that usually showed up about this time on arth slyas last day the mountain twitched and growled and sent rocks sliding and brann grew afraid calming her fear with the ritual dance the sleep song then went to wash the blackened cedar resin off her hands once her hands were clean she wandered about the slopes of tincreal too restless to sketch she missed her father she loved her mother and knew she was loved in return but her mother wasnt company in the same way she was mostly absorbed by her work and the new baby ruan firehair who slept in a basket beside the loom listening to the hiss and thump as brann had listened when she was a baskling breathing in time to the sounds of the weaving lulled to sleep by this constant comforting song brann was jealous of ruan and hated the feeling knew fairly well what the rest of her life was going to be and rebelled against accepting that needed time for herself knew the folk were letting her have it and was furious at their complacent understanding in the valley everyone knew everyone elses business knew what each would do in just about every circumstance before even he or she knew her eleventh birthday was a month and a half away the time of choosing it fell on the same day as eldest uncles his hundredth and there was going to be a grand celebration and she would share it and at the end of it she would announce her choice for her lifework and just about nobody would be surprised life in arai slya was pleasant even joyful when you felt like fitting in but when you didnt it was like a pair of new boots blistering you as it forced you into shape her father and her two older brothers had left with the packtrain going to grannsha for the triyear fair shed wanted to go with them but her mother was stuck here with a baby too young to travel and brann couldnt go if her mother didnt she thought it was stupid that she couldnt go but no one else saw things her way not that she made a great fuss about it for this was the last summer she could spend free the last summer before she was officially apprenticed with all the work that meant the last summer she could ramble about the mountain watching animals and all the other life there sketching in the book uncle gemar the papermaker had sewn together for her with the ink and the brush aunt seansi arth slyas poet and journal keeper had taught her how to use and make from her sketches her mother had woven for her a kneelength tunic with frogs and dragonflies in a lively frieze about the hem dark greens browns and reds on a pale graygreen ground as time passed others found worth in her drawings sjiall the painter and screenmaker saw her plant and insect studies and went into the mountains himself searching for more such her father and immer let her design some of their embellished ware uncle migel seized on several drawings of otters and wolves and graved them into his swords and knives and sent her back to the slopes with specific commissions uncle inar the glassmaker and idadro the etcher and inlayer added her notes to their traditional forms she could choose for any of them they told her so thinking about their praise made her flutter with pleasure though she was irritated and sometimes unhappy about the life laid out for her in the valley she found the outside world frightening what little she knew about it from candidates who made their way to the valley repelled her very few girls came and those that did had stories to put a shudder in back and belly she watched the boys shivering at a scold or turning sullen with shaking but suppressed violence watched the way they guarded their possessions and thoughts their despair if they werent taken as apprentices even those candidates accepted took several years to open out and be more or less like everyone else another thingsince the last fair the trickle of younglings into the mountains had dried up entirely the valley folk came back from that fair with rumors of trouble and reports of a general uneasiness on the plains legates from the mainland were in grannsha making demands the kumaliyn could not possibly satisfy so the stories went still no one expected trouble to come to arth slya they were too isolated and hard to get to there was no road most of the way only a rugged winding track that no one in his right mind would try to march an army along she wandered back to her boulder sat eating one of her apples and watching the antics of otters whod made a mudslide for themselves and were racing about sliding splashing uttering the stuttering barks of their secret laughter her hand dropped in her lap as the otters abruptly broke of their play and darted into the trees two shines like smears of gold painted on the air flickered about the treetops then came jagging down the stream switching places over and over dropping close to the water darting up again she stared at them fascinated by their flitter and their glitter and their eerie song a high swooping sound alternately fast and slow sometimes unbearably sweet she sat on her heels smiling at them bits of sun come to earth they jerked to a halt as if theyd somehow seen her swooped at her swinging closer and closer in tightening circles then darted at her plunged through her again and again she gave a tiny startled cry collapsed on the warm stone she woke as suddenly as she went down a few heartbeats later two children sat on the creekbank watching her from shimmering crystal eyes pale little creatures with ashblond hair bowlbobbed silky very straight one head a shade darker than the other they were so alike she didnt know how she knew the darker one was a boy and the other a girl they wore shirts and pants like hers and apart from those eerie inhuman eyes were much like any of the children running about the valley below the girl smiled gravely at her im yaril thats jaril youre brann brann pushed up until she was sitting on her heels again i didnt tell you my name yaril nodded but didnt answer the implied question jaril wasnt listening he was looking at everything with an intensity that made brann think hed never seen anything like blue sky and wind blowing cedars about and butterflies flitting over the stream and dragonflies zipping back and forth otters crouching across the creek black eyes bright and curious fish coming up to feed breaking the water in small plopping circles whered you come from whore your folks yaril glanced at jaril rubbed at her small straight nose we are the mountains children huh born of fire and stone yaril said sounding awed portentous brann eyed her skeptically dont be silly its true sort of yaril stared intently at brann little fingers began tickling the inside of branns head she scowled brushed at her face dont do that she pushed onto her feet jumped onto the grass and began circling around them dont be afraid brann yaril got hastily to her feet held out her small hands please dont be afiaid we wont hurt you jaril tell her brann kept backing away until she reached the trees then she wheeled and fled into shadow behind her she heard the high sweet singing of the sunglows a moment later bits of yellow light were dancing through the trees ahead of her the patches of light touched down to the red soil changedand yaril stood with jaril waiting for her she turned aside and ran on blind with terror the shivering song came after her the shimmers swept through her caressing her stroking her inside and out gentling her trying to drive the fright from her she collapsed in the dirt dirt in her mouth and nose and eyes the last thing she remembered the taste of the mountain in her mouth she woke with her head in jarils lap yaril kneeling beside her stroking her forehead she tried to jerk away but the boys arms were too strong even if she couldnt quite believe in the reality of those arms she lay stiff as a board waiting for them to do with her whatever theyd planned hush yaril said hush brambleallthorns dont be afraid of us we need you but we cant help that we wont hurt you please believe me jaril patted her shoulder we need you we wont hurt you he said his voice a twin of his sisters a shade deeper than hers as his hair was a shade darker he grunted as the mountain rumbled and shifted beneath them the third quake that day you ought to warn your folk brambleallthorns this hills getting ready to blow mmmmh in your terms slyas going to wake soon with a bellyache and spew her breakfast over everything around brann wiggled loose got shakily to her feet she looked for the sun but it was too low in the west to show over the trees sheee its late mama will snatch me bald she started downhill over her shoulder valley courtesy demanding it she said come on its almost supper you can eat with us mama wont mind the children caught up with her as she reached the stream and started down along it about that supper yaril said we dont eat your kind of food maybe i should explain she broke off and looked at her brother not time yet i dont agree you know why oh all right i suppose it is a big gulp to swallow all at once yaril blinked as she met branns eyes and realized she was listening withconsiderable interest pardon us she said we forget our manners well join you gladly if not for supper and warn your people about the mountain you keep fussing about that slyas waked other times we know her moods weve lived with her a thousand years and more she began hurrying through the lengthening shadows taking care where she put her feet jumping from rock to rock flitting across grassy flats sliding on slippery brown needles keeping her balance by clutching at trees she scooted past landing with running steps on the path that led from the high kilns down to the workshop when she reached the workshop she ran up the steps pushed the door open immer suppertime no answer puzzled she went inside ran through the rooms no one there that was funny she clattered down to the children beginning to worry immer always worked until the light quit always the way to the valley was broad and beaten down from here on passing out of the trees at lookwide point then through a double switchback to end at the landing on the river a cold knot in her stomach brann hurried along the road but slowed as she came out of the trees walked to the edge and looked down into the valley she could see most of it spread out before her the river running down the middle the scattered houses and workshops the fields with crops cows sheep or horses in them even the broad patch of bluish stone that was the dance ground with the galarad oak growing on the western side the one brann thought must be the biggest and oldest tree in all the world there should have been children playing on the white sand road and in between the houses there should have been workers coming in from the fields others standing by the workshops there should have been old folk sitting on benches by the river to catch the last of the days heat the first of the evenings cool chatting and telling stories hands busy at small tasks but there was none of that soldiers were herding her folk onto the dance ground where the valley daughters were due to meet with the yongala to dance the mountain back to sleep brann ground her teeth together to stop her jaw from trembling but the shake had gone deep into the bone she closed her eyes she couldnt bear to see more thats why slyas restless theres no one to dance her pains away she thought and felt a kind of relief easier to think of slya than dance her pains away and ease her back to sleep yes yes thats it slya dreamed this and sent her children she turned her head opening her eyes when she was looking away from the valley gazed at yaril and jaril they are the mountains children slya sent them she clenched her hands into fists the shaking wouldnt stop jerked her head around to look into the valley again cant see got to get closer away from the road harrags leap yes thats it where the mountains squeezed the valley waspwaisted not far from the dance ground was a vertical wall of granite arth slya folk called harrags leap after the smith who went crazy one day a few hundred years ago swore he could fly and jumped off the cliff to prove it brann plunged back into the trees running as fast as she could without falling it wouldnt be so good to break a leg up here whod ever come looking for her finally breathing in great sucking gasps she flung herself down on the flat top of the cliff and looked over the rim she was close enough to make out the faces of those crowding onto the dance ground close enough to hear what was being said but outside of a few orders from the soldiers no one was saying much they looked as bewildered as she felt why was this happening who would gain anything from bothering arth slya her mother was there holding ruan looking angry and afraid mama brann breathed suddenly she wanted to be with her mother she couldnt bear being up here watching she wanted to be down there with her uncles and cousins and aunts kin by kind if not blood sobbing she started to get up but two pairs of hands held her where she was you cant do her any good if you get caught one of the children was speaking she couldnt tell which think bramble your mothers probably rejoicing because youre out here on the mountain at least she knows youre safe look bramlet look close where are the children do you see gingy or shara do you see anyone your age or younger except for little ruan in your mothers arms she shuddered went limp they let her go and she scanned the crowd below gunna barr amyra caith a dozen other younglings but they were all fifteen or more past their choice nobody younger except ruan and even as she watched one of the tall blackhaired invaders shoved his way to her mother took ruan from her kicked her feet from under her when she fought to get her baby back elbowed and slammed his way out of the crowd drawing blood with the clawed back of his gauntlet and as she watched yaril and jaril crowding close to her holding her the soldier carried ruan to the galarad oak and he took her by the heels and dashed her against the broad trunk held her up shook her slammed her once again against the tree harder then tossed her on a heap of something brann had missed before the bodies of the valleys children she trembled she couldnt make a sound she couldnt cry couldnt anything couldnt even feel anger she was numb she kept looking for faces she knew the old were gone like the children the young and strong they were all there some with bandages on arms and legs men and women alike one or two sitting heads on knees none of the old ones yongala cerdan wasnt there ancient uncle gemar who made her sketchbooks wasnt there eornis who shared her birthday he wasnt going to see his hundred after all lathan sindary fearlian frin tislish millo and on and on a long litany of grief a naming of the dead she didnt understand why what could they gain why she watched soldiers going in and out of the houses driving out anyone trying to hide plundering the houses and workshops destroying far more than they carried away why what kind of men were these who could do such things she watched a knot of them kicking and beating uncle cynoc who was speaker this year yelling to him about gold where was arth slyas gold he tried to tell them they had it all the bits inar and idadro and migel had for inlaywork and decoration they didnt listen when they got tired of beating him one of the soldiers stuck a sword in him and left him bleeding dying she watched another knot of soldiers pulling some of the women her mother among them from the dance ground the children tried to get her away but she clutched at the rock and wouldnt move watched the things the invaders were doing to her mother and the others she whimpered but wouldnt look away from the devastation below watched the deaths and worse some of the acts so arbitrary and meaningless that they seemed unreal so unreal she almost expected the bodies to stir and walk away when the play was over as they did in the magic battles at the equinoxes battles that ended with allnight dances and cauldrons of mulled cider and a feast the next day but these dead stayed dead bloody dolls with all the life pressed out of them night settled over the valley obscuring much of what was still happening down there doing nothing to block the sounds that came up the cliff to brann she listened shuddering as shed watched shuddering again the children tried to get her away from the cliff edge but she wouldnt move and they couldnt move her all night she lay there listening even when there was no more to listen to only a heavy silence under her numbness resolve grew in her there had to be a reason for what was happening in her memory a gilded winged helmet a bloodred cloak a glittering figure moving through the drabber browns and blacks of the rest he it was who by a nod had given consent to the use of her mother and the other women who had supervised the looting of the houses and shops who had stood by while her folk were roped together in groups of eight then herded into the meeting hall to spend the night how they could he knows she thought i have to make him tell me somehow i have to make him tell me as the night dragged on yaril then jaril went somewhere came back after a short stretch of time brann was dully aware of those departures but had no energy even to wonder where they went she huddled where she was and waitedfor what she had no idea she wasnt thinking or feeling just existing as a stone exists she got very cold when the dew came down but even that couldnt penetrate the numbness that held her where she was the night grayed reddened some of the soldiers went into the meeting hall brought out two ropes of women her mother among them brann strained to see through the dawn haze her mothers shirt and trousers were torn tied about her anyhow she moved stiffly there were bruises on her face and arms her face was frozen but brann could see the rage in her shed only seen her mother angry once when a new apprentice who hadnt learned valley ways yet jumped branns oldest brother cathor over some silly thing but that was nothing to the fury in her now once they were cut loose the women were put to fixing food for the soldiers and later for the captives the morning brightened slowly the smells of the food reached brann and her stomach cramped yaril went off a few breaths and came back with food theyd stolen for her for some minutes she stared at the bread and cheese the jug of buttermilk hungry as she was it felt horrible to be eating with the things that kept replaying in her head things she knew shed never forget no matter how long she lived yaril patted her shoulder eat she said you need your strength little bramlet wouldnt you like to get your mother and the others free of those murderers how can you do that if youre fainting on your feet youre a practical person brambleallthorns theres nothing wrong with eating to keep up your strength brann looked from one pale pointed face to the other you think i really could get them looser yaril nodded she fidgeted a moment seemed to blur around the edges but her nod was brisk and positive with our help well show you how brann took a deep breath and picked up the jug at first it was hard to swallow and her stomach threatened more than once to rebel but the more she got down the better she felt as she finished the hasty meal the movements below began to acquire shape and order the soldiers lining up the ropedtogether villagers getting pack mules and ponies loaded and roped together yaril whispered to brann you want to make them pay you can let them go ahead its five days out of the mountains well help you get ready let them go thinking they won listen to us well tell you how you can make them pay for what theyve done soft nuzzling whispers as brann watched the soldiers take brands from the fires and toss them into the houses along the white sand road as she watched them march away the roped slaves forced to march with them the laden packers ambling along behind brann huddled where she was breathing hard almost hyperventilating while the leader mounted his horse and started off at an easy walk and the soldierpacemakers voice boomed through the crisp morning all sounds magnified the flames crackling the scuffing thud of marching feet the jangle clink of the soldiers gear the rattle of the small cadence drum that took over for the pacemakers voice she wrapped her arms about her legs and sat listening until the sounds muted and were finally lost in the noises of river and wind then she lifted her head how yaril and jaril gazed at each other for a long breath finally yaril nodded and turned to brann theres a lot for you to forgive we said we wouldnt hurt you bramble but well youll have to decide how much harm we did out of ignorance and need she coughed and her edges shimmered as they had before brann clenched her hands until her ragged nails bit into her palms bit her lip to keep from crying out at this dallying in no mood to sympathize with yarils embarrassment we changed you yaril went on keeping to her deliberate pace though she had to see brands impatience we had to we dont say it was right or a good thing to do but we thought it was the only thing to do you were the first thinking being we saw in this reality we didnt mean to come here we were borne into your realityyour worldby accident through fire i know im not making sense just listen theres no hurry well catch up with them easily enough listen brann you have to understand or you cant you cant deal with what we made you and we cant change that now were melded brann a whole now three making one we came through the heart of fire changed brann among our own kind were children too unfinished malleable think how youd feel brann if you woke one morning without a mouth and could only suck up food and water through your nose and your hands were gone how would you feel with hunger cramping your stomach and food all around you that you couldnt touch how would you feel knowing you would fade and die because you couldnt eat and then if something inside you something you knew to trust said that person will feed you but only if you change her in such and such a way what would you do yaril shimmered again her crystal eyes glowing in the morning light pleading for understanding brann moved her lips no sound came at first finally she said youre demons no no just another kind of people think of us as what we said the mountains children truly we were born through her where we oh call it began where we began we ate things like sunlight umm and the fires at the heart of things we cant do that anymore brann pressed her hand against her stomach licked her lips swallowed you youre going to eat me no no you didnt listen you have to know this maybe itd be better to show you once again she exchanged a long glance with her brother once again she nodded turned to brann wait here bramble when we drive a beast from the trees take it between your hands and drink brann shuddered its blood no its life just will to take yaril got to her feet youll know what i mean when you touch the beast its coded into you now she flowed into the form of a large boarhound and trotted into the trees jaril shifting also and trotting after her brann sat feeling cold and horrified at the thought of what she was going to have to do she heard the hounds haying somewhere in the distance then coming closer and closer then they were on the stone driving a large young coyno toward her in a blind panic it ran at her and if she hadnt caught it would have run off the lip of the cliff without thinking acting from new instinct she mcved faster than she thought she could trapped the lean vigorous body between her hands and did what yaril told her willed to take a wire of warmth slid into her heating her middle in a way she found deeply disturbing though she couldnt have put into words why it was so in seconds the coyno drooped empty between her hands she looked at it wanted to be sick sent it wheeling over the edge of the cliff then she remembered the soldier tossing ruan on the hill of dead children and was sorry she put her hands over her face but found no tears the male boarhound picked his way over the rough stone and pushed his cold nose against her arm by habit she stroked her hand along the brindle silk of his back scratched absently behind his soft floppy ears thats the way its giiing to be the hound whined brann scrubbed her fist across her eyes im all right dont worry worry i spose you do or you wouldnt explain youd just make me do things what now was that enough or will you need more go ahead im going to think about it like cleaning chickens for supper go chase some more beasts here ill sing the blessing while youre gone she looked over her shoulder at the cliff edge and swallowed tightened her hand into a fist again slya says all life is sacred all death must be celebrated and mourned she spoke gravely feeling the weight of custom falling on her thin shoulders jaril rubbed his head against her arm and trotted off after his sister a day and a night and a day passed brann and the children learning the rules of their new unity a day a night and a day gathering the lives of small beasts and large joining hands to share that feeding brann shunting aside grief rage impatience fearexcept in dreamtime when memory turned to nightmare the children scavenging for gear and food tending the stock when brann remembered the need the cows will dry up she said cant you do something bramlet they said were only two at least the beasts will be alive a day and a night and a day drifted past and then another night when the sun rose clear of the horizon she started after her folk brann rode a wild black werehorse down the mountain black mane stinging her face brother and sister melded into one carrying her and the gear theyd salvaged from the gutted houses down the mountainside going like the wind brann as wild and exhilarated as the great beast under her down the mountainside through the bright cool morning lovely lustrous morning though arth slya was dead and lost day ought to weep sun ought to lurk behind a thick weight of cloud trees ought to droop and sigh river to gloom and gray but it was not so and no more than day and mountain and sky could she mourn she thrilled at the driving power of the great muscles between her legs muscles fed as she was with the lives of wolves and coynos she laughed aloud and laughed again when the werehorse bugled its delight late that afternoon they came to the first of many cataracts the werehorse stopped beside a stormfelled ash slowly rotting back into the earth collapsed into brindle boarhounds after brann swung groaning down sore muscles protesting chafed thighs burning the hounds walked out of saddle and gear and trotted away brann stretched and groaned some more then went through the gear found the hatchet and went about collecting downwood for a fire wobbling on legs that felt like wet noodles splaying her knees to keep her thighs apart when she had the fire going and the kettle dangling from an improvised tripod she stripped off her clothing and found an eddy by the ash trees roots where she wouldnt be swept away she sat on a waterpolished root dabbling her feet in the river watching the roughened redness inside her thighs fade to pink the pink to the matte white of healthy skin shed burned her finger getting the kettle to hang properly from the tripod the burn blister had dried and as she watched the dry skin cracked and peeled away leaving no sign at all of the burn some change she thought she slipped off the root dunked herself all the way under crawled out of the water stretched her dripping body along the hard white wood of the ash trees trunk the sun warm and welcome on her back and legs dozing there until a hiss from the fire told her the tea water was boiling she pulled her clothes back on feeling a mild curiosity about when the children would return a curiosity that faded as she made the tea she sat with the hot drinking bowl hugged between her hands her face bent to the fragrant steam rising from the tea her fathers work that bowl with the goodness her father put in everything he made she sipped at the tea listening to the cries of the hunting hounds wishing her father were there sitting beside her on the ash trunk sipped again trying to wash away the lump in her throat dismissing the horrors thinking instead of the good times when her father took his impling to his workshop with its smells of dry clay and wet clay of powders and glaze mixes cedar cabinets and oak tables the whirring of wheels thuds of the kicks that kept the wheels going immers humming another apprentices sweet whistling jokes tossed about laughter shoutssounds and smells set as deeply into her as the thumps and clacking of her mothers loom her mothers tuneless burring songs good times when she shared her birthdays with ancient uncle eornis and he fed her cake and cider and told her the exciting scary stories she loved tough old man should have lasted a dozen more years everyone in the valley was making something special for him shed done an ink drawing of moonfishers in a scream fight her father spent two years on his gift a dasn vuor pot and a hundred dasn vuor drinking bowls one for each year of the old mans life he broke pot after pot until he was satisfied broke bowl after bowl most of them looked fine to brann but he pointed out their imperfections made her see them as he did feel them patient with her until she finally understood what he was talking about and when he took the last bowls from the firing he broke three but wiped the fourth carefully and set it in her hands she looked deep and deep into the black luster that seemed to drink the light rejoicing in the shape that had the rightness of the galarad oak or the yongala dancing when slya filled her a rightness that whispered deep within as if a light was kindled inside her she knew why her father could judge so quickly and surely the worth of his work shine and whisper filling her she felt as if she should hook her toes under something or she might just float away her choice was made more than anything in all the world she wanted one day to make a thing as right as the bowl cradled in her hands she gave it back to her father and sighed he put it carefully into its nest of silk then caught her up lifted her high swung round and round and round with her laughing and proud his spirits suddenly released as his labor was finished at last astonished and enraptured by what his hands had made rejoicing at her choice he might never do anything quite as splendid again and it was somehow fitting that his daughter marked it with the gift of her life yet more fitting that his greatest work was born of love and celebration and not done for gold she refilled the bowl and gulped at the tea burning her tongue with it squeezing her eyes shut to hold back tears he cant have it i wont let him cant have them remembering with helpless fury soldiers carrying things from her home the chest with the dasn vuor pot the chest with the hundred bowls the temueng pimush in the gilded helmet hovering over them with a hungry look putting his hands on them claiming them no the hounds bellowing grew louder closer brann put the bowl down stood crouched waiting a yowling spitting black beast ran from the trees swerved when he saw her a malouch with claws that could strip the flesh from a tough old boar he yowled again and switched ends but the hound bitch was too fast for him dodging the claw strike with a speed that blurred her shape into a brindle streak she tore at his hind leg sprang away again as soon as yaril distracted him brann leaped slapped a hand against the side of his head the malouch writhed around his claws raking her arm then he froze as she started the pull a black statue of hate unable to move unable to make a sound ignoring the blood and pain from her torn arm brann set her other hand on him his life flooded into her hot and raw terrible and terrifying waking in her that queasy pleasure that she hated but was starting to need at last the malouch was a scrap of fur and flesh melting from between her hands children again jaril and yaril took branns hands and the fire passed from her she began to feel clean again though some of it remained with her the malouch had clung to life with a fury that saddened and sickened her and she wanted to rid herself of everything shed taken from him she tried to hold onto the children tried to force all of that stolen life out of her but they melted and flowed through her fingers and flitted away to shimmer over the scatter of gear then they merged and the werehorse was snorting and stamping impatiently the children eager to be on their way she drew her fingers down the torn arm the wounds were already closed ragged pink furrows visible through the rents in her sleeve with the knife from her belt sheath she cut away the bloody rags she tossed the sleeve into the fire thought a minute cut the other sleeve to match she knelt beside the river and washed away the dried blood by the time she was finished the furrows had filled in even the pink flush was gone she looked at the arm a moment then bent again scooped up water splashed it over her face drank a little the children melted apart and moved beside her throwing questions demands pleas at her as she walked about the glade kicking leaves over the body of the malouch smoothing out the rips in the sod he made with his claws repacking the saddlebags with slow meticulous care dismantling the tripod dousing the fire burying the blackened bits of wood she said nothing to them refused stubbornly to acknowledge their presence walked heavily to the riverbank and sang the mourning song for the malouch and for the wood she burned sang the praises of the living river the living forest a week ago she would have done all thisrestored the land sung the praisesbecause shed done similar things a hundred times before because she rested comfortably in the support of ancient custom this time it was a way to shout at the murdering invaders that nothing was changed that arth slya still lived as long as one of slyas children lived and followed slyas way when she turned away from the river the werehorse was waiting beside the fallen ashtree she saddled him tossed the bulging bags in place tied on the spade and hatchet then stepped onto the ash and pulled herself onto his back he trotted to the track did a few caracoles to loosen up then started racing down the mountain once again crystal eyes having no trouble with the thickening shadow down and down until she saw a body flung beside the track a boy huddled round a gaping wound in his chest she screamed the horse to a halt flung herself down and ran back kneeling beside the boy she pressed him over marran she whispered she brushed dirt and leaves from his face his eyes were open dull shrunken she tried to shut them but her hands fumbled uselessly behind her the horse stomped impatiently then whickered and nudged her with his nose stop it she said dont bother me she gave up trying to straighten marran sat on her heels and looked about her tongue caught between her teeth yaril came round her squatted beside manans body he put his hand on the boys face drew it back dead over a day brann nothing you can do brann blinked slowly brushed a hand across her face its marran she said she got to her feet help me fetch wood with clumsy hands she untied the hatchet from the fallen saddle and started away weve got to burn him free she cast about for dry downwood yaril and janl ran beside her trying to talk to her were getting close to the temuengs its dark theyll see any fire big enough to burn a body hes dead how much can it matter when you put him on a pyre free your people and let them take care of him brann bramlet brambleallthorns it wont take that long if we go on now you can have them free by dawn back here before dusk come on brann brann shook her head her mouth set in a stubborn line she wasnt going to be stymied from doing what she clung to as right if she let one thing go the rest might slip away from her little by little bewildered and uncertain alone with nothing but memory to guide her all she could do was hold by what she did know that this was marran that she owed him his fire she trembled her knees threatening to give way caught hold of the branch waving in her face wood yes she pulled the limb taut and lifted the hatchet one of the children made an irritated humming sound then they were both in front of her holding her by the arms taking the hatchet from her she tried to pull away but their hands were locked to her as if their flesh was melded to hers their fire came into her it pinned her in place as if her feet had grown roots she cried out tried again to wrench free they held her the fire held her frightened and frantic she writhed against that double grip until yarils words finally seeped through her panic wait wait listen to us bramlet listen we can help you listen well help we understand listen she grew quiet breathing heavily the grip on her arms relaxed movement restored to her she licked dry lips listen let us make fire for you wha go back sit by the boy and wait well make a hotter cleaner fire for your friend bramble hell burn in mountain heart wouldnt you rather that than green and smoky wood she looked from one small pale face to the other the drive went out of her she turned and fumbled her way back to marrans body stood looking down at him a moment mama she backed away to give the fire room and sat in the middle of the trampled track her arms crossed tight across her narrow chest yaril and jaril came from the shadows and took up places facing each other across the body with formal movements like the paces of a dance dissolved into light shimmers that bobbed up and down like bubbles on a string brann heard the swooping sweet song again jarils deeper notes dominating looked at marran half in shadow half in moonlight looked away pushing her grief back shutting it away inside her as shed done with the rest of her anger and pain not noticing how frequently she was doing this or realizing how much trouble she was piling up for herself when the rush of events was over and there was nothing more to distract her from all that she had lost or from the cold shock of what her future held for her the shimmers vibrated faster and faster waves of colorblue and green and crimsonpassing across them top to bottom faster faster faster the song rising to a high piercing scream they darted away from each other whipped around and came rushing back slamming together into a blinding explosion blue fire roared up in a gather of crackling tongues hanging first in midair the fire lowered until it touched then ate down into marran racing up and down his contorted body consuming flesh and bone until there was only ash the blue flame paled broke in half the halves tumbled apart and the children lay on the leaves pale and weary yaril sat up we have to hunt before we can go on jaril rolled up nodded flowed immediately into the hound form and trotted away yaril following after most of the spring gone out of her legs the burning had cost them brann watched them go sat where she was for a few breaths longer then she got to her feet stretched and began to sing the mourning song for marran about an hour before dawn the werehorse slowed to a walk hooves flowing into clawed pads as each one left the ground it ghosted on step by slow step through the starlit quiet until the sound of a mans voice raised in idle complaint came drifting up the track brann swung down pulled the saddlebags off and carried them to a tangleroot stowed them in the trunk hollow struggling to make no sounds she came back eased the buckles loose and slid the saddle off teeth tight together moving as smoothly as she could so nothing would rattle or clink by the time she reached the huge tree jaril was there to help her lower the saddle they crept around the perimeter of the camp clearing until they found a pepperbush growing crookedly out from the roots of a sweetsap where a thin screen of toothy leaves let them see without being seen the captives slept in the center of the cleared ground the ropes knotted about their necks tied to stakes pounded into the hard soil perhaps on the first two nights some had lain awake too stunned by grief and fear to sleep but this night they all slept heavily noisily with groans and farts and snores and sobs and the shapeless mutters that sleepers make when theyre speaking into dream two men slouched heavily about the edge of the camp clearing passing each other at roughly fifteenminute intervals occasionally moving among the ropes of captives prodding those who groaned and snored too loudly the rest of the soldiers were rolled in their blankets in two rows on the river side the pimush slightly apart from his men yaril eeled up to branns shoulder breathed jarils started for the far side ill tell you when hes ready all you have to do is get close to that sentry touch him before he can yell then we can take the rest brann started sweating abruptly deserted by rage and grief no longer comfortably numb she had to face the reality of those men whose life forces she was going to suck away for all her eleven years her parents had taught her reverence for life slyas strictures demanded awareness of responsibility for all life stopped she remembered how desperately the malouch had clung to life and how easily shed stripped that life away and how nauseated she felt about it later but there was no going back yaril wriggled close warm and alive in her eerie way look at his face that sentry coming toward you she breathed when the guard came out of shadow she saw the face of the man whod taken ruan by her heels and swung her twice against the oak thrown her away like a weed onto a compost heap be ready yaril said her words a thread of sound by branns ear when this one has his back turned jaril will bite the other the sentry walked past her go urged on by the whispered word brann raced after the sentry slapped her hand against the bare flesh of his arm before he had a chance to cry out landed her other hand began drawing the life from him the fire hammering into her differing in quality and force from that shed taken from the smaller less deadly beasts this was a predator among predators a killer horn as much as bred only slightly tamed by the discipline of the temueng army she read that in the flash as his lifeforce roared into her a second later he fell dead breathing hard struggling to quell heinausea brann looked for the other sentry he was down also silently dead in their serpent forms the children distilled from their substance a venom that killed between one breath and the next a minuscule drop in poison sacs yet enough for the death of a dozen men its time yaril whispered dont think bramlet just do its the only way to keep your people safe these murderers have earned death more than you know she touched branns arm then ran ahead of her to the lines of sleeping soldiers a shimmer of pale light and she was a serpent crawling in the dust in the dim starlight dustcolored and nearly invisible except when her vipers head rose above a sleeping man and darted down brann nerved herself and followed man to man she went setting her hands on those the children had not touched taking their life into her a burning unending river flooding her she drank and drank until there were no more lives to take trying as she stooped and touched to ignore the pleasure currents curling turgidly through her it didnt seem right her vengeance should be pure untainted by anything but righteous wrath the children rose from serpent form and came to her their hands melting into hers as they took and took from her until she could think coherently again and move without feeling bloated and unwieldy she turned to look at the dead two rows of them fifty men falling to snake and whatever it was she was now with hardly a sound and no struggle at all they might have been sleeping still silent herself she went to stand beside the temueng pimush the leader of these invaders the one whod given the orders for all theyd donecalmly asleep untroubled by dreams or remorse you know why she thought but how do i ask you what do i ask you he made a small spluttering sound moved his hands she jumped back into shadow but he didnt wake jaril tugged at her arm she leaned down what she whispered take from him but not all enough only to sap his will so we can move him away from them he nodded at the sleeping captives brann looked down and was surprised to see her hands glowing in the hushed darkness before the dawn rather like the round porcelain lamps her father made for nightlights she knelt beside the pimush and took his head between her hands he started to wake but faded into a daze as she pressed the slow drain enough jaril said touched her hand she sighed and sat back on her heels what now into the trees hell walk if we prod him with the childrens help she led the pimush a short distance from the camp clearing and propped him against the high roots of an old oak thats done where from here give him back huh you want him able to talk dont you reverse the flow all you have to do is touch and will bramble its as easy as breathing which i think you dont do jaril grinned at her not like you anyway she rubbed a grubby forefinger by the corner of her mouth the temueng was tall head and shoulders higher than most arth slya men the flesh hard and tight on his bones she shivered he looks like he could snap me in two without half trying shouldnt we tie him or something no jaril changed flowed upon the temuengs chest coil by coil his broad triangular vipers head raised and swaying poison fangs displayed and ready yaril moved around until she was kneeling by the temuengs right arm drawing over her the feral look of a hungry weasel it sat comfortably on her delicate childs face made her more terrifying than a raging male three times her size brann looked from child to serpent wiped her hand across her face scraping away a new film of sweat why dont i feel safer she whispered then giggled nervously the dawn breeze was beginning to stir rustling among the leaves here and there a birds sleepy twitter broke the hush yaril clicked her teeth brann you waiting for it to rain or something kneeling beside the temueng brann put her hand on his brow and found that jaril was right it was easy the fire crackling under her skin went out through her fingertips into him his pale face darkened flushing with renewed vigor she jumped hastily to her feet and moved back a few paces he opened his eyes the flush receded leaving him pale as he saw the serpent head rising over his he stiffened and stopped breathing man yaril said what his narrow dark eyes flicked about going to the viper swaying gently but without that extra tension that meant readiness to strike to the feral child showing her pointed teeth to brann filled with moonfire he didnt move he was afraid but mastering his fear calculating seeking a way to slide out of this peril we are drinker of souls and the mountains children yaril cooed at him she caught hold of his hand the strength in her dainty fingers as frightening as the rest of her she folded the hand into a fist and wrapped her hands about it gazing at him with an impersonal hungry interest you killed our mortal cousins and took others away you bloodied and befouled our mother why her high light voice was calm conversational answer me man she tightened her hands about his fist watched him struggle to keep still sweat popping thick on his long narrow face why she eased her grip why it was something to do he said when he could speak again to pass the time yaril gestured at the viper and it changed to a giant worm with daintily feathered wings little larger than a mans hand flirting on either side of an angular dragons head forked tongue flicking a whiffing and fluttering of the opalescent feathers the great worm grew heavier and heavier on the temuengs chest the coils spilling off him onto the roots of the oak as the pimush stared mouth clamped shut but eyes wide with the fear he couldnt deny smoking oily liquid ran down one of the dragons dagger fangs gathered at the tip then dripped off onto his chest the venom burned through his shirt and into his flesh his body jerked and spasmed as much as it could one hand held prisoned by yaril in a grip he had no chance of breaking legs and lower body pinned by the punishing weight of the worm yaril passed her hand across the bubbling liquid drew it into herself the pain subsided the man lay still again why she said we sent the tribute to grannsha every year without fail the compact between arth slya and the kumaliyn has never been broken though a thousand years have passed since it was made why did you come to arth slya he licked his lips gave a sudden wild shout your men are dead yaril patted his hand only their ghosts to answer you call again if you want call all you want only the captives can hear you and theyre staked to the ground why have you destroyed arth slya she tightened her grip on his fist again watched him struggling to hold back groans and fight off the feeling of helplessness the worms weight and her unlikely strength were waking in him she eased the pressure a little speak true and you will die quickly and easily lie or refuse to speak then my brothers venom will consume you bit by bit and the souldrinker will see you stay awake for all of it his dark eyes darted about he was fighting a last battle with himself desiring defiance but too intelligent to waste his strength hiding things that had to be common knowledge in the villages below with a visible effort he relaxed all dead all slya watches over her children easy they said round up the young and strong no kids or dodderers the breath hissed through his stiff lips nothing about no arsehole god getting her eggs in a twist your kumaliyns skipped abanaskranjinga emperor of the tern uengs rules here now so why come like wolves there were no soldiers in arth slya why ask me i do what im ordered good boy pat im on his fuckin head why come like wolves he sneered old krajinks not about to let a little bunch of mud dawbers nest free thinkin they can make it without him maybe other folk they get the idea they got rights mudfeet mudheads stompin up trouble just get chopped but krajink hes got to pay us to do the choppin and he parts with silver bits like grasslion from his meat cheaper to stomp first dont mess up trade or plantin and harvestin cheap way to get valuable slaves trust of krajink to see that he figures your arth slya artisans might as well be making their junk for him where he can keep an eye on them figures maybe he can make durat a rep as big as your dawbers got brann took a step toward him slaves she spat half my folk dead so that that he can prance around claiming their work he raised his thin arched brows the sound of his voice insensibly seducing him into speaking further turning this interrogation into something like a conversation so whats new about that bint in old lardarses head were all his slaves we hop when he pulls our strings dont hop get the chop why not do the same us to folk beneath us brann stared at him not comprehending much of what he was saying it was a world totally other than the one shed grown up in all she got from the speech was the ultimate responsibility of the temueng emperor for the destruction of arth slya the fair she said what happened to the arth slya folk at the fair on their way hint on ship to andurya durat brann put her hands behind her back clenched them into her fists struggled to keep her voice steady were any of them killed and get chopped for wasting prime meat uhuh brann closed her eyes her father and her brothers were alive captives but alive bramble yarils voice jolted out of her daze brann came round the temuengs feet and stopped beside her what that all you wanted to know yes urn yes well yaril gestured impatiently brann rubbed her hands down the sides of her bloodied shirt blood from her wounded arm long dried it was different somehow looking into his eyes listening to him talk seeing his fear seeing him as a person knowing him with all the harm hed done her she shrank from taking him the revulsion she felt was almost more than she could overcome she reached heavily toward him saw the leap of fear in his eyes saw it dulling to resignation her hand fell i cant she wailed i an immense hot fury took hold of her drowned her will worked her arms set her hands on his brow and mouth and drew his life in a rushing roar out of him then he was dead and that thing went wheeling away it wasnt the children as wobbly as her thinking was she was able to understand that cautiously yaril came closer reached out a spark snapped between them then the strong small hands were closed on her arm and yaril was pressing against her warm and alive murmuring comfort to her another spark snapping and jaril was smoothing his hands along her shoulders gently massaging her neck and shoulder muscles they worked the shock out of her gave her the support she needed until she was able to stand yaril stood beside her holding her hand what was that brann moved her shoulders flexed her fingers the childrens hands comfortably human around them even a little sweaty dont know i think i think it was slya filling me oh there was complete silence from both children for a few breaths then calm and deliberately prosaic words from yaril we better go turn your folks loose as they walked through the trees jaril looked up at her what do we do after this bramble go back to the valley with your folk brann stopped i thought before i knew about da do you think we could get him loose too jaril grinned why not brann stopped in the shadows of some stunted alder bushes an unseen hand restraining her a wall of air keeping her back from her mother and the rest of slyas folk out in the clearing no words no warning nothing tangible but she was being told arth slya was no longer for her she dropped to her knees then swung her legs around so she was sitting with her hands clasped in her lap looking into the camp clearing through a thin fan of fingersized shoots and a lacy scatter of leaves the children exchanged puzzled glances squatted beside her without speaking uncle migel was on his knees beside a stake looking about he scrubbed his hand across his mouth fumbled on the ground by his knees came up with a dirt clod snapped it at a soldier lying rolled in his blanket he grunted as the clod hit splattering over the man and the ground around him not sleeping he said he put two fingers in his mouth produced an earpiercing whistle waited unh looks to me like theyre all dead how her mothers voice all aunt seansi kneeling beside her mother id say so mig that whistle of yours is most likely waking folks in g rann sha wrapping thickfingered hands about the stake migel rocked it back and forth and with an exploding grunt pulled it from the ground he got to his feet his ropemates coming up eagerly with him all eight of them moving out and around the shakes to the line of bodies migel kicked a soldier out of his blanket got his belt knife and cut himself loose he sliced the loop of rope from his neck then tossed the knife with casual skill so it stuck in the ground in front of branns mother who grabbed it with a heartfelt slya and began slicing her rope loose from the stake when she was free she passed the knife to seansi and marched over to the pile of wood the soldiers had cut the night before hauled sticks from it to an open space where she used the sparker she found on a soldier to get a fire started brann watched the swirl of activity and noise in the clearing warm with pride in the resilience of her people harrowed by the shock and violence of the invasion bereft of hope marched off to a fate not one of them could imagine waking to find silent death come among them with no idea of how or when it struck whether it would come on them later not a one of them sat about glooming or complaining but each as soon as he or she was freed from the rope saw something to be done and did it time for fear and mourning later now was time for food in the belly and scalding hot tea to get the blood moving now was the time to get the mules and ponies out of their rope corral now was the time for caching the loot from the valley where they could find it later in a hectic half hour the camp clearing was picked clean except for the bodies of the soldiers the body of the pimush was added to the pile when they found it they passed close by brann and the children but whatever kept her from entering the clearing kept them fromseeing her then they were mounting the mules and ponies and riding away those that had no mounts trotting beside the others after a short but heated argument they left the pimushs horse and gear behind her mother wouldnt have the beast along uncle migel wanted to take it inar and seansi and a dozen others talked him out of that the beast was a highbred racer too obviously not valleybred migel kept sputtering that anyone getting close enough to the valley to spot the horse would be too damn close anyway but the others countered that it only took one snooping outsider to get an eyeful of racer and report his presence to the temuengs if he wanted such a beast then he should buy one the next fair on as they left the clearing the mountain chose to rumble a few breaths and go quiet almost as if slya were laughingthe soldiers dead the people returning to rebuild their homes and brann aimed like an arrow at the temueng emperor as the morning brightened and grewwarmer with the rising of the sun brann sat staring at the empty clearing not seeing it she wasnt tired wasnt sleepy only empty bramble yarils voice demanded her attention she looked around eyes unfocused here yaril put a hot mug in her hand drink this when brann sat without moving staring at the mug the changechild made a small spitting sound like an angry cat wrapped her hands round branns and lifted the cup to branns lips the scalding liquid burned her mouth but brann kept drinking when the mug was empty yaril took it away and came back with more tea and a sandwich of stale bread and thick chunks of cheese scolded her into eating them food in the belly woke her will gave her the energy shed not had the emptiness shed been suffering was of the body as well as of the spirit she realized that when jaril brought the pimushs horse to her the beast wearing her saddle and the pimushs bridle the rest of her gear in place with some additions he was a fine lovely beastno wonder uncle migel had coveted himprancing nostrils flaring but tamed by the touch of jarils hand when brann was ready to mount up you go jaril said he caught her about the legs and tossed her onto the snorting beast his strength once again surprising her having seen him as a frail child or an insubstantial shimmering hanging in midair she could not help letting her eyes fool her into underestimating him she settled into the saddle began settling the horse stroking him comforting him teaching him that she wasnt about to allow any nonsense from him then she was riding away down the mountain holding the horse to a steady canter when he wanted to run brindle boarhounds trotted beside her or disappeared into the trees on scouting runs the track continued to follow the river clinging to the sides of ravines where she drowned in the boom of cataracts departing grudgingly from the cliffs where the river fell in rainbowed mists down and down without stopping eating in the saddle drinking from the pimushs waterskin ignoring the continued chafing of her thighs the cramps in fingers arms legs down and down until the pimushs horse was leaden with fatigue until they were out of the mountains and in gently rolling foothills when the wounded moon was an hour off the horizon she curled up in a hollow padded with grass and went to sleep leaving the horse and her safety to the children she slept heavily and if she dreamed she remembered nothing of it later she woke with the sun beating into her eyes sweat greasing a body drastically changed woke to the pinching irritation of clothing that was much too small for her she sat up groaned hastily she ripped off what was left of her trousers most of the seams having given way as she slept breathed a sigh of relief tore off the remains of her shirt bundled the rags and wiped at sweat that was viscous and highsmelling her hair was stiff with dirt and dried sweat when she tried combing her fingers through it it came out in handfuls she rubbed at her head with the waddedup shirt all the hair came out mousebrown tresses dead and dark falling to the grass around her she kept scrubbing until her head was bare polished bare throwing the shirt aside she ran her hands over the body the night had given her the full soft breasts the narrow waist the broader hips the pubic hair glinting like coiled silver wire in the sunlight she wanted to cry to howl lost and confused a hand on her shoulder she jerked convulsively cried out in a voice she didnt recognize flung herself awaythen saw it was yaril yaril holding neatly folded clothing jarils fixing breakfast next hollow over you better get dressed here brann shook out the shirt looked from it to yaril where brought it with us just in case brann looked at the shirt she still held out and snorted just in case i grew a couple feet taller and a dozen years older she bit on her lip uncomfortable with the deeper richer voice that came out of her a womans voicenot the one she knew as hers just in case you couldnt go back to arth slya just in case you needed to free your father and the others as well as the ones the soldiers had taken seemed obvious to jaril and me that the temuengs would round up the fair people before coming after the villagers you didnt say anything about that you had enough on your mind you did this to me why a child of eleven a girl child yaril said think brann dont just stand there glupping like a fish put that shirt on whod let such a child travel unmolested chances are the first man or woman who needed a laborer would grab you and put you to work for your keep whod bother listening to a child and thats far from the worst that could happen so we used all that life you drank and grew you older you havent lost anything brambleallthorns weve stabilized you at this age you wont change again unless you wish it her head feeling as hard as seasoned oak brann stared at her what she pulled the shirt on began buttoning it having to pull it tight across her newly acquired breasts stabilized you know what the word means put these on they belonged to mareddi whos about your size so they should fit brann stepped into the trousers drew them up began pulling the laces tight but i dont know what it means when you use it about me means youll stay the age you are until you want to change it you can do that well we have havent we like we told you before bramble were a meld the three of us youre stuck with more limits than we have but we can shift your shape about some not a lot and it takes a lot of energy but well you see here boots mareddis too might be a touch roomy weird she ran her hand over her head am i going to stay eggbald id rather not she pulled on the boots stomped her feet down in them yaril giggled i could say wait and see well no bramble new hairs already starting to come in im hungry she looked at the blanket shed slept in nudged it with her toe what a stink i need a bath shrugging she started toward the smell of roasting coyno on her second day out of the mountains she came to a small village where jaril bought her a long scarf to cover the stubble on her head also more bread and cheese some bacon and the handful of tea the woman could spare brann hadnt thought about the need for money before and was startled when he came up with a handful of coppers and bronze bits though she had wit enough to keep her mouth shut while there were strangers about to hear her later when she was riding down a rutted road between two badly tended boundary hedges she called the hound back and pulled jaril up before her whered you get the coin she smiled ruefully shook her head i forgot we couldnt travel down here without it soldiers purses pimushs gear they wont be needing it anymore and we will he leaned back against her awakening a strong maternal urge in her something that surprised her because shed never before felt anything of the sort another thing you didnt bother telling me about you were too busy glooming to listen hunh he tilted his head back looked up at her with a smile too much like marrans for her comfort then he slid away from her hitting the ground on four hounds feet trotting ahead to rejoin yaril as the days passed she rode through village after village clustered about manorhouses with their keeps tenanted by temueng soldiers the fear and anger was thick as the dust cast up by plows and plodding oxen the villages quiet and hushed the children invisible except for the ones working with their parents in the fieldsa kind of desolation without destruction that reawakened anger in her a fury against the temuengs whose touch seemed as deadly as the changeserpents poison she even found herself blaming the lack of rain on them though the dry days and nights let her sleep outside which was necessary because of the presence of the temuengs in the villages and the sullen mistrustful plainfolk toward evening on the seventh day after she left the mountains she reached the wide highroad from grannsha to tavisteen and turned south along it dismounted and walked beside a horse stumbling with weariness the hounds trotting in wide arcs before her noses and ears searching for danger now and then one of them would run back to her and pace alongside her for a while looking repeatedly up at her remnants of the days light glinting in the crystal of their strange eyes the sky was heavily overcast thick boiling gray clouds threatening rain with every breath the river swept away from the road and hack in broad tranquil meanders the color sucked from the water by the lowering skies the sound muted by the ponderous force and depth of the flow she was about to resign herself to a wet cold night when she came on a large rambling structure built between the highroad and a returning sweep of the river an inn with a pair of torches out front torches that had burnt low because it was long after sundown the hounds came back altering into yaril and jaril by the time they reached her what do you think she said should we stop there she drew the flat of her hand down her front sighed id really like a hot bath yaril scratched at her nose considered the inn why not bramble it looks like it gets a lot of traffic the folk there wont be surprised by strangers youre the moneykeeper jri can we afford their prices he looked thoughtful then mischievous why not s not our coin we can always steal more he dug into the saddlebags handed the purse to yaril and took the reins from brann you two go on inside let yaril do the talking and you stand about looking portentous bramble he giggled and dodged away from the sweep of her hand get coier bedded down he wont mind a dry stall and some corn for dinner oh no he wont the door opened at branns touch and she went in looking about as impassively as she could beside her yaril was gawking at the place with far less restraint her childs form licensing freer expression of her interest a long narrow entranceway with open arches on each side led to a broad stairway at the far end a horseshoeshaped counter by the foot of the stairs yaril ran ahead of brann to the counter beat a few times on the small gong set by the wall then engaged in an energetic sottovoce debate with the sleepy but professionally genial man who emerged from the door behind the counter brann watched from the corner of her eye trying to show she knew what she was about ignoring the men who came to the archdoor of the taproom and stared at her with predatory speculation she grew increasingly nervous as yaril prolonged that debate if shed been here with her mother and father as she couldve been shed have been excited and absorbed by the newness of it all protected by the arms of custom and love now she was merely frightened asea in a place whose rules of conduct she didnt know she reached up touched the scarf still wound about her head already she had about an inch of new hair silvery white and softly curling like downfeathers on a duck it itched needed washing as much as the rest of her seemed weeks since shed had a bath she gazed down at thin wrists that looked as if a breath would snap them at long strong hands tanned dark that were dark also with the grime water alone wouldnt get off soap and a hot bath she sighed with anticipated pleasure yaril came trotting back i thought youd like to eat first while hes getting the water heated for your bath she led brann into the taproom and settled her at a table in the far corner jaril came in looked through the arch began helping yaril fetch food and eating things acting as beginning apprentices were expected to act serving their masters wants and needs the clink of the coin the children had taken from the soldiers had bought her a measure of welcome the childrens act brought her a grudging respect as one who might have a dangerous amount of power however odd she looked even that oddness had its good points setting her apart from the general run of women on their own as soon as she was settled behind the table with the wall at her back she felt better as if shed acquired a space all her own and when the children brought cold roast chicken heated rolls with cheese melted into them and a pitcher of hot spiced wine she began to eat with the appetite engendered by her long ride the children knelt beside her hidden from the rest of the room when most of the wine was a warm mass in her stomach and the first edge of her hunger had been blunted she looked down at jaril coier all right he nodded good stable clean fresh straw in the stalls no mold on the oats good she put down the wine bowl what about you two do you need to eat he shook his head the fine hair flying into a halo about his pointed face after that last meal no we shouldnt need more until the wounded moon is full again oh she finished the rest of the food and sat holding the drinking bowl cradled in her hands her body ached she still wasnt quite used to the altered distribution of meat on her bones though as time wore on new habits were beginning to form that was a help but she was more and more worried about her ability to make her way in this other world she was woefully dangerously ignorant about things these people didnt waste two thoughts on the money jaril carried for example the only coin shed ever held was the bronze bit marran called his luck piece the children seemed to know what they were doing their experience at traveling seemed to be much greater than hers but she felt uneasy about leaving everything to them arth slya encouraged its young ones to develop selfreliance within the community they had to know their capacities their desires and gifts in order to make a proper choice whether that choice be centered in the valley or elsewhere that knowledge and contentment therein was even more important to the wellbeing of the valley than the proper choice of a lifemate even after choice if the passage of time found the young man or woman restless and unsatisfied they were encouraged to seek what they needed elsewhere apprenticeships were arranged in grannsha usually at fairtime in tavisteen or somewhere on the plains the young folk leaving to be dancers players of all sorts merchants soldiers sailors she had cousins all over croaldhu probably scattered about the whole world but they all had help getting to know how to act they had people around them to encourage and support them such practices had kept arth slya thriving for more than a thousand years a thousand years impossible that in so short a time as a day such a way of life had almost ceased to exist she sipped at lukewarm wine and noticed fbr the first time the singular hush in the taproom at first she thought shed caused it then she saw the three men at the bar their backs against the slab tankards still hill in their hands they were temuengs with pale northern skins the color of rich cream straight black hair pulled back and tied at the napes of their necks high prominent cheekbones long narrow eyes as black as the shirts and trousers they wore they had a hard brushed neatness no dust on them no sweat not a hair out of place faces cleanshaven nails burnished on hands that looked as if theyd never done anything brann could think of as work a disturbing neatness that spoke of coldness and control that frightened her as it was meant to do yaril sensed her unease dissolved into the light shimmer crept around the edges of the room then darted through the men and away before they could do more than blink flicked back along the wall and solidified into yaril standing at her shoulder watch out for them the girl whispered they have leave to do anything they want to anyone theyre the enforcers of an imperial censor yaril patted her arm but you just remember who you are now drinker of souls brann shivered i dont like she started in a fierce whisper a pressure on her arm stopped her she looked up a fourth man had come from somewhere and was standing across the table from her he pulled out a chair and sat down i dont recall requesting company she said jaril was on his feet now standing at her other shoulder she lost much of her fear with the children backing her this temueng was nothing she leaned back in her chair and examined him with hatred and contempt he ran his eyes over her what are you supposed to be drinker of souls the phrase yaril had used came out easily enough she looked at his frozen face and laughed who are you he spoke with a deadly patience she giggled nervously though he and his armsmen were not very funny she giggled again and the temueng grabbed her arm his fingers digging into her flesh he tried to twist the arm to retaliate for her laughter somewhat to her own surpriseshe resisted him with ease and sat smiling at him as he strained for breath getting red in the face his menacing calm shattered but he wasnt stupid and knew the rules of intimidation well enough if a tactic fails you quit it before that failure can make you ridiculous and slide into something more effective hed made a mistake challenging her with unfriendly witnesses present he loosed her arm sat back turned his head partway around but didnt bother looking at the men he spoke to clear them out he said she watched the enforcers clear the room and follow the plainsfolk out stationing themselves in the broad archway their backs to the taproom she frowned at the temueng knowing she would kill him if she had to her gentle rearing and slyas strictures of respect seemed a handicap down here but she wouldnt abandon either unless she was forced to she had horror enough for nightmares the rest of her life he jabbed a forefinger at the children you two he said out no brann said yarils nostrils flared huh she said yours are they ketcha we are the mountains children yaril said born of fire and stone he looked from one to the other turned his head again temudung come here one of the three standing in the doorway swung round and came across to the censor salim he pointed at yaril the girl stretch her out on the bar then well see if the mountain has answers censor brann said softly though with anger take my warning dont touch the children they arent what they seem yaril snorted let the fool find out the hard way mistress the enforcer ignored that exchange and came round the table hand ready to close on yarils arm and snatch her away from branns side then it wasnt a delicate small girl the temueng was reaching for but a weasellike beast the size of a large dog that was leaping for his throat tearing it and leaping away powerful hind legs driving into his chest missing much of the geyser of blood hissing out at him brann grimaced with distaste and dabbed at the bloodspots on her ece and shirt with the napkin the host had provided with her meal by the time the temueng slumped to the floor the weasel had shrunk smaller a darkly compact threat crouched on the table in front of brann long red tongue licking at the bloodspots on its fur i think youd better not move brann said quietly the censor sat rigidly erect a greenish tinge to his skin staring not at brann or the beast but at the serpent swaying beside her the two enforcers in the arch wheeled when they heard the abruptly silenced shriek from their companion took a step into the room stopped in their tracks when the serpent hissed the weaselbeast gave a warning yowl the taproom filled with those tiny sounds that make up a silence the ones never heard in the middle of ordinary bustle and noise the creak of wood the hiss of the dying ire the hoarse breathing of the men the grinding of the sensors teeth the buzzing of a lissfly without sense enough to shun the place censor she said shed done some rapid thinking lipped into the fund of stories shed heard from ancient uncle eornis tales of heros monsters and mischiefmakers i am drinker of souls she said infusing the words with all the heavy meaning she could feel fortunate o man that i am not thirsty now feel fortunate man that the mountains children are not hungry were it otherwise you would die the death of deaths she felt a little silly though he seemed to take her seriously enough all i desire is to pass in peace through this miserable land let me be temueng and ill let you be you and your kind she let the silence expand until even the slightest sound was painful then she said i have a weakness censor anger censor you will be tempted to make the locals pay for your shame but if you do that ill be very very angry censor ill find you censor believe me censor she stopped talking and grinned at him beginning to enjoy herself but enough was enough so she stood pushing her chair hack with her legs im going to my room now censor im tired and i plan to sleep soundly and well but the mountains children never sleep so youd be well advised to let me be say what you want to the folk here i wont contradict you you need lose no touch of honor censor she felt his eyes on her as she left the room yaril flitted up the steps before her and jaril came behindguarding her though she was too selfabsorbed to realize that until triumph burnt out and she was walking tiredly down the lamplit hall to the room shed hired for the night a cheerfully crackling fire on the hearth a large tub of hot water set comtbrtably close to the heat copper cans of extra hot water to add later soft flubbed towels on the rush seat of a highbacked straight chair a bowl of perfumed soap beside them she crossed the room letting the children shut the door touched the thinwalled porcelain of the soap bowl picked it up ran her fingers over the bottom immers mark it was born from her fathers kilns the simple lovely bowl made her feel like weeping her father was a gentle man who disliked loud voices would simply walk away if someone got too aggressive he saved his anger for cheats and liars and slipshod work and for that last he was unforgiving he would not live long as a slave there wasnt the right kind of bend in him she sighed and stripped putting aside that worry there being little she could do about it right then with a breath of pleasure she eased into the hot water and began to wash away the grime of her long hard ride the pleasure of the bath making up for those many hardships shed had to endure even for the contretemps in the taproom and whatever came of it she wrinkled her nose at the filthy shirt and trousers thrown in a pile beside the chair disgusted by the thought shed have to get back in them come the morning no mother or cousin or anyone to do for her when she was done she stood up dripping the scent from the soap around her like a cloud she snapped open one of the towelsit was almost big as a blanketand began rubbing herself dry a little timid about touching herself embarrassed by the soft full breasts the bush of pubic hair she put a foot on the side of the tub dried it stepped onto the hearth tiles dried her other foot dropped the damp towel beside her discarded clothes and wrapped the dry one about her yaril and jaril were sitting on the bed watching her but in the days since the valley shed gotten used to their being always around she rubbed at her head with a corner of the towel combed her hand through short damp hair sighed with relief as it curled about her fingers being bald was almost as embarrassing as the jiggle of her breasts she looked at the bed but she wasnt sleepy tired yes exhausted uncertain weepy yes but the bed meant nightmares when her mind was so roiled up she walked to the window it was still not raining and very dark the wounded moon not up yet and anyway it was shrunk to a broken crescent she leaned on the broad sill gazing to the west where the mountains were wondering what her folk were doing now how they were faring if theyd gone back and collected the loot yet she continued to gaze into the cloudy darkness willing herself to see her mountain her tincreal andfor a momentbelieved it was her will that touched the peaks with light then the sill rocked under her elbows the floor rocked under her feet and the faint red glow illuminating the peaks rose to a reddish boil bursting into the sky some minutes later a blast came like a blow against her ears it settled into a low grinding grumble that finally died into a tensionfilled silence the red glare subsided to a lowlying seethe sandwiched between clouds and earth standing with her face pressed against the iron lace her mouth gaping open in a scream that wouldnt come she was a hollovircast figurine empty no anger not even any surprise as if shed expected it and of course she had they all had the signs had been amply there the children had warned the blow was coming soon no she said saying no to the sudden thought that the mountain had destroyed the little the temuengs had left of arth slya guilt seized her if shed left the soldiers alone alive if shed let them take her folk away her motherd be alive now they all would a tugging at her arm she looked down jaril they could be safe bramble if the mountain blew away from the valley and it isnt your fault like you told me once your folk know the moods of the mountain i could fly there and see be back by morning if you want do you brann barely whispered yes please she turned back to the window her eyes fixed on the soft red glow a bit of hope mixing with her despair behind her she heard the door open click shut then small hands caught hold of her arm yaril led her to the bed tucked her in lying on her stomach her face to the wall she let herself relax as yaril murmured soft cooing sounds at her and smoothed those small strong hands across her shoulders down along her arms over and over her shaking stopped all at once she was desperately tired she slept a weight was on her she couldnt breathe a hand was clamped over her mouth a knee butting between her legs fear and horror and revulsion welled up in her she began to struggle not knowing what was happening trying to free her mouth trying to buck the weight off her but he was strong and heavy and hed got himself set before she was awake enough to fight him he was hard and thick pushing into her he was grunting like an animal hurting her it was a dry burning as if he invaded her with a reamer rasping at her all she could think of was getting it out seconds passed a few heartbeats and she came out of her panic lay still for one breath another then she moved her head so suddenly and so strongly he wasnt ready for it she didnt quite free her mouth but she got flesh between her teeth and bit hard he cursed and slapped her then fumbled for her mouth again she wriggled desperately under him got her hands free slapped them against the sides of his head shoved it up off her started the draw he had a moment before the paralysis took hold but he couldnt dislodge her when he was drained she rolled him off her and got shakily to her feet lit the lamp from the dying fire threw on a few more sticks of wood toe in his ribs she nudged him over the censor shed humiliated him this was how he got even got dead she looked away no anger or fear left all she felt was dirtied filthy she looked down at herself and was startled by a drop of blood falling by her foot her thighs were smeared with blood another drop fell hastily she stepped into the tub scooped up a dollop of fresh soap and began washing herself gently at first then scrubbing the washcloth harder and harder over her whole bod as if she could scrub the memory of the dead man off her skin by the time she finished the bleeding had stopped she padded to the bed wrapped herself in a blanket and sat crosslegged in the middle of the stained sheets staring at the door about an hour later yaril came back with a bundle of clothing brann blinked at them understanding then where yaril had gone the changechild had seen the way she looked at the stinking shirt and trousers once she was safely asleep yaril went out and stole clean things for her you didnt lock the door brann said her voice a hoarse whisper yaril looked at the dead man shook her head held up the clumsy key i did brann opened her mouth to say something forgot it began to cry the gasping bodyshaking sobs of a hurt child yaril dropped the clothing and ran to her sat on the bed beside her murmured soft cooing words to her patted her soothed her comforting her as a mother would a frightened child gentling her into a deep healing sleep with the song of her voice spinning sleep with that soft compelling voice when she woke the sound of rain filled the room while she slept her body had healed itself the bruises and strains were gone and the burning hurt between her thighs she sat up the body was gone she got quickly out of bed and started pulling on the clean clothes yaril had brought her a knock on the door as she was tucking in her shirt tail come jaril came in looking a little wan i was right he said not waiting for her questions mountain blew east not north the river has changed course some got more cataracts the track out is chewed up so badly that if you didnt know where arth slya was already youd never find it dance floor is cracked part of it tilted some of the workshops slid into the river your folk are out clearing up a few bumps and bruises but i didnt see anyone seriously hurt your mothers fine her looms didnt get burnt the fire in your house went out the quake didnt mess them up either so shes been busy she thinks youre dead killed by temuengs folk dont know what to do about your father and the others if they havent returned before shelters are cobbled together some of your cousins are going to slip down and see what happened to them sheee they shouldnt be all right if they keep their heads down theyve been warned brann brushed her hand back over her hair rubbed at her eyes thanks fri that helps a lot you look worn down her mouth curled into a wry smile i picked up a life last night come and take jaril hesitated you all right not so upset as i was a little wiser about the way things are she held out her hands as he took them she said by the way what did you and yaril do with the body and where is she watching the enforcers theyre asleep and she wants them to stay that way until after were gone we dumped it in the river with a little luck itll be out to sea before its spotted he took his hands away giggled hell get to tavisteen before us i better see how theyre treating coier get him saddled you feel like eating whats one more dead man after he left she wandered about the room picking up her scattered possessions folding everything neatly packing with the careful finickiness of the most precise of her aunts when she was finished she sat on the bed gathering courage to leave the room after a few ragged breaths she bounced to her feet draped the saddlebags over her arm sucked in a deep breath go slow she thought act like you dont give spit what anyone thinks she touched the doors latch and went weak in the knees not ready to go out not yet she passed her hand over her hair realized shed forgotten to wind the scarf about her head saw the creased length of material hanging over the back of the chair she crossed to the wavery mirror a curling mass of soft white hair all over her head long enough now that its weight made the curls larger looser strange but rather nice suiting the shape of her face she thought about not wearing the scarf itd feel good to let the wind blow through her hair but short as it was the color it wasnt itd cause too much comment when she was riding the highroad she wound the strip of cloth about her head tied it so the ends fell behind one ear odd that paring down of her head to its basic contours made her eyes look huge and gemlike her mouth softer she looked at herself another heartbeat or two then strode to the door jerked it open and stepped into the empty corridor the other travelers staying the night had already departed or were still sleeping it was early she walked slowly down the rush matting toward the stairs at the end of the corridor her stride growing firmer steadier at the landing she touched the scarf to see if it was still in place a concession to uncertainty then started down a younger version of last nights host so exact a copy he had to be the owners son looked up as she stopped by the counter you wish athin id like athno something to eat certainly athin it is a bit early he went on as he flipped the hinged section of counter top and came out to escort her to the table shed chosen the night before itll take a breath or two to prepare but tis just as well to be early this day the diligence from tavisteen is due to stop here soon for the fastbreaking and well be busier than broody hens and wishing for more hands trying to feed them and the escort too she said nothing but he must have read something in her silence because he came around and stood beside her traveling was near impossible till the temuengs started sending patrols with the packtrains and the diligences now we have eggs fried or poached fresh baked rolls sausages theyre the familys special blend and many the praises weve got for them though its me who says it or a nice steak or weve some young rockquail or some fish my middle son caught from the river this morning for drinking theres ale cider tea or something called kaffeh a trader left with us a month ago some seem to like it though i must say i think its an acquired taste he turned his head to listen to the rain coming steadily down outside the highroad will be awash if this keeps up athin for your comfort you might consider staying until the storm blows out having waited for him to finish she did not bother to answer his discreet attempt to wring another days coin out of her but simply ordered a hot ample breakfast with a pot of tea to wash it down his amiable chatter had put her at ease and now she was merely hungry the children came in before she was done with the meal soaked and waiflike one moment dry the next silent and undisturbed by the stares of the fastbreakers in the slowly filling room they threaded through the tables and came to stand beside her brann scowled at the stareeyes and they looked hastily away wary of her rumors she thought worse than midges for getting about she sipped at the hot tea saying nothing until shed emptied the cup she set it down with a small definite click turned to jaril have you paid for our room and meals no mistress nor for the stable and worn his back to the rest of the room jaril grinned and winked at her see to it then i shall be annoyed if you allow yourself to be treated like a country fool jaril winked again went trotting off to pay the rate yaril had won by bargaining with the host brann relaxed a bit more squeezed a last half cup from the pot and sat sipping at it looking about the room a number of new faces probably theyd been in bed when she reached the inn last night up now to get their mornings meal before the inundation from the diligence and the temueng patrol an odd mix alike in their wariness not alike in other ways a merchant with a duplicateinlittle of his opulent dress bland ungiving face and tight little hands seated beside him a son most likely learning the business several scarred harshfeatured men in worn leathers with more cutlery hitched to their bodies than shed seen outside of migels smithy they reminded her immediately of the temueng invaders different racial types but a sameness to them that overrode the minor differences of build or skin color half a dozen older men seated about mostly with their hacks to the walls their clothing and demeanor giving little clue as to who they were or why they were on the move the only thing she could be sure of was that they werent temuengs jaril looked in through the archway nodded keeping her face expressionless brann slid from her chair and walked without haste between the tables feeling eyes on her all the way in the foyer she lifted a hand to the young host pushed through the main door and stopped under the bit of roof that kept the rain off her head it was coming down harder than shed expected in gray sheets that hid everything more than a bodylength away coier stood saddled and ready hitched to a ring in one of the several wayposts before the inn sidling and unhappy not liking the rain very much she felt for him reluctant herself to leave the shelter of the roof but there was no help for it she had to be long gone when yarils sleep spinning wore off and the enforcers woke to find the censor vanished she stomped through the wet and pulled herself into the saddle sitting with a squishy splat took the reins when jaril handed them up to her looked at him with envy his clothing wasnt clothing at all but a part of his substance and when he chose it shed the wet better than any ducks back she sighed the trouble you two get me into with a gentle kick she started coier toward the highroad keeping him at a walk no doubt they all think im a horrible monster riding while i make you children run in the mud she bent down called to yaril how longs the spinning going to last without you there to freshen it yaril turned her face up the rain slid away without wetting her she held up her hands and brann swung her onto the saddle in front of her till the diligence gets there probably id say the noise of it is enough to wake them whatll they do considering what happened in the taproom raise one holy stink and get half the temueng army looking for us sheee yaro we cant handle that cant fight something then run like sheol and hope you lose it yaril patted her arm just have to be smarter than they are thats all not so great a start was it an hour later the diligence came out of the rain at her she heard it before she saw it its creaks rattles cadenced sloppy thuds windy snorts a snatch or two of voices mostly bits of curses she nudged coier off the road pushing up tight against the hedgerow trying to ignore the clawing thorns the rain was coming down harder than ever and from the sound of the thing whoever was driving it expected the world to get out of his way the large mild heads of takhill drays came out of the rain their black manes plastered down over the white stripes that ran ear to nose the leather blinder on the offside lead gleaming like the glaze of dasn vuor their brown hides dripped water and looked almost as black as the harness the feathers on their massive shapely hocks were smoothed down with rain and mud but their sturdy legs lifted and fell with the regularity of a pendulum ticktock ticktook two first then two more then the two wheelers larger than the others a fine hitch the driver hunched over the reins cowl pulled so far forward she couldnt see his face only the large gnarled hands so deftly holding the black leather straps he was silent his silence making a space about him that the second man on the perch made no attempt to breach he was a temueng with a short bow held across his knees that he was trying to protect with his cloak a quiver full of arrows clipped to the inside of one leg he was cursing steadily stopping only to wipe at his face he saw her looked indifferently away she watched him with a surge of hatred that twisted her stomach into knots the diligence was a long boxy vehicle creaking along on three pairs of oversize wheels that cast up broad sheets of brown water oiled silk curtains were drawn tight against the rain but there was some sort of lamp burning inside probably more than one because she saw the shadows of the passengers moving across the silk six high narrow windows filled with profiles and the rounds of swaying heads she watched them and wondered what was so important it took those people out into weather like this the last window slid past then she saw the piles of luggage strapped behind and felt again that helplessness that had engulfed her as she walked into the inn an ignorance of life down here so complete that moving into it was like stepping off tincreal onto a lowhanging cloud four temuengs rode guard far enough behind the diligence to escape the mud and gravel the broad irontired wheels kicked up they rode swathed in heavy cloaks lances couched bows covered but she had little doubt theyd be a nasty surprise to anyone thinking of attacking the diligence the leader turned his head and stared at her as he rode past she saw a flash of gilt of paler silver an empush commanding four then he was past then they were all past she let out a breath her middle hurt as if shed been stooping and straightening for hours she wiped at her face kneed coier into a walk guiding him back onto the road the two hounds pacing silently one on each side of her a few breaths later she heard the sound of a horse coming rapidly up behind her then the temueng empush rode around her turning his mount to block the road she pulled up a flutter in her stomach a knot of fear and rage closing her throat she couldnt speak sat staring at him grimly silently her eyes blurred and after a moment she knew she was crying she didnt try to hide her tears only hoped the rain beating on her face would camouflage them who are you he shouted at her his voice harsh impatient what are you doing on this road where are you going she stared at him managed a traveler headed for the nearest port so i can get out of this soggy backwater she was surprised by the crisp bite of the words no sign of what she was feeling in them as if someone else were speaking for her her fear and anger lessened the tears stopped she sat silent waiting for his response your credeen he rode closer held out his hand what your permit to travel athin the honorific was an insult he drew his sword holding it lightly in his right hand the sigiled tag ah she thought furiously seemed the temuengs were trying to control travel and tighten their grip on croaldhu nothing of this had been in place three years ago at the last fair the kumaliyn didnt bother with such nonsense she dredged up the worst words she could think of cursing the temuengs officiousness the need to poke his nose in other peoples business all he had to do was ride on and let her be but he was waiting for some sort of answer and from the look of him wasnt inclined to accept excuses or pleas of ignorance she glanced quickly at jaril and yaril the werehounds had moved quietly out from her until almost obliterated by the rain she risked a look over her shoulder the other soldiers and the diligence were out of sight and hearing lifting a hand slowly so he could see it was empty she moved it in a broad arc from yaril to jaril they are all the permits i need temueng and yaril was a fireball rushing at his head and jaril was fire about his sword with a scream of pain he dropped the blade hastily brann said just chase this one off ive had enough lives the fires seemed to shrug then nipped and sizzled about the flanks of the already nervous horse driving it into a frantic bucking run after the diligence the shaken empush struggling to keep from being thrown into the mud one of the fires flowed into a large hawk and came flying back it swooped to the swords hilt caught it up and vanished into the rain with it a second later it was back settling to the ground beside coier yaril again as soon as the talons touched mud brann lifted her onto the saddle in front of her i gave that fool his sword yaril said better if he doesnt have to explain how he lost it she leaned back against brann smiled as the other fire returned and was a hound again standing beside the horse we got trouble enough once he connects up with those enforcers brann nudged coier into an easy canter im still glad hes alive we got trouble anyway whats one more stinking temueng she stroked yarils moonpale hair another hour she sighed stinking rain wasnt for that one of you could fly watch i dont know what to do i dont know brann rode on into the rain that dreary steady downpour that falls straight from clouds to earth and stays and stays until you forget what the sun feels like jaril laughed at the idea that anything so simple and natural as rain could keep him from flying and was following about an hours ride behind a dark gray mistcrane dipping in and out of clouds yaril was a hound again running easily beside the horse rested and wellfed coier had to be held to a steady lope he wanted to run and brann shared the urge but she didnt dare let him loose an hour passed then another the children could communicate over any distance bounded by the horizon why this limitation they either couldnt or wouldnt explain and jaril would give them an hours warning of pursuit a chance to discover a hide that would fool the followers another hour brann rode on between halfseen hedgerows beaten into a semblance of neatness by the downpour washed to a dark shiny green that glowed through the grays of rain and mud some fifteen minutes into the fourth hour the hound was suddenly yaril trotting by her knee screaming up at her over the hiss and splat of the rain riders coming up fast temuengs three from the diligence one of the enforcers half dozen besides new faces most likely occupation troops she dashed ahead of the horse was a hawk running then powering into the rain gone to look for a break in the hedges brann was frantic ten men men warned about her half a score of men who could stand at a distance putting arrows in her pincushion brann not something pleasant to contemplate adept as her body was at healing itself she had a strong suspicion there had to be a limitat which point she would be very dead the hedges on both sides of the road were high wild and flourishing taller than she was atop coier and likely as thick as they were tall even if she could somehow push through those murderous hounds on her trail would spot the signs shed have to leave and be through after her and shed have gained nothing would have lost if some of them had been living long enough hereabouts to know something of the land even a years patrolling would have taught them how they could drive her into a corner yaril came winging back touched down changed to childshape brann pulled her up before her once again so they could talk without having to shout nothing the changechild said no turnoffs far as i dared fly but theres a weak spot in the hedge about twenty minutes on a place where one of the bushes died brann started to protest but yaril shook her head its all there is bramble well contrive something now move she slid of changing in midair and went soaring away on hawk wings brann urged coier into a gallop and followed her feeling a surging exhilaration at the power under her the hedge on the left grew wilder and even the meager signs of tending evident before vanished completely straggly canes encroaching on the paving yaril stood in the road waving at a thin spot where the canes had withered away and the few leaves clinging to branchstubs were wrinkled and yellow without hesitation brann turned coier off the road and drove him toward the brittle barrier with voice heels and slapping hands head twisted back snorting protest he barreled through into a longneglected field that was grown to a fine thick crop of weeds in the center of which stood a shapeless structure with much of its thatching gone its stone walls tumbled down the stones charred black in spite of the rain and the many that had gone before she rode coier into the meager shelter through a door where half the frame still stood the other half lay in splinters among the charred stones and twisted weeds the roof that remained was sodden and leaking but it kept out the worst of the wet she dismounted with a sigh of relief and trembling legs glad to be out of that depressing incessant beatbeat on her body and head she closed her eyes and leaned against the endwall dripping onto the bird dung weeds old feathers bits of thatching that lay in a thick layer over the beatenearth floor but she couldnt stay there she looped the reins about the remnant of the door frame then ran back to yaril the changechild was dabbling in the mud resetting the clods that coiers hooves had thrown up helping the rain wash away the deep indentations his iron shoes had cut into the mud the hole in the hedge looked wide as a barn door brann tried to drag a few canes from the live bushes across the gap but that didnt seem to do anything but make the opening more obvious yaril straightened the mud sloughing off her leaving her dry and clean she saw what brann was doing giggled dont be silly bramble the pet name seemed to amuse her more and she laughed until she seemed about to cry then pulled herself together go on she said get into shelter jarils coming be here soon to keep watch when i cant cant watch then scoot yaril giggled again then stepped next to the twisty trunk of the bush and changed with startling suddenness she was a part of the hedge as green and vigorous wild and thorny as the bushes on either side of her shaking her head at her lack of thought brann trudged to the burnedout structure barn or house or storage crib whatever it was she stripped off her sodden clothing rubbed herself down with one of her blankets stripped the saddle and bridle off coier and rubbed him down until she was sweating with the effort doled out a double handful of cracked corn onto his saddle pad she tied on his tether and left him to his treat then got out her old filthy shirt and trousers slipped into them at least they were dry she wrinkled her nose at the smells coming from the dark heavy cloth but soon grew used to them again she folded the damp blanket into a cushion sat down with her back against the rough wall and was beginning to feel almost comfortable when jaril walked intheyre almost here he said youll hear them soon he squatted beside her far as i could see they didnt investigate any of the turnoffs theyre coming straight ahead pushing their horses hard on the chance they can overtake you what happens when they wear out their mounts and still havent come on us raise the countryside i expect listen through rain that at last was beginning to slacken she heard the pounding of hooves on the worn stone paving of the highroad coier lifted his head and moved restlessly she got to her feet and stood beside him a hand on his nose to silence him if he decided to challenge the beasts on the far side of the hedge she listened with her whole body as they went clattering pounding splashing past without slackening pace the noises fading swiftly into the south she let out the breath she was holding jaril squeezed her fingers gentlyim off bramble better i keep an eye on them awhile more he looked aroundi think you could chance a fire yarilll get you the makings dry them off you might as well eat something now it could get harder later then he was a mistcrane stalking out the door brann followed him stood watching his stilting run and soar beautifully awkward on the ground beauty itself in the air she stood wiping the damp off her face suddenly and simply happy to be alive delighted with the water running from her hair the breath in her lungs lifting and dropping her ribs she stood there long enough to see yaril dissolve out of the hedge and come walking through the wet weeds a slight lovely sprite a part of her now her family she smiled and waited for yaril to reach her brann woke from a long nap to find the afternoon turned bright as the clouds broke and moved off yaril was sitting in silence staring into the heart of a little fire her face enigmatic her narrow shoulders rounded the crystal eyes drinking in and reflecting the flames brann felt an immense sadness a yearning that made her want to cry it wasnt her own grief but waves of feeling pouring out of yaril for the first time she saw that theyd lost as much as she had drawn from their homeland and people as she was driven from hers and there was very little chance theyd ever return to either homes or people they were changed as she was changed exiled into a world where there was no one to share their deepest joys and sorrows brann licked her lips wanted to say something wanted to say she understood but before she could find the words yaril turned grinned jumped to her feet tacitly rejecting any intrusion into her feelings jarils on his way back rains over well ride tonight and if we can lay up tomorrow brann yawned whats he say temuengs went on till the rain stopped but they finally had to admit theyd missed you there was a bit of frothing at the mouth and toing and fming yaril giggledthen the enforcer rode on for tavisteen your favorite empush started back hes sending the temuengs one at a time down side roads to stir up the local occupation forces and looking careful at the hedges as he goes past time i got back to being a plant its boring but not quite so bad as being a rock with another giggle she got to her feet and ran out brann followed her to the opening watched her dart through the weeds to the hedgerow merge with the green shaking her head she turned away to fix herself a bit of supper while she waited for jaril to arrive the mistcrane flew ahead of them searching out clear ways leading them along twisty back roads that were little more than cowpaths moving mostly at night ducking and dodging watching temuengs and their minions spilled like disturbed lice across the land nosing down the smallest ways missing her sometimes by a hair a breath brann wormed slowly south and west heading for travisteen though that grew more and more difficult as the hunt thickened about her the children stole food for her corn for coier to keep his strength up because there was never enough rest and graze for him she grew lean and lined fatigue and hunger twin companions that never left her sleep continually interrupted meals snatched on therun five days seven ten sometimes forced into evasions so tortuous she came close to running in circles yet always she managed to win a little farther south twice temuengs blundered across her but with the childrens help she killed them and drank their lives passing some of that energy on to coier restoring the strength that the hard running was leaching from him the broad fertile plain at croaldhus heart dipped lower and lower until sedges and waterweeds began to replace the cultivated fields and the grassy pastures until pools of water gathered in the hollows and stood in still decay scummy and green with mud and algae the fringes of the marish a large spread of swampland and grassy fens like a scraggly beard on croaldhus chin a bar on her path a trap for her if she wasnt careful should the temuengs get close enough they could pin her against impassible water or bottomless muck the mistcrane flew back and forth along the edge of the marish trying to work out a way through it a straggling line from one dotsized mud island to the next wading through the pools and streams to test depth and bottom keeping as close to the highroad as he could so he wouldnt get them lost in the tangle of the wetlands even after the road turned to a causeway built on broad low stone arches a mans height above the water an additional danger because temuengs riding along the causeway could see uncomfortably far into that tangle he led brann and coier along his chosen route one that managed to keep a thin screen of cypress flerpine and rootrotted finnshon between her and that road the wounded moon was fattening toward full and the childrens crystal eyes saw as well by night as by day so they moved all night slowly with much difficulty struggling with impossible footing slipping and sliding half the time with brann dismounted and walking beside coier stroking him comforting him bleeding energy into him helping him endure stumbling on until they reached a mud island high enough to get them out of the water and away from the leeches and chiggers that made life a torment to the two fleshborn though they avoided the changechildren gray even during daylight everything was gray gray skies gray water gray mud dried on sedges and trees on low hanging branches gray fungus gray insects gray everything the stench of damp closed around her of rotting everything flesh fish vegetation three gray nights she rode three gray days she rested on mounds of mud and rotting reeds where she fed coier from the too rapidly diminishing supply of corn rubbed him down touching to death the leeches on his legs draining their small bits of life feeding it back into him once the leeches were drained they were easy enough to brush off falling like withered lengths of guttapercha by accident she discovered another attribute of her changed body as she fed that life into the weary trembling beast her hand was close to one of the oozing leechbites and she saw the bite seal over and heal with the feed by the end of the fourth night she was ready to chance the causeway rather than continue this draining slog as dawn spread a pale uncertain light over the water jaril led her deeper into the marish to an eyeshaped island considerably larger than the others with a small clump of vigorous sharpscented flerpines at one end a dry graveled mound at the center with some straggly clumps of grass a bit of stream running by it with water that looked clear and dean and tempting she resisted temptation and began going over coier her probing deadly touch killing gnats and borers chiggers and bloodworms and the everpresent leeches feeding the weary beast those bits of life it was a handy thing that deadly touch of hers and she was learning from far too much practice how to use it by now she could kill a mite on a mosquitos back and leave the mosquito unharmed after spreading a double handful of corn on his saddlepad she plunged into a stream and used a twist of grass to scrub the sweat and muck off her body and hair while she washed yaril thrust a hand into the pile of wood jaril collected and flew back to the island got a fire going and set a pot on to heat water for tea then took branns clothing to the stream and began scrubbing the shirts and trousers with sand from the mound when brann was clean inside and out when the water was boiled and the tea made when yaril had hung the sopping shirts and trousers on ragged branches of the pines brann sat naked on a bit of grass cool and comfortable for the first time in days watching coier standing in the water drinking sipping at her own drinking bowl the tea made from the scrapings of her supply but the more appreciated for that she set the bowl on her knee sighed i dont care how many temuengs are shuttling along the causeway come the night im getting coier and me out of this jaril looked at yaril nodded traffics been light the last few nights and he hesitated weve used more energy than i expected yaril and me were getting hungry think id like being the hunter for a change instead of the hunted she gulped at the tea holding it in her mouth letting the hot liquid slide down her throat to warm her all over coiers sick or something the waters got him or those bites he needs graze and rest more than anything rest me too maybe we could find a place to lay up once were past this mess she looked over her shoulder at the hazy sun rising above the pines could one of you do something about drying my clothes i dont feel right lying down with nothing on anything could happen to make us light out with no time to stop for dressing right while jaril doused the fire yaril changed went shimmering through branns wet clothing drying a set of shirt and trousers for her when she thought they were ready she brought them to brann get some sleep she said well watch brann woke tangled in tough netting made from cords twisted out of reed fiber and impregnated with fish stink she woke to the whisper of a drum to the suddenly silenced scream from coier as his throat was cut she woke to see little gray men swarming over the island little gray men with coarse yellow cloth wound in little shrouds about their groins little gray men with rough dry skin a dusty gray mottled in darker streaks and splotches like the skin of lizards shed watched sunning on her sunning rock little gray men butchering coier cutting his flesh from his big white hones she wept from weakness and sorrow and fury wept for the beast as she hadnt wept for her murdered sister her murdered people wept and fir a while thought of nothing else then she remembered the children she could move her head a little a very little it was late the shadows were long across the water no sign of the children anywhere another gray man sat beside a small crackling fire net cording woven about him and knotted in intricate patterns she guessed were intended to describe his power and importance a fringe of knotted cords dangled from a thick rope looped loosely about a small hard potbelly in an oddly beautiful longfingered reptilian hand he held a strange and frightening drum a snakes patterned skin stretched over the skull of a huge serpent with a highdomed braincase and eyeholes facing forward smiling he drew from the taut skin a soft insistent rustle barely louder than the whisper of the wind through the reeds a sound that jarred her when she thought about it but nonetheless crept inside her until it commanded the beat of her heart the inout of her breathing she jerked her body loose from thespell and shivered with fear magic he looked at her and she shivered again he sat before that tiny hot fire of twigs and grass his eyes fixed on her with a hungry satisfaction that chilled her to the bone she thought about the children and was furious at them for deserting her until the drummer reached out and ran a hand over two large stones beside his bony knee graywebbed crystals each large as a mans head crystals gathering the fire into them little broken fires repeated endlessly within his hand moving possessively over them he grinned at her baring the hard ridge of black gum that took the place of teeth in these folk enjoying her helpless rage until a commotion at the other end of the island caught his gaze she strained to see froze as a temueng walked into her arc of vision leading his mount and a pack pony with a large canvaswrapped load gray men crowded around him hissing or whistling snapping fingers stamping their broad clawed feet jostling him giving off clouds of a hate and fury barely held in check his nostrils flaring with disgust he looked over their heads and kept walking until he stood stiffly across the fire from the magic man notlooking at brann with such intensity she knew at once the marishmen had sold her she lay very still grinding her teeth with a rage greater than the gray mens you sent saying you had the witch the temuengs voice was deep and booming deliberately so brann thought meant to overpower the twitter and squeak of the gray men i brought the payment you required the drummer convulsed with silent laughter drew whispery laughs from his drum yellow man scourge a thee dryfoots he laughed some more sit scourge gray men trotted busily about building up the small fire into a snapping crackly pinesmelling blaze the magic man played with his drum its faint sounds merging with the noise of the fire the temueng sat in firmly dignified silence waiting for all this mummery to be done looking occasionally around to brann she glared hate at him and lay simmering when he looked away taking what satisfaction she could in his rapidly cracking patience the drum sound grew abruptly louder added a clickclickclack as the drummer tapped the nails of two fingers against the bone of the skull i ganumomo speak the drummer chanted garbling the plainspeak so badly she could barely understand what he was saying hah i ganumomo daah beah mos strong dreamer in ahhh mawiwamo continuing to scratch at the drumhead with two fingers of the hand that held the skull he scooped up one of the crystals held it at arms length above his head ganumomo naah fear fahfihmo see see he set the crystal down pursed his rubbery lips added a whispery whistle to the whispery rattle of the drum snapped off the whistle chabamawe naah sah strong magah da chabamawe naah hotha ganumomo hah dropping into a conversational tone he said you dryfoot you bring aulmeamomo with a grunt of assent the temueng got to his feet and went to the pack pony he unroped the canvas took a pouch from among the other items piled onto the packsaddle brought it back to the fire he dropped it beside the drummer returned to his seat across the fire from the gray man bringer of dreams he said more will be sent when we have the witch like you say what is it the chabummy i brought other things axe heads spear points fishhooks knives an earnest of final payment give me the witch fish that swim too straight he go net otha thing in the trading i ganumomo daah beah wanting no dryfoots come in mawiwamo i ganumomo daah beah wanting brann stopped listening as the bargaining went on focusing all her attention and will on the children it was no use she got no response at all no matter how hard she concentrated she moved about the little she could but her arms were pinned tight against her sides her legs were bound so tightly she couldnt even bend her knees the more she struggled the more inextricably she was tangled in the cords anger rumbled in her like the fireheart of tincreal anger that was partly her own and partly that wildness that took hold of her and killed the temueng pimush she was terrified when that happened somewhere deep within her there was terror now but it was overlaid by that melded fury she began to sing very softly tinder her breath the possession song that called the sleeping lady into the yongala and readied her for the great dances dance slya slya dance i am the path so walk me dance the sky the earth the all dance the round of beings thrall dance slya slya dance emanation puissance i am the cauldron empty me dance dissolution turbulence end of all tranquility dance slya slya dance i am the womb come fill me germination generation dance hard deaths fecundity dance the is and what will be dance the empty and the full dance the round of beings thrall though she sang so very softly and the magic man was deep in bargaining he sensed immediately what was building in and around her he broke off came round the fire and kicked her in the ribs the head but he was too late slya took her as she groaned slya called the drummers fire to her and it burned the nets to ash and nothing and it leaped from her to the magic man and he was a torch and it leaped from her to the temueng and he was a torch and it leaped from gray man to gray man until the island was a planting of torches frozen gray men burning temueng burning grass and trees burning pouch of dream dust burning in an absent blockedoff way she saw the packs and gear burned off the horse and pony without singing a hair on them though they ran in panic into the water and away finally the fire dimmed in her a last tongue licked out caressed the crystals yaril and jaril woke out of stone sat up blinking then slya was gone the island bare and barren the trees reduced to blackened stakes the ashes of the burned blowing into drifts and she was burdened with a fatigue so great she sank naked on charred sand and slept three days later she was temueng in form and face wearing stolen temueng gear riding on an elderly but shapely werehorse one good enough for temueng pride but not enough to tempt temueng greed her altered shape grace of the childrens manipulations and the lives of half a dozen temueng harriers they ambushed along the causeway the sun was setting in a shimmering clear sky and she was riding across the river on a stone bridge a quarter of a mile long turning onto a road paved with massive blocks of the same stone the city a dark mass against the flaming sky tavisteen gateway to the narrow sea branns questacross the narrow sea with sammanq schimti bastard rumors spread faster than trouble through tavisteen no one claimed them everyone heard them agitation on the plain temuengs dead or vanished silent celebrations in tavisteener hearts temuengs thrashing uselessly about interrupting spring planting rousting honest and otherwise folk from their homes stopping trader packtrains to question the men and rummage through their goods temuengs closing down the port more tightly than before suppressed fury in every tavisteener and an increase in smuggling tavisteeners being contrary folk the moment the ternueng tekora governing the city promulgated a rule thered be cadres of tavisteeners working to find ways to round it but they were wily and practical enough to pretend docility since the temuengs moved in and took over any trader caught in port went through long and subtle negotiations and paid large bribes if he wanted to sail out again another cause for fury it was ruining trade and this aggravation doubled because they were chasing some crazy woman who kept slipping like mist between their fingers in spite of the trouble she brought on them tavisteeners cheered her in the secret rooms of mind and heartand hoped shed go somewhere else agitation in the marish marishmen went gliding like gray shadows from the fens to attack temuengs and plainsfolk alike turning the causeway into a deathtrap for all but the largest parties and these lost men continually to poison darts flying without warning from the marish no one dared go into the wetlands to drive off the ambushers traffic along the road sank to a trickle then dried up completely agitation in tavisteen bodies without wounds lying in the darkest parts of dark alleys floating in the bay temuengs and tavisteeners alike the locals were small loss to the city since all of them without exception were castoffs without family to acknowledge them given to rape and general thuggery the other tavisteeners grumbled at the cost of exorcising all those stray ghosts but didnt bother themselves with listening to the complaints of the ghosts or hunting for the ghostmaker for the most part this was another case of silently applauding one they saw as something of a hero in spite of the trouble she was causing them the temuengs were not nearly so philosophical about the mysterious force stalking and killing them temueng enforcers began snap searches surrounding a section of the city or the wharves turning everyone into the street checking their credeens searching houses and warehouses ripping furniture boxes and bales apart kicking walls in even turning out ship holds beating tavisteeners and foreign sailors with angry impartiality hauling chosen members of both sorts off to the muccaits for questioning sometimes they made several of these searches in a single day sometimes they let several days pass with none sometimes they struck in the middle of the night they found smugglers caches forbidden drugs and weapons illegal stills prisoners escaped from any of a dozen muccaits and other things of some interest to the tekora they did not find the woman sammang shipmaster sat hunched over a tankard of watery beer scowling at the battered table top his dark strongfeatured face the image of his islands war god squat and powerful was that god a figure carved from sorrel soapstone and polished to a satin shine meant to inspire awe and terror in the beholder the rest of the taverns patrons not at all a gentle lot sat at the far side of the room and left him to his brooding now and then he tugged at an elongated earlobe the heavy gold pendant that usually hung there hed sold that morning to pay docking fees the little left had to keep him and his men for a while longer soon though hed have to break from the mooring and try to run past the ships and the guard tower at the narrow mouth of the harbor not something he contemplated with any pleasure trebuchets hurling hundredpound stones springals with javelins that could pierce the thickest of ship timbers fireboats anchored beyond to take care of what was left of any ship sneaking out skryers to spot anyone trying to run under the cover of magic temuengs were thorough buatorrang curse their greedy bellies he had a cargo of arth slya wares smuggled down from the fair by an enterprising tavisteener under the noses of the tern uengs whod grabbed everything they could with some hides and fleeces from the plains nothing that would spoil or lose its worthif he could get the girl out of this wretched port he growled deep in his throat his broad square hand tightening on the tankard until the metal squealed protest sammang schimli the shipmaster he looked up the lines deepening between his thick black brows the corners of his mouth dipping deeper into the creases slanting from flared nostrils he ran his eyes slowly over the woman standing on the far side of the table shove off whore im not looking for company he shut his eyes and prepared to ignore her the woman pulled out a chair sat across from him nor i shipmaster only passage out of tavisteen to utarselt and im not a whore eyes still closed thumbs moving up and down the sides of the tankard he said im going nowhere soon woman i know his eyes snapped open and he stared at her if youll tell me just what you need to shake yourself loose she went on and we can agree on terms ill see what i can do about financing your clearance he looked her over no not a whore not reacting to him right for that she was interested but in an oddly childlike and at the same time cerebral way none of the body signs of sexual awareness under the mask of calm a nervous uncertainty he clicked tongue against teeth widened his eyes as he realized who she must be she had large green eyes in a face more interesting than pretty rather gaunt right now as if shed been hungry for a long time a full mouth held tightly in check skin like alabaster in moonlight the hands on the table were long narrow strong hands not accustomed to idleness shoulder length soft silver hair catching shimmers from the taverns lamps whenever she moved her head wholly out of place here he had a sudden suspicion shed look out of place anwhere he could think of by preemalaus nimble tail how she ran loose in this part of the city was a thing to intrigue a man he drew his tongue along his bottom lip tapped his thumbs on the table maybe she could break the girl loose maybe shed put his head in a temueng stranglers noose a gamble but what wasnt why not he said we cant talk here he thought about the rumors the dead on the plain the dead in the city the dead floating in the bay then he drained the tankard set it down with a loud click that made her hands twitch i have a room upstairs she smiled suddenly a mischievous gamins grin that changed her face utterly be careful shipmaster you dont want to make me angry he stood your choice leaving her to follow if she would not so sure anymore he didnt want female company he went up the several flights of stairs hearing now and then her quiet steps behind him he was rooming on the fifth floor up under the roof not so much for the cheaper price as for the breezes that swept through the unglazed windows he unlocked his door shoved it open walked in and stopped two children sat crosslegged on his bed moonlight glimmering on pale hair glowing in crystal eyes the woman brushed past him settled herself in the rickety chair by one window my companions she said close the door when he hesitated she giggled afraid of a woman and a pair of kids he looked at the key in his hand shrugged might be the smartest thing ive done in months he pulled the door shut latching its bar and went to perch on the sill of the nearest window yaril the woman said any snoops about no brann the fairest of the two children grinned at her but jaril did drop a rock on hermy the nose nearby the child with the shade darker hair waggled a hand soso got him a couple streets back fossicking about trying to figure out what happened to you no one else interested in you well except for the usual reasons hah brat talk about what you know still mmh i think you better go prowl about outside see we arent interfered with she turned to sammang let him out will you please what could the kid do more than you want to know shipmaster he shrugged come on kid when the latch was again secure he stumped to the window hitched a hip on the sill angled so he could look out over the roofs toward the estuary and at the same time see the woman and the remaining child why me he said why not a temueng ship theyre going in and out all the time cheaper too because im going to cost you brann is it right im going to cost you a lot maybe more than im worth you who i think you are youve already fooled temuengs high and wide seems to me you could go on fooling them just as easy not that im usually this candid with paying customers you understand but i want to know just what im getting into candid he raised both brows said nothing you know quite well what youre getting into shipmaster the childhe was growing more certain it was a girlslid off the bed and walked with eerie silence across the usually noisy floorboards touched a pale finger to the wick of the stubby candle sitting on the unsteady table that was the rooms only other piece of furniture the wick caught fire spread a warm yellow glow over brann and sammang touched the hills and hollows of the lumpy bed she went back to where shed been and sat gazing intently at him for a long uneasy moment sharp images of the candle flame dancing upside down in her strange eyestell him she said hes hooked he might as well know the whole maybe he could come up with better ideas than we can he knows this city and the temuengs you can trust him with just about anything he isnt trying to sell you he scowled at the girl snorted at her impudent grin turned to the woman have you heard of arth slya she said her voice broke on the last words she cleared her throat waited for his answer who hasnt it was my home was he leaned forward suddenly very interested if arth slya was gone the slya wares hidden in his hold had suddenly jumped in value jumped a lot temuengs came a pimush and fifty men tried to take my people away killed once again her voice broke hastily she turned her head away until she had control again in a muffled voice she said killed the littlest and the oldest marched the others off off for slaves on the emperors orders the pimush told me slaves for the emperor he called him old lardarse the pimush did hes dead his men dead i killed the children and i killed them my folk are home again the ones left trying to put things things together again her shoulders heaved she breathed quickly for a space then lifted her head and spoke more crisply her mask back in place slya woke and tincreal breathed fire scrambled the land so arth slya is shut away as long as the temuengs hold croaldhu i doubt youll hear much of arth slya he tugged at his earlobe narrowed his eyes youre going after the emperor no well not exactly this is the year of the grannsha fair i know slyaborn i came for it and caught my tail in this rattrap there were slya folk at the fair the pimush told me they were taken to andurya durat where they were going to be installed in a special compound the emperor old lardarse she laughed it was not a comfortable sound he built for them slaves shipmaster my father and two of my brothers my kin and kind i will not leave them slaves she spoke with a stony determination that made him happy he was neither temueng nor slaver he nodded approving her sentiment it was what hed have done in similar circumstances which buatorrang and the preemalau grant would never happen he wasnt so sure he wanted to involve himself and the girl in this but it might be worth the gamble where she was now she was like to rot before he could pry her loose there was a lot the woman wasnt telling him but he didnt think this was quite the moment to bring that up my greatest difficulty she said is i havent been out of arth slya before and know very little about the world down here youre not doing so bad saiir he smiled and you knew enough to come here instead of grannsha ignorance is not the same as stupidity shipmaster and you want to go to utarselt slipping in the back door i have to be careful im all there is its not very likely you can do anything but get yourself killed she shook her head looked stubborn ive taught temuengs here they arent masters of the world you have that how do you keep from being caught cant be two women on this island look like you i know a trick or two how much will this cost he rubbed a hand across his chin fifty gold for passage you and the children in advance done the urchin grin again it charmed him but not enough for him to reduce the price though he was rather disappointed that she hadnt bothered to haggle itll take a few days to steal that much he raised his brows temueng strongboxes she said defiantly they owe me more than they could ever pay though i beggared the lot of them and dont worry shipmaster i wont get caught or tangle you in temueng nets now the rest of it what papers do you need what signatures what seals who do you have to bribe how much gold will it take and how soon do you need it four days later tavisteen gone quiet no more dead no alarums out for an impudent thief though he listened for them and had his crew listening when they werent getting the girl ready to sail the room up under the roof late afternoon light streaming in heavy with dust motes a salt breeze blowing hot and hard through the windows tugging at the papers brann dropped on the table look them over shipmaster i think theyre right but youll know better than i if theyll pass that he could read a number of scripts was one of the several reasons the children had for choosing him theyd walked his mind in dream learning the language of his islands learning much of what he knew about the ports he visited and more about his character he was a man of strong loyalties who kept his crew together cared for them gave them money to live on though that meant his limited resources vanished more quickly a man whose love for his ship was as fierce as her love for her folk and firehearted tincreal a man of many gifts who could read water air sky and landshapes as if they were words scribed in a book hard when he needed to be hard with a center of tenderness he let very few see a brown square man with a largefeatured square face sitting by the window with the sun giving a sweat sheen to his tightgained skin he was a creature of living stone a seagod carved from redbrown jasper with eyes of polished topaz he affected her in ways she didnt understand did things to that adult body shed so suddenly acquired that she didnt want to understand this terrified her even sickened her because she could not forget no matter how she tried the temueng censor grunting on top of her reaming into her she dreamed that time again and again the children having to wake her because her cries might betray that nights hiding place she watched the man and wanted him to touch her her breasts felt sore and tight there was a burning sweetness between her thighs she forced her mind away from her intrusive body and tried to concentrate on the papers and what the man would say of them sa mang felt her restlessness looked up where are the children around never mind them how soon can we leave he shook his head you are an innocent wait a minute he began going through the papers again holding them up to the light wondering by what magic shed come up with them not a flaw in them at least none he could find when he was finished he squared the pile flattened a hand on it how much noise did you make getting these none the temuengs who signed and stamped them were well call it sleepwalking they wont remember anything of what happened handy little trick mmmh he tapped his forefinger on the pile of paper cant go anywhere without these but its only a start o disturber of temueng peace and mine even with gold to ease their suspicions well have to be careful to touch the right men and move fast before the wrong men start talking to each other how much gold without waiting for an answer she leaned out the window brought back a heavy bag which she set on the table in front of him before he could say anything she had twisted away she brought in a second bag dumped it and was out again pulling in a third with quick nervous movements she went away from him to sit on the bed today she seemed very aware of him as a man her response woke his own he eyed her with interest wondering what bedding a witch would be like she looked hastily away skittish creature well sammo thats for later he unwound the wire from the neck of the first bag began setting out the coins brows raising as he broached the other bags and the piles multiplied ten each in rows of ten ten rows of ten a thousand gold a full thousand heavy hexagonals soft enough to mark with his thumbnail even without weighing and trying them he was sure they werent mixed with base metal something you had to watch for here in tavisteen the tricky when he finished he sat frowning at the mellow gold glimmer and i thought to discourage her by asking a ridiculous price for her passage he looked up this much high assay gold will be missed she shook her head not soon these are from the tekoras private stash dust and cobwebs over the lockboxes with a laugh and a shake of his head he began putting the coins back in the sacks you wouldnt consider signing on with me as bursar i do like the idea of paying off the tekoras men with the tekoras gold he set two of the sacks on the paper pile held out the third here you hang onto this you might need it she shook her head no i dont want it when can we leave he dropped the sack on the table frowned tides right round midmorning tomorrow but id rather put off leaving another day have to provision the girl top off the water barrels dont want to look hurried either set noses twitching he drummed his fingers on the table top lips moving as he conned the tides why not midday three days on she blooded a moment nodded can you and the children get on board without anyone seeing you when she laughed at that he went on a temueng pilot will be coming along hes to get us past the forts and fireships good enough but hell stick his nose into every corner before he lets us leave can you handle that i think so you can really be ready to sail that quickly i could sail yesterday his voice was angry violent if it werent for those lapalaulaucursed sharks she slid off the bed started for the door turned back i forgot to ask how long from here to utarselt say we get good winds and we arent jumped ten twelve days the girls a clever flyer that long you want a shorter route its only five days to the mouth of the garrunt but dont ask me to take the girl anywhere near the fens which i understand are a maze of mud and stink and hostile swampfolk no thanks the marish was bad enough seems to me the long way round is the shortest route all things considered he got up and walked over to her touched the side of her face dropped his hand on her shoulder need you go right now she stopped breathing green eyes suddenly frightened she moved away would not look at him i only ask he said mildly he didnt try to move closer she let out a long shaky breath how old do you think i am sammang schimli he raised a brow shall i flatter or speak the truth truth mmm midtwenties maybe a bit more he crossed his arms over his chest a lovely age brann old enough to have salt in the mix young enough to enjoy the game she set her shoulders against the door her agitation visibly increasing it puzzled him disturbed him made him wonder if she was whole in the head if not what a waste i wouldnt wouldnt know she flattened her hands against the door then burst out im eleven i know what i look like i know its hard to believe but inside here im eleven years old the children changed me grew me older i went to sleep a girl and woke a woman like this she swept a hand along her body dared to look at him a moment how could a child do what i have to do eleven he frowned at her uncertain she nodded shyly abruptly you you do disturb me shipmaster she rushed on but im not ready for what you offer abruptly he believed her saw the child there marveled that he hadnt understood it before when her urchins grin flashed out when she relaxed and let her mask drop she was little sister mischievous childif he didnt look at her body he backed off nice child good child bright and warm and loving he discovered that he liked her a lot and wanted to help her all he could too bad he said but were still friends she blushed nodded if it were otherwise she fumbled the door open and ran out he followed her watched her slow as she went down the stairs until she was the cool witch hed first seen shaking his head he shut the door went back to the table to tuck the papers in a leather pouch the children spooky little bits those eyes preemalaus bouncing tits changed her he shivered at the thought momentarily chilled in spite of the heat eleven what a thing to do to her to me he slid a hand down one of the bags of gold the corners of the hexagonal pieces hard against his palm then stripped its tie off and began stowing the coins about his person the other two bags he shoved in the pouch on top of the papers no more arth slya wares for a good while anyway and im the only one in tavisteen who knows that he chuckled patted the bulging pouch began humming a lively tune too soon to be passing out bribes might as well nose out some more of the slya wares shed passed the gold on didnt care what he did with it as long as he got her out when shes a few years older what a woman shell be taking on the whole damn tenaueng empire and getting away with it yes hed wager even the girl she got away with it shouldve had hairy jimm hanging around below this much gold was honey to the tongue for the thugs hanging about he bent transferred the boot knife to his sleeve still humming he left the room locked the door behind him went lightly down the stairs the songs traditional refrain ousted from his head by a more seductive one the siren song of the traders game where profit was more the measure of skill than anything important in itself no more slya ware his mind sang to him no more no more and when the word gets out when that word gets out the price goes up up up youre a lucky man sammang schimli though youd have traded places with a legless octopus a week ago slya ware slya ware rare it is and growing rarer no one knows gonna be no more the temueng enforcers went like locusts through his goods but the smuggled treasures were deep in the bundles of hides and fleeces his crew went after the lapalaulau castrate and put things together again stowing the bales and casks properly so the girl was ready to go when the sun was directly overhead and the lice were off the ship when the girl was tugging at her mooring eager as sammang was to be gone he stood at her rail wind whipping his hair into his eyes and mouth as he waited for the pilot he watched the skinny tern ueng his pockets heavy with branns gently thieved gold leave the sourfaced harbor master clamber into a dinghy sit stiff and somber while the masters men rowed him out to the girl sammang wondered briefly where brann and the children were then walked forward to help the pilot over the rail he showed the temueng about the ship fuming as the man poked and pried into her cracks and crannies even into the crews quarters opening their seabags sticking his long crooked nose where it had no business being the crew resented it furiously but were too happy to be getting back to sea to show their anger they watched with sly amusement as the temueng they named him in whispers slimeslug went picking through sammangs quarters with the same prissy thoroughness they passed the open door again and again savoring sammangs disgust he held his tongue with difficulty beckoned hairy jimm in to take a chair on deck for the pilot and he lingered a moment after the pilot followed jimm out to grin at a large sea chest the temueng hadnt seemed to notice and salute as soon as he could he left the pilot sitting with his signal flags across his knees lowering the level in a sack of red darra wine brann was sitting on his bed flanked by the notchildren there was a shimmer about her a snapping energy weve pulled the hook the pilots getting drunk on deck were just about loose young brann but hold your breath until were past the fireships he dropped his eyes to the full breasts swaying with the movement of the ship beneath the heavy white silk of her shirt sighed as he saw the nipples harden she smiled eleven she said though im getting older by the minute yeah arent we all the blond boy had his head in her lap the girl was curled up tight against her both were deeply limply asleep with their eyes closed they seemed more like real children theyve been working hard the past few nights she said theyre worn out worn out that too was something hed just as soon not have explained not much point in hiding down here once we put the pilot off you can trust my men theyre a good bunch he frowned no no you wait here until i have a talk with them which i will do once we pour that gilded gelding into his dinghy you get seasick i dont know ive never been on a boat before buatorrangs fist woman ship not boat ship he fished under the bed found a canvas bucket spew in this if the need takes you he looked at the sleeping children them too he started out the door turned i wont leave you shut up longern i have to um my crew theyre not delicate flowers dont mind the way they talk stop fussing shipmaster i have got a little sense or havent you noticed feeling better about everything sammang went back on deck and stood by the rail watching hairy jimm maneuver the girl among the ships crowding the estuary the pilot was paying little attention to what was happening about him his title had atemueng twist to it he wasnt there to guide them through the harbors natural snags but to ease them past the far more deadly manmade obstacles the day was brilliant with a brisk headwind and tide and river current together were enough to carry the girl barepoled out to the stone pincers at the mouth of the bay stays singing about him the salt smell growing stronger than the stench of estuary mud and city sewage the shimmering blue water blown into sharp ridges white foam dancing along them sammang relished everything about the day the colors and sounds the mix of smells the exploding array of possibilities ahead of him the pilot shoved onto his feet as the ship came up to the two great towers looming over the narrow mouth of the estuary settled himself and began whipping his signal flags about when specks of bright color bloomed and swung atop the south tower he made a last pass then rolled up his flags sheathed them and dumped himself back in the chair ignoring the crew who took every chance they found to walk up stare at him and stroll away again hairy jimm kept a minatory eye on them and the heckling didnt go beyond staring hed made it quite clear early on that anyone who laid a hand on the pilot would go overboard there and then more than one of the crew had deep grudges against the temuengs and the parade could have disiritegyated into a shivaree with a dead temueng at the end of it when they began crowding too close and staying too long sammang nudged hairy jimma and the big brown bear lumbered forward and stopped the parade the ship slid without incident between the towers began to lose way as the channel widened abruptly and the flow spread out hairy jimm sent tikrat and turrope to raise the jib and ordered the ship into a tack so the wind wouldnt push them into the teeth of the gate the girl was a twomasted merchariter with standing lugsails a configuration that could have been clumsy and often was but she was sammangs dream and hed watched her rise from bare bones under the hands of his great uncle kenyara more than that hed built with his own hands model after model had sat with kenyara and argued and trimmed the models and made her come to life as much by will as by the work of his hands and the gold he brought back to the pandaysarradup the wood hed searched out and brought back the fittings hed gathered from most of the ports he touched in his travels the eyes on her bow hed carved and painted himself she could sail closer to the wind than most her size could squat down and ride storm waves as well as any petrel she was an extension of himself and he loved her far more than he would ever love man or woman loved her with a passion and a delight that would have embarrassed him into stammering if he had to talk about it seeing her dulled and dying and quiet at the mooring had been the worst of many bad times during the months of stagnation in tavisteen now he felt her come to life under his feet and hands he stood smoothing his hand along her rail in a contented secret caress young brann i owe you whatever you want you and your he cleared his throat with a sound half a laugh half a groan the children scared him and he had no hesitation admitting that to himself brann was pleasanter to the mindchild woman fighter with a passion caring stubbornness that reminded him very much of a younger sammang he thought fondly of a few of his own childhood exploits as he watched the fireships swinging at anchor the last line to pass then they were free he took a deep breath the air filled the lungs better out here he looked at the slouched temueng half asleep and reeking of the wine theyd fed him or it would soon as they got that off the girls deck they put the pilot and his minions overside in the trailing dinghy set and trimmed the sails and left the fireboats in their wake sammang stood sniffing at the wind gave a short shout of freedom and celebration grinned as he caught the cheerfully obscene salutes from dereech and his shadow aksi he moved to the wheel cuped his hands about his mouth bellowed tikrat turrope aski leymas dereech gaoez staro rudar zaj gather round when they were around him squatting on the gently heaving deck sammang clasped his hands behind his head grinned at them still riding high with the effects of breaking the girl loose and incidentally sneaking past the temueng clutches the woman they were turning the island upside down to find we got a passenger he said he stretched straining his muscles till his joints popped the woman the temuengs were hunting one who kicked those sharks where it hurt we dont mind that do we he grinned into their grins grimaced as the wind blew hair into his teeth rotting in tavisteen hed let his hair grow long too despondent to get it cut we owe her he said still be watching moss grow up the walls without her help witch he said nice kid but no mans meat not mine not yours ever see what happens if a silili priest holds onto a rocket too long after its lit uhhuh so keep your hands to yourselves this old fart talking to you he wouldnt like to see what comes down if one of you got her into a snit hanh hairy jimm rubbed a meaty hand across his beard i heerd a thing or two about that nakki that makes me leery of her what keeps her hands off us relax jimm shes a good kid treat her like a little sister he thought a minute not so little he looked round at the crew thats it they went off to busy themselves with the endless tasks that kept a ship healthy but hairy jimm fidgeted where he was turropes boor was telling him the fen pirates are taking everything that moves be you temu be you panay whatever how you want to handle that a good wind and no proas going to catch the girl turropes hoor has got a busy ear she say the djelaan have found them a weatherman sammang laughed if he sticks his head up ill sic the witch on him he sobered shes paying us for a quick passage jimm cutting south would add at least five days give your totoom a thump for me and whistle us a steady blow he rubbed thumb and forefinger over the fingerpieces of the heavy gold pendant in his left ear the first thing hed ransomed with branns gold tracking down the buyer and leaning on him till he sold ill talk to her see what she says he watched jimm walk away watched him try the tension of backstays eye the sails for weak spots look for any problems hed missed in port things that would only show when she was moving with a nod to uasuf silent at the wheel sammang went to stand in the bow hands clasped behind him staring out across the empty blue empty now but how long would it stay that way for a few breaths he stopped worrying and simply relished the way the girl was taking the waves and the wind she was a trier his sweet girl even with her hull fouled with weed and barnacles she danced over the waves preemalau be gentle and send no storms she had to be careened and cleaned gone over for dry rot and wood worm every bit of cordage checked and replaced if necessary he knew as well as hairy jimm how fragile she was right now he unclasped his hands touched her stays feeling the hum in them touched her wood feeling the life in it loving her for her beauty and her gallant heart afraid for her cursing the djelaan pirates cursing all weathermen cursing the temuengs who were too busy with conquest to keep their own coasts clean he watched the dolphins dance in the bow waves a while longer then went below to see how brann was faring and talk to her about jimms disclosures how soon until were in djelaan waters she said four days he said too far she said wear the children out for what could be nothing you dont farsee he said the temuengs call me witch she said their mistake dont you make the same one i have certain abilities but theyre useful only in touchingdistance then we should turn south in two days go wide around the djelaan corals he said how many days would that add four probably five too long she said id be a shade by then and the children would be hungry then we sail on luck and hope he said and fight if we have to theres nothing else no the next two days passed bright and clear with spanking winds that propelled the ship across the glittering blue as if she were greased sammang watched brann move about the ship taking pains to keep out of the way of anyone who was working she respected skill and found the sailors fascinating both things showed the crew saw both were flattered and fascinated in their turn and the children helped with that by staying below where their strangeness wouldnt keep reminding the men of corpses in dark alleys and corpses floating in the bay young tikrat was wary of her for an hour or two but he succumbed to her charm after shed followed him about awhile as he played his pipe to help the work go easier he spent the hour after that teaching her worksongs leymas was the next she won he taught her a handful of knots then set her to making grommets she was neatfingered and used to working with her hands and delighted when he praised her efforts sammang continued to watch when he had a moment free amused by her ease with them as if they were older brothers or male cousins as if she willed them to forget her ripe body damping ruthlessly any hint of sexuality one by one his crew fell to her charm and began treating her as a small sister they were rather fond of fonder as the second day faded into the third by then he couldnt move about the deck without finding her huddled with one of the men her strong clever hands weaving knots her head cocked to one side listening with skeptical delight to the extravagant tale he was spinning for her even hairy jimm told her lies and let her take the wheel so she could feel the life of the ship while he showed her how to read the black lady the swinging lodestone needle and put that together with the smell of the wind and the look of the sea to keep the ship rushing along the proper course she had relaxed abruptly and utterly all her own wariness and pretenses and was the child of the gentle place where shed been reared he saw in her the naive and trusting boy hed been when he found his island growing too small for him and hed smuggled himself on board one of the trading ships that stopped at perando in the pandaysarradup hed been confident in his abilities and eager to see the great world beyond never hurt deliberately and with malice trust never betrayed friendly as a puppy it took a lot of trampling and treachery to knock most of that out of him he saw the same kind of trust in her and he sighed for the pain coming to her but knew he couldnt shield her from that painand if he could he wouldnt to survive she had to learn even the temuengs hadnt taught her to be afraid of others here surrounded by people who were not threatening who responded to her friendliness with good will and friendliness of their own shed let her guard down not a good habit to get into still he couldnt condemn it totally as foolishness it had done her good with the men and he had to admit to himself with him the fifth day slid easily into the sixth no djelaan yet but the rising of the sun showed him clouds blowing about a low dark smear north and west of the girl the southernmost of a spray of uninhabited coral atolls most of them with little soil and no water good only to shelter pirate proas while the djelaan waited to ambush ships that ventured past he scowled at it was it empty of life except for birds and a few small rodents or were a dozen proas pulled up on one of its crumbly beaches with a weatherman set to cast his spells brann came to the bow and stood beside him is that selt no thought it was a bit soon djelaanr if theyre coming thats where theyll come from she chewed her lip a moment i cant judge distances at sea well come even with the island about midafternoon be about a halfdays sail south of it and youd like to know if you can relax or should get ready to fight right and the trip is a little more than half over wind keeps up and pirates keep away we should be in silili say about sundown five days on mmm children lying dormant they havent used as much energy as theyd ordinarily do she looked around at the crew then straightened her shoulders stiffened her spine jaril will fly over the islands and yaril will tell us what he sees youd better warn nam and the others its sort of startling the first time you see one of the children changing sammang wasnt sure what was going to happen but suspected it would be spectacular and remind him and his crew forcibly she wasnt little sister to all the world he patted her hand they wont faint bramble she looked up at him startled then halfsmiled and shook her head well id better fetch them up she left him and moved with brisk assurance along the deck he went back to stand by hairy jimm who had taken the wheel awhile because he was nearly as fond of the girl as sammang and loved the feel of her under his hands our witch is getting set to scare the shit out of us hanh jimm took a hand off the wheel scratched at his beard hey she our witch sammo ehh stubb he boomed on your feet the dozing helmsman started came to his feet looked dazedly about huh then he came awake a bit more and strolled yawning over to them grab hold as soon as staro the stub had the wheel jimm moved away our witch gon be showing her stuff and i want a close eye on it by the time brann came up on deck with yaril and jaril the news had spread through the crew even those supposed to be sleeping settled themselves inconspicuously about the deck doing small bits of busywork sammang looked around amused the way hairy jimm said our witch with the air of a new father contemplating his offspring made him want to laugh until he realized he felt much the same way she came up to sammang and hairy jim whats the most common large bird that flies out this far albatross why she turned to the boy you know that one jaril grinned at her and suddenly the grin was gone the boy was gone there was a shimmer of gold and a large white bird with black wingtips was pulling powerfully at the air and rising in a tight spiral above the ship a heartbeat later it was speeding toward the island yaril srrs with her back against the mast her eyes shut her high young voice sounding over the wind and water sounds the creaking of mast and timber first island nothing from high up going closer some birds objecting no beaches no sort of anchorage going on to the next silence the listeners wait without fuss quietly working not talking second island more trees dont see any sign of surface water definitely deserted quiet enough to hear a rat scratch silence sammang gazes at brann wondering what she is thinking third island this ones the lucky dip a dozen proas drawn up by a stream cutting through a bit of beach apparently waters the main attraction maybe a hundred djelaan war party clubs spears throwing sticks long knives war axes a clutch of them cheering on a tattooed man whos throwing a fit ah the fits over look at them scoot anyone want to wager the tattooed gent wasnt telling them about this fine fat ship passing by get a move on folks you got trouble rolling at you they raced west and south carrying as much sail as the rigging would stand the girl groaning and shuddering fighting the drag of the weed on her hull in spite of that she sang splendidly through the water she popped rigging and staggered now and then but the crew replaced and improvised and held her together as much by will as skill sammang was all over the deck adding his strength where it was needed eyes busy searching for breaks he heard laughter and saw brann beside him her gyeen eyes snapping with sheer delight in the excitement swirling about her for a breath or two he gwzed at her and was very nearly the boy whod run to the wider world confidently expecting marvels then he went back to nursing his girl the wind dropped between one breath and the next the girl shivered and lost way the drag of the weed braking her with shocking suddenness sammang cursed stood looking helplessly about the crew exchanged glances dropped where they were to squat waiting hands busy splicing line one man whittling a new block to replace one that had split brann touched sammangs arm jaril says the proas are about an hour behind us how many twelve traveling in two groups the tattooed manthat has to be the weatherman jaril thinks so and i agreehes hanging behind with a couple boats to guard him the other nine are riding a mage wind at us really flying jaril says how many men in each boat nine or ten eighty maybe ninety not counting the bodyguards he scowled at the limp sails a wind even a breath jarils thought of that hes been trying to get at the weatherman but he keeps bouncing off some kind of ward whether he comes at the proa out of the sky or under water only thing he can think of is a pod of midsized whales he spotted a little way back when he broke off talking he was going to find them he plans to drive them at the proas spell or no spell a half dozen irritated whales are going to swamp that boat he figures a weatherman will drown as fast as any other breather and once hes gone you should have your wind thing is though he doesnt know quite how long its going to take so you should be ready for a fight sammang nodded touched her arm our witch he said felt rather than heard a murmur of agreement from the crew youll fight with us in my way she grimaced looked around at the circle of grave faces raised her voice so all could hear listen brothers when it starts dont touch me i am drinker of souls and deadlier than a viper i dont want accidents i prefer to choose where i drink sammang nodded said nothing yaril tugged at his sleeve what do you want me to be sammang shipmaster serpent wildcat falcon dragon itd have to be a small dragon sammang blinked at the notchild falcon sounds good you wouldnt get in our way and you could go for their eyes she considered a moment nodded be even better if i make some poison glands for the talons then all i have to do is scratch them sammang blinked some more be careful whom you scratch he said after he got his voice back dont worry ive done this before she stretched yawned went to curl up by the mast a moment later she seemed sound asleep he turned to brann raised a brow dont ask me she saidbefore they came here probably thats something i havent seen sammang went below and dug out his war ax a steel version of the stone weapon hed learned to swing as a boy in the godwar dances his fathers passed on to him an ax that hadnt been used in a real war since his greatgrandfather carried it against setigo the next island over after hed shipped out a few years he got very drunk and nostalgic and spent most of his remaining coin hiring a smith to make a copy of the bloody old ax describing it to him as a curving elongated meat cleaver point heavy with a short handle carved to fit his grip zaj and gaoez the bowmen of the crew climbed on the cabins roof and sat waiting arrow bundles between their knees hairy jimm was swinging his warclub to get the feel of it a longhandled lump of ironwood too heavy to float other crew members were using hones on cutlasses or spearpoints razor discs or stars whipping staffs about making sure clothing and bodies were loose enough to fight effectively djelaan never took prisoners either they were driven off or everyone on the ship died the girl wallowed in the dead calm close by several fish leaped and fell back the sounds they made unnaturally loud in that unnatural silence yaril woke fidgeted beside brann im going up she said suddenly she dissolved into a gold shimmer then was a large redmask falcon climbing in a widening spiral until she was a dark dot high overhead circling round and round in an effortless glide brann stood still looking frightened and uncertain the hour crept past men occupied with small chores fidgeting with their weapons the redmask left her circling and came swooping down screaming a warning found a perch on the foresail yard silence a few breaths the sea empty then the djelaan came out of nowhere yelling heating on flat drums proas racing toward the girl their triangular sails bulging with the magewind a wind that did not touch the girls sagging canvas zaj and gaoez jumped up and began shooting almost emptying the first proa before the mage wind began taking their shafts and brushing them aside they shot more slowly after that compensating for the twist of the wind managed to pick off another halfdozen before the djelaan bobtail spears came hissing at them propelled with murderous force by the throwing sticks they hopped about dodging the spears and getting off an ineffective shaft or two until hairy jimm began batting spears aside with his warclub the rest of the crew darted about catching up those that tumbled to the deck and hurling them back at the proas doing little damage but slowing the advance somewhat then grapnels were sinking into the wood of the rail the djelaan attacking from both sides sammang and others raced along the rails slashing the ropes until there were too many of them and they had to fight men instead of rope yaril screamed powered up from the yard and dived at the proas not a falcon anymore but a small sun searing through the sails the weatherman was holding the air motionless trapping the girl but protecting her too in seconds she was swaying untouched in a ring of flames as the proa sails burned and began to char the masts and rigging with shouts of alarm half of the attackers turned back and began to fight the fires that threatened to leave them without a means of retreat the rest swarmed over the rails and the girls men were fighting for their lives cutlass ax and halberd warclub staff and all the rest flailing stabbing slashing a ring of men tight about the foremast holding off the hordes that tried to roll over them yaril flew at djelaan backs stooping and slashing her razor talons moistened with the poison she and her brother could produce when inspired to do so keeping the djelaan off brann as she walked through them reaching and touching reaching and touching each touch draining and dropping a man a spear went into her side she faltered a moment pulled it out with a gasp of pain sweat popping out on her face a trickle of blood then the wound closed over and she walked on at first the attackers didnt realize what was happening then they began struggling to avoid those pale deadly handsthey retreated before her throwing other attackers into confusion the girls men shouted when they saw this and fought with renewed hope a powerful gust of wind whooshed along the deck filling the drooping sails another deadly redmask came darting out of the east where the weathermans proas had been and swooped at the djelaan clawing at eyes and hands slashing flesh the poison on his talons killing quickly painfully twisting and turning with demonic agility he wove unharmed among the weapons of the pirates with a formidable ease that drew moans of fear from them retreating from the falcons retreating from brann who burned now with a shimmery fire the djelaan broke dropping their weapons scrambling down the grapnel lines leaping into the sea and swimming for their firestripped proas the men in the boats dragging the swimmers over the sides the djelaan fled that demonhaunted ship sammang dropped his war ax and leaped to the wheel turning the girl so she was cutting across the rising swells not lying helpless between them hairy jimm roared the men capable of moving into trimming the sails and getting the ship into order so she wouldnt be broken by the coming storm brann and the children staggered along the deck heaving djelaan dead and wounded overboard when that was finished brann stood a moment staring at her glowing hands the wind whipping her white hair about plastering her shirt against her burning body with a sigh she went searching for crew dead and wounded zaj was dead a small brown islander much like the men whod killed him she and the children carried him to the side wall of the cabin and lashed him there to wait for what rites sammang and the others would want for him she hurried back to kneel beside dereech who had a flap of scalp hanging down over his face deep cuts in his legs and shoulder he stared up at her with his one clear eye horror in his face as she reached for him tried to crawl away from her but was too weak when she flattened her hand on him he froze a moan dying in his throat from his place at the wheel sammang watched her and wondered what she intended wondered if he should drive her off dereech what shed done to the djelaan shed done to save her life and theirs but the glimpses hed caught of her work worried him he liked and trusted the child in her but didnt know what to do about the witch in the end he did nothing she bent lower smoothed her hand up along dereechs face pressing the flap into place her hands blurring in a moonglow mist the bleeding stopped the flap stayed put as if the mist had soldered it down she pressed the other wounds shut smoothed her hands over them the glow shuddering about her flesh and his the children stood behind her their hands welded to her body until she sat back on her heels finished with the healing tikrat had a spear through a lung she burnt the spear out of him bone point and broken haft close the wound and held her hands over it a wound that was almost always fatal smiling tikrat was the ships bard story teller and singer the pet of the crew now all saw her clean and close his wound saw the boys chest begin to rise and fall steadily and smoothly our witch shes our witch a whisper passing round our childwoman witch sammang murmured to himself the children with her she moved on to rudar then uasuf left them sleeping their wounds closed cleaned healed she went briskly over to hairy jimm who jumped when she touched him looked uneasy and dubious as she began moving her hands over his meaty body touching pressing the mist moving with her after a minute of this though he grinned and stood holding his arms out from his body as if for a tailor taking measurements when she finished he patted her on the head any time our witch she went on the children following close behind tunope leymas gaoez healing the smallest cuts the scrapes and bruises even a bloodblister on turropes little finger then she came toward sammang she looked very tired haunted by all the dying her face pale in spite of the eerie glow that shone out through her skin your turn sammo give over the wheel a minute you might find this a bit distracting hairy jimm boomed laughter shouldered sammang away from the wheel distractins not the word no not the word she touched the cut in sammangs side he felt a jolt then a tingle then coolness a new vigor coursing into him her strong nervous hands moved along his body and all the hurts and scrapes of the fight were wiped away and he understood the look on jimms face he was tumescent before she was half done ready to take on a harem and a half when she stepped away from him she smiled uncertainly at him met his eyes briefly blushed turned hastily away to the hatch a bit of hard work and some douches of icy sea water from the building waves cooled him down he glanced at the sun and was startled to see how little it had moved less than an hour since the fighting started he shook his head feeling a touch of wonder at how much had happened in that pinch of time two dead but because of the childwoman and the notchildren the wounded lived and were well neither maimed nor disfigured he lifted his head and laughed our witch he shouted laughed again at the cheers from the three now awake he began a rumbling song hairy jimm took it up all of them roared it into the wind as they settled the girl for the blow coming sometime after midnight sammang stumped wearily into his cabin a nightlamp was hanging from a hook by his hammock brann was curled in the bed halfcovered by a blanket her flesh faintly glowing in the darkness her eyes were closed and for some time he thought she was asleep he pulled off his shirt started to unlace his trousers thought about the sleeping witch and decided he could stand the damp if he kept himself warm eleven eleven eleven he told himself his mind believed it but his body didnt he started to swing up into the hammock couldnt resist another look at brann she was curled on her right side now watching him her face was pale and drawn huge eyes darkringed asking him he turned his back on her climbed into the hammock flipped the blanket over him and settled himself to sleep much later he woke knowing something had roused him from sleep not knowing what it was he listened to the ship nothing there slowly he became aware of a sound almost too soft to hear faint rhythmic creaking soft soft rustles brann lay curled up her back to him the children were somewhere else doing whatever shapechangers did at night she was sobbing and the shudders that convulsed her body were shaking the bed he scowled at her hesitated tipped out of the hammock and padded the few steps to the bed he touched her shoulder bramble she buried her face in the pillow the shaking went on she was gasping and struggling to stop crying unable to stop the shudders coursing through her body he caught her shoulder pulled her over examined her face she was crying with the ugly allout grief of a wounded child he straightened looked helplessly around cursed the children for leaving her in this state finally he gathered her up holding her tightly against him patting her smoothing his hand over her hair and down her back over and over murmuring he didnt know what to her her shudders and wrenching sobs died gradually away for a while she was just a child he was comforting insensibly that changed pats changed to caresses he forgot the child in the womans bodyuntil he suddenly realized what he was doing he pulled away from her youll be all right now he said when he could get the words out he started to get up but her hands closed about his arm pulled him down beside her dont go she whispered please brann he touched her face drew his hands down over her shoulder and onto her breast her eyes widened her tongue moved along her lips she sighed and her breast shifted under his hand tfie nipple hard as he was he pulled his hand away no she breathed got to he said he tore at the lacing on his trousers breaking the thongs in his urgency she was warm and wet and ready for him closing tightly about him passive at first then doing what her body taught her when it was finished and he lay beside her his breathing quieting she snuggled against him sighed a sound of deep contentment and went to sleep he woke with a numb arm and white curls tickling his chin sunlight pouring through the slats of the airvent lay a moment listening to the sounds of the ship the wind had slackened to a brisk quartering breeze that drove the girl steadily along without straining her branns breath was a spot of warm dampness on his shoulder she was deeply bonelessly asleep not even murmuring as he eased from under her and slid off the bed he picked up a fresh pair of trousers and laced them on pulled on a sleeveless shirt bleached by sun and salt water to a dirty gray he ran his fingers through his hair and swore to have staro take a knife to it before the day was out he looked at brann she lay on her stomach one arm outflung the other bent so her fist was pressed against her mouth a child damn her a moment before hed been looking forward to breakfast now his appetite was gone he left the cabin his bare feet soundless on the planks taking care to make no noise when he shut the door he didnt want to wake her if she slept most of the day away hed be quite happy he had a lot of thinking to do hairy jimm had the wheel he was squinting at the sky ahead humming a threenote song into his beard he grinned at sarnmang jerked a massive thumb at the sky takes a bit of getting used to it does but theyre handy little buggers y know sammo you ought to keep hold of them all say you can sammang looked up two large white birds circled lazily above the ship effortlessly keeping even with her they been up there most all the night friendly of them they say they give us a shout down here if somethin starts coming at us late in the afternoon brann came on deck standing in the bow sammang heard her shouted exchanges with the crew heard her silences she drifted about for some time circling gradually closer to him but he gave no sign he knew she was there when she put her hand on his arm he flinched and all but jerked his arm away youre really upset she seemed amazed yes he said angrily almost violently i told you i was getting older i was eleven in tavisteen but things have happened since pushing me older might be fifteen sixteen seventeen now she drew her forefinger along the hard muscle of his arm you helped sammo you taught me a lot before you ever touched me dont do that he pulled his arm away stared at the water ahead of the ship without seeing it why i dont know lot of reasons comfort i needed to touch someone just for me not to heal them or kill themshe gave a tiny shrug curiosity you werent virgin his own resentful confusion increased his fury a temueng censor raped me hes dead she ran her hand slowly down his arm he felt her enjoying the feel of him and ground his teeth together you would be too she said if id wished it a chill ran through him fear he forced himself to look at her there was sadness in her face as if she knew how her words had affected him had extinguished desire she said it deliberately he thought out of pity for me he took a step away almost hating her then child and woman both looked at him out of those wide green eyes and anger drained from him forgetting him she leaned precariously out to look down at the water slicing out from the bow the sea looks different she said how come how different color maybe the way it moves i dont know its just different watching her he again saw himself as a boy ships lad trying to answer the same question he leaned over the rail beside her and began teaching her as he was taught the next day was bright and clear but the wind grew erratic now and then quitting altogether leaving the girl wallowing her sails slatting the crew run off their feet and the weathermakers ghost tangled itself in the rigging gibbering at them which didnt improve either skill or morale tikrat who was ships exorciser as well as bard had dealt with the rest of the ghosts but the weatherman was stubborn and filled with spite determined to make the lives of his slayers as miserable as he could manage he was ragged and growing more so but grimly hanging on ignoring tikrats chants and sacred dances the eroding of the incense the boy waved at him the curses of sammang and the rest of the crew yaril and jaril watched the process with fascination until it began wearing on the nerves of their friends then they joined to drive the ghost from the shrouds and banged through him until he was scattered wisps of smoke that dissipated with the rising wind on the twelfth day after leaving tavisteen the panday girl dropped anchor in the crowded bay at the island port silili branns questsilili to andurya durat with taguiloa the dancing man holding lit candles in both hands taguiloa made the last run whirling over and over coming up with the candles still burning arms lifted high over his head feet stamping out an intricate patterdance over the cork matting spread on the flags of the summer court he finished the dance before the painted coffin made the required deep obeisance blew out the candles bowed to the fingersnapping crowd and stalked into the darkness with stifflegged dignity leaving yarm to pass through the ghostwitnesses and collect what coins they felt like giving should be a goodish haul most of the witnesses were rich old merchants more than halfdrunk delighted to have their minds taken off the death of one of their number even if the dead was only an old cousin of the master of this house they were reminded too vividly of their own decaying bodies and how short the count of their remaining years could be he didnt like performing at ghost watches either but the money was good the fee guaranteed with whatever he could wring from the watchers added on top of that he stopped by the food table dipped a drinking bowl into the hot mulled wine and stepped back into the shadows to watch the dancers who followed him move onto the matting their long sleeves fluttering their gauze draperies hiding little of the lithe bodies beneath tari called blackthorn and her dancers csermanoa wasnt stinting his uncle taga smiled wasnt for love all this csoa the sharp was underlining his position among the hina merchant class from the number of men sitting out there and the smiles painted onto their faces he was nailing down his status with the same force he used to drive bargains taris flute player was a marvel the sounds he got out of that pipe and matchedthe mood of the dance and the subtle rhythms of taris body taga sipped at the wine frowning thoughtfully at the way the music enhanced the appeal of the dancers though tradition decreed that flute music be reserved for female dancers for the past year hed been working with taris ladjinatuai developing a mixture of tumbling and dance that used the flowing line of the flute music but he hadnt tried it in public yet it was a daring move and required the right audience probably one with a strong leavening of temuengs much as he despised them they werent so rigidly set on maintaining things the way they were when he ventured to combine juggling and tumbling into a single presentation he had gerontai his master to support and defend him but he remembered all too well how difficult it had been to win acceptance before the tekora chanced to see him and approve taguiloa spent a good few days despising himself for being grateful for this recognition until his mentoralmostfather chided him out of it were despised anyway by those who pay us for our skills gerontai said dont let them tell you how to see yourself look at the lapdogs licking temueng ass and running after you now that the tekora says youre remarkable what does it matter that it takes a temueng to see what you are you know yourself soulson you know youre better than i ever was or could be your integrity lies in your art not in what hina say of you the new things he wanted to do though would need a lot more than the tekoras approval he was growing more and more impatient to get started but could only see one way to manage gather a troupe together and travel to andurya durat with a chance at performing before the emperorwhich would give him the right to display the imperial sigil when he was working that plan would cost an impossible sum in bribes and fees to say nothing of general expenses hed need a patron and a lot of luck to have half a chance of pulling it off he watched and listened a while longer brooding over all the barriers he could see no way of surmounting then set the bowl down and went into the sidecourt where csermanoa had put up a paper pavilion for the players a place to keep them away from his guests he found yarm in a corner with one of taris maids glanced at her to see if she was being coerced in any way nodded to her and strolled into the alcove that served as washroom and dressingroom after stripping the paint from his hands and face he climbed out of his tumbling silks and pulled on a long dark robe thrust his feet into the aged sandals he brought along when the performance would be long complex and tiring knotting a narrow black sash about his waist he walked back into the main room stood looking around chinkoury the mdarjin magician and his boys in a small knot by the door elongated blueblack figures even the boys a head taller than taguiloa to one side and a little behind them a clutch of felhiddin knife dancers bending stretching testing gear inspecting each other chattering in their rapid guttural tongue little brown men covered in intricate blue tattoos he didnt recognize them must be new to silili trust csermanoa to get hold of something no one else had seen curled up in the far corner snatching what sleep they could six young women more joyhouse girls than dancers a step above ordinary joygirls but far below the rank of courtesan though most of them had hopes the last to performin both their functionsthey were expected to return to their house with more than their appearance fee with longerterm attachments if they could manage it he nodded to chinkoury and passed out of the pavilion he stood in shadow watching the dancers silently applauding tad for the gift she was wasting on those drunken coinsuckers he watched the merchants for a moment with a contempt he usually had to hide some were drinking and eating a few frankly asleep others wandering about some watching the dancers some with their heads together a heavily conspiratorial air about them that suggested they either plotted new coups or told each other tales of coups past to magnify their shrewdness maybe one or two watched blackthorn dancing with a pinch of appreciation and understanding of what they were seeing the magic she was making there on the cork mats before the painted coffin taguiloa drew his sleeve across his face amused and angry i ought to know he thought by now i ought to know what to expect he put anger away and watched blackthorn end her dance bow first to the coffin her sleeves fluttering dangerously near the hordes of candles burning about the elaborate box then to the audience who woke enough to provide the expected applause she was after all blackthorn the most celebrated dancer in three generations as her maids came giggling into the audience rattling their collecting bowls dodging gropes shaking heads at gross remarks but careful to smile and say nothing blackthorn sailed majestically into the darkness her dancers drifting after her the flute player weaving a slow simple tune that trailed into silence a moment after the last of the girls vanished in the hush before chinkoury was due to appear taguiloa heard a faint commotion from the direction of the main gate and succumbed to the curiosity that was his chief vice he glanced quickly about but the noisy clash of cymbals the sprays of colored smoke and thelooming of the apprentices as they ushered their master onto the cork all this had trapped the attention of most of the guests and servants those still involved in conversations wouldnt notice if old csagalgasoa climbed out of his coffin and jigged on the lid he slipped away and eeled into a dark corner of the public court hidden behind a potted blackthorn that tad had given to csermanoa when he was one of her favored few before she inherited her house and income from another of her lovers old grum stopped talking and slammed the hatch shut swung the bar and opened the wicket to let in the folk hed been arguing with a man and a woman not hina two children very fair not hina you wait grum said you wait here he jerked a third time at the bell rope then stumped off to his hutch and vanished inside a broad man muscled like a hero panday by the look of him not much taller than taguiloa but wide enough to make two of him dark brown skin shining in the torchlight yellow eyes hawks eyes taguiloa grinned fitting with a beak like that wide rather thicklipped mouth good for grins or sneers raggedly cut black hair barbaric ear ornament the length of a mans finger a series of animal faces linked together a shipmaster from his dress the woman tall and full of nervous energy attractive face for one not hina rather wide in the mouth with elegant cheekbones and an arrogant nose eyebrows like swallows wings over large lustrous eyes green he thought though it was hard to be sure in the torchlight a band of silk wound about her head hiding her hair white blouse with long loose sleeves wide leather belt that laced in front long loose black trousers stuffed carelessly in the tops of black boots she wore no ornaments of any kind had no visible weapons but he smelled the danger that hovered round her like a powerful perfume dombro the steward came into the court hastened to the visitors sam mang shipmaster you are early this year and late this night for which i beg your masters pardon but it is important i speak with him so the sao csermanoa understood he asks if you would wait in the spring garden pavilion shipmaster he cannot leave his guests quite yet taguiloa scowled at the steward stiffrumped worm players had to put up with a lot of sniping from him he looked like he wanted to try his insolence on the shipmaster but didnt quite dare obviously the panday was important to csermanoa he watched the shipmaster nod and follow the steward waited a while then slipped after him hed met many foreigners in this house csermanoas interests ranged widely while it wasnt according to temueng law for a hina to own shipping he was a very silent partner to more than one shipmaster and tagas snooping had brought him the startling discovery that this highly respectable merchant was also a fence of considerable proportions there was not a whisper of that in the market places around silili and taguiloa would have been mocked as moondreaming if hed told anyone but he was a miser with the secrets he nosed out calling them up and fondling them when sleep eluded him he ghosted through the dark paths his senses alert if this was something to do with the subterranean aspects of csermanoas business the merchant would be quick and drastic in the methods he used to keep his secrets to himself i should forget this and get back to the watch he told himself he kept following them the steward unlocked and opened a gate in a wall and left it open after ushering the panday and his companions through taguiloa crept up to the gate after a few ragged breaths still halfconvinced he should get out of there a few scrapes of feet against gravel no talking dombro wouldnt waste his breath on foreigners taga watched a moment more then floated through his feet as soundless as he could make them he whipped into shrubbery on the far side of the gate wishing he wore clothing more suitable for nightprowling a moment later the steward came back a sour sneer on his face he passed through the gate slammed it shut and locked it trusting soul seshtrango send him boils on his butt the pavilion was a freestanding sixsided structure large enough to contain more than one room he circled round it till he found one window whose oiled paper was an arch of yellow light he slid into the shaggy yews planted close to the wall dropped into a crouch as a voice sounded above him startling him with its nearness and clarity at first he didnt catch what was being said then realized the woman was speaking panay growing up wild in this polyglot port city had given him the rudiments of many tongues and hed polished them as he grew older because he admired his masters command of many languages and because it was a necessity for satisfying his thirst for secrets youre fussing about nothing sammo her voice was husky but musical deep enough to pass for a mans i did all right in tavisteen hunh an angry rasping sound rather like a lions cough youre a baby brambleallthorns tavisteeners may think theyre the slippriest things under the langareri bowl but silili hina make them look like children who arent very bright hina say theyre the oldest folk and maybe its so trying to get through their customs is like threading a maze without a pattern and since the temuengs took over here nothing they say or do means exactly what it seems to its called survival bramble hina are very good at surviving so am i friend another impatient sound from the panday footsteps going away from the window coming back going away again pacing taguiloa thought a baby that woman wicker creaking the whisper of silk the woman sitting down after a while the man joined her csermanoa financed a good part of the girl he said im clear of debt to him the girls all mine its the other way now he owes me hell take care of you i can take care of myself baby baby you havent the least idea what the real worlds like a chuckle warm and affectionate hahl maybe i didnt last month but ive learned a few things since youve learned to tease thats for sure who says im teasing let it go brann you know how i feel smooth your feathers and take any help thats going think of your father and your brothers if youre killed before you get to them what good is all youve done so far you throw my own arguments at me how can i fight that silence for a while ill take a lot of killing lapalaulau swamp me i wish you were a few years older there was an odd strained note in the mans voice taguiloa scowled there was too much he didnt know he couldnt catch the nuances the feelings between the words crouched outside in the darkness he could hear the strong currents of affection passing between them such shared understanding they didnt have to say any of those things he wanted to know he flushed with envy not even tani blackthorn was that close gerontai had loved him but he was an old man when he took an angry street boy into his home and he was a man of solitude and distances tagas parents his brothers and sisters he lost them in a shipwreck when he was five he clung to a bit of debris and was pulled out of the sea by a fisherman brought back to live with an overworked cousin who had eight children of her own and neither missed nor mourned him when he ran away what are you going to do the womans voice unload my official cargo for what i can get see if i can get hold of more slya ware maybe pick up other cargo go home awhile careen my ship i didnt use half your gold in tavisteen you sure you dont want it back very sure what i need the children will provide yeah sound of wicker shifting scrape of boots on the tile floor what about your father will he work for the emperor how can he without tincreals fire hes spent a lifetime putting her heart into his work what he does is more than just shaping the bowls and things old lardarse she giggled like that name a temueng pimush should know the worth of his emperor where was i ah i suppose he can have my folk beaten into making something but it wont be slya ware what a fool he is if hed left us alone hed have had the pick of what we made now that the mountain has taken her own back hell have nothing arth slya gone taga thought he closed his eyes and cursed the temuengs cursed the woman cursed himself for somehow believing thered always be a place free from the compromises hed made all his life a place where artist and artisan explored their various crafts without having to pander to blind and stupid men whose only virtue was the gold in their pockets if he understood what she was saying arth slya was either dead or maimed beyond recovery the panday cleared his throat come home with me bramble wait till i get my ship clean of weed and rot well take you up the palachunt to durat sooner and safer than the land route wait for you take you and your folk away once you break them free silence again more creaks from the wicker as she shifted about more wool moving against silk im sorry you wouldnt love me again sammo i wanted you to you

older fast give me a couple more years bramble then maybe ill believe it slya youre stubborn were a pair youre right im going to stick to my first plan sammo i know how you feel about the girl and i can read a map a dozen places on that river where the temuengs could drop rocks or fire on you and would if they thought they had a reason youd all be killed and if you werent youd lose the girl i wont have that sammo i wont the shadows around taguiloa suddenly vanished and hot golden light flickered about him he bit back a yell and jumped to his feet meaning to get out of there as fast as he could hoping he wasnt already identified his feet wouldnt move he tried to turn his head it wouldnt move not his head not a hand not a finger he stood frozen and afraid as abruptly as it came the light was gone taking with it the greater part of his fear whatever else had happened he wasnt discovered inside the pavilion the man and woman were still talking there were no shouts of discovery outside it something very strange had happened if he fled without careful thought likely hed run into trouble rather than away from it he glanced around saw only darkness and yews dropped to the ground and began listening again to what was happening inside i dont want to let you go the panday was walking about his words loud then muffled i dont want to go creak of wicker as she moved restlessly on the divan if it werent my father my brothers my kin if it werent for slya filling me driving me if ill stupid word i cant change what is sammo you dont even know if theyre alive now you dont know what will happen to them before you can get to durat no a long silence filled with the small sounds of movement if they arent alive the woman said suddenly fury frustration fear sharp in her voice if they arent alive i will drink the life from abanaskranjinga and spit it to the winds preemalaus bouncy tits brann dont say that dont even think it i wont say it again but i will do it thats another reason i dont want you and the others anywhere about i believe you dont say more what if someone is listening sound of door opening feet crossing the tiles voice louder window shutters slamming open taguiloa shrank farther into shadow but the panday saw nothing but the darkness of the yews and the moonlit grass beyond he dragged the shutters to and went to stand behind the woman so close to the window taga could hear him breathing wheres the boy keeping watch ah feet on tiles wicker protesting loudly as a heavy weight dropped onto the silk cushions the panday sitting beside the woman i could leave jimm to take care of the girl and go north with you dont be silly sammo id have to spend more time worrying about you than getting on with the business the children will take care of me theres no way the temuengs can harm them strike at them and they fade and are something else somewhere else not you while they live i live he grunted then laughed dont think i want to go deeper into that laughter from the woman a long comfortable silence taguiloa felt the amity and warmth moving between them filling the silence was angry and sad at once that such a communion was beyond him even as he felt this the woman repelled him and the things they said frightened him he thought of leaving decided hed wait for csermanoa and see what happened then as if it took a cue from him a childs voice broke the silence aril says csermanoas coming taga listened heard nothing for a few breaths then the crunch of feet on the gravel path then csoas voice ordering the guards to take up their posts taga smiled to himself csoa the sharp making sure they werent close enough to hear what was said in the pavilion yet where they could come running if he needed them fast heavy footsteps as he came on alone protesting planks as he climbed the stairs to the pavilions door faint squeal of hinges well sammang precariously saiim he spoke hina with very little accent ah creak of wicker as the rotund little merchant settled himself across the room from the man and woman didnt expect you till the end of summer the panday chuckled the gods dispose sadm a short silence this isnt business im calling in a couple favors business well discuss tomorrow another short silence sorry about your uncle an old man full of years wariness in the merchants voice taguiloa grinned into the darkness seeing the film sliding over csoas eyes the stiff smile stretched his lips for him favors meant coin and he never parted with coin until he got as much as he could for it my friend needs a place to stay hid and needs tutoring in hina and temueng ways she speak hina the woman broke in with a rapid question to the shipmaster wanting to know what was being said she listened and told him shed be speaking hina the next day the children would give it to her she will the panday said finality in his voice loud creaks from across the room the wicker complaining as csoas shifting weight stressed it taguiloa imagined the fat man leaning forward to stare at the woman his narrow black eyes sliding over her as if she were a sack of rice he thought of buying stay hid thats the other favor dont ask ah the wicker creaked again csermanoa settling back dombro wont gossip he knows better grum wouldnt talk to his mother if he had one who else saw her my crew but they wont talk not about her we came the back ways no one credible saw her you had that hair covered good old womans hair with a young womans face catches the eye can she read and write her own gabble i mean yes good shes got the idea shouldnt be too hard to give her a fair sense of hina script if shes willing to work at it silence taguiloa imagined the merchant running shuttered eyes over the woman again is she prepared to earn her keep an angry exclamation from the shipmaster not while shes here csermanoa added hastily i ask so ill knovi what to teach her switching into rapid panay almost too rapid for taguiloa to follow the man reported to the woman what he and csermanoa had been saying samna im not going to he earning my way you know that hes fishing its nonsense ill survive she added grimly leave how i do it to me taga smiled as i thought he told himself a tough one csoa can go milk a rock and get more than shell give him you dont want the imperial guard waiting for you sammang speaking angrily careless taguiloa thought im sure csoa knows some panay and the word imperial is a bad slip has to tell him more than they want him to know who knows to wait you think the temuengs in where you come from dont send messages every day to durat so theyre not stupid by now they know youve escaped them and theyll have an idea where youre going they will be waiting for you youve got to be sly and cunning youve got to know the ground all right all right i hear you i admit youre right get on with the bargaining im sleepy be careful taguiloa thought csoa may owe you favors but youre not hina remember that and beware how he treats the woman depends on how much he still needs you dont let him know the temuengs will hunt her down and stomp everyone connected with her he made a note to himself to stay as far away from her as he could manage switching to high hina the shipmaster said sao csermanoa will you provide shelter and tutoring for the freewoman and her child companions taguiloa wished he could see the merchants face that was a most formal request phrased in the elegant high hina more suitable for use with one from the few old families left after the temueng clearances in the bloody aftermath of their invasion he nodded with appreciation a touch a real touch shrewd though he was csermanoa would bite in the same high tongue with the same formality csermano answered the shipmaster i say to you o sammang schimli shelter will be provided and tutoring for the freewoman and her child companions slipping into less formal language he went on you said companions i only see one child silent little thing her twin watches outside a bit young but very competent competent taguiloa thought havent found me he jumped and almost betrayed himself as a small hand touched his arm a soft laugh sounded in his ear he looked down saw the boys face as a pale oval in the shadow then it dissolved into the golden light that had touched him not so long ago then the light was gone there was a faint rustle to his left as if something small was pattering away no wonder the woman wasnt worried witch with demon familiars he shivered and renewed his vow to keep away from her shivered again when he realized the boy would tell her about him as soon as csermanoa left he fidgeted he wanted to get out of there now he knew enough to play with but he couldnt chance the guards theyd be just bored enough to catch the slightest sound and mean enough to enjoy stomping him favor for favor the merchant said name it and ill think about it tomorrow shipmaster wicker creaked you said business tomorrow sen would you promise blind sounds of the panday shifting his feet softer noises of the woman standing beside him thanks for listening ill make other arrangements sit sit csermanoa spoke hastily a querulous note in his voice theres no question of swearing blind certainly not well talk about that tomorrow grunts more creaking a few thuds csermanoa standing the woman may stay of course she may servants will be provided food the tutoring you ask all i ask is discretion heavy steps on the tiles crossing to the door come to the ghostwatch shipmaster before you leave sound of door opening closing heavy feet stumping down the steps csoa calling to his guards walking off with them taguiloa stayed where he was until he heard the gate clunk shut he straightened turned to follow csoa out then he heard the panday and the witch start talking hesitated squatted once more cursing his stupidity but unable to break away our witch caressing sound in the mans voice youre set he wont bother you maybe ask questions mmmh certainly questions youre all right as long as youre suspicious bramble but soon as you relax you talk too much you talked too much to me what harm would you do me bed you child i keep telling you she sighed impatiently it wasnt a childs body you loved i dont know what i am any more only that im not arth slyas brann waiting for her eleventh birthday so she could make her choice sammo i was going to be a potter like my father he made a teapot and drinking bowls for an old mans birthday uncle eornis my birthday was his too he was going to make a hundred this year the oldest among us her voice broke after a moment she cleared her throat and went on that he was killed two weeks before his hundred funny that seems worse she seemed to be speaking to herself taguiloa was caught up in them his imagination responding to the emotion in the soft voice emotion that was all the more powerful because of the quiet restraint that kept the words so slow and easy i saw a ternueng take my baby sister by the heels and dash her brains out against the oak i saw them fire my home and walk away with my mother my uncles aunts and cousins i didnt cry sammo all that time i didnt cry and now i weep for an old man at the end of his life look at me isnt it funny brann dont worry about me sammo im not falling apart like aunt frin always said complaining is good for the soul a purgation of sorts silence the man began walking about stopping and walking stopping and walking no regular rhythm to his pacing pulled two ways taguiloa thought wants to stay wants to go three months the panday said his voice stone hard with determination enough time for you to learn how to go on and work out a way into audurya durat then make your way there in three months ill be tied up at the wharves of durat waiting for you no you cant stop me the girl what if something happens to her thought about that plenty of inlets near the mouth of the palachunt jimm can wait there with the girl your gold will buy a ship i dont have to care about all it needs is a bottom sound enough to get us back down the river and the children flying guard he chuckled now argue with that brambleallthorns dear friend what about the crew whore you going to take with you into that rattrap tikrat staro the stub better to ask who i can persuade to stay behind and if im going to have to part jimms hair with his war club to make him wait with the girl he cleared his throat youre part of the crew now bramble youre our witch soft gasping snuffling sounds the witch weeping taguiloa scowled into the darkness his pulses shouting danger at him danger to stay so close to a woman who could spin such webs he started to creep out of the shadows froze as he heard the door slam feet running down the steps then the shipmaster slowed to a deliberate walk the gate creaked open bumped shut taguiloa stood still in halfshadow and worked the cramps out of his body behind him he heard the soft murmur of voicesthe children and the woman he closed his ears to them started cautiously for the gate staying in the shadow of the plantings moving with the silent hunting glide that had served him so well other times a faint giggle by his side he looked down the blond boy trotting beside him taga ignored him and went ghosting on until he reached the wall the boy caught hold of his arm wait he breathed a slight tug then a large horned owl was powering up from him it sailed over the wall circled twice and came slanting back feathers soft as milkweed fluff brushed at his arm then the boy was standing beside him no one out there not even a servant why its late only a couple hours till dawn you know what i mean the boy grinned at him danced back a few steps turned and ran into the darkness taguiloa stared after him then turned to the gate with a silent prayer to tungjii he lifted the latch and walked through the kula priest came from the house and paced round and round the pyre with its festoons of silk flowers and painted paper chains and the paper wealth soaked in sweet oils to make a perfumed and painted fire he waved his incense sticks and the sickly sweet perfume drifted on the breeze to taguiloa if funerals had not provided a steady income and a place to show his work hed have missed them all the smell of the roasting meat the sight of the earthsoul and skysoul oozing out of the coffin surrounded by that smell which the incense never quite covered twisted his stomach and made the inside of his bones itch the fire was crackling briskly as the kula finished the final tensing round he stepped back and chanted binding the sparks into a web of light so there was no danger of the house or the watchers catching fire taguiloa sensed a presence and looked down the blond boy was standing beside him watching the show with amused interest there was a companionable feel to the situation that made him want to relax and grin at the boy ruffle his hair the way he hated to have done to him when he was a boy hed stopped being afraid of this maybedemon this changechild he smiled at the boy and went back to watching the fire burn the shimmer that was the skysoul wriggled free and darted skyward like a meteor shooting up instead of down the earth soul a bent little man looking much as old uncle had looked in life hovered near the pyre as if it didnt have the strength to leave the meat that had housed it after a while though it seemed to shrug its meager shoulders and begin a heavy drift upwards riding the streamers of smoke the death was clean the old man had nothing to complain of there was no violence against the meat to hold the earthsoul down a clear testament to the way csermanoa performed his family duties as the fire began to die down the party grew livelier the servants came bustling about replacing the plundered food trays setting out new basins of steaming spiced wine drawing the lamps down and replacing the candles in them the joygirls were circling through the guests teasing and laughing cajoling sweets from the men whispering in their ears it was clearly time for the players to leave he looked down the child was gone he watched a moment more then edged around the walls of the summer court and went into the paper pavilion yarm had the gear packed and was curled up dozing beside it he shook the boy awake caught up his own pack and left csermanoas compound by the servants entrance the sleepy doorkeeper coming awake enough to hold out his hand for a tip feeling generous ignoring yarms scowl taguiloa dropped a dozen coppers in the palm the broad beaming grin he got in return seemed worth the price as they wound through the irregular narrow streets yarm kept looking back something taguiloa didnt notice until they were about halfway to the players quarter and the house and garden hed inherited from gerontai he endured yarms fidgeting for a while then looked back himself halfsuspecting what hed see the small blond boy was strolling casually along behind them making no effort to conceal himself he stopped when he saw them watching him waved a hand and sauntered into an alley between two tenements taguiloa tapped yarm on the shoulder forget it he said thats nothing to trouble us whos he whats he want petulance and jealousy in the boys voice taguiloa frowned at him started walking again without answering him yarm had a limber body a quick mind when he wanted to use it a good ear for rhythm he also had a difficult nature he made no attempt to change he was intensely almost irrationally possessive taguiloas continued aloofness still intimidated him a little but the effect of it was wearing off he had to go there were complications to getting rid of him notably his cousin the thugmaster fist but he had to go an owl dipped low overhead hooted softly and went slanting up riding the onshore wind freshening about them in the thickening dark just before dawn taguiloa shivered then laughed at himself the boy was teasing him that was all and following him home he glanced up at the owl walked on nothing he could do about it besides a hundred people knew where he lived that was not one of his secrets the days slid one into the next until a week was gone the boy appeared now and again when taguiloa was performing watching him with such genial interest that he found himself relaxing and accepting his presence with equanimity and curiosity he didnt try to talk to the boy only nodded to him and smiled now and then yarm began making jealous scenes about the boy barely confining them to the walls of the house making life there such a misery that taguiloa began staying away as much as he could even neglecting practice something hed never done before he was coldly furious at yarm but he needed him for performances already booked a wedding two funerals a guild dinner and the firstpressing festival and there was always fist who started dropping in on taguiloa now and then mentioning casually how delighted the family was that yarm had found such a considerate master it was enough to make a man stomp into the temple and kick old tungjii on hisser fat butt taguiloa threw the sticks and they landed eskimemeloa the wave of change a sign of the third triad a good high point he smiled with satisfaction maybe a sign that his luck was changing djeracim the pharmacist grunted gathered the sticks and threw them snarled with disgust and emptied his winebowl nekokaran only one step from nothing the maelstrom grunting with the effort lagermukaea the fat scooped up the sticks held them a moment lost in his huge hand that kid of yours tap hes whispering nasty things about you in pupas ear muckworm dont waste any time running to the temueng nose to dump his dirt you ought to pop the kid in a sack and drop him in the bay he opened his hand looked surprised to see the thin brown stalks on his broad palm clicking tongue against teeth he cast them hummed a snatch of a dirge as they split into two signs rebhsembulan the honeybee and minatuatuan the reviving rain he grunted even added they didnt count enough to beat the eskimemeloa he grinned a moment later began flipping the coppers one by one to taguiloa who caught them and tossed them up again keeping more and more in the air until he finally missed one and dropped the bunch laughing he opened his pouch and dropped the coins inside along with djis leaving out enough to buy another jug of wine that i would he said tie him in a sack if someone would sack fist and feed him to a shark he pushed the coins into a squat triangle let me know if someone none of us likes is looking for an apprentice maybe i can push yarm off on him or her he curled his tongue and whistled up another jug tacuiloa sat on the pier in a heavy fog listening to the sound of the buoys clanging to the distant shouts from the woda living boats to the thousand other noises of the early morning hed always liked foggy days enjoyed the times when he was immersed in the sounds of life yet wholly alone in the small white room the fog built around him the blond boy came into that room and sat beside him his short legs dangling over the piers edge water condensed on his skin and in his hair ran down his nose and wet the collar of his jacket why are you following me about taguiloa spoke lazily not overly interested in the answer curiosity about why i was outside the pavilion listening that oh no i already know what you were doing there and why i wanted to know more about you why my companion needs to reach andurya durat i thought you might be the right one to take her me nol after a moments silence he said shes a witch worse shes a foreigner worse than that shes going hunting for temuengs so you like temuengs hahl i like living what about gold not enough to die for it you want to go to durat and play for the emperor brann could provide the gold my master reached his eighties by being a prudent man he took a chance on a boy who tried to rob him took him in taught him made him his heir was he wrong stay out of my head there was no force to his voice he was too accustomed to the boy now he couldnt work up any fear of the changechild no matter how strange he acted look jaril im not saying i dont understand her feelings if my folks were slaves understand me its the rest of my life youre talking about brann knows that all she wants is a quiet way into the city so she can get there without the guard waiting for her if she didnt care who knew she was coming she could hire a barge and a team of dapples and float in comfort up the canal a foreigner she could buy a temueng to take her enough gold buys anything csermanoas gold certainly not were not going to make trouble for our sammang and his men think rather of the tekoras vaults who can stop yaril and me from getting in where we want why me jaril snickered slanted a crystal glance at him you presented yourself darkened by the fog his eyes glistened with good humor and who would look for vengeance riding in a players wagon your companion offers to pay the bribes and the outfitting and expenses along the way what you make thats yours to share out with the others in the troupe she is generous how easy to be generous with temueng gold given the temuengs dont know who would think of serpents with pockets in their hide taga chuckled not me friend you wont take yarm one more funeral and im done with him hes got a cousin with a nasty temper he has a lot of cousins most of them with nasty tempers only one of them about to lesson you with padded clubs that wont break the skin only bones tungjiis gut i suppose you were a fly on the wall be one monstrous fly but youve got the idea why tell me we like you offer whether or not you accept my companions gold yaril and i well keep an eye on fist and warn you when hes set to act accept seshtrango send him hives and flatulence and inflict yarm on him the rest of his life jaril giggled then dug in the pocket of his jacket and dropped a handful of gold beside taguiloa brann wants to move out of csermanoas house hes hanging around a bit too much asking questions she doesnt want to answer and the maids spy on her makes her nervous could you find her a place to stay he stacked the coins into a neat pile that should be enough someplace she can stay quiet and safe theres no place safe from gossip even if she seems hina at least outside the house she can do that we can do that mmm i can think of a couple places might do give me two days meet me at my house i hear the boy got to his feet with the sinuous supple grace of a cat vanished into the fog with a wave of a hand taguiloa sat staring at the black water rocking under his feet wondering what hed got himself into he followed the music and laughter through the pleasure garden to the beach house built out over the waterwaterdark stones and windsculpted cedars clipped and trained seagrape vines salt flowers in reds and oranges and a scattered shouting pink a willow or two to add a note of elegance a bright cool morning with the sun just hot enough to fall pleasantly on the skin flute song winding through the wash of the sea the spicy whisper of the cedars the rustle of the willows ladji he thought then lifted his head and stopped as another instrument began to play a jubilant very clear rather metallic flurry of notes dancing around the thread of the flute song he walked into the house tari blackthorn was reclining on a low divan amid piles of pillows watching two girls dancing a small ancient man with a few wisps of hair on mottled skin stretched tight over his skull knelt at the edge of the straw matting and danced fingers like spider legs over the holes of his flute beside him a small darkhaired woman sat on a broad orange cushion an instrument like a distorted and enlarged gittern on her lap her hair was dressed in innumerable small braids some of them stiffened into graceful loops about her head elaborate gold earrings wide hoops with filigreed discs hanging from them large blue eyes the blue so dark it was almost black small pointed face dark olive skin a nose that had a tendency to hook a wide mobile mouth smiling now as she watched the girls dance short stubby fingers moved with swift sureness over the strings the ivory plectrum gleaming against her dark skin tari looked up as he came in smiled and nodded at a pile of cushions near her feet he dropped on them leaned against the divan and watched the girls they were very young ten or eleven sold by their parents into the night world when they were old enough so their adult features could be guessed at hed escaped being impressed into the world of the joyhouses by craftiness learned in a hard school by the nimble body coordination and speed tungjii had gifted him with and by a lot of luck he watched the dancers with a cool judicial eye his tastes running to older women the plumper one wasnt going to make a dancer she was a juicy creature with a bold eye she had the proper moves but there was no life to her dancing none of the edge and fire tail blackthorn got into her dances the other girl was thin and underdeveloped coltish and a bit clumsy but there was a hint that she might have some of the gift that made blackthorn the premier dancer of silili before she was nineteen and kept her there for the next fifteen years taga twisted his head around and saw her watching him a slow smile touched the corners of her mouth she seldom let her face move in any way that would encourage wrinkles part of the discipline she enforced over nearly every aspect of her life he was a part of that tiny area where she let herself feel and possibly be hurt that little area of danger that gave her the magic she put into her dancing her smile was at most a slight lifting of her face a gleam in her eyes but hed warmed to it since hed celebrated his seventeenth birthday in her bed eight years ago she was at her zenith now while he was still rising shed stay where she was for a few years and manage a graceful glide into her retirement unless she made enemies here too she walked the ragged and crumbly edge between acceptance and obloquy walked it with calculation and care knowing a misstep could destroy her like every player she had only her wits her skill and the tenuous protection of custom and reputation to restrain the merchants and the officials who ran silili always subject to the whims of the temuengs and ordered the lives of all who lived there tali touched the ceramic chimes the double clink was not loud but it cut through the music the dancers stopped and bowed then stood waiting for her to speak the plump one a little nervous but enough in command of herself to slide her eyes at taguiloa the thin one seeing no one and nothing but blackthorn tari lifted a hand you saw what do you say the hungry one tail nodded when you have that hunger its easy to see it in others if i were five years younger i might want to kick her feet from under her she turned to the two girls deniza she told the thin one see my bataj about buying you out rasbai your gifts lie elsewhere i am not the proper teacher for you may i suggest mmm atalai she dismissed them firmly ignoring both rasbais scowl and denizas sudden glow your student has shut his mouth whatd you do to that little snake he watched the two girls walk out with their silent chaperone and said nothing until they had time to get beyond hearing then turned to stare cooly at the foreign woman me he said i did nothing her eyes opened a bit wider the toes of her right foot nudged at the nape of his neck tickled through the hair by his right ear this is blackthorn little love maybe you forget she dug at him with the nail of her big toe harm would i ask in front of her if i didnt trust her fishbrain he swung round caught hold of her ankle danced his fingers along the hennad sole of her foot even a fishbrain knows blackthorn he let her pull her ankle free its the truth i did him nothing hes happy contemplating my future broken bones what fist and a handful of his thugs are getting set to thump me some youre very cheerful considering considering ive got some protection fist and yarm dont know about im shucking yarm the end of the week going on tour soon as i can get it together ive got a patron of sorts whos financing me and providing that protection i mentioned youre finally going to do it the dances uhhuh i need a flute player he scowled at the mat funeral tomorrow the last appearance ive got for a while yarms out the next day im not looking forward to that i told you he was a bad idea that you did but i had no ears then and nothing between them either he caught hold of a toe pinched it lightly flute player a sharp intake of breath a moments silence tari lay back with her eyes shut he frowned at her but before he could say anything she spoke ladji the ancient flute player got easily to his feet came across the open airy room and dropped to his knees near the head of the divan sew he said tranquilly he held his flute lightly across his thighs you have a student your sisters grandson i think it is you know him you know taga what do you think she opened her eyes its a gamble and the hillwolves are getting bold she glanced at taguiloa lifted the corner of her mouth a fraction rumor is once the jamara lords and the jamaraks are left behind its a dance with death delicate lift of a delicate brow slow and smooth a question to taguiloa youre not given to taking those kinds of chances little love its the hillwolves that better watch themselves he hesitated wondering exactly what he wanted to say how much he wanted to tell this was blackthorn who read him better than he did himself my patron is a friendly witch with demon familiars he turned so he was facing the foreign woman that is not for repeating she nodded but said nothing the old man spoke taga when would you like to talk with linjijan and where blackthorns toe nudged at taguiloas head again will here do since you offer he rubbed his head gently against her foot this afternoon ive got to start shaking the mix ladji the old man looked past her at the wall linjijan went out with his brothers this morning after fish hell be returning with the sun but hell need sleep he turned muddy amber eyes on blackthorn and smiled the wrinkles lifting and spreading and you saor prefer the afternoon true my eldest love she made the deep gurgle that was her sort of laugh raga dance for me you ive earned some entertaining dont you think he turned his head and kissed the smooth instep then jumped to his feet he kicked off his sandals and walked barefoot onto the woven straw mat rubbed his hands down his sides lifted a brow to ladjinatuai then began snapping his fingers hunting for the rhythm that felt right for the mood he was in and the way his body felt he looked over his shoulder at the foreign woman play for me he said with ladji if you will ladjinatuai lifted his flute and began improvising music to the changing rhythms of tagas fingers a few beats later a soft laugh and the lively metallic complex tones of stringed instrument came in picking up the beat playing fantasies around it making a sound hed never heard before he let the music work in him a while longer when he was ready he began the first tumbling run moving faster and faster gathering the energy of the music into his blood and bone ending the run with a double flip landing reversing direction without losing the impulse driving him dropping curling onto his shoulders slowly unfolding his body until he was a spear pointed at the roof breaking suddenly the music breaking with him a long swoop of the flute a glittering cascade from the strings his body flexed rose and fell wheeled and caracoled improvised around the traditions of the female dancers the male mimes and tumblers he felt every move all the pain and effort yet at the same time he was flying riding the sound until a tiny shake a hairline miscalculation and he lost it the music went on but his improvisation faltered with a gasping laugh he sank onto his knees then sat back on his heels hands on thighs breathing hard sweat pouring down his face into his eyes and mouth he heard blackthorns gurgling laughter the patter of her hands but only at a distance more important to him this moment was the music that wove on and on the foreign woman and the old flute player working out their own magic until they achieved resolution and silence he swung on his knees to face the woman who are you my name is harra hazhani from the west a long way from dancer why chance curiosity who knows i came with my father your father dead she plucked a discord from the strings an aneurism neither of us knew he had your people you wouldnt know them she shrugged what does it matter then producing a soft buzzing sound from the instrument by pulling her hand gently along the strings she stared past him im a long way from my mountains dancer the wind blew me here and dropped me the day will come when i catch another and blow on rukkanag my people you see it means nothing to you and why should it she had a strong accent that was not unpleasant especially in her honeyspice voice as she spoke she made almost a song of the words using the pads of her fingers to coax a muted music from the strings abruptly she lifted her hands from the instrument and laughed more prosaically sad taguiloa when my father dropped dead saiiri blackthorn took pity on me and gave me houseroom until i could find the kind of work i was willing to do she took up the plectrum and plucked a questioning tune and have i o man who makes music with his body have i do you dance the dances of my people and never so well as blackthorn does hers show me he moved off the mat to make way for her seating himself once again at tafis feet hana hazhani looked at him gravely considering him then she set her instrument aside and got gracefully to her feet she wore black leather boots with high heels a long skirt with a lot of material in it that swung about her ankles a bright blue with crudely colorful embroidery in a band a handspan above the hem a longsleeved loose white blouse and a short tight vest laced up the front that seemed designed to emphasize high full breasts and a tiny waist the blouse was gathered at wrists and neck by drawstrings tied in neat bows she reached into a pocket in the skirt and pulled out a number of thin gold hoops slid them over her hands so they clashed on her wrists when she lifted her arms over her head and began clapping out a strongly accented rhythm still clapping she began to whistle a sound with a driving energy as crude to his ears as the colors and patterns in the embroidery on her clothing was to his eyes she whistled just long enough for ladjinatuai to pick up the tune though the mode of her music was not that of his flute her head went back her arms curved so her hands were almost touching then quivered so the gold hoops clashed slightly of the beat then she was whirling round and round her feet moving through an intricate series of steps she danced pride and passion and joyat least that was what he read into what he sawthen went suddenly still a foot pointed a leg a little forward a straight slant visible through the drape of her skirt her head thrown lwk her arms up as if she would embrace the moon she broke position grinned at him and went back to her cushion dropped with energetic grace beside her instrument what do you call that he pointed to the instrument daroud a sort of distant cousin to a lute you dance well enough thanks you play a lot better i know modest too like you what would you do if a man started fondling you depends official patron or some lout in an inn where we happened to be staying start with the lout she tilted her head scowled put her hands on her hips back off lout one hand shifted position so quickly it seemed to flicker a short thin blade grew suddenly from her fingers she held the hand close to her body and waited and if he didnt hed lose maybe some fingers certainly some blood she tossed the bright sliver of steel into the air caught it and flipped it at the wall it thudded home a hair from a small waterstain on the wood she frowned got up and retrieved the knife kesker would pull my hair for botching a throw like that kesker my fathers bodyguard until he got killed protecting your father no bloodfeud we passed too close to his homeland youve had a varied life very that takes care of the lout if you run into trouble for it ill back you but try saying no first will you sure why not say a jamar lord has an itch for foreign bodies in his bed she grinned and i say its all right with me honored sabin but ive got the pox so maybe youd rather not you dont look it thats us foreign bints cant tell about us and if he says he doesnt believe you then i do this she began to whistle an odd little droning tune he watched her a moment until she blurred and a total lassitude took hold of him she stopped whistling and clapped her hands the sharp sound jolting him awake men are very suggestible in that state she said calmly id tell him he wasnt at all interested in me and he should forget the whole thing including the whistling my father was a mage i was his best and most constant student he looked at her and began laughing so hard he fell over on the floor when he recovered a little he sat up wiped at his eyes caught taris astonished stare and almost began again he sucked in a long breath exploded it out if you want to come along youre welcome harra hazhani he cleared his throat though you might want to wait until you meet my patron before you make up your mind he narrowed his eyes examined her face her hands wondering how old she was twentythree you answer questions not asked why waste time you wanted to know keep out of my head woman no need to get in it your face told me men are much alike you know at least on things like that uhhuh you and the witch should have some interesting conversations you make me curious who is she a foreigner like you should i know her i doubt it tari blackthorn stirred on the divan nudged at him with her foot go home taga now that you steal my treasure from me go home summerfly and soothe the wasp in your nest she made a soft snorting sound dont come back o ungrateful one without a thankgift to make up for taking all my afternoon the second hour after midday and not a breath before she gurgled or ill have my dancers fickle you into a mass of quivering jelly he trapped the prodding foot woke laughter in her with knowing fingers kissed the instep then jumped to his feet and started for the door before he reached it she called out bring your witch with you and let us see this wonder of wonders he waved a noncommittal hand and plunged out the door before she could call him back strode off along the winding path whistling an approximation of harras dance tune content with things as they were except for yarm and yarm would cease to be a problem very soon old tungjii was sitting on his shoulder he could almost feel hisser presence there so i light a batch of incense for you o patron of my line o bestower of joy and sorrow the doorguard let him out the gate and he strolled along the sundappled lane beneath the willows and the tall rare mottled bamboo a few wisps of fog were flowing in off the sea and the air had a nip to it that pleased him the night would be foggy and jaril was sure to come to him branns house was ready with a discreet maid waiting to see if she pleased the new mistress he sauntered through the players quarter wound deeper into silili heading up the mountain to the temple his mood mellowing until he was afloat on contentment and all men were brothers and all beasts had souls he drifted through the godons the throng of traders from a thousand lands east and west mdarjin black men ebony stick figures heads shaven and enclosed in beaten bronze rings bronze rings about their wrists and ankles narrow bodies clad in voluminous robes patterned in lines and blocks of black and white and sudden patches of pure color blue green red a vibrant purple they brought ivory and scented woods and metal work of all kinds western men and womenphras suadi gallinasi eirsan dozens of other sorts of men he couldnt name pinkish skin hair shading from almost white to the darkest of blacks eyes blue brown green yellow mongrel hordes they were none as pure as hina they came with clocks and other mechanical devices saddles and fine leatherwork books wines fine spices the women especially were spice hunters adept at worming into the odd places where you found the rarest of the spices gem traders art dealers dream sellers anything that men or women would buy harpish clad in leather top to toe in spite of the warmth of sililis climate faces shrouded in black leather cowls with only the eyes cut out always in groups of three never alone dealers in mages wares and witchs stock mystical books rumor and small gods vioshyn in layer upon layer of violently clashing patterned cloth selling seaivory and mountain furs carved chests and exotic powders also most of the more common drugs felhiddin small thin a walnut brown clad mostly in the blue tattoos that covered every inch of visible skin skimpy loincloths and sandals men and women alike though any stranger who mistook the meaning of the bare breasts got the metal claws the women wore in the meat of the offending hand and threatening growls from any other felhiddin nearby as they swirled about him like a dog pack set to attack trading in exotic nuts and herbs scaled hides of strange beasts furs in fine bright colors metallic reds and greens a hundred shades of blue bowls and other objects carved from jewelwoods with great simplicity but exquisite shape henermen trading nothing but their services and their herds of strong ugly begryers hauling whatever their hirers desired inland along the land route to the west mercenary fighters of all races and both sexes street magicians dancers acrobats musicians beggars woda watermen and porters squat broad bowed legs calling their services in loud singsong voices priests servants to many gods and demons mostly hina native to the ground born on selt to die on selt born in the uplands that had once been hinaruled but now lay in the tight fists of damara lords here now as pilgrims to the great temple on selts central mountain or teaching in the priest schools attached to the temple mages small men and large small women and large all races all shapes some pausing awhile in silili during their enigmatic wanderings some there for the day changing ships touching foot to ground only to leave it again some there to study in the temple schools some just nosing through the teeming market fog was edging up from the water and the streets were beginning to empty the foreigners flowing out of them into the joyhouses or the inns of the strangers quarter according to the hungers that most clamored to be satisfied taguiloa waved to those who leaned from joyhouse windows calling his name shrugged off invitations he was popular among the women of the night because of his stamina and his delight in them and their bodies it was his intention to appear as one who walked lightly and with laughter through the world his fears and blue spells he kept strictly to himself he was a good fella a pleasant considerate lover a gambler who lost and won with cheerful equanimity a friend who didnt vanish when trouble came down so there were many men and women to wave and call his name and few knew it was as much calculation as nature as hardwon as blackthorns beauty a product of much pain and rage and thought when gerontai died he wept and shuddered in blackthorns arms and she shut herself away with him a day and a night though this meant she had to deny her current patron and had to coax him into complaisance with a masterly performance of illness a sickness in which she seemed frail and suffering but ten times as lovely and desirable as before perhaps because of her momentary unattainability from where he was concealed taguiloa watched with amazement and appreciation seeing how she took what would have destroyed a lesser woman and made it work to her advantage he left her and shut himself in his masters house his now shut himself away from everyone and thought long and hard about how his life should go coming from that wrestling match with a sketch of the man he wanted to be eighteen and determined to climb as high in his way as blackthorn had in hers he ran up the steps of the temple way reached the temple plaza turned and looked out across the city and the bay the shops were being shuttered the paper windows of the living quarters above them glowed a dark amber just visible as night drifted down on selt torches and lampions flared in the night quarter the noises of the night came to him tinkle of strings soar of flutes laughs shouts a fragment of a song the strangers quarter was quieter the only lights the torches that glimmered before the inns and taverns and noodle shops the docks were dark and deserted except for the guard bands with their polelamps and rattles out on the water the wodaan were lighting up lanterns and cook fires too far away for him to hear more than a few mushy sounds the blat of a horn a wild raucous shout or two he could see dark shapes passing the lanterns merging and parting some moving fast jaggedly some slowly sinuously a shadow play of dark and light that fascinated him for a while wisps of images for another dance fluttering unformed in his head the ghosts of the drowned and murdered came oozing from the water and the ground blown by the wind like scraps of smoke ignoring the temuengs its a good place to be he thought and i am a man with the luck god riding my shoulder time to pay my debt eh tungjii he went into the temple moved past the godalau and her companion gods and stopped before one of the smallest figures the little luck whose belly was shiny from the hundreds no thousands of hands that had rubbed it a mostly naked little manwoman with fat bignippled breasts and a short thick penis left eye winking in a merry face taguiloa bowed patted the round little belly dropped coins in the offering bowl and lit a handful of incense sticks feeling more than a little drunk from contemplating the possibilities in his future he poked the sticks in the sandbowl squatted and watched the sweet smoke swirl up about the god after a moment he laughed jumped to his feet did a wheeling run a double somersault flipped into a handstand then over onto his feet then he was running from the temple laughter still bubbling in his blood the luck god still riding his shoulder giggling into his ear jaril materialized from the fog walked down the temple way stairs beside him saying nothing just there taguiloa nodded to him and continued his careful march downward the steps were slick with condensation and worn by generations of feet to break a leg here would be thumbing his nose at the god on his shoulder and an invitation to a cascade of evil luck when he reached the bottom he smiled down at his small silent companion ladji and blackthorn offer linjijan ladjis grandnephew as our flute player blackthorn wants to meet brann he hesitated lifted a hand let it fall i told them a little about her and you they wont say anything jaril oh yes theres a foreign woman too a musician and the daughter of a mage shes joining the troupe i think tomorrow two hours after midday would your companion be willing to come ive found a house a few steps from mine a maid there for brann if she wants to keep her the girl will be discreet we can get your companion moved in tomorrow morning if she decides to take the house you want to see it come along then brann came through the wallgate not at all the woman hed seen that morning obviously shed decided not to show forth as hina wisely so he thought the shipmaster was right hina ways werent easily acquired her hair was hanging loose not curling but undulating gracefully out from her face black as night cloud soft she wore a cap of linked gold coins with strings of coins hanging beside her face a long loose robe of black silk embroidered with birds and beasts from hina tales her skin was darkened to an olive flushed pink on the cheeks her mouth a warm rose her green eyes wide and gemlike her face as devoid of expression as the godmasks in the temple a brindle hunting bitch pranced beside her prickears twitching crystal eyes filled with a dancing light that said yaril was enjoying herself for a moment taguiloa felt uneasy before this trio though he was used to ghosts fluttering about and gods roaming the world now and then someone would see the godalau swimming through the waters of the outer bay her long fingers like rays from the moon combing the waves her fish tail like limber jade flipping through air and water churning both or geidranay big as a mountain squatting on a mountainside tending the trees hed seen a dragon break a long drought undulating laughter it was flashes of reds and golds as the sun glittered off its scales a memory of beauty so great the ragged boy digging for clams forgot to breathe the little gods sessa who found lost things sulit the god of secrets pindatung the god of thieves and pickpockets all the rest of them they scampered like cheerful mice from person to person coming unasked leaving without warning a capricious treacherous and highly courted clutch of godlings you could make bargains with them and if you were clever enough even profit from them if you werent clever enough and brought disaster on yourself and your folk well that was your fault if you got greedy and overstepped or fearful and failed to keep your wits honed you might find yourself reduced to nightsoil collector or beggar with juicy sores to exploit taguiloa walked in silence with the woman boy and bitch contemplating his choices when tungjii gave you used the luck or lost it and more the time he was still fussing about being obligated to a temueng gerontai impressed that on him and to underline the lesson told him raskataks story raskatak was a fisherman with a small boat and miserable luck who brought in just enough fish to keep him from abandoning the craft and seeking some other kind of work one bright day he was out in his boat alone on a becalmed sea his lines overboard while he patched his sail it had nearly split up the middle in the sudden squall that separated him from the other boats and left him wallowing between swells that rapidly flattened out as thewind stopped dead and the sun rose higher and higher until it was beating remorselessly on the ocean there was nothing touching his lines they hung loose over the side even the boat sounds had died away until the noise the awl made punching through the canvas seemed as loud as a large fish breaking water though none did for miles about overhead sundragon burned and undulated white and gold great motherofpearl eyes turning and turning and on his forward shoulders tungjii rode hisser plump buttocks accommodated in a hollow the dragon made for himmer waving a fan gently before hisser face heesh looked down at the wretched little boat and grinned suddenly broadly reached into the glitter about the dragon twisted hisser dainty hand in a complicated round opened hisser fist and let a scatter of gold coins drop into the boat watching with casual interest to see if they would hit the fisherman on his head and kill him miss the boat altogether and be lost in the sea or land beside the man in a clinking shining pile tungjii had no leaning toward any of those outcomes heesh was merely watching to see how chance would work out the coins came clunking down heavy rounds that landed in a little pile beside raskataks bare feet one of them bouncing off his big toe crushing the bone he gaped at the coins his big bony hands stilled on the rotten canvas after a minute he put the canvas aside and scowled at his reddened toe he lifted his foot and put it heavily on his knee he touched the toe with clumsy fingers grunted at the pain still ignoring the gold he searched around in his sea chest drew out a flat piece of bone broke off a bit of it bound it to his toe with a bit of rag then a twist of line he put his foot down with the same heavy care only then did he pick up one of the coins and look it over test it with his teeth he sat staring at it as if he didnt understand what it was moving with the same stolid deliberation he picked up each of the coins tested each of them the same way and put it away in his sea chest when he finished that he looked up searching the sky for the origin of the shower of gold what he saw was the glitter and burn of the noon sun he hawked and spat over the side went back to sewing up the sail gold or no gold he wasnt going to get home without a working sail he finished the seam and raised the sail but the wind was still absent the canvas hung limp not even slatting against the mast he sat waiting his eyes half shut dreaming of what he was going to do with the gold as if to prove that miracles never occur singly a school of fish struck the hooks on his lines and he spent the next two hours hauling them in dropping the lines back until his boat was alive with flopping glistening silversides and the moment the school passed on a fresh breeze sprang up and set the wretched little boat racing for selt for the first time ever he came in early and alone and got premium prices on his fine fat fish he went back to the tiny hovel hed built of ancient sails and bits of driftwood on a handful of land he rented from a distant cousin he counted the coins over and over even when it was only by feel after his fish oil lamp sputtered dry and he counted the silver and copper coins the days catch had brought ten times the sum he usually made fearing that the gold might disappear as strangely as it had come fearing too that the thieves that lived around him might smell it out and steal it from him forgetting no thief of reasonable intelligence would come poking through his bits and pieces he buried the gold under the agglomeration of sticks and rope he used for a bed then spent a good part of the night nursing a jug of cheap wine and trying to ignore the pain in his toe while he dreamed of great feasts and highclass dancing girls and fine silk robes and his cousins bowing respectfully before him and seeking his advice and begging favors of him which he granted or refused with gracious nobility in the morning he washed his toe bound some cobwebs and chicken dung about it and tied on another rag without much thought acting from old habit he rose with the dawn got dressed went limping down to the water and went out again in his boat again he had great luck as if his hooks were magnets he called the fish to them again he filled the boat so soon he was the first back and got the best price it being the way of the stupid he sw himself as clever he saw what was happening as an outcome of his superior worth though he was no less a silent man he began holding himself with great pride not noticing that children followed behind him mocking him the gold coins staved where they were buried beneath his bed he dreamed the same dreams night after night but in the morning he left the dreams behind and went out on his boat as he had since he was old enough to hold a line he sat alone in the boat whispering to himself saying if i spend gold theyll want to know where it comes from theyll send thieves to steal it from me theyll send men to kill me so the gold stayed under his bed the dreams stayed in his head his foot got worse the toe swelling and turning black his catch went back to what it was before a whole days work hardly enough to pay his land huy his meals and a jug of cheap wine to kill the pain in his foot on the sixth day a squall caught his boat before he got more than a few lengths from the shore reducing the wretched thing to a hodgepodge of shattered planks and timbers it took him all day to gather the bits and pieces then he went looking for driftwood so he could cobble the boat back together he had more than enough gold for a dozen such boats but the thought of spending it never entered his head he worked on the boat all day then went home to eat and dream some more in the morning he couldnt get out of bed his whole foot was black his leg swollen his body damp with fever by the end of the week he was dead this is the lesson cerontai told taguiloa use your luck or it rots like raskataks toe linjijan was a smiling amiable boy nineteen or twenty skinny hands chapped and callused from the labor on a fishing boat keeping in spite of that the tender agility of his greatuncles hands taguiloa met his mild uncurious gaze and groaned within the boy seemed as incapable of keeping himself as a dayold baby then he saw the way blackthorn brann and harra were smiling at him the halfexasperated halfadoring smile of a mother for a mischievous but wellloved childand changed his mind linjijan was one of the fortunate of the earth as long as he had his music hed be content and whatever he needed to survive and play that music would come unasked into his hands women and men alike would care for him protect him love him even when they were furious at him taga sighed but promised old tungjii more incense and a free performance on the luckday festival he listened to linjijan play and sighed again moved quietly to stand beside the old piper thanks he said dryly the old man stretched his mouth in a tightlipped smile savoring the ambiguity in the word he snapped his fingers linjijan stopped playing and came to squat beside him you want to go with him ladji nodded at taguiloa linjijan nodded he hadnt said a word so far even to his greatuncle greeting him with a smile and a nod thats it then come the old man retreated to the far side of the room and sat with his back against a wall linjijan beside him tari stirred on her divan her eyes fixed on brann shed focused on the womans face the moment taguiloa brought her in had been glancing repeatedly at her as taguiloa dealt with linjijan now she gave over any pretense of interest in the others saiir brann she said taga tells me you will be reading past and future for the countryfolk he tells me youre a witch really a witch read for me she looked blindly about what do you need gada sticks fire and shell crystal a bowl of water tell me what you need and ill have it brought brann came across the room to kneel beside the divan the brindle bitch moving beside her with silent feral grace if you will give me your hand said blackthorn tad extended her hand brann cradled it on hers yaril she said lets make it real this time the bitch shimmered into a gold glow which rose and hovered a moment over blackthorn then sank into her taguiloa remembered it with a shiver at the base of his spine and wondered briefly if he should interfere he glanced at branns intent face and held his tongue the glimmer emerged from tari and coalesced into a small blonde girl she stood beside brann murmured in her ear for several minutes then she retreated to the end of the divan and sank out of sight brann shivered her composure broke suddenly briefly pain and fear and pity and anger flowed in waves across her face she sat very still as if frozen for a moment then the mask was back she opened her eyes drew a forefinger across tans palm not even the gods know for certain what the morrow brings she said quietly their guesses might be better than a mortals but thats only because theyve had a longer time to watch the cycling of the seasons and the foolishness of man when i read the fates of men and women i will give them what pleases them and phrase it vaguely enough that whatever happens they can twist the words to fit as they will they want to be fooled and will do the greater part of the work for me her voice flowed on gentle and soothing yongala laughing told me folk hold fast to their dreams even when their reason tells them they are fools tari blackthorn dancer on fire do you desire that sort of reading or the truth of what you fear tad trembled closed her eyes what do you know shall i speak of it here these are my friends i wouldnt ask if i didnt expect a real answer brann looked at the hand she still held set it on the black velvet cover watching her closely his curiosity a hunger in him taguiloa saw her gather herself a cold knot in his stomach he waited for her answer this is what i know she said her voice held level with visible difficulty some days every step is agony and effort your ankles and knees swell and throb sometimes beyond bearing when you are in the dance you forget that pain but are nearly crippled by it once the dance is over you fear the end of your ability to dance six months ago you sought solace from pain in poppymilk now you find yourself slaved to it and view that slavery with horror but cannot escape it she turned away from talis drawn face looked over her shoulder at taguiloa in spite of her efforts her own face quivered she closed her eyes tried to calm herself and when she spoke her voice was flat and dead saхm i will not do this for you in the villages it would call too much attention to me and i dont think i she faced round again moved on her knees to the foot of the divan yaril jaril come to me i need you the blond boy came from the shadows put his hand on her left shoulder the hand melted through the black silk and into the flesh beneath the blond girl came from behind the divan and stood at her right shoulder the hand melting through the black silk of the robe and sinking into the flesh beneath brann reached out and brushed aside the many layers of fragile silk and took blackthorns ankle in her hand taguiloa saw then what hed overlooked before the ankle was swollen a little thickened stiff tari watched with fear and anguish as brann brushed her fingers across the swelling it is only beginning she said cleared her throat took a breath then went on were it to proceed you would be unable to walk five years from now she smiled a wide urchins grin full of joy and mischief slya be blessed o dancer it will not proceed she closed her eyes and held the ankle cradled between her hands taris eyes flew open wider heat she whispered brann said nothing did not seem to hear after a moment she lowered that foot to the velvet and lifted the other taguiloa watched amazed his anxiety and the sharp fear aroused by the witchs words dissipating as the womans long strong hands moved from ankles to knees not bothering to push aside the layered silk robe from knees to hips then wrists elbows shoulders humming softly brann moved her hands from the top of taris head down along her body to the hennad soles of her lovely feet the children moving with her bonded to her flesh to flesh then she sat back on her heels and sighed the children moved away from her their small fine hands sliding from flesh and silk yaril shimmered a moment and was again a brindle bitch lying beside her jaril went to squat beside taguiloa taris face flushed then paled she sat up moved one foot then the other moved her wrists bent one leg at the knee straightened it bent the other leg straightened it her hands were shaking her breath came sharp and fast she opened her mouth shut it couldnt speak closed her eyes pressed her hands against her ribs sucked in a long breath let it out and the poppymilk youre free of that too theres not gold enough in the world brann shrugged oh well gold she got to her feet stretched yawned this isnt what im going to feed the farmers no and no tell them what they want to hear and make them shiver just enough she grinned and scare the bones out of any hillwolves stupid enough to attack taguiloa looked around harra was gazing at brann with an expression of lively interest her full lips pursed for a whistle but not whistling ladji was sliding his ancient flute between thumb and forefinger smiling at nothing much his body gone rubbery with his private relief he was apparently the only one whod known of taris growing pain linjijan was gazing dreamily at nothing his fingers moving on his thighs as if he practiced modes of fingering for music he heard inside his head jaril touched taguiloas ann he looked down what is it you wanted a boy to play the drums you volunteering jaril shook his head too boring but i found a boy he doesnt have to be hina taguiloa looked around the room mages daughter from so far west hed never heard of her people linjijan comfortably hina brann the changeling witch once of arth slya now of nowhere yaril and jaril who knew what they were one more foreigner whod notice he laughed how long will it take to get him here he turned to tari spread his hands sorry i shouldnt be so free with your house tari blackthorn waved a slim hand i wont say i owe you but you may bring all the world in here and i wont complain hes waiting outside jaril darted for the door taguiloa strolled across to the divan knelt beside tari took her hand in his there was a time when i thought i was running this thing he lifted her hand touched his lips to the wrist cradled the hand against his cheek you didnt tell me i wasnt telling myself she eased her hand free taga my tinti her voice was a whisper that reached only him dont you see how odd it is all this this collection of magetouched strangers why are they being pulled together and who is doing it she bent a finger touched the knuckle to his chin she worries me your patron i dont understand her i shouldnt say it after what she did for me but be careful of her summerfly why is she doing this she has her reasons and you know them why am i even more worried for you no dont fidget so little love i wont ask more questions she ran her forefinger around the curve of his ear and down his neck your drummer comes taga laughter shook in her voice taguiloa swung round a mdarjin boy stood uncertainly in the doorway clutching drums half as big as he was ten maybe twelve blueblack skin hair a skim of springs coiled close to his skull huge brown eyes his hands and feet were borrowed from a bigger body his arms thin as twigs with bumpy knobs where the joints were his name is negomas jaril said his father was a mraj shaman and he did something negomas doesnt know what but it was bad and it killed him and the rest of the mdarjin wont have anything to do with negomas now its like he caught something from his father and could infect them with it but thats not true i checked him out and you know im good at that he tugged the boy forward negomas grinned nervously his body was taut quivering with eagerness and hope your drums taguiloa said my drums he grinned wider and mischief brightened the huge brown eyes i grow into them he waggled one of his large bony hands with a bit of time he finished winced as jaril kicked him in the ankle saхm he added politely play them for me something i can move to he stepped out of his sandals moved to the center of the mat and stood waiting shaking himself a long ripple from ankles to head wrists to shoulders he smiled toward the boy then unfocused his eyes and concentrated on listening with ears and body both he heard a blurred shiver of sound then some tentative staccato taps that had unusual overtones a sonority similar to the deeper notes of harras daroud the drums began speaking with more authority he kept up his loosening moves listening until the sound slid under his skin and throbbed in his blood he flexed his arms twisted his body from side to side then let the music lift him into a handless backflip that developed into a series of bending stretching kinetic movements alternating high and low he reveled in the drumsong beating in blood bone and muscle was unsurprised when two flutes joined in singing in none of the usual modes producing a strong harsh music then the daroud came in picking up its own version of the melodic line adding a greater tension to the blend by tugging at the beat of the drums the dance went on and on until taguiloa collapsed to the mat sweating and laughing exhausted but flying high his panting laughter mingling with the applause and laughter from tari and brann whoops from jaril and the sweating mdarjin boy then silence filled with the sound of taguiloas breathing he fell back till he lay flat on the straw his hands burned his bones ached and hed collected bruises and sore muscles from moving in ways he hadnt tried before he turned his head lifted a heavy hand to push sweatsticky hair off his face youll do negomas he yawned swallowed anyone i need to talk to about you the boy shook his head moved his fingers on the drumheads taguiloa looked at jaril raised his brows jaril shook his head taguiloa pushed up until he was sitting with his arms draped over his knees you understand you wont be my student but only part of the troupe when the boy nodded he went on im sorry but thats the way the world says things have to be i need a hina boy if ever i can find the right one jaril fetch whatever the boys got move him into my house and make sure yarm doesnt try anything jaril snorted looked pointedly at brann brann sighed taguiloa is master of this motley group my friend we dont argue with the boss at least not in public even if hes being more than usually foolish she chuckled then sobered you know what yarm is like for the good of our purpose get negomas settled then take him out for something to eat she smiled i know you could fry tagas liver if you chose he knows it by now or hes a lot stupider than he looks we all know it and we know youre going to do nothing of the kind jaril walked over to negomas jerked his head at the door then strolled out with an air of going where he chose at the speed he chose to go negomas picked up his drums winked over his shoulder at taguiloa then followed the blond boy out brann got to her feet stood looking around im glad its you whos got to pull this mix of geniuses together she nodded to blackthorn smiled a general farewell and swept out the door yarm looked up as taguiloa stepped through the door where you been and whats that dirty mdarjin doing here none of your business and speaking of dirty this house is a garbage dump if you want neat hire a girl you can afford it yarm said sullenly im not your servant youre not my wife either which is just as well because youd be fit only for drowning if you were a woman not a servant boils on your ass youre what i say you are as of now thats nothing get he jerked a thumb at the door now yarms voice cracked with surprise and rage youre putting that foreigner in my place get out now tomorrow morning you can collect your gear but ive had all im going to take from you fist will out he leaped at the boy caught the collar of his shirt half shoved half lifted him across the room and out of the house set his foot on the boys backside and sent him in a stumbling sprawl down the leaflittered path yarm lay dazed for a moment or so then scrambled to his feet and came screaming at taguiloa who slapped his face vigorously several times swept his feet from under him with a leg scythe caught an arm in a punish hold and ran him down the path and out into the street he stood watching as yarm slunk off even his back full of threat though he didnt dare turn and voice his thoughts he still doesnt quite believe youre serious taguiloa looked down jaril stood beside him his blond hair shining in the sunlight im like to have company tonight uhhuh well be there too yarils been getting bored she says i have all the fun taguiloa stood in the center of the bedroom and looked about him hed finished packing up yarms things and a ratty lot they were the boy had no pride blackthorn was right he thought as she always is yarm had a beautiful slim body limber as a sea snakes and the face of a young immortal which the women in the audiences sighed over he also had a good sense of timing he learned quickly everything taguiloa taught him but he was spoiled lazy whining dishonest about small things and large unless he thought he would be caught jealous of taguiloas time and attention to a degree that had soon become unbearable not a sexual jealousy that would have been far easier to handle but something else taga couldnt understand or explain he put the packets outside with a feeling of relief this house used to be the place where he rested practiced meditated it was filled with memories of his loved teacher memories of peace and contentment after the turmoil in the streets gerontai had taught him much besides tumbling and juggling hed been hoping for much the same relationship with yarm but was quickly disillusioned hed let yarm move in with him not seeing the speculative gleam in yarms black eyes a measuring cold calculation powered by malice and spite and a like for hurting a passionate need to hold and own fire and ice and neither of them comfortable to live with taguila stood in his doorway rubbing his back across the edge of the jamb feeling relaxed and clean for the first time in the three years yarm had lived here the wounded moon was a ragged crescent rising in the east its lowest horn just touching the temple roof im not going to wait here staring at the wall like a fool negomas was spending the night with brann no need to worry about him jaril taga yelled an owl circled above hooted what sounded like laughter came swooping down landing beside taguiloa as the blond boy a moment later a nighthawk screeched came slipping down and landed as the silverbright small girl whats the fuss her voice was water clear melodious taguiloa bowed welcome damasaхr hm well feeling as if he faced the ghost of his greataunt who was mamasaхr to the whole family and by repute tougher than a temueng pimush taguiloa cleared his throat i was going to visit some friends thought your brother might like to come along she snorted though jaril had informed taguiloa that his kind didnt actually breathe and therefore couldnt play the flute and let fist burn you out taguiloa laughed before he thought then expected her to scold him for disrespect but she seemed unperturbed just stood waiting for him to explain himself fist has better sense he said even on a foggy night start a fire here and half of silili would go bad enough to have hina on his tail when some ghost or other named him as the firestarter something that big would bring in temueng enforcers and maybe even an imperial censor hed be skinned alive and hung to rot his family too and everyone who helped him and their families taga flung his arms out and even when he was dead the ghosts he made would torment the ghost he was im not worth all that no way not even for dearest yarm the family hope he smiled at the little girl want to come along she gazed a moment at her brother then nodded why not this ghost business is weird taguiloa stared at her your kind dont die oh they die all right and stay dead ghosts no way they dont have souls thats something theyve been arguing about since eldest ancestor learned to talk she shrugged a waste of time and breath far as i can see she watched as jaril blurred then changed into a hina boy this is the first reality weve seen where there are ghosts you can actually talk to she shimmered and changed to a small golden lemur then hopped up to ride her brothers shoulder well jaril said she couldnt come as a little girl thatd make your friends uncomfortable taguiloa pulled the door shut turned the key in the lock and dropped the metal bit into a pocket then started walking toward the gate through the rustling foliage of bushes he reminded himself hed have to water in the morning you change your shapes so why couldnt she be another boy the lemur gave a chittering sound that sounded indignant jaril grinned and patted her paw but yarils a female he said she couldnt do that why not curiosity driving him taguiloa persisted its only appearance after all if i dressed myself in womans robes painted my face wore a wig and practiced a bit i could make a fairly convincing appearance as a woman though my real nature wouldnt change at all the boy turned those strange crystal eyes on him when taguiloa was sure he wasnt going to answer he did the inner and outer are one with us if we try to change the nature of the outer we deny and warp the inner so he grinned an impudent urchin grin that acknowledged and mocked taguiloas voicethat we seem children should tell you we are children how old are you hard to say time is funny six or seven hundreds of your years something like that children we grow slowly seems like he tapped a finger on jarils head relieved to find it solid warm and a little oily talking about weird i find you changechildren stranger than any ghost ive ever seen they wandered through the night quarter sharing jugs of wine the lemur a popular little beast with her smooth soft fur and dainty manners they got evicted from a few places when some weakstomached drinkers refused to tolerate an animal drinking from mens wine bowls and others who liked the beast somewhat more than they liked the objectors jumped the objectors and started breaking the furniture they visited a joyhouse jaril pouting and yaril sulking when taguiloa wouldnt let them go upstairs with him they settled for entertaining the joygirls jaril clapping his hands and dancing yaril dancing with him a small and elegant figure bowing and swaying with the most wonderful grace golden fur glimmering in the lamplight the lemur even played a simple tune on a gittern abandoned in a corner they stayed there quite a while even after taguiloa rejoined them but eventually wandered on to watch a fight in the middle of the street throw the bones with a circle of men on the sidewalk losing and winning with equal enthusiasm all three savoring the noise and activity about them loud raucous mostly illegal and immoral but full of vigor and the beat of life now and then taguiloa got a jolt when he looked at jarils eager young face then hed tell himself seven hundred years tungjiis tits and tool and forget worrying about corrupting the boy sometime after midnight he doused his head with icewater looked blearily about collected the children and started threading through the narrow streets heading toward the players quarter they left the lamplit streets behind left the noise and warmth and good feeling taguiloa shivered the water in his hair making him cooler though it didnt do much to clear the fog out of his head i shouldnt have had that last jug jaril shook himself like a large wet dog yarillemur leaped off his shoulder shimmered and was a large owl beating upward at a steep angle yarils going to keep an eye on our backs someones following us not yet probably waiting for us tell me about fist what scares him not much hanging temueng torturers dragons he swears he wont hang the enforcers will have to kill him to take him his footsteps sounded like gongs in his ears jarils feet made no sound at all hes cunning knows when to back off runs strings of smugglers snatchthieves thugs i dont know what all he figures he can handle you a little pain and fear and you do what he says yeah id figure the same were it not for you changechildren why else would i put up with yarm for so long and hes afraid of dragons a few years back or so im told fist had a diviner read the gada sticks for him the man told him to watch out for dragon fire ah maybe yaril and me we can make that reading come true jaril blurred and a twin to yarils owl went sailing up narrowly avoiding tangling itself in the branches of pomegranate growing out over a wall taguiloa stood blinking after him ill never get used to that as he prowled along through the shadows of the narrow lane he wondered what had got into the changechild too much wine for one thing he thought about that and was more confused than before they didnt have innards like normal folk you could see that when they were smears of light but jaril had picked up a taste for wine rambling the night with taguiloa and disposed of it somehow managing to get nicely elevated on it maybe it was like ghosts drinking the fragrance of wine and tea and cooked foods what did changechildren eat jaril never said anything about that doesnt matter hes a friend can eat whatever he wants doesnt bother me good kid jaril even if sometimes he scares the shit outta me slowly sobering he kept to the shadows and moved as silently as he could toward his own gate fist wasnt going to kill him just break an arm or leg or both and tromp on him a lot and repeat the tromping as soon as he healed unless he gave in and took yarm hack taga cursed the emperors boils or whatever it was that stirred him up and made him grab at everything in sight with the usual number of enforcers about and the tekoras guard up to strength fist would have settled for a minor beating tungjii and jahtakash alone knew what hed get up to these days a horned owl came swooping down and changed to a blond child yaril she came close to him whispered some men in the garden waiting for you yarm is there twolegged elephant beside him a couple others with clubs fist himself taga swore under his breath thats bad i thought so mind if jaril and me we burn up a little of your garden what i remember what you said about fire we wont let it get away taga stared at her then grinned dragons well in a good cause why not he scowled and swore again fist seshtrango gift him with staggers and a horde of rabid fleas yaril giggled looked up giggled again shimmered and was a replica in green and silver of the small crimson and gold dragon undulating past over tagas head jarildragon flipped his streamered tail in airy greeting taga grinned up at the baby dragons youre drunk both of you silent laughter bubbled in his blood the serpentine shapes waved laughter at him wove laughterknots about each other exulting in a form that made them drunker than any amount of wine would they settled down before the enchantment of their beauty wore off him he was wine drunk too far more than he should be and started off toward his house he gave them a few moments then followed after thinking they were going to impress the shit out of those thugs waiting like innocent babes in his shrubbery the dragons moved swiftly ahead of him darting in swift undulations toward his garden he strolled along the lane between the high woodandstone walls that shut in the houseandgarden compounds of those players and artists wealthy enough to buy and maintain a place here he had inherited his thered been some uncertain years after his master died when he was afraid he would lose the tiny house and garden when he had to swallow his pride and borrow money from blackthorn which he knew she wasnt expecting him to repay he did itand repaid itbecause gerontai had taught him to love tending that garden he knew every plant in there every inch of the soil even the worms and beetles that lived in it he knew it by taste and feel and smell he knew every miniature carp in the small pool every bird that nested in his trees and bushes it was his place of retreat and meditation and more necessary to him than anything or anyone else even blackthorn yarm had disrupted that peace but once this nonsense was over hed have his retreat back negomas was proving a quiet happy companion with a love of growing things and a gentle sureness in those outsize hands that were so clumsy othertimes he had the wrong sort of body and no talent at all for tumbling or the new kind of movement taguiloa was exploring but taguiloa was beginning to feel that hed found someone to whom he could pass on the other things gerontai had taught him and maybe the changechildren could find him a hina boy to learn the movements a boy that would fit into the household and appreciate the peace taguiloa ambled along the curving lane dreaming of times to come chuckling as he heard shouts curses and screams ahead of him cracks cracklings shrieks a scream baby dragons getting busy when he stopped by the gate a red and gold dragon head popped over the wall a gold crystal dragon eye winked at him then the head vanished he pushed on the leaves of the gate and they swung inward without a sound busy yarm thered been a squeak in one of the left side hinges yesterday he strolled into his garden hands clasped behind him stopped after a few steps and grinned at the tableau before him yarm in a half crouch fists clenched his face twisted with helpless rage his shirt and trousers slashed with thin charred lines and speckled with black spots still rededged and smoking fist on his knees howling with pain the side of his face burned his left shoulder and arm bubbling raw meat two other men on their faces in the gravel of the path twitching a little speechless with terror yaril dragon and jaril dragon drifted down and hovered by taguiloa one on the left the other on his right both a little behind him like proper bodyguards greet you yarm taguiloa said come for your things i see you met my friends he grimaced at the howling fist turned to jaril could you do something about that noise golden eye winked at him dragon dissolved in his light ray form jaril zipped through fist wheeled about him went through him again then returned to dragon shape and took his place at taguiloas shoulder the howling stopped not a full cure the mans flesh was still ragged and raw but at least it wasnt oozing anymore fist got to his feet he opened and shut his left hand the muscles in his arm shifted stiffly but the pain was no longer unbearable theyve promised to keep an eye on me and mine taguiloa said they must have thought you had hostile intentions waiting here in the dark like this you dont have hostile intentions do you fist the big man was staring fascinated at the serpentine shapes turning his head from one side to the other until taguiloa began to get dizzy watching eyes glazed fearsweat dripping down his face fist coughed said uh no sure not he turned away from yaril and jaril reached over to touch his burned side like you said we come to get yarms stuff meant nothing by it he kicked the nearest of his men in the ribs isnt that so fidge on your feet goat turd silent laughter from the dragons taguiloa glanced at yaril blinked as she began smoking about the nostrils and produced a small gout of bright blue fire fidge started shivering and had difficulty getting to his feet fist went so pale he looked leprous in that brief blue glow then yarn might as well collect his belongings everything he owns is in those packs by the door hell need some help hauling it but then youre here arent you so generous with your time and muscle he turned his head to jaril dragon light their way my friend if you feel like it of course more silent laughter then jaril dragon went coiling after fist and yarm prodding them to move faster when they were back taguiloa said good theres no reason for any of you to return is there my friends here might be a bit nastier if they saw you again they were mild tonight but their tempers get a bit tetchy when theyre hungry i wouldnt show my face inside these walls again if i were you silently heavily the four intruders trudged through the gate and into the lane taguiloa pushed the two sections of gate shut and dropped the bar home with intense satisfaction he strolled toward the house laughter bubbling up in him his own and that from the dragonets yaril and jaril dissolved and retbrmed into ehildshapes giggling helplessly leaning against the housewall beside the door holding their middles you should you shoulda yaril gasped you shouldve seen jaril chasing them through the hushes you shouldve seen us herding them off the grass giving them hotfoots until they were hopping like oh oh oooh i think im gonna bust jaril calmed a little asked hopefully you think theyll come back not this summer he looked around at the garden but couldnt see much the crescent moon was low in the west and the starlight dimmed by fog rolling in he couldnt see any smoldering glows turned to the children fire all out we made sure if youre wrong and i burn to death ill come back and haunt you we know they said in chorus we know early in that long summer in silili jaril went with taguiloa to the shaggil horsefair on the mainland loud hot dusty filled with the shrill challenges of resty stallions the higher bleating whinnies of colts and fillies the snap of auctioneers chant the whamtap of closing rods the smell of urine sweat hay dust clay dust horse and man cheap wine and hot sauce boiling noodles and vinegar cinnamon musk frangipani sandalwood cumin hot iron leather oils islands of decorum about jamar lords islands of chaos about wrestlers tumblers jugglers of the more common sort sword swallowers fireeaters sleightofhand men doing tricks to fool children shell and pea men fooling adults gamblers of all degree hina farmers there with their whole families the infants riding mother and father in backcradles the older children clinging close somewhat intimidated by the crowd foreigners there for the famous shaggil mares whose speed and stamina passed into any strain they were bred to speculators there on the hope they alone could dig out the merits in colts neglected enough to keep their price low courtesans there for goodlooking easy mounts to show themselves off in wider realms than the streets of silili temung horsebeliks there to buy war mounts and takhill drays to pull supply wagons and siege engines taguiloa strolled through the heat noise and dust enjoying it all enjoying most of all the knowledge he could buy any handful of those about them with the gold in his moneybelt he stopped a moment by a clutch of tumblers watching them with a masters eye sighing at the lack of imagination in the rigidly traditional runs and flips they performed the patterns with ease and even grace and they gathered applause and coin for their efforts but hed done that well when he was twelve jaril wouldnt let him linger but tugged on his sleeve and led him from one shed to another pointing out a bay cob they should get to pull the travel wagon a lanky gray gelding that would do for harra who admitted she was out of practice but had once been rather a good rider the changechild wouldnt let taga stop to haggle for the beasts but urged him on until they were out at the fringes where weanlings and yearlings were offered for sale he stopped outside a small enclosure with a single colt inside taguiloa looked at the wildeyed demon tethered to a post looked down at jaril even i know you dont ride a horse less than two especially that one yaril and me well fix that later the age i mean oh wait here and dont look much interested in any of these he waved at the enclosures around them im not and suck your own eggs imp trailing laughter jaril shimmered into a pale amorphous glow tenuous in that dusty air as a fragment of dream it drifted in a slow circle above the corrals flashing through the colts and fillies in them finishing the survey with the beast in the nearest enclosure it melted through his yellowmud coat and seemed to nestle down inside the colt that made taga itchy reminding him of antfeet walking across his brain skittering about under his skin he reached inside his shirt and scratched at his ribs looked about for anything that might offer relief from the beating of the sun he was sweating rivers his heavy black shirt was streaky with sweat mud powdered with pale dust the moneybelt a furnace against his belly nothing close not a shed about these were the scrubs of the fair interesting only to the marginal speculators and a few farmers without the money to buy a mature beast but with land and fodder enough to justify raising a weanling he pulled his sleeve across his face grimaced at the slimy feel the heavy silk being no use as a swab when he let his arm fall jaril was standing beside him we want him the changechild said and pointed to the dun colt moving irritably at his tether jerking his head up and down blotched with sweat caught in an unremitting temper tantrum why the colt was a hand or two taller than the yearlings about them with a snaky neck an ugly boney head ragged ears that he kept laid back even when he stood fairly quiet a wicked plotting eye whoever brought that one to the fair had more hope than good sense you cant be serious sure jaril said tough smart and kill anyone tries to steal him and fast he reached up tugged at taguiloas sleeve come on once the breeder knows we really want him hell try to screw up the price he expects to make enough to pay for the colts feed selling him for tiger meat to some temueng collector dont believe anything he tries to tell you about the duns breeding the mare was too old for bearing and on her way to the butcher when she got out at the wrong time and got crossed by a maneater they had to track down and kill took them almost six months to trap him colts been mistreated from the day he was foaled and even if he wanted to behave he wasnt let offer the breeder three silver and settle for a halfgold no more dont act like you know it all thats what breeders like him love to see hell peel your hide and draw your back teeth before you notice just say you want the colt and will pay a silver for him let the breeder rant all he wants then say it again he gave taguiloa a minatory glance then a cheeky grin and trotted away his small sandaled feet kicking up new gouts of dust annoyed and amused taguiloa followed him knowing jaril was getting back at him for the times hed ordered the changechild about he was a tiny hina boy today with bowlcut black hair and dark gold skin except for his eyes indistinguishable from any of a thousand homeless urchins infesting the streets of silili dressed in dusty cotton trousers and a wrapabout shirt that hung open over a narrow torso and fluttered when there was any breeze he rounded a haystack and stopped beside three men squatting about a small fire drinking large bowls of acid black tea he waited for taguiloa then nodded at a foxfaced man lean and wiry with a small hard pot belly that strained the worn fabric of his shirt taguiloa came up to him salim he said you own the dun colt tethered by himself back there a ways i have a fine dun yearling salim indeed one whose blood lines trace back on both sides to the great mare kashantuea and her finest stud the moonleaper alas the times are hard saom that a man must be forced to part with his hearts delight bloodlines ah then youve turned up the maneaters origins a flicker of sour disgust then admiration that a sothron islander should know so much oh knowing one come let us gaze on the noble lines the matchless spirit of this pearl among horses a pearl without price as such a wise one as you are must see at a single glance i know nothing of horseflesh taguiloa said glad enough to take jarils advice one silver for your dun one silver the breeders face went red and his eyes bulged one silver for such speed and endurance of course a jest at my expense haha twenty gold i noticed the spirit he was doing his best to eat the plank in front of him no doubt hed prefer manflesh like his sire two silvers though im a fool to say it never though i starve and my children starve and my house fall down fifteen gold eating your house too is he think what youll save on repairs by getting rid of him three silver and thats my limit his mother was hoovesthatsing renowned through the world twelve gold only twelve gold though it hurts my heart to say it no doubt it was because of her great age that she died in the birthing taguiloa wiped at his face and looked at his hand im hot and tired my wife waits with a bath and tea let us finish this three silver for the beast and five copper for his rope and halter my boy can find a new fancy if he has to well youre jesting again noble skim such a miserable sum so be it come he wheeled and started off knowing jaril was coming reluctantly to his feet and pouting with disappointment might work might not he didnt really care he didnt want anything to do with that piece of malevolence in the corral the breeder let him get three strides away then called out wait oh noble sen why didnt you say you bought for this divine child this god among boys that my hearts delight should find a home with such a young lion ah that tempts me yes i can give my prize into such hands though if you could bring yourself noble satim a halfgold he sighed as taguiloa took another step away you are a hard man noble satim agreed then three silver and a copper hand you pay the tag fee satisfied with his bargaining taguiloa nevertheless glanced first at jaril got his nod then waved a hand in airy agreement they stopped at the pavilion of records paid the transfer fee and the small bribes necessary to get the clerks to record the sale and hand over the tin ear tag a larger bribe to get a tagger to set the tag in the dun colts ear as soon as he identified the proper beast the breeders job was done but he lingered relishing the dismay on the face of the tagman when he heard the yearling scream saw him lash out with each hoof in turn saw his wild wicked eye his long yellow teeth the tagman started to refuse and retreat but taguiloa got a good grip on his arm the boyll get him calmed down watch jaril climbed the rails and stood balanced on the top one looking down at the the dun who went crazy trying to get at him somewhere deep in his soul the breeder found a limit and opened his mouth to protest shut it when taguiloa laughed at him and repeated watch the boy found the moment he wanted and launched himself from the rail twisting somehow in midair so he came down astride the colt the yearling squealed with rage gathered himself and snorted mildly did a few fancy steps then stood quite still twisting his limber neck around so he could nose gently at jarils knee again the breeder started to shout a warning again he heldhis peace as the dun swung his head back round and stared at him breeder stared at beast beast at breeder and the man looked away first convinced the beast was snickering at him fuming he stalked off aware hed been fooled into selling a valuable beast for almost nothing after they bought the bay cob and the gray gelding they left the fair taguiloa on the gelding leading the cob jaril riding the yearling they left the three horses with a widow who had a shed and pasture she rented in the days that followed jaril and yaril flew across frequently to train and grow the dun from a yearling to a lean fit threeyearold those same days taguiloa planned the performances and rehearsed his troupe they walked out of silili taguiloa brann harra negomas linjijan jaril as hina boy and yaril as brindle hound taguiloa and linjijan put their shoulders to the manyokes of a tilt cart that carried their props costumes camping gear food and a miscellany of other useful objects brann and harra slipped straps over their shoulders and added their weight to the task of towing that clumsy vehicle jaril ran ahead of them with negomas both boys chattering excitedly about what they expected to happen a sharing of ignorance and pleasurable speculation yaril trotted about her nose to the ground enjoying the smells of the morning they left the last huts of the indigent behind before the sun was fully up negotiated the waste cursing ruts and briars then rocked onto a country lane where the going was a bit easier there was dew on the grass and low bushes the morning was cool and bright the smell of damp earth and soft wet grass almost strong enough to overcome the pungency of cow dung and dog droppings they hauled the cart through long crisp shadows cast by fruit trees nut trees spice trees and an occasional cedar or seapine all the bearing trees were heavy with ripe fruit or nuts or pods of spice as the heat of the sun increased and licked up the dew it also woke the heavy sweet perfume of the fruits and spices the tang of the cedars bees and wasps hummed about nibbling at late peaches and apricots nectarines and apples cherries and pears the air was filled with their noises with bird song with the whisper of needles and leavesand with the squeals groans and rattles from the cart as it lurched in and out of ruts one of the not so small irritations of being hina or foreign in a temuengruled world if they could have used the paved imperial way theyd have cut in half the effort and time it took to reach the causeway between selt and utar but bored temueng guards harassed even the wealthiest of hina merchants using that road what theyd do to a band of players didnt bear thinking about five hours after they left taguiloas house they came out of a lane onto the rocky cliffs where a few skinny longlegged pigs rooted among the grass and weeds trotting surefooted on the edge of cliffs rotten and precipitous jaril eyed them warily looked up at his soaring sister who had long since decided that she preferred wings to feet made a face at her then shimmered into a tall fierce boarhound and went back to trot beside the sweating straining adults the small wild pigs were the only nonworking livestock on the island and had tempers worse than hungover tern ueng taxcollectors the causeway towers were visible ahead a barrier that had to be passed no matter how unpleasant or malicious the guards were they needed to get their credeens there the metal tags they had to have to show in every village or to any temueng who stopped and required them taguiloa had travel permits for all of them but the credeens were more important it meant more bribes it meant enduring whatever the guards wanted to do to them these temuengs were the scrapings of the army left here while the better soldiers were off fighting the emperors wars of conquest taguiloa saw them every time he looked up saw them watching the clumsy progress of the tilt cart talking together the closer he got the worse they looked he began to worry for the womens sake the guards had to let them by eventually but they knew and he knew that nothing they did to him or brann or harra or linjijan or the children would bring them any punishment his stomach churning he kept his eyes down his shoulders bent hoping to ride out whatever happened knowing he had no choice but to accept their tormenting resistance would only make things worse the empush turned the papers over and over inspecting every mark and seal on them asking the same stupid questions again and again jabbing a meaty forefinger into taguiloas chest hitting the same spot each time until taga had to grit his teeth to keep from wincing only two of his fourcommand were visible the others probably even drunker than their fellows and asleep inside the tower brann endured the comments and catcalls the ugly handling though she was strongly tempted to suck a little of the life out of the temuengs might be doing the world a big favor if she drained them dry she watched harm and taguiloa both stoically enduring their hazing and kept a precarious hold on her temper but when the guards left their tormenting of the women and began leading negomas and jaril toward the tower shed had enough she went after them covering the ground with long tiger strides harra bit her lip then started whistling a strident tune that brought a large dustdevil whirling up the dirt lane and onto the way where it slapped into the empush distracting him so he wouldnt see what was happening brann slapped her hand against a guards neck he dropped as if shed knocked him on the head a breath later and the second guard followed him shooing the boys ahead of her green eyes flashing scorn she stalked back to taguiloa and the empush before he could object or question her she caught hold of his hand and held it for a long long moment by the time she released him his face had gone slack his eyes glazed give us our credeens she said crisply moving dreamily the empush fumbled in his pouch and drew out a handful of the metal tags she counted the proper number and tipped the rest into his hand put these away she waited until he pulled the drawstring tight give me the travel papers good youre going to forget all this arent you answer me good now you can go into the tower with your drunken men and get some sleep when you wake youll remember having some fun with a troupe of players but letting them go on their way after a while the usual thing you hear good never mind the men on the ground theyll wake when theyre ready go into the tower and crawl into bed thats right she watched tensely as he turned and stumbled into the tower stepping over his men without seeing them taguiloa raised a brow they dead just very tired take them a couple days to get back to their usual nastiness thought you wanted out with no trouble comes a time taga comes a time she gave him the travel permits and passed the credeens around as long as he really forgets taguiloa ducked under the shafts and got himself settled once more against the yoke linjijan looked mildly at him then away again hed ignored most of what had gone before looking at the guards with such calm surprise when they poked at him that they left off in disgust brann drew her hand across her sweaty dirty face grimaced at the streaks of mud on her palm its worked before in tavisteen well you wouldnt know about that lets get moving i feel naked standing around like this they were stopped at the utar end of the causeway but that empush was only interested in his bribe and let them pass without much difficulty he had a sour spiteful look but his men were out of sight perhaps even out of call and he wasnt going to start trouble not on utar with his commander a sneeze away they curved around the edge of the terraced mountain that took up the greater part of utar keeping to the broad way on the lowest level where the haughty temueng lordlings wouldnt have to look at them passed a third empushad of guards and were finally freed of hindrances rumbling along the causeway that linked utar to the mainland at the widows farm where theyd pastured the horses they transferred the gear and supplies from the cart to the gaudy boxwagon taguiloa had purchased from a disbanding troupe whose internal dissensions had reached the point of explosion in spite of their success on tour they left the tilt cart in the care of the widow and after a hasty meal started on the twoday journey through the coastal marshes taguiloa drove linjijan sat beside him coaxing songs out of his practice flute negomas rode on the roof with his smallest drum he liked it up there with the erratic wind pushing into his stiff springy hair and blowing debris away from him he played with the drum fitting his beat to linjijans wanderings or playing his own folk music singing in the clicking sonorous tongue of his fathers brann and harra rode ahead of the wagon harra on the gray gelding brann on the dun colt forcegrown by the children a wellmannered beast as long as she or one of the children were around and an illtempered demon when they werent brann was working on that but it would take time they rolled along the stone road raised on arches above the mud and water through the misty gloom of the wetlands into heavy stifling air that blew sluggishly off the water and along the raised road carrying with it clouds of biters the duns temper deteriorated until even brann had trouble controlling him even the placid cob grew restless and broke his steady plod as he twitched and snorted and shook his head vataraparastullakosakavilajusakh harra slapped at her neck wiggled her arms began whistling a high screeching monotonous air that seemed to gather the biters in a thick black cloud and blow them off into the gloom under the trees she kept it up for about twenty minutes then broke off coughed spat and took a long long drink from her waterskin negomas giggled and began beating a rapid ripple on his drum chanting up a wind that came from behind and blew steadily past them keeping them relatively clear of biters until they came up to the campsite the emperor kept cleared and maintained for travelers a large shed with wattle walls and a tile roof a stone floor tilted so rainwould run out and a stack of reasonably dry wood in a bin at one side it was very early in the trading season so everything was clean and all the supplies were topped off the steeping well was cleaned out with a new base of sand and charcoal the water in it fairly clean and clear there was a second shed for the wagon and stock this one with high stone walls and a heavy gate with loopholes in it where a spearman or bowman could hold off a crowd with yaril and jaril to stand guard it would take a wolf hardier than any of the loners living in the swamps to make off with their goods the next day they showed their credeens at the gates of hamardan the first of the river cities clear of the marshes and rode through the streets negomas playing a calling song on his drums linjijan making witcheries on his flute harra riding the gray with her knees and plucking cascades of cheerful noise from her daroud it wasnt market day but the bright noise of the music was pulling folk hina and temueng alike out of their houses and shops and drawing boisterous children after them they made a wide circle about the city and then in the center of the flurry theyd created they rolled trolled caracoled to the largest inn in hamardan it was a hollow square with few windows in the thick outside wall and a redtile roof with demonaverts scattered along the eaves a place where the richest merchant would feel safe with his goods locked in the inns fortress godons and he himself locked into the comfort and security of the inn proper this was early in the season few merchants traveling yet end of summer not yet harvest time no festivals coming up none in the recent past folk were ripe for anything that promised entertainment though they were players and low on anyones scale of respectability though half the troupe was foreign and worth even less than players still taguiloa knew the value of what he was bringing to the inn and made a point of assuming his welcome he drove the wagon into the central court and leaped down from the drivers seat with an easy flip landed lightly on the pavingstones to the applause of the swarming children bowed laughing to them then went to negotiate for rooms and the use of the court for a perfbrmance on the next night after the market shut down and the crowds it brought were still in town brann set up a small bright tent in the market and put negomas beating drums outside it jaril doing some tumbling and calling out to the passersby to come and hear past and future from a seer come from the ends of the earth to tell it though she carefully used nothing painful from the bits yaril gave to her she gave the maidens and matrons a good show and it was not long before word flew along the wind that the foreign woman was a wonder who could look into the heart and tell you your deepest secrets twice male seekers thought to take more than she wanted to givea woman alone a foreigner was fair game for the predatorybut a low growl from a very large brindle hound that came from the shadows behind the table was enough to discourage the most amorous and she got twice her fee from these men smiling fiercely at them and mentioning things they didnt want exposed and a calm threat to show to the world their poverty or stinginess whichever it might be they left growling of cheat and fake and fraud but no one bothered to listen that night the inn was jammed with people anyone who could come up with the price of entrycity folk and those from the farms and fisheries around the jamar and his household the poorest sat in thick clumps on the paving stones of the court the shopkeepers and their families packed the thirdfloor balcony the jamar and his family had the choice seats on the end section of the secondfloor balcony the side sections of that balcony given over to town officials and the jamarak temuengs the wagon was pushed against the inside end of the court its sides let down on sturdy props to make a flat stage triple the wagons width the bed and sides were covered by layers of cork the cork by a down quilt carefully tied so it wouldnt shift about the first balcony above the wagonstage was blocked off for the use of the players a ladder went from this to the wagon bed giving them two levels for performing it was a good crowd and a goodnatured one brann and harm took coin at the archway entrance to the court the inn servants escorted the balcony folk to the stairs and glared down street urchins who tried to sneak in for free the host stood on the second balcony watching all this with suppressed glee since he got a percentage of the take for allowing taguiloa to use his court there were very few clients in the inn and fewer expected for the rest of the month so it was no hardship to accommodate the players something taguiloa had counted on for hed made enough tours with gerontai to know the value of an innkeepers favor the noise in the court rose to a peak then hushed as the drums began to sound wild exotic music most of these folk had never heard before a little disturbing but it crawled into the blood until they were breathing with it on the secondfloor balcony taguiloa looked at brann ready he mouthed to her she nodded he put his hand on negomass shoulder the boy looked up smiled then changed the beat of his music lending to the throb of the drums a singing sonorous quality linjijan came in with his flute giving the music a more traditional feel blending mdarjin and hina in a way that was more comfortable for the listeners then the daroud added its metallic cadences and the crowd hushed sensing something about to happen taguiloa leaped onto the balcony rail and stood balanced there arms folded across his chest the soft glow of the lampions picking out the rich gold and silver couching of his embroidered robe people of hamardan the drum quieted to a soft mutter behind him flute and daroud went silent in the western lands beyond the edge of the world maidens dance with fire to please their king and calm their strange and hungry gods at great expense and effort i bring you fire as he gestured blue crimson and gold flames danced above the quilting yaril and jail spreading themselves thin and the maiden a loose white silk gown fluttering about her brann swung over the rail and went down the ladder in a controlled fall using hands and feet to check her plunge then she was in among the flames standing with hands raised above her head while she swayed and the flames swayed about her the drum went on alone for a while until the beat was so strong they who watched were trapped jo clayton in it then the flute came in and finally the daroud playing music from arth slya the betrothal dance when a maid announced to the world that she and her lifes companion had found each other a sinuous wheeling dance that showed off the suppleness of the body and the sensuality of the dancer in arth slya there were no flames the girl would dance with her lover brann danced it that night with what pleasure she could and more sadness than shed expected to feel danced it in memory of sammang schimli who had salvaged her pleasure in her body the flames vanished the music stopped the dance stopped brann stood very still in the center of the wagonstage breathing rapidly then flung out her arms and bowed to the audience she ran up the ladder and vanished into the shadows to a burst of whistles and applause the drum began again a quick insistent beat taguiloa leaped onto the railing people of hamardan see my dance he flung the broidered robe away with a gesture as impressive as it seemed careless for he capered high above the wagon and the courts rough stone on a rail the width of a small mans hand he wore a knitted bodysuit of white silk flexible as chainmail fitting like a second skin a wide crimson sash was tied about his waist its dangling ends swinging and flaring with the shifts of his body in that impossible dance behind him flute and drums blended in familiar music hina tunes though the drum sound was more sonorous and melodic than the flat tinny sound of tradition at first the flute sang in a traditional mode then changed as the dance changed beginning to tease and pull at the tunes harra tossed taguiloas shimmer spheres to him one by one they caught the light of the lampions and multiplied so it was as if a dozen tiny lamps were trapped in each crystal sphere shimmering crimson gold and silver as he put one two three and finally four into the air and kept them circling as he did a shuffle dance on that rail moving on the knife edge of disaster until he built an almost unbearable tension in the workers who gave a soft whisper of a sigh as he capered then tossed the spheres one by one into the darkness behind him the drum hushed the flute took up a twofaced tune it had two sets of words one set a childs counting rhyme the other a comically obscene version the rivermen used for rowing with that as background he did a fast sliding stumbling comic dance on that railing swaying precariously and constantly seeming about to fall from his perch each time he recovered with some extravagant bit of business that drew gasps of laughter from the crowd he ended that bit as secure it seemed on his narrow railing as his audience were on their paving stones with the flute laughing behind him he flung out his arms and bent his body in an extravagant bow the flute soared to a shriek he overbalanced to a concerted gasp from the watchers that changed to stomping shouting applause as he landed lightly on his feet and flipped immediately into a tumbling run above the flute drums daroud began to weave together a music that was part familiar and part a borrowing from three other cultures music that captured the senses and was all the stranger for the touch of familiarity in it taguiloa flung his body about in a dance that melded tumbling movement from a dozen cultures and his own fertile imagination the music and the mans twisting wheeling body wove a thing under the starshimmer and lampion glow that earth and sky had never seen before and when the movement ended when the music died and taguiloa stood panting there was for one moment a profound silence in the court then that was broken with whistles shouts stomping feet hands beating on sides thighs the backs of others and it went on and on a celebration of this new thing without a name that had taken them and shaken them out of themselves when they could get away from the exulting host and the mostly silent but leechlike attentions of the jamar and his jamika they met in the inns bathhouse steam rose and swirled about lamps burning perfumed oil casting ghost shadows on the wet tiles the condensation on the walls was bright and dark in random patterns like the beaded pattern on a snakeskin brann swam slowly through the hot water her changed black hair streaming in a fan about her shoulders yaril and jaril swam energetically about like pale fish half the time under the water bumping into the others sharing their soaring spirits negomas paddled after them almost as much at home in the water as they were his only handicap his need to breathe taguiloa lolled in the warm water his head in a resthollow his eyes half shuta dreamy smile twitching at his lips now and then he straightened his face but his enforced gravity always dissolved into a smile of sleepy satisfaction harm kicked lazily about her long dark brown hair kinking into tight curls about her pointed face the first time the troupe had gone from a long hard rehearsal into blackthorns bathhouse harra had been startled even shocked as the others stripped down to the skin and plunged with groans of pleasure into the water and let its heat leach away soreness from weary muscles communal bathing was an ancient hina custom one whose origins were somewhere in the mythtime before men learned to write a bathhouse was rigidly unstratified the one place where hina of all castes mingled freely the one place where the strictures of ordinary manners could be dropped and men and women could relax after the temueng conquest the bathhouses were suppressed for a few years temuengs seeing them as places of rampant immorality unable to believe that sexual contact between all those naked people was something that simply did not happen that anyone who broke the houses only rule would be thrown out immediately and ostracized as barbarian harms wagondwelling people lived much like those early ternuengs with little physical privacy and many rules to determine the behavior of both sexes rules born out of necessity and cramped quarters though her life had been different from that of the ordinary girlchild of the rukkanag she had no older brothers or sisters her mother died in childbirth when she was four and the infant girl died with her after that her mage father spent little time with his people traveling for months years apart from the clan taking harra with him absorbed in his studies absently assuming shed somehow learn the female strictures her mother would have taught her he treated her as much like a son as a daughter especially when she grew old enough for him to notice her quick intelligence though he did engage a maid to help her keep herself tidy and sew new clothing for her when she needed or wanted it he began teaching her his craft when she was eight training her in music and shaping the two things being close to the same thing for him and her they were much alike in their interests and very close he talked to her more often than not as if she were another magus of his own age and learning but there were times when he was shut up with his researches or visiting other mages in the many many cities they visited or stopping at one of the rude hermitages where nothing female was permitted then he settled her into one of the local homes she learned how to adapt herself quickly to local custom how to become immediately aware of the dangers to a young girl and how to protect herself from those while making such friends as she could to lessen her loneliness a bit sometimesthough this was rareher father stayed as long as two years in one place other times shed begin to take in the flavor of a city to learn its smells and sounds and other delights then hed be going again it was a strange sometimes troubling usually uncertain existence and the burden of maintaining their various households fell mainly on her slender shoulders once she reached her twelfth birthday but it was excellent preparation for survival when her father died between one breath and the next from an aneurism neither of them knew he had and it let her assess at a glance the proper manners in a bathhouse and overcome her early training unable to control her embarrassment she contrived to hide it stripped with the rest and got very quickly into water she found a lot too clear for her comfort she paddled about with her back turned to the others hoping the heat of the water would explain the redness in her face but ended relaxed and sighing with pleasure as the heat soothed her soreness now she was as much at ease as the others as she watched taguiloas smiles and savored her own delight rehearsals were one thing but putting on a finished performance with that storm of audience approvalwell it was no wonder he was still a little drunk with the pleasure of it she felt decidedly giddy and giggly herself it could get addicting she said aloud taguiloa opened one eye grinned at her the door to the bathhouse opened and several serving maids came in they set up a long table in one corner and covered it with trays of fingerfood several large stoneware teapots more wine jugs drinking bowls hot napkins the roundfaced old woman who supervised this bowed to taguiloa with the jamars compliments saimysaiir taguiloa lifted a heavy arm from the water the godalau bless his generosity the old woman bowed again saiim the host does not wish to intrude on your rest but he desires you to know that the jamar has requested you perform at his house the coming night taguiloa lay silent for a breath or two then finally said inform the host that we will be pleased to perform for the jamar provided we can arrange a suitable fee and proper quarters for ourselves and our horses the woman bowed a third time and left shooing the curious and excited maidservants before her taguiloa batted at the water and said nothing for a few moments then he sighed and rose to sit crosslegged on the tiles a fee is probably a lost cause im afraid well be lucky if we get a meal and shelter id hoped to get farther along betbre i ran into this sort of complication still it could be worth the irritation these temueng jamars keep in close touch by pigeon mail and courier so word of us will be passed on and reach andurya durat before we do he studied brann a long minute you will be careful ill try taga slya knows ill try harra got out of the water wrapped a toweling robe about her and went to inspect the food suddenly very hungry she poured some tea and began trying the different things set out on the trays come on all of you leave the heavy worrying for some other times this is heaven if youre as hungry as me the jamar was a big man even as tall as she was branns head came only to his middle ribs his shoulders were broad enough to make three hina his belly big and hard as a beer tun his legs tree trunks arms feet and hands built on a similar heroic scale he should have been ugly but wasnt he should have seemed fierce and intimidating as an angry storm dragon but didnt he gave them a mild beaming welcome hamardan house is honored by your presence he boomed taguiloa bowed we are the honored ones he murmured feeling a bit battered jamar hamardan escorted the troupe to the rooms within the house he had set aside for them something taguiloa hadnt expected nor had he expected the luxury of those rooms he didnt quite know how to deal with all this effusiveness it made him uneasy temuengs simply did not treat hina and foreigners like this the jamar hovered about them as they tried to settle themselves silent and diffident but impossible to ignore his bulging eyes slipped again and again to brann harra and the others again and again he licked his lips opened his mouth to speak shut it without saying anything taguiloa tried to edge him out the door and away from the troupe so he would say what was on his mind but he seemed impervious to hints and unlikely to respond well to being hustled out in spite of his apparent amiability taguiloa knew enough to be extremely wary at this moment though the tension of keeping up the required courtesies wracked his nerves he caught harras eye tungjii bless her quick wits she gathered the rest of the troupe and hustled them out of the room the yaril hound settled in the corner of the room her crystal eyes halfclosed but fixed on the temueng a powerful defender if there was trouble jamar hamardan waited while the room emptied out completely listening absently as taguiloa continued his inane chatter abruptly the huge temueng cleared his throat shutting off taguiloa in midsentence how many days can you stay here he fumbled for some way to address the player he wouldnt use the hina saх though he obviously wished to be polite and he wouldnt give the player any temueng honorificno temueng could do that and keep his selfrespect he avoided the difficulty by falling silent and waiting with twitchy impatience for taguiloas answer ah taguiloa scrambled for some way to escape what he saw coming ahh jamar hamardan saх jura we have to be in durat before the stormsblow down from the high plains he was deferential but determined used his most careful formal speech and hoped for the best if this temueng decided he wanted his own troupe of entertainers there was almost nothing they could do running meant giving up everything and he wouldnt do that as long as there was the smallest chance he could work himself free stay here the jamar said you wont lose by it a generous offer jamar hamardan saх jura taguiloa spoke slowly still hunting for a way out if i may we need more than a place to keep the rain off and food in our bellies he risked the touch of commonspeech after a sidelong glance at the temueng we are at our best this year saх jura if i may we have dreams but that is nothing to you saх jura i waste your time with my babbling your pardon saх jura he lowered his eyes bowed his head and waited the temueng cleared his throat no no he said no bother silence taguiloa glanced quickly at the temueng the big man looked troubled he turned his head suddenly caught taguiloa watching him one week he said my jamika grieves he halfswallowed the words our eldest son is with the forces in croaldhu our youngest was called to andurya durat he looked past taguiloa as if he no longer was aware of him he is her heart the breath in her throat a good lad for all that rides like hes part of his horse openhanded with his friends spirited and impatient maybe a little heedless but hes young he cleared his throat again you again he searched for a word but settled for the slightly derogatory term used by temuengs for hina females your ketchin they should keep the jam ika distracted she was pleased by you last night she smiled when you did that thing on the rail and the rest of it well she slept without he broke off frowned give her some time away from grieving showman and you can ask what you will taguiloa looked away from the huge man stumbling over his love for his cow of a wife and for that calf who sounded like most young male temuengs arrogant thoughtless and as unpleasant to his own kind as he was to those who had the misfortune to be in his power never mind that he told himself a weeks better than i hoped he swept into a low bow of your kindness saх jura certainly a week the jamar hamardan turned to leave turned back one of the ketchin shes a seer one can sometimes see past a day past a night saх jura my jamika will ask the ketcha to read for her i do not inquire how the ketcha reads or if she knows more than how to judge a face whether she lies or speaks what truth she sees i do not care showman tell your seer to make my jamika contented do you hear me i hear you saх jura the jamar hesitated another minute in the doorway then stumped out taguiloa stood rubbing at the back of his neck with fingers that trembled relief apprehension anger churned in him a week and who said it would end then one week then another then another it had to end there had to he touched the shoulder where hed felt his doublenatured patron riding and wondered if this was one of tungjiis dubious gifts he scanned his immediate past to see where hed forgot and invoked his god nothing but ordinary chaos and the usual curses quickly forgotten he forced himself to relax and went searching for the others to tell them what had happened taguiloa pulled on a knitted black silk body suit like the white one he used in his act then he slipped from his room and began his nightly prowl about the jarnars house listening for whatever he could pick up driven as much by survival needs as by curiosity the week was winding to a finish the testing of jamar hamardans good will was closer he might let them go or he could insist they stay yet another short while and then another nibbling their time away never letting them go he moved through the maze of halls in the wing where the troupe was housed heading to the storage alcove hed found the first night hed prowled the house a pair of late rambling servants forced him to duck into the shadowy doorless recess only to discover they were bound for that same alcove he cursed the libidinous pair and searched for some place to hide they probably wouldnt raise a row if they saw him just take off to find another place to scratch their itch but thered be gossip later that would work around to someone in authority and make trouble for the troupe there were narrow shelves set from the bottom of one wall he went up them and tried to fold himself into invisibility the shelves were far too narrow for that but over him he saw a recessed square in the ceiling of the closet he pushed against one side of the square and it tipped silently upward he was through the opening and easing the trap into place as the pair came in whispering laughing afraid to move he listened to the sounds coming from below but after a few moments of creeping boredom and stiffening limbs he eased into a squat and looked about him enough of the wounded moons light came through airholes in the eaves to show him a maze of beams with ceiling boards between them the roof was high over the place where he crouched slanting steeply to the eaves it was just like a temueng to waste such a vast cavernous space on dust and squirrels spiders and mice the place was filled with noises once he let himself listen gnawing the patter of clawed feet chittering from squirrels shrieks from mice as housecats stalked and killed them yowls as the cats fought and mated his fears of being heard faded he got to his feet oriented himself and began prowling along the beams listening for voices in the rooms below in the days since that first prowl hed picked up enough to make him increasingly uneasy now he went swiftly along the ceiling beams heading for the jamars quarters without stopping at his other posts the office silent now he spent a moment standing over the crack that funnelled sound up from below last night hamardan was there talking with his overseer one of his uncles a shrewd old man whod lost all but the youngest of his grandsons to the army they were discussing the increase in the emperors portion of the harvest speculating cautiously about what it meant both men notsaying far more than they put in words their silences saying much more than those words about their curiosity and unease about what was going on in andurya durat the old man had a letter from one of his grandsons anouncing the death of another of them the others were well enough but not especially pleased with their lot the letter included news about the jamars eldest son he was alive unhurt but bored with life despising the croaldhese loathing the food the smells the women everything about that cursed island including very much between the lines his fellow officers and the men he commanded neither the jamar nor his uncle had any idea why the emperor had suddenly decided to start sending his armies out to conquer the world for two hundred years the temueng emperors had been content with the rich land of tigarezun they didnt like it tigarezun was important to them they didnt consider the hina had any connection with it it was theirs their ancestors bones were buried in that soil hina burned their dead the heedless creatures how could they have any right to land if they didnt claim and consecrate it with ancestral flesh and bone but this coveting of foreign lands was foolishness especially an island over a weeks sail away especially any island temuengs did not like sea travel and felt uneasy on a bit of land that you could ride side to side in a day or two and this warring was taking and wasting their sons the two men spent an hour yesternight grousing and speculating about the emperors mental state hed just taken a new young wife maybe he was a crazy old man trying to feel young again taguiloa padded along the beams checking out the rooms in the private quarter of the big house day room bathroom conservatory and so on only silenceuntil he reached the jamars bedroom wife weeping husband trying to comfort her sobs diminishing after a while silence for a few breaths heavy steps quicker lighter ones noise of complaining chair the continued patter of the womans feet as she paced restlessly about taguiloa stretched out on the beam and prepared to wait she says empis enjoying himself in durat hes got a new horse and hasnt lost too much money at gaming and has a chance to catch the eye of someone important at court the woman stopped walking sighed its what he wanted tjena i know but i miss him so ingklio steps couch creaking why dont we go to the capital for the winter too much to do and the ulardrah have been raiding close by you know what happened last month to the tjatajan jamarak house burned granaries looted what the drah couldnt carry off they fouled uncle perkerdj could see our land safe hamardan grunted not this year he said with a heavy finality that silenced the jamika more creaking as she got back on her feet and started dragging about again making querulous comments about her maidservants and their defects the insults from some of the cousins and kinwives the disrespect of one of the male servants the jamar said nothing perhaps he didnt bother listening to her being so familiar with her diatribes they were like the winds blowing past a part of the sounds of the day no one notices taguiloa lay on his beam halfasleep telling himself he might as well leave them to their wellworn grooves because the last four nights this byplay had ended in their going to bed he yawned and grinned into the darkness had to be one monster of a bed and a sturdy one at that the jamika was built to match the jamar massive arms and thighs breasts like muskmelons only a head shorter than him maybe thats why he never took a second wife shes the only woman in the world big enough he wouldnt crush her with that weight or look absurd standing beside her an oliphaunt mated with a gazelle the thought wiped away his amusement if that was true the jamar would do just about anything to keep his wife content he certainly had no concubines and was awkward around brann and harra seeming almost frightened of normal sized women taguiloa nearly forgot himself and swore at old tungjii he held back bad enough to be in this bind without irritating the unpredictable tungjii hisser favors were bad enough but hissers curses were hell on dragonback he bruised his nose against the splintery beam and promised tungjii a dozen incense sticks when he got back to silili what about the players hamardan said suddenly shall i let them go or would you like to keep them taguiloa bit down hard on his lip sucked in a long breath oh ingklio would you keep them that one comforts me so shes a true seer i know it shes told me things no one else well things and if shes here she can keep telling me what empis doing he never writes heavy creaking again as she flung herself down beside harardan just think our own players can we afford it hina and foreigners how much can they cost fuming taguiloa listened as the discussion below him altered to an oliphauntine cooing enough of this listen to them much longer and ill be sick he got to his feet and ran the beams to the distant trap let himself down and loped along the dark quiet hall to his bedroom he stripped off the black bodysuit sponged away sweat and dust wrapped a soft old robe about himself and went down the hall to rap at branns door she let him in after a brief wait the lamps were still lit jaril and yaril sat crosslegged on the bed their small faces serious their crystal eyes reflecting light from the lamps jaril thought youd be along soon brann said she sat on the bed beside yard bad news it wasnt a question were a little gift hes wrapping up for his wife taguiloa said youve been a bit too convincing that great cow wants daily news of her wretched calf she said a few words in a language he did not know but they needed no translation as they crackled through the air and shes charmed with the idea of having her own company of players something to raise her status with the neighbors she was a little worried about the cost but he wasnt were only hina and a few foreigners how much could scum like that cost throw a little food at us a jar or two of wine and were bought mmm yaril fetch harra weve got to talk dont frighten her but let her know its urgent she looked thoughtfully at taguiloa we wont bother waking linji and negomas she looked at the door harra knows a lot more about things like this than i do she blinked uncertainly theres so much a tap on the door taguiloa got up let harra in resumed his seat on the bench were about to be offered a permanent home he said right here harra wrinkled her nose at brann i told you to tone those sessions down easy for you to say not so easy for me to do you didnt have that cow hanging over you sucking every word you said she sighed i know i got a little carried away but i have to tell you my behavior doesnt make much difference the jamika wants to believe in me and she twists everything i say into something she wants to hear even if i dont say a word she interprets the way i breathe she moved impatiently the bed squeaking tinder her anything helpful in what your father taught you well he wasnt very organized about anything besides his own studies just taught me whatever interested him at the time mmmm harm frowned at the wall sorting through the inside of her head suddenly she grinned i have it theres an herb and a spell that will set a geas on that man thing is one cant work without the other ive got a pinch or two of lixsil in my fathers herb bag but it doesnt need much the maid that brings my meals chatters a lot she tells me hamardan eats his breakfast alone in his private garden when the weathers good she says hes a sorefoot bear mornings and no one stays around him if they can help it the weathers going to be dry and sunny the next three days negomas swears he knows and i think i believe him so you see where im heading one of the changechildren drops the lixsil in his tea i dont have to be that close i can lay the spell on him when were with the jamika brann you handled those guards on the causeway can you do the same with her shes bound to kick up the kind of fuss we dont want when we roll out mmm brann looked wistful i wish i had magic what i do best is kill people and awful as she is tjena doesnt deserve killing her eyes shifted from taguiloa to harra and back then she moved her shoulders and visibly pulled herself together i can drain her so shes tottery and suggestible then tell her that what she does the next few days will affect her son ill have to think about it some more she smiled and relaxed yawned anybody got anything to add well lets get some sleep hina servants set out the table and covered it with a huge stoneware teapot and a drinking bowl a mountain of sweetrolls a bowl of pickled vegetables a platter of sausages and deepfried chicken bits a bowl of sweetened fruit slices citrons and peaches apricots and berries a platter of fried rice with eggs mixed in as soon as the meal was set out the servants left moving with an alacrity that underlined harras maids report of hamardans morning moods when the garden was empty a small grayplush monkey dropped from one of the trees and scurried to the table he leaped up on it and picked through the dishes lifted the lid of the teapot and shook a bit of paper over the tea he peered into the pot and watched the gray bits of herb circling on the steaming water the bits turned translucent and sank he put the lid back on and scampered away diving into the bushes just as hamardan stomped out glared at the sky then stumped to the table pushed back the sleeves of his robe splashed out a bowlful of tea and gulped it down the small gray monkey showed his teeth in a predators grin then blurred into a long serpent and began slithering through a hole in the wall jaril slipped into the room where harra was playing a muted accompaniment as brann chatted with the jamika about her children listening more than she spoke he squatted beside harm hes guzzling it down he whispered harra nodded she began simplifying the music until her fingers wandered idly over the darouds strings she closed her eyes and began a soft whistling that twisted round and round and incorporated the play of her fingers an intense look of concentration on her face she wove the spell the magic in it itching at jaril it made his outlines shiver and blur and started eddies in his substance that acted on him like a powerful euphoric her cold nose nudged at his hand yaril as hound bitch had crawled over to him and was pressing against him quivering a little her outlines shimmering the same eddies in her substance she was as uncertain as he about this feeling as a longterm experience but she was enjoying the sensation being a measure more hedonistic than her brother willing to live in the pleasures of the moment while he tended to fuss more about abstracts and whatwillbe than whatwas in the point present harra stopped whistling its done she murmured go back to him and whisper what you want in his ear jaril jumped to his feet and went out brann turned to watch him go missing something the jamika was saying when the querulous voice snapped a reprimand at her she swung back slowly and sat staring at the temueng woman her back very straight waiting in silence until tjena ran down if youre finished she said with an icy hauteur that quelled the woman then she looked down at her own palms we are at a change time she said bringing each word out slowly heavily as if she dropped overripe plums on the table and watched them mash when she heard herself she lightened up a bit reminding herself that the woman might be thick but she wasnt totally stupid forces converge she said weaving strange patterns it is a time to walk warily every act will resonate far beyond the point of action it is time that those tied to you experience a like courtesy give me your hands she held the jamikas larger hands between her own tilted her head back closed her eyes the change is begun she said the threads are spun out and out fine threads wound about one about and about the links are made son to mother mother to son what the mother does to those about her will be done unto the son as she chanted the nonsense in a soft compelling voice she tapped into the temueng womans life force draining her slowly carefully until the woman was in a deeply suggestible daze softly softly brann whispered anything you do to us will be done to you prison us here and your son will be a prisoner send bad report about us to the other jamars and jamikas and your son will suffer slander hurt us in any way and you hurt your son hear me tjena hamardan jamika you will not remember my words but you will feel them in your soul any harm you do to us that same harm will come to your son hear my blessing tjena hamardan jamika the benign side of the change coin what good you do to man and maid in your power hina temueng or other that good will bless you and your son praise will perfume his days and nights good will come to you in proportion to the good you give a quiet soul a contented life sweet sleep at night and harmony by day hear me tjena hamardan jamika forget my words but feel them in your soul forget my words but find contentment in your life forget my words she set the jamikas hands on the table and heard a soft unassertive whistle die behind her and knew hana had reinforced her words with one of her whistle spells sleep now tjena hamardan jamika sleep now and wake to goodness at your high noon tea lie back on your couch and sleep wake with the nooning knowing what you must do sleep sleep sleep with harras help she straightened out the huge woman on the daycouch smoothing out her robes and crossing her large but shapely hands below her breasts smoothing her hair fixing her so she would wake with as few as possible of those debilitating irritations that came from sleeping in day clothing brann frowned at her a moment then trickled some of the life back in her doing it carefully enough she didnt disturb her sleep she moved away from the couch going to the door of the sitting room several maids were in the smaller room beyond talking in whispers working on embroideries and repairs while they waited to be summoned she beckoned to the senior maidservant showed her the sleeping form of the jamika your mistress will sleep until time for tea her night was disturbed and she was fretful an older hina woman with a weary meekness from years of hectoring the maids mouth pinched into a thin line she knew all too well what fretfulness in the jamika meant for her and the other maids brann smiled at her if she finishes her sleep without being disturbed the jamika will wake in a sweeter temper and make your life easier for a while at least until the moon turns again the maid nodded understanding what was not said godalaus blessing on you if it be so sator she murmired then went quickly away from brann appreciative but uneasy with the strangers powers brann harra and the yarilhound went back to their rooms to pack having done everything they could to ensure good report and an uneventful departure on the morrow they rumbled from the house early the next morning leaving behind much good feeling among the hina servants and a pair of contented but rather confused temuengs linjijan whod grown restless and unhappy closed within those walls was delighted to stretch his spirit and bodylong thin legs propped up on the splashboard neck propped on his blanket roll he played his flute the music ebullient and joyfilled waking little devils in the horses whod also grown bored in their sumptuous stables and were inclined to work off their excess energy in bursts of mischievous behavior branns dun shied at his own shadow kicked up his heels tried to rear and gave his rider some energetic moments until she managed to settle him down a little when they passed from sight of the house she let him run a short while but pulled him back to an easy canter before he could blow himself and tire her more harra laughed and let her gray dance a bit then quieted him and added the plink of her daroud to the wanderings of the flute and the dark music negomas was stroking from his smallest drum at midday they reached hamardan again and stopped at the inn for a hearty lunch with hot tea and pleas from the host to play again that night anxious to make up time taguiloa shook his head to that but promised to stop there when the troupe returned to silili certainly tunjii rode taguiloas shoulder those next four weeks as they followed the river road north the weather was perfect for traveling and for outdoor performances in villages without an inn they played to cheering crowds in the market square and more than once spent several nights in a jamars house though there was no more trouble about leaving when they pleased word flew ahead of them it seemed that every village and inland city was waiting and ready for them folk swarming about the show wagon following in shouting cheerful crowds as they drove through city streets or village lanes the hiding places in the carts bottom grew heavy with coin and the mood of temueng and hina alike was as genially golden as the weather whether it was his timing the long summer having worked up a mighty thirst in them for diversion whether it was the strong leavening of ternuengs in each audience for whatever reason the troupe met little of the resistance taguiloa had expected to the strange and sometimes difficult music and the improvisational and wholly nontraditional dance and tumbling he was introducing he began to worry they were a tempting target for the ulardrah the hillwolves through whose territory they would have to pass a small party of players coming of a phenomenally successful tour fat with gold on their own no soldiers two of them women two of them children only the dog to worry about and they wouldnt worry that much about her he could hope tungjii would stick around but he knew only too well the fickleness of his patron and the quicksilver quality of such fortune as that they bathed in these golden glowing days these warm dry silver nights they left the city kamanarcha early in a bright cool morning there was a touch of frost on the earth glittering in the long slant of the morning light the guard at the city gate was yawning and stiff more than half asleep as he operated the windlass that opened the gate taguiloa tossed him a small silver and got a shouted blessing from him along with a hearty request to come back soon as an afterthought the guard added watch out for the drah showman word is theyre prowling on top of the wagons roof negomas grinned and rattled his drum defiantly linjijan was stretched out more than half asleep lost in the dreams he never spoke aloud of them all hed changed the least during the tour no closer now to the others than hed been before an amiable companion who did everything he was asked to do without skimping or complaint and nothing at all he was not asked to do he was no burden and no help irritating each of the others in turn until they learned to accept him as he was for he certainly wasnt going to change his flute was a blessing and a joy that had to be enough negomas and harra were much together studying each others bits of magic as taguiloa had taken dance and tumbling and juggling and melded them into an exciting whole had brought harra and negomas and linjijan together and almost coerced them into producing the musical equivalent of his dance so these orphan children of different traditions were blending their knowledge to make an odd effective magic that belonged only to them and magnified their own power the whole they made being greatly more than either apart brann was as isolated from the others as linjijan though more aware of it she was simply too different now from human folk and her purposes were too much apart from theirs she was fascinated by the illusions harra and negomas created for their own entertainment and by the intimate connection magic had with music as if the patterning of sounds by drum daroud and harras whistling somehow patterned the invisible in ways that allowed the boy and the young woman to control and manipulate it after leaving hamardan brann had tried to learn from harra but she could not it was as if she were tonedeaf and trying to learn to sing there was something in her or about her that would not tolerate magic hana found this fascinating and tried a number of experiments and found that any spells or even unshaped power that she aimed at brann was simply shunted aside magic would not touch her refused to abide near her harra and negomas both could do whatever they wanted in her presence as long as whatever they did wasnt aimed at her she wasnt a quencher therefore not a sink where magic entered and was lost she simply wasnt present to it at least not any longer she told harra about the marish shaman whod netted her and the changechildren so neatly harra decided eventually that this had somehow immunized her and the children against any further vulnerability brann listened sighed nodded slyas work she said she doesnt want me controlled by anyone but her the countryside was brown and turning stubbly the harvest coming in the pastures were taking on a yellow look with sparse patches where little grass grew and fewer weeds they were coming to the barrens where the soil was hard and cracked laced with salt and alkali so that only the hardiest plants grew there and those only sparsely even along the river where there was plenty of water there was little vegetation and the trees had a stunted look for some hours they passed long straight lines of panja brush lowgrowing bushes with smooth hard purplish bark crooked branches and little round leaves hard as boiled leather these lines were windbreaks against the winter storms that swept down off the northern plains those flat gray grasslands that spawned the temuengs they left the last of the windbreaks behind a little after noon and were out of the kamanarcha jamarak and into the barrens the road began to rise and the trees thinned and fell away there was a little yellowish grass on the slopes but it didnt look healthy the river sank farther below them into the great gorge that cut through the matigunns the road followed the lip of the gorge and the towpath continued far below them the stone pilings that marked the edge of the canal jutting like gray fingers from cold pure water glinting bluer than blue in the late summer sun the canal was part of the river here the stone of the mountain heart too stubbornly resistant for anything else the towpath was a massive project in itself old tales said it was burned out of the stone by dragons breath in the mythtime before popokanjo shot the moon there were no barges on the river yet floating down or being towed up in a few weeks when the harvest up and down the river was complete the trading season would begin and the huge imperial dapplegrays that towed the barges from hamardan to lake biraryry would be plodding northward in teams of eight or ten escorted by the emperors horse guards the dapples were bred and reared only in imperial stables anyone else found with one would be fed to them piece by piece because the dapples ate flesh as well as corn human flesh by choice though theyd make do with dog or cow or the flesh of other horses if there was no one in the emperors prisons healthy enough to be fed to them the tow master for each team was raised with them from their foaling he slept with them ate with them arranged their matings tended them in every way shod them plaited mane and tail washed and combed the feathering at their hocks polished their hooves repaired their harness kept it oiled and shining he did all that from pride and affection for his charges and also because theyd kill and eat anyone else who tried to come near theth even the fiercest of the ulardrah bands left them alone barge travel was safebut very expensive high overhead a mountain eagle soared in wide graceful loops yaril keeping watch over the road and the surrounding hills shed spot any ambushes long before they ripened into danger hana and taguiloa were joking together both of them relaxed and unworried for the moment yarils presence was a guarantee that there was no present danger to the troupe brann rode ahead of the wagon brooding over a problem that was becoming increasingly urgent the children were hungry the performing used up their strength far faster than shed expected shed walked the alleys of silili for a fortnight taking the life force of every man who came after her intending to steal or rape or both feeding the children until they were so sated they couldnt take another draft of that energy they needed for their strange life storing more of the stolen life in her own body until her flesh glowed with it since then shed fed them from herself and from what animal life she could trap dogs and cats that roamed the streets of the cities and villages they played in careful to take no human life she didnt want anyone connecting mysterious deaths with the troupe she cursed the hamardan jamar he was the source of the trouble now if it hadnt been for him theyd have reached andurya durat already the drain from the dregs of the city a day or two more and shed have to go hunting anything she could find in these barren mountains wolves twolegged or otherwise deer wildcats anything the children could run to her the children were patient but need would begin to drive them and they would drive her by nightfall they were deep in the barrens yaril had found one of the corrals the dapples used when they walked the road to hamardan returning to pick up another barge it was a stone circle with a heavy plank gate and threesided stalls locked grain bins and a stone watering trough at the roadside there was a tripod of huge beams that jutted out over the river a bucket and a coil of rope thered be no problem about bringing water up for them and for the horses they set up their night camp inside the circle filled the trough with water emptied half a sack of grain in the manger they didnt touch the grain bins though the children could have opened them that was dapple food and theyd be stealing directly from the emperor not a good idea the night promised to be cold and drear though tungjii was still hanging about since the sky was clear and no rain threatened the children went prowling about the hills and came back with lumps of coal for a fire reporting a surface seam about a mile back from the road leaving brann and the children to watch over the camp taguiloa linjijan and harra took empty feed sacks and fetched back as much as they could carry more of tungjiis blessing taguiloa thought for there was no wood to make a fine and wouldnt be as long as they were in the barrens and the nights were not going to get warmer leaving hana and taguiloa making a stew from the store of dried meat and vegetables arguing cheerfully over proportions and how much rice to put in the other pot negomas and linjijan rubbing down the horses and going over them with stiff brushes combing out manes and tails cleaning their hooves brann went with the children to stand beside the tripod where they couldnt be seen from those inside the corral she held out her hands and the children pulled life from her she could feel them struggling to control the need that grew each night and she suffered with them when they broke from her she sighed you want to go hunting tonight yaril kicked a pebble over the edge and watched it leap down the nearly vertical cliff and plop into the water might not have to ulardrah uhhuh a mans been watching us since late afternoon wheres he now gone he left before we found the coal left as soon as it was obvious we were settling for the night ah you could be right yaril nodded her silvergilt hair shining in the light of the wounded moon she giggled our meat coming to us how soon do you think not before they think everyones asleep they think well be trapped inside that she nodded her head at the corral i say we turn the trap on them she looked at jaril he nodded me out at longscout nightowling it jaro staying with you to carry reports what about numbers i think four or five of them is all right were sure hungry enough to handle them ten or more wed better scare off we could cut some out two or three maybe hamstring them so they cant run what do you think bramble brann felt a twinge of distaste but that didnt last long the ulardrah were a particularly unpleasant bunch with no pretensions to virtue of any sort the best of them with the gentle charm of cannibal sharks she nodded at the corral tell them i vote no yaril said jaril nodded let em sleep theyll just get in the way brann sighed then she smiled just us again her smile broadened into a grin look out you wolves jaril looked up six of em on their way he blurred into a wolf form and went trotting into the dark brann pulled her fingers through her hair the black stripping away until it was white again blowing wildly in the strong cold wind she pulled off her tunic tossed it to the ground beside the stone wall stepped out of her trousers kicked them onto the tunic the air was very cold against her skin but shed learned enough from the children to suck a surprising amount of warmth from the stone under her feet and bring it flowing up through her body comfortable again she still hesitated then she heard the yipping of the wolf and set off in that dii action running easily through the darkness her eyes adapting to the dark as her body had adapted to the cold she reached a small steep walled bowl with the meander of a dry stream through the middle of it a few tufts of withered grass and a number of large boulders rolled from the slopes above the bowl a horned owl came fluttering down transforming as it touched the earth into yaril you might as well wait here theyre a couple breaths behind me then she was a large gray wolf vanishing among the boulders brann looked about shrugged and settled herself on a convenient boulder crossed her legs rested her hands on her thighs and cultivated a casual relaxed attitude the ulardrah came out of the dark a lean hairy man walking with the wary lightness of a hunting cat the rest of the drah were shadows behind him lingering among the boulders he stopped in front of her what you playing at she got slowly to her feet moving with a swaying dance lift smiled at him and took a step toward him he looked uncertain but held his ground she reached toward him he caught her arm in a hard grip what you think you doin woman hunting a real man she crooned to him she stroked her fingers along his hard sinewy arm then flattened her hand out on his bare flesh and sucked the life out of him as he fell she leaped back wrenching her arm free in the boulders a man screamed others came rushing at her knives and swords in hand she danced and dodged felt a burn against her thigh as a sword sliced shallowly slapped her hand against the first bit of bare flesh she could reach pulled the life out of that one more pain she avoided some of the edges took a knife in the side touched and killed touched and killed twin silver wolves slashed at legs bringing some of the men down blurring as steel flashed through them wolves again as swiftly three men drained two men down crawling away touch and drain man on one leg lunging at her knife searing into her side touch and drain touch and drain all six dead gritting her teeth against the pain she jerked the knife free and tossed it away the wound healing before the knife struck stone and went bounding off she straightened felt the tingle of the life filling her the wolves changed yaril and jaril stood before her held out pale translucent hands they had expended themselves recklessly in this chase and the drain of it had brought them dangerously close to quenching she held out her hands let the stolen life flow out of her into them smiling with pleasure as the mountains children firmed up and lost their pallor when the feeding was complete she looked around at the scattered bodies felt sick again ive saved slya knows how many lives by taking theirs she shook her head the sickness in her stomach undiminished shivering she strode back to the stone circle yaril and jaril trotting beside her looking plumper and contented with the world she pulled her hands back over her hair darkening the shining silver to an equally shining black she stepped back into the trousers pulled the laces tight and tied them off wriggled into the tunic and smoothed it down suddenly exhausted she leaned against the stone wall im going to sleep like someone hit me over the head any chance well get more visitors not for a while yaril said i didnt see any more bands close enough to reach us before morning but ill have another look to make sure brann nodded and stood watching as two large owls took heavily to the air she watched them vanish into the darkness hating them that moment for what theyd done to her for what they made her do a lifetime of draining men to feed them and slya knew what that word lifetime meant when it applied to her the flareup died almost as quickly as it arose there was no point in hating the children theyd followed nature and need and as for living with the consequences of that need well shed learned a lot the past months about how malleable the human body and spirit was and how strong her own willtolive was like the children shed do what she had to and try to minimize the damage to her soul like them too she was in the grip of the god swept along by slyas will struggling to maintain what control she could over her actions she followed the high stone wall around to the gate and went in taguiloa sat by the fire breaking up chunks of coal with the hilt of his knife throwing the bits in lazy arcs to land amid the flames he looked up as she came into the light then went back to what he was doing she hesitated then walked across to stand beside him how many of them he said six how did you know figured got them all yes he tossed a handful of black bits at the fire wiped his hand on the stone flagging after a moment he said the three of you were looking washed out we wouldnt hurt you or any of the others hurt i wonder what you mean by that he began chunking the hilt against another lump of coal not looking at her what happens when we get to durat i dont know how could i my father my brothers my folk i have to find them and break them loose you knew that before you took up with me i dont want to have to choose between you and the others and my people taga keep you clear if i can ill leave you once we get to durat ill change the way i look she shrugged what more can i do you knew it was a gamble when you agreed to bring me to durat you know what i was you want to back out now you could destroy me yes make it impossible for me to work where there are tem uengs yes you knew that in silili yes you know us now were friends if not friends then colleagues and still if you have to youll destroy us yes all right as long as its clear he smiled suddenly a wry selfmocking twist of his lips youre right i gambled and i knew it your gold to finance a tour and a chance for the emperors sigil against the chance youd get us chopped he touched his shoulder tungjiis tough on fainthearts i go on as for your leaving us could cause more talk than if you stayed youre part of the troupe the duratteese are waiting to see until we perform at the emperors court if we ever do youre part of the troupe remember that and be careful she lifted her hands looked at them let them fall as careful as im let taga branns ouestandurya durat the rescue and attendant wonders taguiloa stopped the wagon at the top of a stiff grade sat looking down a winding road to the oasis of andurya durat dry brown barren mountains ancient earths bones sucked clean of life and left to wither two files of them blocking east and west winds funnelling south the ice winds of the northern plains andurya durat doubly green and fecund when set against those mountains steamy damp dark green lush born from the hot springs at the roots of cynamacamal the highest of the hills its angular symmetry hidden by a belt of clouds its conepeak visible this day splashed thick with bluewhite snow absently stroking and patting the neck of her fractious mount brann stared at the mountain feeling immensely and irrationally cheered it was a barebones replica of tincreal she felt the presence of slya warm and comforting she would win her people free she didnt know how yet but that was only a detail taguiloa watched her gaze at the mountain and wondered what she saw to make her smile like that with a gentleness and quiet happiness he hadnt seen in her before he turned back to the road frowned down at the dark blotch on the shores of the glittering lake sucked in a breath and put his foot on the brake as he slapped the reins on the cobs back starting him down the long steep slope wishing he could put a brake on brann godalau grant she didnt run wild through those temuengs down there andurya durat stuffed with temuengs of all ranks glittering white marble meslaks like uneven teeth built on the shores of the largest lake snuggling close to the monumental pile still unfinished that housed the emperor and his servants varisized compounds where the meslar overlords lived and drew taxes from the jamars in the south the basshar nomad chiefs in the north along the rivers and on the banks of the cluster of smaller lakes there were inns and guesthouses that held jamars from the south come up to seek an audience from the emperor so they could boast of it to their neighbors to seek legal judgments from the high magistrate come up to the capital for a thousand other reasons and there were tent grounds and corrals that held the basshars and their horse breeders down from the grass with pampered pets from their tents to sell for imperial gold with herds of kounax for butchering with leatherwork with cloth woven from the long strong kounax hair with yarn rope glues carved bones and other products of the nomad life scattered among the farms that fed the city were riding grounds for the horse and mallet games played with bloody kounax heads a noisy brutal cherished reminder of the old days when the durat temuengs were nomad herders on the sea of grass ambling behind their blatting herds fighting little wars over water and wood times the old men among the meslars spoke of with nostalgia celebrating the ancient strengths of the people times even the most fervid of these celebrators hadnt the slightest inclination to recreate for themselves there was another andurya durat tucked away behind massive walls the strangers quarter a vigorous vulgar swarm of nonternuengs shipmasters and merchants from the winds four quarters drawn to the wealth of the ancient kingdom players of many sorts hoping for an imperial summons and the right to display the imperial sigil artisans of all persuasions many of them working under contract to build and maintain the gilded glory of the vast city outside the walls inn and tavern keepers farmers mostly bina in from the local farms with meat and produce scribes poets painters mages and priests beggars thieves whores and children herds and hordes of children filling every crack and corner winding streets crowded multistoried tenements with shops on the ground floor and a maze of rooms above taverns godons the market strip all these existing in barely contained confusion and nonstop noise shouts quarrels music clashing with music raucous songs barrowmen and women shouting their wares yammer of gulls bubbling coos from pigeons twitters and snatches of song from sparrins and chevinks harsh caws from assorted scavengerbirds screams from falcons soaring high like headsmens doublebitted axes sharpedged and cleanly in their flight taguiloa inserted himself and his company into this noisy multicolor polyglot community just one more bit of brightness in a harlequinade as subtle and as blatant as frostdyed leaves in a whirlwind taking his troupe to the inn where he and gerontai stayed the time they came seeking to perform for the emperor papa jao sat outside his inn on a throne of sorts raised higher than a temuengs head his platform built of broken brick rubble arranged at random set in a mortar of his own making that hardened and darkened with the years so the stages of the thrones rise were as clearly evident as the rings on a clamshell on top of the pillar hed built himself a chair with arms and a back and covered it with ancient leather pillows it was his boast that he never forgot a face something likely true because he wrapped his hands around the chair arms leaned out and cried taga come to make your fortune you know it papa jao hows it going sour and slim taga sour and slim bright black eyes moved with a neverdying curiosity over the wagon and the rest of the troupe ah ah he chortled its you been tickling gold out of jamar purses the chortle fruited into a wheezy laughter that shook every loose flap of flesh inside and outside his clothing he was a pearshaped little man with a pearshaped head heavy jowls a fringe of spiky white hair he drew back and tied in a tail as wild as a mountain ponys brush after itd been chased through a stand of stoneburrs how many rooms you want four yah we got em second floor good rooms a silver a week each right with you well well rumor say truth for once he leaned round yelled jassi jassssii get your tail out here swung back you want stable room for the horses and a bit of the back court for your wagon silver a week for the horses we provide the grain three coppers for the wagon oh all right i throw in the court space leaned round once more angait angaait get over here and show saii taguiloa where to go the next day taguiloa busied himself burrowing into the complicated and frustrating process of getting the troupe certified for performing in durat working his way up the world of clerks and functionaries parting as frugally as possible with branns coin returning to the inn that night exhausted angry and triumphant the permit a square of stamped paper waving from a fist sweeping in circles over his head harra laughing brann clapping negomas slapping a rhythm on a tabletop linjijan wandering in with the practice flute he was almost never without taguiloas return metamorphosed into an impromptu performance for the patrons of jaos inn taguiloa dancing counterpoint to brann hana whistling linjijan producing a breathy laughing sound from his flute negomas playing the tabletop and a pair of spoonsthe whole ending in laughter and wine and weariness taguiloa went up the stairs relaxed mind drifting frustration dissipated rubbing against his own kind he had rubbed away the stink of temuengs and their stupid arrogance while taguiloa was swimming against the stream of temueng indifference and stupidity while negomas and harm were out exploring the market watching street conjurers and assessing the competition brann set out to do some exploring of her own hunting without too much urgency for a niche where she could make changes without interested observers she wanted no connection between sammangif he had come to duratand taguiloas blackhaired seer the strangers quarter swarmed with people not a corner a doorway a rubble heap a roof nook empty of children beggars women and men watching the ebb and flow in the street she worked her way to the wharves finding more space among the godons as long as she avoided the guards the merchants hired to keep the lightfingers of the quarter away from their goods yaril found a broken plank in one of the scruffier godons flowed inside and kicked it loose while jarilhawk flew in circles overhead watching for guards brann crept inside stripped off the skirt and coins stripped the black from her hair altered her face to the one sammang knew she straightened smiling feeling more herself than she had in weeks as if somehow shed taken off a cramping shell a sound she wheeled hands reaching straightened again jaril stood looking up at her stay he said why im tired i should hunt tonight uhhuh he looked around at the dusty darkness who knows whats hived in here youll want the skirt and things when youre ready to go back to the inn be nice if they were still here she frowned at him you sure youre all right dont fuss bramble i gave yaril a bit extra thats all in case something goes bad round you he blurred into a black malouch and curled up on the skirt his chin on the pile of linked coins his eyes closed running away as he always did when she tried to probe his thoughts and feelings as yaril always did she shook her head impatiently ran her hands through her hair dropped to her knees and crawled out into the street yaril walking beside her a frail fair girlchild again brann began searching along the wharves for sammang or one of his crew ebullient tikrat whod be whistling and jigging about center of a noisy crowd hairy jimm whod tower over everyone by a head at least a wild woolly head staro the stub wide as he was tall with big brown cow eyes that got even milder when he was pounding on someone whod commented on his lack of inches turrope lean and brown and silent tikrats shadow leymas dereech rudar gaoez uasuf small brown men like a thousand others off a hundred ships but shed know them all the moment she saw them and sammang there was a flutter at the base of her stomach when she thought of meeting sammang again she wove in and out of the godons went up and down the piers jutting into the river looking and looking her face a mask never stopping fending off hands that groped at her sucking enough life out of men who refused to back off to send them wandering away in a daze from the west wall to the east she went searching and finding none of those she searched for stood with her hand on the east wall tears prickling behind her eyes a lump in her throatuntil she convinced herself that sammang would keep his men out of trouble while he waited for her and the best way to do that would be to keep them off the wharves she rubbed at her forehead trying to think where would he be if he was here how could he make himself visible but not conspicuous hunh phrased like that the answer was obvious if he was here hed be sitting in a wharfside tavern waiting for her to walk in she began working her way west again drifting in and out of taverns as the afternoon latened ignoring shouted offers from traders shipmasters sailors and others who mistook her purpose ignoring caustic comments from several tavernkeepers who objected to her presence or the presence of yaril in their taprooms as shadows crept across the streets and out onto the river she came to a quiet rather shabby structure near the western wall her feet were starting to give out her knees were tired of bending and she was about ready to quit how easy once she was out of sight and touch for sam mang to change his mind call himself a fool head for pleasanter waters without much hope she pushed through the door stood looking around squinting against the gloom trying to make out the faces of the dark forms seated at tables about the room the man behind the bar came round it and crossed the room a little rotund man without much force to him we dont want children in here you should be ashamed of yourself woman using a baby like that in the business go on get out of here go on go go go he waved pudgy hands at her like a farmwife shooing chickens out of the kitchengarden she glared down at him her patience pushed beyond its limit you calling me a whore little man he winced no need for hard words what do i care what you do just dont do it here what im going to do here is sit myself down and have a bowl of wine and my young friend is going to do likewise she pushed past him and went to one of the stools at the bar swung up on it and sat massaging her knees yaril climbed up beside her sat with her small chin propped on her palms her elbows braced against the aged dark wood a chuckle came from one of the darker corners branns stomach turned over and she felt breathless as she recognized the voice sammang came into the light stopped beside her i greet you witch so you made it the little man started opened his eyes wide set a winebowl in front of her one in front of yaril shoved the jug at her and backed hastily away without waiting for payment she slanted a glance at sammang filled the bowls and sipped at the wine sighing with pleasure as the warmth spread though her so i did he reached round her caught the jug by its neck went back to the table yaril giggled brann scowled at her finish that and go stand guard if you dont mind yaril nodded gulped down the rest of the wine ignoring the goggling eyes of the barman she wriggled off the stool and trotted out brann squared her shoulders slipped off the stool and marched with her bowl to the table in the corner where sammang sat waiting for her she set the bowl down with a loud click pulled out a chair dropped into it and scraped it close enough to the table so she could lean on crossed arms and look past him or at him as she chose whos with you all of em said theyd swim the whole damn river if i tried leaving them behind he filled the bowl pushed it toward her relax bramble im not going to jump your bones out here hunk what about the girl she sipped at the wine her elbows braced on the wood to keep her hands from shaking avoiding his eyes except for quick glances i circled round by perando picked up a cousin of mine and his crew hes got her tucked away up the coast a bit when did you get in yesterday you a week ago been doing some trading lucked into a few things that should pay expenses yesterday mmm havent located your folk yet the children are going out again tonight tell jimm to knock his totoom for me and stir up some luck sooner this is done the easier ill be she rubbed at the nape of her neck frowned at the tabletop there was a stirring in her that had nothing to do with the way sammang made her feel a sense of tidal forces moving that frightened her for herself for her kin for sammang and the troupe for everyone and everything she valued she reached for the bowl gulped more of the wine down and forced herself to ignore that fear were ready to go when you are she glanced at him looked away i could know more tomorrow maybe we could meet here to make plans she had to fight to keep her voice steady if youre staying here he reached out closed his hand around hers finish your wine and come upstairs you sure ive decided face values good value i missed you i i hoped she emptied the bowl and stood swaying as the rush of the wine made her dizzy sammang reached out to steady her his touch was fire more disrupting than the wine the first time theyd come together in the cabin of his ship itd been easy and natural as breathing this was more deliberate colder no not cold far from cold but planned not a sweet happening but a deliberate step taken in full understanding of what she was doing she was nervous and uncertain afraid she couldnt please him this time the barman her voice was a silly squeak she flushed with embarrassment none of his business bramblewithoutthorns sammang touched her cheek relax little witch weve plenty of time fed up to full strength from the rats and snakes of the quarter brann didnt want angry ghosts shouting her presence to the night winds and maybe temuengears yaril and jaril flew out her window and swept on wide owl wings across the lake to the great pile resting on the roots of firehearted cynamacamal brann hitched a hip on the windowsill and watched them vanish among the cloud shreds staying where she was a while longer enjoying the damp cool wind blowing up from the river a long day it was full dark before she could wrench herself from sammangs side getting back to the inn just in time to celebrate taguiloas success then she had to go out again on the feeding hunt now she sat in the window her thin silk robe open to the nudge of the soft wind remembering the feel of the solid powerful body next to hers the smell of him the hard smoothness of his skin the spring of his hair she watched the wounded moon rise over the wall up thin and late dawn only a few hours away feeling within herself a deepdown purring that was not a part of her a little angry at it unhappy that it was there hoping sammang wasnt aware that hed pleasured slya perhaps as much as hed pleasured her she stretched and yawned slid off the windowsill padded across to the bed dropping the robe to the floor as she moved sinking into the flock mattress sinking deep deep into a dreamless sleep yaril and jaril circled over the main pile of the palace wheeled away as something wary and malevolent down there smelled them out and reached for them long invisible fingers combing the air they spiraled higher and stopped thinking onlyowls for a while until they felt the fingers coil back down felt the palace folding in on itself like a blood lily come the dawn they drifted a while longer through the clouds then went back to their swoops over the grounds locating the guard barracks the crowded warrens where the servants lived the far more spacious and luxurious quarters of the imperial dapples and the carefully tended fields where those monsters ran the workshops and greenhouses the foundry the glassmaking furnaces the kitchen gardens working their way out and out until they came to a new structure tucked into the folds of the mountain an isolated compound still stinking of green cement and raw lumber high walls a guard tower overlooking a heavy barred gate torches burning low to light the space about the gate lamps inside the tower guards drowsing there but ready enough to come awake at a sound the owls sailed across the wall and fluttered down onto a rooftree then melted into light shimmers and slipped inside through the rooftiles workshops spacious wellequipped though there were no steel tools about locked up or carried away for the night or for times when the tool users were sufficiently tamed that the tools wouldnt be a danger to them or the guards the light smears zipped through the shops and passed into the living quarters room after empty room then a sleeper another then more empty rooms in all that vast place there were only twelve of the twoscore gone to the fair there was only a bare dozen left despite what the pimush had saidperhaps had said to escape a drawnout dyingthe temueng soldiers had not been tender with the arth slya slaves the changechildren wondered briefly if the emperor still expected his doublehundred slaves from the valley wondered if the sribush in charge of the invasion forces had gotten tired of waiting and sent noses prowling to find out what happened to the pimush and his captives when theyd probed the whole of the compound and made sure there were no others tucked away into the odd corner they drifted back through the occupied rooms naming the sleepers so they could tell brann just who was there knowing each because they knew what brann knew callim branns father hed been beaten probably because he declined to work he was recovering the beating must have been several days before stretched out on the rooms single bed snoring twitching as flies walked his back the weals there sticky with salve cathar branns oldest brother slept curled up on a pallet in one corner duran her younger brother sat dozing in a chair beside the bed waking now and then to fan the flies away in the next room over a man sat dulleyed slackfaced fingers plucking steadily at nothing uncle idadro the etcher and inlayer a finicky precise little man never too adept at handling outsiders his wife glynis had gone to the fair most years befere but she died suddenly of a weakness in the heart and left him drifting his eldest son trithin his only anchor against the world he was wholly unable to cope with this year hed taken that son to the grannsha fair the boy blessed with his mothers bubbling good humor and ease with people little friend of all the world they called him when he was a baskling then a trotling no sign of trithin anywhere within the compound perhaps he was alive elsewhere but neither of the changechildren believed it more likely that the wounded moon rose whole than that theyd find trithin walking earthface again this is the roll of the living they call out to brann later callim cathar duran trayan garrag reanna theras camm finn farra farm and idadro eight men four women this is the roll of the dead trithin sintra warra wayim lotta doronynn imath lethra lannos and rossha at the end of this final sweep the two light smears hovered in the middle of an empty room and sang to each other the questions that had occurred to them what was that thing in the palace that thing with the groping fingers how powerful was it that it not only caused the emperor to commit genocide but made slya herself act deviously wrenching them from their home space and sending them to brann to change her so she could be a vessel for slya bringing slya here disguised to fight her attackers they circled each other and sang their uncertainty should they tell brann what they thought about it she knew some of it already knew slya slept within her and simultaneously slept within tincreal knew slya drove her as she drove the stone of tincreal with utter disregard for her and those she cared for the changechildren contemplated that disregard with a chill in their firebodies that paled the light and almost sent them into their hibernating crystals the form their people took when all energy was drained from them and no more would be available for some considerable time the dormant form that was not death but a state for which their folk had little fondness and exercised their ingenuity to avoid unless the alternative was the dispersal of real death like burntout stars choked to ash and nothing the children hovered and shivered and were more afraid than theyd been since they woke on the slopes of tincreal and found themselves starving in sunlight she might send us back when shes finished with us yaril sang no it was a long long sigh of a sound filled with a notquite despair after all there was much to be said for this world and for the companionship they shared with brann we could talk to her yaril sang when this is over brann too if slya returns us shell have to change brann back brann jaril sang is a brown leaf falling not ignored but not restored why should slya bother after she gets the arth slyans free again and the vengeance she wanted for the slaughter i think the great are the same in all realities they use and discard use and discard this one and that for what they consider the greater good their good poor brann poor us that too two small light smears very young for their kind with much of the long slow learning of that kind yet ahead of them swooped angerdriven through the roof tiles melted into twin owls and went powering back to brann uncertain what they should or would say to her hoping with every atom of their impossible bodies that she slept and dreamed of the bite of pleasure shed worried from the chaos of her life they didnt know what to do how the slyans could be rescued without harming folk who were their friends what to say to brann if she asked their advice they glided through the open window blurred into their childforms and tiptoed to the bed brann was deep asleep her eyes moving under the lids a small smile twitching her lips yaril looked at jaril he nodded and the two of them retreated into a corner and sank into the catalepsy that took the place of sleep jassi stuck her head in the door knocked against the wall taguiloa looked up from the glitter sphere he was polishing someone to see you she winked at him tightass highnose creep with maratulliks brand on him imperial hand eh man you musta connect some good coming up taguiloa set the sphere carefully into its velvet niche got to his feet and began pacing about the room this was an astonishingly early response to his permit hed expected several days of rest before the temuengs took note of his presence if they ever did he stopped at the window stared at the court without seeing any of it im not ready he snapped thumb against finger swung round that i did uhhuh he smiled at jassi tell your creep friend im busy but if he wants to wait ill be down in a little while if he decides he wants to hang around offer him a bowl of your best wine so he wont be tootoo annoyed you could land up to your neck taga she eyed him uncertainly but with more respect than before you that sure of yourself jassi lady of my heart and elsewhere im not no im not but if you scratch every time a temueng itches youll wear your fingers down to nubs now go and do what i said he wrinkled his nose if he walks come tell me she shrugged and left taguiloa closed his hands over the window sill squeezed his eyes shut breathed deeply this was make or break he knew as well as jassi that he was taking a big chance if the slave walked out chances were he or another like him would not be back chance he touched his left shoulder tungjii up to you keep your eye on us he pushed away from the window hunted out the travel papers and the metal credeens he was holding for all but brann he stood looking at them a moment then tossed them on the bed kicked off his sandals stripped moving quickly about the room he washed brushed his long black hair smoothed it down tied it at the nape of his neck with a thin black silk ribbon making a small neat bow over the knot he dressed quickly in the dark cotton tunic and trousers the low topped black boots that he thought of as his humble suit when he was finished he inspected himself carefully brushed a hair off his sleeve smoothed the front of the tunic neat but not gaudy smiling he collected the papers and creedens left his room and went down the hall to harras she let him in went back to the skirt she was embroidering using this bit of handiwork to calm her nerves and pass the time he looked around except for them the room was empty seen brann she went out with the changekids this morning early excited about something harra narrowed her eyes thats your goseethemassa outfit the imperial hand sent a slave to fetch me his eye twitched he put his hands behind him not as calm as he wanted to appear im letting him stew awhile dont let it go too long but you dont need me telling you that think it could maybe be about brann i dont know he asked for me jassi says ah then its either very good news and were on our way to the court or its very bad news and the hands going to be asking you questions you dont want to answer she paused a moment last doesnt seem likely if he was going to be asking nasty questions hed send an empush and his squad to fetch you not some slave right here you keep these he gave her the troupes papers and the credeens after separating out his own in case a wry smile a flip of his hand in case the hand is sneakier or crazier than we know get negomas and linjijan back to silili and brann if i donteome back be better if you keep as far from her as you can you know why shes here he moved his thumb over his own credeen slipped it into his sleeve well ive killed enough time id better get downstairs keep your cool dancer ill try magedaughter i shall try taguiloa followed the silent slave through the west gate onto the broad marblepaved avenue fronting the lake thinking about the year he and gerontai had come here theyd got to the lower levels of the temuengs the merchants and magistrates and minor functionaries but the powerful had ignored them and they made their way back to silili without getting near the emperors halls meslar maratullik was the emperors left hand running the censors and the noses head of security about the emperors person hope and fear hope and fear alternating like right foot left foot creaking on the gritty marble following the silent sneering slave he walked along that lakeside boulevard past walls on one side high smooth white walls with few breaks in them only the massive gates and the narrow alleys between the meslaks the lakeside was planted with low shrubs and occasional trees stubby piers jutted into the lake with pleasure boats sail and paddle tied to them the lake itself was quiet and dull the water reflecting the gray of the clouds gathering thickly overhead no rain just the grayeddown light of the afternoon and a steamy heat that made walking a punishment even in these white stone ways as clean and shining and lifeless as the shells on an ancient beach now and then bands of young male temuengs came racing down that broad avenue on their highbred warhorses not caring who they trampled whooping and yelling sometimes even chasing down unhappy slaves leaving them in crumpled heaps bleeding their plebian blood into the noble stone taguiloas escort had a staff with maratulliks signon a placard prominently displayed so they escaped the attention of the riders maratulliks meslak was a broad rolling estate on the lakeshore with a riding ground a complex of workshops and servant housing extensive gardens selfsufficient within the outerwalls should some disaster turn the meslak into a fortress taguiloa followed the slave through the gates into the spacious formal gardens with their fountains and banks of bright flowers the exquisitely manicured stretches of grass he looked around remembering the noisy ratridden quarter and knew if he was absolutely forced to choose between the two hed take the rathome not this emptiness but such a choice was most unlikely what he was determined to ensure was a less radical choice staying out of the slums keeping himself and blackthorn if it came to that in reasonable comfort after his legs went and his body would no longer do what his mind desired what he had now suited him very well the silence meditation comfort of his small house on the hillside the noise and excitement of silili nights it took twenty minutes to work through the gardens and corridors to a small glassedin garden with a gently plashing fountain in the center falls and sprays of miniature orchids some rare kinds taguiloa had never seen before one huge tree encased within the bubble fans worked by ropes and pulleys from outside by slaves who never saw the beauty they maintained there were wicker chairs scattered about singly and in small clusters but he was not tempted to sit despite the twohour walk and his aching feet he moved his shoulders tightened and loosened his muscles to calm himself there was no point getting angry at the temueng and there were a lot of reasons he shouldnt he knew he had to control his irritation he didnt take easily to groveling had lost the habit of it the past five years but all that hed won for himself in silili meant nothing here the meslar maratullik left hand counsellor to the emperor came into the garden with a feline grace and the silent step of a skilled hunter he was short for a temueng though he was more than a head taller than taguiloa his face was rounder less bony the features more delicate than most temuengs he wore a narrow robe of heavy dark gray silk finely cut arrogant in its simplicity as taguiloa bent in the prescribed deep obeisance he went cold with the thought that perhaps there was hina blood somewhere in the hands ancestry if that was true he was in a doubly perilous position hes seen too often what happened if a hina in an important family was born with wodaan characteristics how that man made himself rigidly hina rejecting everything that would dilute the ancient hina culture how that man overtly and in secret tormented any wodaan unfortunate to fall into his hands and how often such a man ended up in a position like the hands where he had a great deal of power over the lives of others especially those he hated so virulently taguiloa could trip himself up here without ever knowing precisely what hed done to bring the mountain down on his head care take care he cautioned himself dont relax till youre out of here and maybe not even then maratullik acknowledged taguiloas presence with a stiff short nod crossed to the fountain settled himself in one of the wicker chairs and spent some moments smoothing out the heavy silk of his robe he lifted his head his dark eyes as dull and flat as the silk beckoned taguiloa forward stopped him with an open palm when he was close enough taguiloa bowed again then waited in silence eyes lowered a game thats all it was a game with bloody stakes yielding just enough to propitiate this temueng that rumor made a monster yet not enough to lose his selfrespect walking the hairfine ridge between capitulation and catastrophe he waited his hands clasped behind him so they wouldnt betray his tension maratullik was silent for a long time perhaps testing the quality of taguiloas submission more likely taking a bit of pleasure in making him sweat we have heard good things of you hina the monsters voice was a high thin tenor i am honored saх jura meslar taguiloa murmured he could feel sweat damping the cloth under his arms he fought to keep his grasp on himself telling himself the hand expected such signs of nervousness and would he suspicious if he failed to see them the two silences stretched on taguiloas head started to ache there was no way he could get anything like respect from this temueng but making a doormat of himself would only incite the man to stomp him into the ground you have foreigners in your troupe yes saх jura meslar taguiloa lifted his eyes just enough to catch glimpses of maratulliks hands at the word foreigner the fingers twitched toward closing opening again slowly and reluctantly at taguiloas mild and noncommittal answer the fingers stiffened into claws taguiloa sweated some more trying to play safe was less than safe in this game should he amplify his answer or would that further antagonize the temueng after a few moments of harried thought he elected to wait for the next question and see how a more extended answer affected those hands hoping all the time that maratullik didnt know how thoroughly his small and delicate fingers betrayed him why taguiloa shifted from foot to foot let his nervousness show a hit more disciplined his voice to a dull monotone three reasons saх jura meslar he spoke softly slowly choosing his words with care his eyes flicking careful not to look at the hands too long first saх jura meslar when i was younger i made tours through the tigarezun with my master gerontai and i have taken notice of how eagerly the countryfolk greeted exotic acts and how well they reward those that please them he winced inside at the pompous greed in the speech but the fingers were relaxing he was conforming to expectation second saх jura meslar making a tour such as this is very costly especially in the beginning aside from their other talents the members of the troupe excepting the children have contributed to outfitting us and will have a share in whatever we take in the foreigners of course taking a much smaller share than the hina glance at the hands almost flat out good but dont overdo the boring bit or the geed third saх jura meslar though this will be of little importance to you it carries a high weight with me there are my own aspirations i seek to blend tumbling juggling and dance into something no man has seen before the music i found to accompany this new movement was also a blend a music from mdarjin drums rukkanag daroud hina flute a music that is sufficiently different to be intriguing sufficiently familiar for the comfort of the listeners it is an exciting music saх jura meslar all who have heard it agree he bowed again and fell silent watch what you say hes far from stupid or he wouldnt be where he is tell me about your foreigners the women first they are honored by your interest saх jura meslar taguiloa cleared his throat i know only outlines saх jura meslar i must confess it i wasnt interested in their life stories only their coin and their skills harra hazhani is rukkanag from far out in the west somewhere you will of course know of them she came to silili with her father he died and left her without protection or a place to go and a limited amount of coin so she needed a way to earn more the customs and strictures of her people forbid her on pain of death to sell that which is a womans chief asset and besides she was a foreigner only the perverse would pay for her however she is an excellent dancer in her way and a musician of considerable talent the other woman is called brannish tovah she is sujomann out of the west too from up in the far north somewhere she says winter nights last half a year and the snow comes down until its high enough to drown mountains i needed a seer who could also dance and she came well recommended shes bound to the wind by her god or so she said goes where the wind blows said she lost a husband and two children to ice and wolves has a brindle boar hound she says is her familiar and a street child she picked up who has something to do with helping her in her rites and acts as crier to call clients so she can read for them like the hazhani woman she is forbidden by custom and her indwelling god to seek congress with men not her kind were she to be forced she is bound by her god to castrate the man and kill herself that tends to reduce the ardor of any who might find her interesting to speak truly saх jura meslar i was quite pleased when i learned these things having women in a troupe is always a tricky thing can lead to complications with the countryfolk if they consider themselves free to supplement their incomes on their back the mdarjin drummer is a boy about ten or so hard to tell with those folk he has no father or relatives willing to claim him though how that happened is not clear to me i did not bother to probe for answers i was not interested in anything but the way he played the drums linjijan the flute player is hina and the second best in all silili the first being his great uncle ladjinatuai who plays for blackthorn he bowed and waited tensely for the hands response hands still loose on his thighs maratullik was silent for some breaths then he said both women come from the west so they said saх jura meslar the questioning went on for a short while longer maratulliks hands relaxed his voice gone remote and touched with distaste he was no longer much interested in the answers and taguiloa rapidly shortened them to the minimum required by courtesy short as they were the temueng interrupted the last you will perform here tomorrow night he said you will make the necessary arrangements with my house steward wait here he got to his feet and glided out ignoring taguiloas low bow his attitude saying he had forgotten the matter completely it was of that small an importance in his life taguiloa squeezed his hands together froze his face into a mask exultation bubbling in him he struggled to keep his calm but all he could think was ive won ive almost won hair a white shimmer tied at the nape of her neck clothes a black tunic and trousers worn sandals on her feet brann walked through the busy market making her way to sammangs tavern in no hurry to get there savoring the anticipation enjoying the exuberant vitality of the scene around her a face came out of the crowd two more she strangled a cry in her throat cathar camm theras her brother a cousin by blood a cousin by courtesy faces she knew as well as her own she began following them trying to stay inconspicuous afraid of losing sight of them cathar sauntered through the market his eyes alive with pleasure in the jumbled colors and forms stopping to bargain for fruit and herbs a length of cloth joking with the cousins in no hurry unaccompanied by any guard she could see paying for his purchases with a metal tablet he showed the vender she wanted desperately to talk to him but didnt dare approach him after her first flush of emotion her mind took over what was he here for except as bait to draw her out otherwise why would the temuengs let him and the others beyond the compound walls taking a chance theyd run not much of a chance with the hostages the temuengs held but how could they be sure had to be noses about she couldnt see any but that meant very little in this crush anyway how could she tell a nose from the rest of the folk here couldnt smell them she choked back a hysterical giggle besides what could she say to cathar if she did go up to him hello im your little sister a foot taller hair gone white fifteen years too old but im still brann brambleallthorns no im not a crazy woman i really am your sister eleven years old never mind my form ha hed believe her like hell he would she chewed on her lip as she eased after them trying to think of some way she could talk with him without giving herself away to the noses yaril tugged on her arm she let the changechild lead her into a side street where there was a jog in a building that gave her a bit of privacy house of assignation yaril whispered theres one the next street over you put on a hina face and go rent a room ill bring cathar to you brann grimaced yaril the changechild scratched at her head made an impatient gesture with her other hand the doors got twined serpents painted on it you just go and knock and say you want a room for the afternoon and give the old woman three silver bits and tell her your servant will be bringing someone later and let the maid take you up when the girls gone you take your clothes off and put on the robe youll find in the room and sit down and wait she frowned keep the hina face and youd better make it a kind of wrinkled up face dirty old woman paying young men to service her just in case cathars nose decides to check you out brann wrinkled her nose tchah what a thing you dont have to like it just do it dont be too long you sure you can convince him yaril giggled cathar you know your brother never passed up a chance in his life ill get him there you be ready she was sitting at a table near the window when cathar walked into the room curiosity bright in his graygreen eyes his dark brown hair blown into a tangle of small soft curls she watched him with deep affection and nearly wept with joy to see him so much himself in spite of everything that had happened he came and looked her over a glint of amusement and interest in his eyes he bowed she felt a knot tighten in her stomach she didnt want her brother looking at her like that even if he didnt know who she was and thought she was some rich hina matron who got her thrills from picking up young men in the market she leaned forward started to speak yaril said hastily wait she darted into the shadows of the bed curtains emerged as a smear of light sweeping along the walls cathars eyes widened he looked from the light to brann began backing toward the door his hand reaching for the latch cathar brann whispered wait you know me he blinked stood frozen with shock as branns face rippled and changed to the one she woke up with on the flight from the valley he licked his lips what brann glanced at yaril who was a small blond girlehild again the changechild nodded no one listening right now ill keep an eye out downstairs just to make sure he had a shadow she flicked a hand at cathar like you suspected she grinned up at him relax baby no ones going to hurt you she tugged on the latch pulled the door open and went out brann sighed i dont quite know how to explain this cathar sit down will you you make me nervous fidgeting like that he narrowed his eyes pulled out a chair and sat across the table from her i know you im glad its you not duran hes so damn hardheaded hed never believe me im brann your sister he leaned forward frowning as he scanned her face youre very like mum now you werent a few minutes back she pushed at her hair still black she hadnt bothered changing that again and im a dozen years too old and im a long way from home and a shapeshifter of sorts well slya woke brother she changed me did they tell you those temuengs did they tell you they sent a pimush and his fifty to clean out the valley they told me gingy and shara are dead cathar all the kids under eleven were killed all the old ones too uncle eornis the yongala the rest she closed her eyes ive gone over it so often i saw some of it cathar what they did to mum saw roan get killed uncle cynoc they set the houses on fire too but they didnt burn too much the houses i mean i was up on tincreal all day you know i found the children there i came back and the soldiers were in the valley i watched from harrags leap then i went after them slya changed me i told you that and brought the children yaril has a brother she opened her eyes tapped her breast she rides me slya i dont know what shes going to do i killed them cathar the pimush and his men the children helped they make a poison it kills between one breath and the next the pimush told me what happened at grannsha he said no one was killed jaril tells me about half arent here i suppose they were killed after all mums all right well as all right as she can be after what happened her looms werent hurt tincreal blew about a week after that jaril flew back to see what happened the hills are scrambled you could only find your way back to the valley if you knew where it was but theyre all right the ones left alive i forgot marrans dead i found him killed on the trail gave him fire didnt do that for the temuengs we think youre bait to catch me you and the others they let out the children and me we think the sribush on croaldhu knows his men are dead before i got off croaldhu i gave the temuengs some sorrow i expect they guessed i had something to do with arth slya which is why you and the others have noses on your tail how long have they been letting slyans out about a month his voice was cool he wasnt committing himself to anything yet she sucked in a long breath youre as hardheaded as duran all right listen you remember the time you and trihan caught uncle cynoc in your dammar trap remember what he made you do bury the offal from the killing ground all that summer she made a sharp impatient gesture either you believe me or you dont did they tell you why theyre letting some of you out he shrugged said they dont want their hina waiting on us were supposed to do for ourselves they give us a credeen to show and keep track of what we buy and just send out those with close kin here they said theyd skin duran first then da if i run same with the others first few days we had guards breathing down our necks but they left us looser after that i havent noticed anyone following us be easy enough to do he looked around the room this was clever bramble he grinned all right i do believe you though its not easy when i look at you what have you got in mind breaking out wont be that hard but where do we go after were out the shipmaster who took me off croaldhu and brought me to silili hes here now hes going to take you down the palachunt and back to the north end of our island where the smugglers come in you know best not to wait get it done fast less chance of something disastrous happening you get the others ready to move sometime the next five days the children know where to find you they can get in and out without anyone noticing them how is da the children told me hes been beaten yeah he wouldnt work and he wont take any kind of orders hes getting better but not easier mums safe alive youre surer uhhuh last time jaril saw her she was setting up her loom brann smiled you know mum house half burned down around her everything in a mess but as long as the roof is tight over the looms and shes got the yarn she needs the rest doesnt matter ill tell da that might make him bend a little if he has to he can get about if that what worries you do they ever check on you at night say after sundown and before dawn no at least they havent up to now they change the guards a little after sundown about the seventh hour leave them on all night change again about an hour after dawn ive heard them grousing about the long dull duty theyre pulling then the sooner we can get you out the longer itll be before anyone notices youre gone barring some ill chance cant leave too soon or he broke off as a large brown bird came swooping through the window blurred and landed beside brann as a slim blond child blurred again into the hina child whod brought him here nose has decided he wants to be sure what youre doing up here hes negotiating with the old woman now right now and in a breath or two hell be up peeping through the voyeur holes she darted to the bed and pulled the covers about talking rapidly as she worked you cathar get your shirt off muss your hair see if you can look however you look when youve had your ashes hauled brann get that hina face back on fast and take those pins out of your hair look like youve been mauled about a bit huh she scowled from one to the other then marched to the table caught up the bell stomped to the door leaned out and rang for the house maid shell bring tea you shouldve rung before brann closed her eyes sat back in the chair and concentrated her face and body rippled and flowed the face and hands changing to those of a middleaged hina matron she opened dark brown eyes saw cathar staring at her uncertainly i can answer any question you ask me brother in spite of whats been done to me i am brann you were courting lionnis i forgot to tell you shes one of the living too remember the time mouse and i spied on you yaril swung the door wide as the maid brought in a heavy tray with tea and cakes she set the tray on the table bowed smiled at the silver bit brann tossed to her yaril shut the door after her came back to the table eyes she murmured in the wall now she squatted by branns feet her eyes closed a mask of indifference on her pointed face cathar pulled his shirt over his head and began doing up the laces making quite a production of it a twinkle in his graygreen eyes he was beginning to have fun with this business the realization born in him that there was hope there was a good chance he and the others would get back to the valley home to the slopes of tincreal that hope was bouncing in his walk and gleaming in his grin his spirits were winding up to an explosion which she hoped he would put off until he got back in the compound she watched him scoop up the gold coin she set on the table toss it up and catch it grinning then strut out of the room watched him and wanted to run after him and hug him until he squealed impossible damn the temuengs for making it impossible she poured out a bowl of tea and sat staring out the window sipping at the hot liquid fighting an urge to cry overwhelmed by the love she felt for her brother realizing how lonely shed been the past months even with sammang and the crew even with taguiloa and harra even with the intimate association with the children she felt alone nothing could replace the feel of her folk around her where she breathed in warmth and affection where the space she took up was one shed grown for herself where she moved suspended in certainty not so long ago shed been fretting about that closeness feeling suffocated by it now she was beginning to understand the dimensions of her loss but she didnt have time to brood over it she emptied the bowl in a pair of gulps patted her mouth delicately with the napkin from the tray swung to face yaril he was a good one girl she said making herself sound mincingly precise go find me another such boy she reached into a box and took out another gold coin hurry child i grow needy again silent and expressionless yaril took the coin and went out brann filled the tea bowl and sat staring out the window sipping at the cooling liquid now that the room was silent and empty she thought she could hear tiny scraping sounds the spy made as he fidgeted behind the peepholes could feel his eyes watching her the silence stretched out and out the noiseinthewall sounds grew louder and more frequent then the sounds moved along the wall very small noises that might almost be mistaken for shifts and creaks of the old house even when they were gone she sat without moving or changing the expression on her face sat sipping at the tea as if she had all the time in the world yaril came back through the window again a gold shimmer mixed with the gray light from outside she flashed through the walls and came back to stand beside brann hes gone think we convinced him enough so he wont probe further not now anyway or hed be outside waiting to follow you but just in case he left a friend behind you better keep that form awhile brann grimaced yaril patted her hand poor baby bramlet jahr brann striped off the robe tossed it onto the bed pulled on her tunic and trousers lets get out of here i dont like this place that day passed and the night and in the late afternoon when the shadows would have been long and dark if the heavily overcast sky had let enough light trickle through the troupe rolled out of the west gate their planning done two plot lines converging everyone nervous and wondering if the whole thing was going to come apart on them and sink them beyond recovery on their way to maratulliks meslak escorted by the slave whod fetched taguiloa before this time on a lanky white mule of contrary temper whose notion of speedy travel was a slightly faster walk than usual a pair of silent guards rode ahead of them another pair rode behind yaril was an owl circling over them jaril rode with negomas on top the wagon both boys quiet negomas because he was nervous and rather intimidated by the guards and the great houses white and silent and eerie in the pearly gray light jaril because he wanted to avoid drawing notice to himself brann rode beside the bay cob looking out over the ruffled gray water the stubby docks with their pleasure boats covered with taut canvas to keep out the rain the street was empty even of slaves as the threatened rain began to mist down and the wind to blow erratically dropping and gusting dropping and gusting throwing sprays of rain into her face the wagon rolled on and on rumbling over the pebbled marble the sound echoing dully from the walls the slow clopclip of the ironshod hooves extra loud in each drop of the wind taguiloa drove and linjijan rode beside him his flute tucked carefully away to keep it out of the rain linjijan stretched out on the seat practicing his fingering along his ribs wholly unconcerned about what was happening around him he was restful to be with right now taguiloa felt the calm radiating out from him and was grateful for it as his own pulses steadied his breathing slowed the tightness worked out of his muscles he couldnt keep his dreams from taking his mindif they made a good enough showing if they managed to interest the hand they were set set for the court performance the chance hed worked so long to get he tried not to think of brann and her plans for this night expelled from his mind any thought of the changechildren and what they would be doing while he danced up ahead the slave kicked the mule into a faster gait as the rain started coming down harder brann danced with fire a soaring swaying shimmering column of braided blue red gold jaril flowing bright the drums heavy and sensuous in the shadows behind her the daroud deep and sonorous singing with and against the song of the drums the hand sitting in shadow watched without any sign he was responding to the music or the dance but the adolescent temueng males filling the benches on either side of him were stamping and whistling both things bothered her the meslarlings raucous callow behavior and the hands silence draining the energy she needed for the dance she owed the troupe her best so she reached deep and deep within and drove herself to increase the power and sensuality of the dance negomas and harm seemed to sense her difficulty and threw themselves into the music making the great room throb and the hand move in spite of himself leaning forward letting himself respond and then it was over and brann was bowing then running into the shadows behind the screens set up to serve the players taguiloa touched her shoulder never better he whispered she smiled nervously its a bad crowd she murmured stupid and arrogant he nodded touched the chime that warned linjijan and the others to begin the music he caught up his clubs began his breathing exercises listened to the music eyes shut running through the moves in his mind the dance was paradoxically easier on the high rail at the inns because he didnt have to work so hard for the clown effect everything forgotten but his body and the music he caught the cue and went wheeling out with a calculated awkwardness where he seemed always on the verge of winding himself into impossible knots and losing control of the clubs and knocking himself on the head as tacuiloa flung himself and the clubs about jaril was a shadowcolored ferret darting through the lamplit halls until he reached the outside then a mistcrane powering up through the rain to join yaril who was circling through the clouds waiting for him a mistcrane herself now that the rain had turned heavy they cut through the clouds to the far end of the lake and circled around the great shapeless pile of the palace to the slave compound at the back guard changed yet should have but we better check they landed on the roof of the tower blurred and oozed through the tiles into the rafters where they hung as mottled serpents lost among the shifting shadows from the smelly oil lamp sitting in the center of a worn table the room was empty for a few breaths then the guards came in stomped about shaking off the wet using their sodden cloaks to mop faces arms and legs then a blanket off the cot in the corner grumbling all the time about having to nursemaid a clutch of mudheads like that not even able to have a little fun with the women stuck out here the rest of this stinkin night to sit and shiver in case one of those knownothing shits tried to run yaril lifted her serpent head looked at jaril nodded she blurred into a beast rather like a winged marmoset with poison fangs then moved silently along the rafters until she was in position above one of the guards when she heard the click from jaril that told her he was ready she dropped on silent wings gliding onto her targets shoulder and back sinking her fangs into his neck shoving off before he could close his hands on her fluttering up in a steep narrow spiral as he collapsed twitched a little went still his mouth open a trace of foam on his lips jaril struck a second later than she did his guard fell over hers dead before he hit the floor they blurred into light smears oozed through the roof and flew down to the gate with a little maneuvering they swung the bar out of its hooks but left the gate shut for the moment so the gap wouldnt be noticed they filtered through the planks then were small blond children running unwet through the rain to the living quarters taguiloa kicked the club into the air then hopped about holding his foot with one hand while he kept that club circling in long loops with the other a grimace of exaggerated anguish on his face throwing the club higher than before he danced back and back while the club soared hopped closer and closer to the club abandoned on the floor the music rising to a screech he bumped his heel into the floorclub wheeled into a series of vigorous back flips landed flat on his back and caught the descending club a second before it mashed his head waved it in triumph then let his arm fall with a loud thump that cut the music off as if with a knife he lay there a moment then got to his feet with a quick curl of his body bowed and ran off the padded part of the floor into the protection of the screens the hand chuckled throughout the performance apparently deciding he approved of these players there was more stomping from the youths a few whistles taguiloa went out bowed again then retreated behind the screens negomas and linjijan began playing a lazy tune while harra came behind the screen to collect her wrist hoops and finger bells she nodded to branco then taguiloa flicked her fingers against his cheek wriggled her shoulders clinked her hells once to let linjijan know she was ready stood waiting until the music changed jaril grinned up at cathar this is it time to go right he looked over his shoulder duran go get the others back to jaril the guards dead gates open downpour out so theres nobody much about we have to get to the lake but that shouldnt be a problem yaril and me we can take care of just about anything that pops up all you and the rest need to do is follow us good enough durans going to be handling one boat with me farra and fann will take the other boats are ready well we wouldnt be here now if they werent didnt mean to insult you just nerves yeah get a good hold of em its a long hairy walk to the lake with uncle idadro gagged and supported by camm and theras duran and reanna giving their shoulders to callim the arth slyans followed jaril out of the compound cathar closed the gates and put the bar in place with garrags help then joined with him to act as rear guard garrag was a woodcarver whod puttered about in the workshop without doing much telling himself he was doing it to fool the censor who was in each day to check on them but he was a man who couldnt stand idleness he had to do something with his hands even if it was only whittling hed found a short length of seasoned oak in the supply bin and shaped it into a long lethal cudgel though the chisels and other tools were counted and taken away every night the censor and his minions didnt bother with the wood he carried that cudgel now and walked grimfaced beside cathar shortsighted eyes straining through the gray sheets of rain they moved through the rain along a twisting service path toward the main gate the only way out of the palace grounds yaril flew ahead scouting for them jaril walked point leading them through the maze of paths and shrubbery past the stables of the dapples past the echelons of slave quarters into the gardens before the gate deserted gardens with gardener and guard alike inside out of the miserable weather even the hunting cats loosed at night were snugged away out of the wet they came close to one of these lairs where a malouch lay dozing cathar and ganag spun around to face the charge of the large black beast but light streaked between them and the malouch wound in a firesnake about the beast sent him in a spinning tumbling yowling struggle to rid himself of the length of burn searing his hide he went whining off into the darkness and the light streak was once more a blue gray mistcrane flying precariously through the rainy gusts predator eyes searching the foliage for other dangers harra stood posed listening to the whistles and applause and shouted suggestions trying to ignore most of it spoiled young brats many of them the prime sons of the meslars and magistrates here in audurya durat she broke her pose bowed and ran into the relative quiet behind the screens louts she muttered taguiloa dropped a hand on her shoulder they like you and want you back hah theyd like anything in skirts especially if she took them offshe grimaced pasted a smile on her face stepped into the light bowed retreated again youre going to have a job getting them back taga they havent the sense to know what theyre seeing godalau grant the meslar has and does she stripped off the gold hoops and the finger hells laid them on the table stood rubbing her hands together taguiloa listened to the whistles and shouts that showed little sign of tapering off knowing all too well what hed have to face it was a gamble sending harra out to dance before this herd of spoiled youth but he needed the rest time after the comic dance he moved away to the food table the hand had set up for them poured some water and drank a few sips just enough to wet his mouth watched as harra drank more greedily then dipped her fingers in the water and sprinkled it across her face outside linjijan was playing a lyrical invention of his own with negomas delicately fingering his drums to produce a soft singing accompaniment their skill almost drowned by the noise of the watchers harra sighed took up her daroud frowned you want me to stay here so that wont go on even more no i can get em go on out i need you there she nodded wiped her hands on the cloth laid out by the house steward threw the cloth down went around the back end of the screen and settled herself as inconspicuously as she could beside negomas ignoring the flareup of noise that only stopped at a sharp tap of the gong at maratulliks elbow she picked up the beat and fit herself into the music then helped it change into the sharp dissonances and throbbing hard beats of taguiloas dance music taguiloa shivered his arms sipped at the air closed his eyes and once again played over in his mind his first tumbling run and the dance moves immediately after hed be moving at speed carried on the music going faster and faster until he was at the edge of his ability to control his body he tapped the small gong to let them know he was ready shook himself again then listened for the music that would lift him into his final dance jaril came trotting back to the clump of trees where the arth slyans huddled in the cold soggy darkness weve eased the slave portal open yarils keeping watch on the guards but theyve got themselves some mulled cider and are more interested in that than whats outside the windows keep quiet and move real slow we dont want to have to kill these guards we dont know when theyre going to be relieved or what would happen if the next set found them dead be better if the alarm doesnt go up till the morning better for brann and better for you all follow me and keep in the shadows i dont want you even breathing hard and when we get out stay hugging the wall until were far enough away from the guard towers it wont matter if they see us got that good come on they followed the child through the shrubbery the storm wind covering any noises they made tension winding higher and higher in them all until cathar wanted to shout and break things and knew the rest were feeling much the same they had to cross a small open space before they reached the narrow gate set within the larger one jaril didnt stop but went skimming across the gravel his feet making almost no sound at all cathar watched the thin line of his folk move after the boy and winced at every crunch of their feet he waited until the last were through then followed garrag across the gravel his back knotted with expectation of shouts or spears hurled at him he was almost disappointed when nothing happened and he was through the portal and walking along the massive white wall fronting the palace grounds jail brushed by him passed back through the portal over his shoulder cathar watched the door swing shut then saw a patch of light ooze through the wood coalesce into the boy jaril ran past him waving him on impatiently no time to indulge curiosity now cathar moved his shoulders and grinned then shifted into an easy lope to catch up with the others slya bless what a pair they are he looked at the nearly invisible mistcrane flying above them the pale boyform leading them slya bless a moment later jaril led them across the avenue and along one of the stubby piers two sailboats were set up and ready at the far end working as quickly as they could cathar and his brother farra and her sister fann got the others settled into the boats the sails raised the lines cast off the water was choppy the wind difficult and the rain didnt help but once they got away from the shore that rain served to conceal them from anyone watching then the escape became a matter of enduring wet and cold and keeping the boats from capsizing the mistcranes flew with them guiding them until they were halfway across the lake then one of them went ahead to take care of the guards at the outlet into the palachunt when cathar eased his boat into the outcurrent the guard towers shone as brightly as usual with the huge lampions that spread their light out across the riveruntil there were no dark patches for smugglers or troublemakers to slip past he chewed on his lip but the mistcrane that guided them flew serenely on so he tried to relax and trust the children a flicker of darkness sweeping past him then there were two mistcranes sailing the clouds above them no shouts from the towers no stones catapulted at them slya bless what a pair they circled a number of moored merchanters tricky sailing in the dark and storm with the rivers current both a help and a hindrance then the cranes blurred into shimmering spheres of light hanging about the masts of a small ship moored away from the others when they came alongside that ship a broad solid man a panday with a clanking gold ornament dangling from one ear leaned over the rail and tossed cathar a rope welcome friend he called down tikrat get those nets overside tacuiloa wheeled across the matting sprang off into a double twisting backflip swung round and dropped onto his hands as he landed used the slap of his hands on the mat to power him back onto his feet then went on one knee in a low bow the music behind him breaking as suddenly into silence silence from the watchers then a burst of applause calls for more more but taguiloa was exhausted not even sure he could stand yet he stayed in the bow his arms outstretched at first then folded on his knee maratullik touched the gong beside him and the applause faded to silence he leaned forward a remarkable performance he watched as taguiloa got heavily to his feet and bowed again from the waist acknowledging the compliment for him at that moment the meslar was little more than a paper figure unreadable a mask that might have anything behind it something a smooth voice came from saying pleasant things most remarkable my compliments dancer come here if you please taguiloa stumbled forward exaggerating his weariness though not by much wondering what was coming next accept this poor recompense for the pleasure you have given my young friends with a sweeping gesture maratullik brought round a heavy leather purse and held it out smiling at the roars and applause from the benches taguiloa dropped to one knee in a profound obeisance godalau bless your generosity saх jura meslar introduce your troupe hina they too deserve our thanks was he preening himself before the sons of his peers or was he after something else paper figure making gestures he was pleasing those louts if the noise was any measure of their feelings taguiloa stood slowly holding the purse before him linjijan hina flute player the second best in silili the first being his greatuncle the wondrous ladjinatuai who plays for the dancer blackthorn nod from the hand desultory applause from the benches negomas mdarjin and drummer as before a quiet nod from the hand a sprinkle of clapping from the youths harra hazhani rukkanag dancer and daroudist nod from the hand he scanned her face with some care but said nothing whistles and shouts from the benches that quieted as soon as maratullik touched his gong brannish tovah sujomann seer and dancer again maratullik scanned her face saying nothing again he stopped the noise from the meslarlings when he tired of it my steward tells me the rain is heavy rooms will be provided for you to take your nights rest here you may return to the quarter come the morning without waiting for a response from taguiloa he turned to brann you will please us yet more oh seer if you stay to read for us she lifted her head and stared at him coolly taguiloa held his breath certainly sao jura meslar if you will furnish a guard instructed to curb the enthusiasm of the overeager taguiloa let his breath trickle slowly out this response fit within the margins of proper behavior though barely so brann oh brann oh brambleallthorns remember who this is and why youre here you suggest nothing sao jura meslar i warn my god is jealous of my person and prone to hasty acts ah yes i know something of the sujomanni which of their gods is yours the hag with no name saх jura meslar she who spins the thread of fate thus your calling most fitting he looked from bench to bench quiet now except for some muttering and moved his lips in a neat and mirthless smile we will forgo the readings seer this night perhaps another time would be more propitious your will is mine saх jura meslar she bowed and stood silent waiting with the others for their dismissal would it were so sujomann he struck the gong and the steward came forward to lead them out working swiftly and with a vast good humor the crew got the arth slyans stowed below deck the flight through the palace grounds and across the lake had used up the better part of three hours and even the fittest among the escapees was cold weary and soaked to the skin rubbed down and dressed in dry clothing hoisted into hammocks wrapped in blankets swaying gently as the ship hoisted anchor and started downriver all tension drained from them warm and comfortable most of them drifted into a deep sleep cathar was too restless to sleep he tumbled out of his hammock and made his way back on deck the masts were bare except for a small triangle of sail the shipmaster was taking her away from her mooring as silently and inconspicuously as he could trying to keep out of the way of sailors passing back and forth along the deck uneasy about his footing wind and rain beating against his back cathar groped along the rail to the bow where the panday stood staring into the gloom he touched the mans arm shipmaster the panday turned a stonegod face to him a sternness in it that eased a little when he saw who it was even with that easing he didnt look very welcoming his words underlined his dislike for mudfeet wandering about his deck youll be more comfortable below branns brother cathar is it right soon as were around that bend ahead well be racing no place for passengers then why isnt brann here your sister has proper reasons for everything she does leave her to them she got you out ill get you home thats enough youll see her when shes ready look cathar its three days coming up the palachunt and usually two days going down for a shipmaster who gives his ship the respect she deserves us well be racing the pigeon mail and taking chances that turn my hair white thinking of em if we can make the mouth by noon this coming day theres no way in this world the temuengs can get word to the fort there in time to stop us but lad one thing we dont need is interference on deck you keep your folk below you hear i hear why are you doing this shes our witch as much as shes your sister someday when im good and drunk maybe ill tell you the tale witch then he remembered branns face changing and looked away uneasy at the thought below with you now a strong hand closing on cathars shoulder turning him get brann stood at the glazed window seeing the gray curtains of the rain and the flicker of the single lamp cutting the darkness of the small room a movement in the window mirror the door opening she stiffened then relaxed as yaril came in small blackhaired hina urchin he came across and leaned against her hip neither of them spoke for a while then he began singing his voice a burr that hardly stirred the air mistcrane mistcrane flying high through the gray and stormy sky wounded moon sails high and white river races with the night oh the mistcranes ghostly flight flitting phantoms never missed from their greedy masters fist mistcranes flight is finished now shipman answers to his vow phantoms waking from their fright laughing in the face of might as the sun soars shining bright turn the key set us free blessed be we when home we see brann sighed moved from the window mistcranes flight might be finished but theres a fistful of other threads to tie off watch while i sleep my friend i trust the latches on these doors about as much as i trust the walls with a strong following wind augmenting the push of the current and a clear sky opening ahead of them as they left the storm behind the little ship groaned and strained and flewdown the river sammang jimm and tikrat watching the water as if it was a treacherous mount that would try to rub them from its back given half a chance they raced from point to point trusting memories from the trip upstream taking impossible gambles and bringing them off as if tungjii rode the bow scattering blessings before them they emerged with the dawn from the twisting chute through towering limestone cliffs into the broad triangle of wetlands sloping down to the coast sammang sent tikrat into the jibboom stays to spot snags took in sail until the ships speed was reduced by half put hairy jimm at the wheel and kept the crew hopping as he went carefully down that treacherous stretch winding through halfdrowned trees whose stale stench clung so closely to the soupy greenishbrown water that he felt as if he were eating drinking breathing it along with the swarms of pinhead midges blown from the trees on the heavy erratic wind they left the trees about midmorning and picked up speed along the broad main channel of the delta skimming along between stretches of saw grass and stunted brush the air immediately seemed cleaner and many degrees cooler sammang sighed and moved his shoulders rubbed his back against the foremast to get a little of the stiffness out of the muscles there tikrat came off the ropes rubbing at tired eyes groaning and grousing but cheerful sammang laughed at him then sent him below to tell the arth slyans they could come on deck if they wanted get some sun and fresh air he watched the youth go bouncing away and knew there was going to be a song about this race one hed enjoy but have to suppress for a while at least if he wanted to keep trading in silili he laced his fingers behind his head and pushed exploding out a sigh of pleasure as he pulled against the resistance and worked his muscles one last knot to unravel the fort at the rivers mouth he glanced up at the hot pallid sky thick with birds none of them carrying mail he was ready to swear that a witchsummoned demon might beat them but he had strong doubts so powerful a magus could be found in time to make a difference temuengs tended to distrust and dispose of anyone with that much power he yawned nodded at jimm and went to see if leymas had fresh kaffeh in the pot taguiloa stared out his window at the busy courtyard below fingers tapping nervously on the sill brann was out in the market somewhere set up for readings keeping herself visible while imperial guards stalked about turning the quarter upside down as they searched for the escaped slaves he hadnt seen her since the troupe went wearily up the stairs a little after sunup he didnt want to see her he liked her she was easy enough to like doing the best she could to piece together the ruins of her existence trouble was hed got so close to being set for life a breath away from court a breath easier to endure losing what hed had no real chance of getting but to get so close if it didnt happen he wasnt quite sure how hed handle himself he left the window and began pacing about the room with the barely contained energy of a caged tiger imperial guards stumping through the quarter he could hear the sounds of their progress drifting in on the wind rumors jassi brought a clutch of them with his breakfast tray the escapees were twelve identical sisters who performed unnatural acts on each other while the emperor watched the description of those acts growing more lurid with repetition or they were snake men with poison fangs the emperor kept as a weapon to scare the meslars into doing what he told him and they were stolen by the meslars who were planning to assassinate the emperor and he knew it and that was why he was so hot to get them back or they were a coven of witches of talents so wild no one agreed on what they could be turning lead into gold whipping up an elixir that guaranteed immortality seers who could tell the emperor everything that was happening in every corner of the tigarezun rumors none that connected taguiloa and the others with the escape tungjii took branns plot and made it better bringing the rain clown on them so they were shut up in maratulliks house for the whole night impossible they could have any connection with the escape his mind told him be easy the hand knows where we were he cant suspect us his gut replied that were so clearly out of it might be just the thing to make him suspect us he doesnt need proof to maul us about all he needs is suficient malice and a shred of suspicion taguiloa kicked a chair across the room stalked after it and jerked the door open startling a maid into dropping a pile of dirty towels he gathered them up for her and sent her down to find him some sandwiches and a pot of tea youre nervous as the fleas on a dead dog jassi set her fists on her hips after she deposited the tray on the table by the window narrowed her eyes at him negomas says last night went good what you fussing about this business with the slaves peh taga that happens a halfdozen times a year we spend a few days dodging damn guards then theyll catch the running fools and thingsll settle back the way they were hey you know why they leaving this inn alone cause you here thats why grandda he even had a thought maybe hed let you stay here free well that one he din keep in his head for long she giggled so you got nothin to worry about he dredged up a smile flipped a silver bit to her just nerves jass its the waiting and not knowing she winked at him no sweat taga you got it we see a lot of em here and we know a giggle a sidetoside jerk of her hips and she was gone he pulled the door shut and went back to pacing gulping down several cups of the strong steaming liquid as he paced the hollow in his belly that spurred him into ordering the sandwiches had vanished before jassi came in with the tray helpless thats what he was nothing he could do to change what was going to happen he couldnt remember feeling this helpless since the day fouryearold taga drifted lost in an angry ocean clutching a ships timber sure nobody would ever find him the forts main tower was a dark gray thumb thrusting into the sky sammang stood in the bow glaring at it when he wasnt scanning the water for the constantly shifting sandbars that were the plague of the coast along here the arth slyans were below decks again out of sight and out of the way they crept closer to the fort the sun was a hammer beating down the glare from the water hard and bright hiding the sand until they were almost on it until it was almost too late to avoid jamming the ship into the soft sucking traps they crept along feeling their way through the water the fort was silent no one on the walls no challenges the ship came even with the dark mass silence hot limp cataleptic they slid past into the deeper water the brownish stain from the outflow vanishing into the blue of the open sea sammang drew his arm across his face slapped at the rail turrope rudar reech get those sails up midafternoon a knock he smoothed his hair down composed his face walked with slow controlled steps to the door and pulled it open jassi grinned at him he downstairs again that slave she tapped at taguiloas arm din i tell you he cleared his throat tell him im meditating but ill be down in a breath i give him a jar of the good stuff he happy no sweat she giggled you come down f you want but he din ask to see you he give me this lead seals clanked dully at the ends of the red ribbon tied about the roll of parchment he steadied his hand lifted the roll until he could see the pattern squeezed into the lead the emperors sigil he said softly maratulliks man you said yeah i said you gonna read that taguiloa smiled i am gonna read it he carried the scroll to the window rubbed the ribbon off hitched his hip on the sill and flattened the parchment on his thigh after skimming through the elaborately brushed signs he started at the top and read it again his name the names of the others in the troupe horses wagon props all listed commanded to appear before the emperor and his consort two nights hence under the name players of the left hand they were further commanded to move next day into the rooms provided in meslak maratullik where they would be the emperors resident company he set his hand on the notice grinned at jassi command performance before the emperor she slapped her hand on her thigh din i tell you din i din i that you did jass tell papa jao to lay on a feast tonight everyone in the inn and all the players in the quarter you can fit at the tables scoot he watched her swing out laughing and excited shouting the good news as she clattered down the stairs then frowned at the parchment he had no intention of spending the rest of his life in this deadalive steambath of a city breaking loose would take some tricky maneuvering though he couldnt just pick up and leave seshtrango send the man boils on his butt and a plague of worms he sighed brann and harra would have to get to maratullik somehow change his mind or well thats for later maybe hes not so hot to keep hold of us just wants something to distract the emperor from the way his security chief had lost a clutch of slaves the troupe was a toy to dangle in front of him brann do i owe this to you like all the rest he tossed the parchment roll on the table and settled himself into a corner of the room to do his breathing exercises and meditate himself back into the calm he needed to handle what was happening another late afternoon the troupe turns onto the lakefront avenue this time passing through the gates of maratulliks meslak guards before guards behind slave on a cranky white mule lake water turned hard and bright as sapphire shards the sun burning hot in a cloudless sky rumbling past slaves trotting on late errands who cringe into the walls and watch the procession nimble along air burning in taguiloas throat catching there when cymanacamal rumbles and belches a gout of steam the walls the stone blocks of the paving creak beneath and around him no wind the latening day is so still every sound is a slap against his ears ominously still once the noise of the mountains stirring has subsided premonition sits like an ulcer in his belly he tells himself it is preperformance jitters this is perhaps the most important performance of his life not because he will be dancing before the emperorhe has few illusions about the quality of the emperors appreciation and a deepseated hina resentment of all temuengs especially those in positions of powerit is important because it will determine the course of the rest of his life he sits with the reins draped loosely through his fingers letting the cob pick his own pace a willed naysaying in his head nothing is going to go wrong disaster will not happen nothing happened in the hands house before that crowd of louts nothing will happen when they perform before a court certain to be better mannered brann riding in front of the cob jaril perched behind her yarilhound running beside her her dun is restive jerking his head about drawing his black lips back baring long yellow teeth harra riding beside the wagon strain showing on her face naysaying again he will not see that strain will not look at her again linjijan sitting up for once fingering his practice flute shifting continually even linjijan the selfabsorbed is restless and uneasy about what he will not think about linjijan the palace gates open to take them in an understeward led them to a room opening off the audience hall where they would be performing and left them to get ready after telling taguiloa that the hall was being prepared as he requested matting on the floor low stools for the musicians a screenedoff area to retire behind when one or the other of them wasnt on stage there were screens here also set up at the far end of the long narrow room dressing rooms of a sort along one wall two coppers of hot water simmered on squat braziers with soft white cloths heaped high on small tables beside the braziers fine white porcelain basins beside the towels taguiloa smiled as brann went immediately to the basins ran her fingers over them hunting makermarks against the other wall nearer the door a long low table with pots of tea wine jugs fingerfood in elaborate array runners of braided reed taking the chill off the stone floor a scatter of plump silk pillows the hand must have enthused wildly about them brann felt a touch of pleasure in taguiloas evident delight a touch of satisfaction at this indication of the troupes high repute but pleasure and satisfaction drained rapidly out of her as had all feeling since her folk left with sammang except for an occasional twinge of uneasiness when she thought of what slept within her she sang to it at night sleep slya slya sleep yongala dances dreams for you and hoped the god would sleep until brann took them both back to the slopes of tincreal in spite of the lethargy that seized on her the past three days shed struggled to present her usual face to the world grateful to taguiloa and the others for giving direction to her life when every other purpose had been stripped from her having to stay with the troupe and perform with them meant it would be a while longer before she had to make painful decisions about what she was going to do with the rest of her life it was an interlude when she could relax enjoy the approval of audiences the friendship of taguiloa harra and negomas and the comforting indolence of linjijan and let life flow about her undisturbed and unexamined she stripped took the dance robe jaril handed her and wriggled into it smoothed it down over her breasts and hips enjoying the slide of the silk against her skin pleased by the way it clung and showed off the body beneath im getting very vain she told jaril giggled at the face he made taguiloa dressed quickly pulling on a crimson silk body suit tied a broad gold sash about his waist began spreading the white paint over his face a commotion at the door he turned toward the curtained arch smoothing the white onto the back of one hand and between his fingers the drape billowed violently a tall thin girlchild stalked in followed by a sevenfoot guard three steps in she stopped and looked around with arrogant inquisitiveness hot yellow eyes landed on taguiloa i am ludila dondi she said sister of the consort he bowed damasatirajan she stared at him as if she expected more from him but he felt safer silent so he continued to wait mute as the huge guard who stayed half a pace behind her she brushed past him took up the jar of facewhite poked her finger in it then wiped the finger on the wall dropped the jar without bothering about where it fell by luck it landed upright on one of the pillows annoyed but forced to keep silent taguiloa caught up the jar and set it back on the table stood watching as ludila dondi sauntered about the room poking and prying into everything she slapped a heavy hand on a drumhead ignored the alarm on negomas face as she beat harder and harder on the skin laughing at the booms she produced negomas bit his lip and said nothing but his brown eyes were eloquent she gave the drum a kick he caught it as it toppled and scowled after her as she strolled to harra are you the seer she put her hands on narrow hips and scanned harra from head to toe with insolent thoroughness no damasaorajan i am the dondi ketcha she turned slowly glaring about the room wheres the seer i want the seer brann stepped around the screen and bowed antipathy sitting sour on her stomach when she straightened she watched the dondis face change the temueng girl felt it too hate at first glance she was very young long thin arms long thin legs black hair hanging loose elaborate earrings in longlobed ears small mirrors bound in silver a mix of some sort ternueng plus something else and dangerous for all that she was a child she was empowered warning plucked at branns nerves then she felt the god stirring in her and forgot everything else no she thought fiercely no you dont you dont ruin tagas lifeno she drew in on herself pushing the godforce flat the dondi walked around her nostril lifted in a sneer you real or fake i am an entertainer oh sabr the dondi brann was pleased but rather surprised at how cool and controlled she sounded which would you prefer the dondi prowled about her with awkward adolescent ferocity tugging at branns hair pinching her breast poking a finger into her stomach drawing a hand down the curve of her hip treating her like an animal on the block brann felt no anger only a deeper and more intense loathing bored with the lack of reaction the dondi stepped back prophesy oh seer certainly satir the dondi brann lifted her arms pressed her hands together to make a shallow bowl place your hand on mine please which hand whichever you choose sit amp the dondi the choosing is part of the reading the dondi looked at her hands started to extend the right toward brann then snatched it back nol she wheeled and stalked from the room followed by the mute guard brann shivered and looked sick taguiloa came to her touched her shoulder with his unpainted hand what was that about i dont know brann shuddered i think she was just curious or sniffing at us to see what we were she went silent for a breath or two i shouldnt have come here taga should have sprained my ankle or something couldnt do that not with maratullik breathing down your neck he soothed her though he agreed with her wishing hed thought of it himself but he didnt want anxiety tightening her muscles and perverting her timing make them drool bramble make them pant for what they cant get make them forget youre anything but a woman she shook her head laughed all right all right taga i get the message good he went back to the table and began smoothing the white paint over his other hand branns dance went well no one jumping up to denounce the fire as demonbred or accuse her of running off with imperial slaves applause when she finished was enough to show some interest but not great enthusiasm taguiloa relaxed as the dance went on satisfied that the dondis visit was an aberration not an indication that anyone here had serious questions about them one thing bothered him it was a dead house temuengs were sitting like stumps out there barely could stir up a flash of response he rubbed at the nape of his neck just meant more work that was all the audience hall was a huge barrelvaulted room large enough to hold the quarters market square and have space left over hundreds of glass and gold lamps were clustered along the walls and hanging on gilded chains from the ridge of the vault swinging slightly in the drafts painting a constantly shifting web of shadow on the floor and on the forms of those seated about the dance mat from the look of the crowd most of the meslar lords in durat royal abanaskranjinga sat on a carved and gilded throne on a dais a doubledozen steps above the floor behind him a carved and gilded screen taguiloa caught glimpses of dark figures moving behind the screen probably the emperors wives and concubines and some of his older children his present consort sat six steps below him her head even with his knees on a cushion by her feet was a young boy a stiff determined look on his round face no more than four or five he was the chosen heir at present the favorite among old krajings many sons closest to the dais were none of the meslars but a number of darkclad temuengs with the same mix in them as in the dondi behind them a clutch of men and women wearing heavy brown robes with cowls pulled forward so their faces were hidden in shadow tacuiloa finished his clown dance and bowed avoiding the emperors hungry black eyes eyes that caressed him seemed to devour him during the dance the emperor had laughed and slapped his thigh bent and whispered in his consorts ear hungry hungry eyes no wonder maratullik wanted a distraction to take the emperors gaze off him taguiloa bowed again and ran behind the screen brann brought him a cup of tea and a towel its going well she whispered hana came behind the screen for her hoops and fingerbells its going well she whispered then looked from one to the other as they broke into hastily stifled ogees fools she said amiably and turned to wait for her cue clinking the small gong to let linjijan and negomas know she was ready taguiloa sipped at his tea and gazed at brann she was wound so tight that another turn would shatter her he kicked a pillow across to her sat beside her after a moment he closed his hand over hers it was damp and cold and oakhard whats wrong i dont know i dont its like the air is pressing in on me not jitters exactly i dont know silence awhile they sat quietly listening to the music the scrape of harras feet the clink of her bells who are those brownrobes i dont know im frightened taga he patted her hand but said nothing reassuring lies wouldnt do here he was too disturbed himself hed awakened the emperor from his torpor and wrung laughter from him he had a sense of approval flowing from the audience but all the reponses out there were just a hair off nothing he could put his hand on nothing he could ignore either he was elated with his success and furious he couldnt enjoy it without this other thing niggling at him the music stopped a ripple of applause harra came stalking behind the screen moving with frustrated ferocity stripping the bells from her fingers the hoops from her arms theyre half dead out there id rather yestereves louts setting the bells and hoops on a table with angry precision she went scowling to the teatable she poured herself a bowl gulped it down poured another that was not an experience i want to repeat she sighed and sipped then lifted the bowl in a mock toast luck to your feet taga youll need it she shivered set the bowl down time to get back out there he felt the growing deadness of the audience when he wheeled out it dragged at him drained his energy as if the black temueng eyes and the yellow eyes of the mixes were mouths pressed against his flesh consuming him as he danced for them he forced himself to go on though his limbs felt leaden and his edge was gone he pulled in took fewer chances and even then felt he danced on the rim of a precipice the music changes taguiloa falters covers tries to go on a hot force takes his body moves his feet in a complex pattern across the dance mat a rumbling in the ground below the palace the lamps sway and flicker the shadows dance in broken webs across the floor and the faces of the silent watchers brann comes from behind the screen dances toward him her feet moving as his feet move her hair is white and shifting about her head as if windblown though the air is heavy thick still her face is strained and pale she moves with a stiff resistance that matches his own moves into the dance with him weaving a pattern about and through the pattern he is weaving moving gets easier for both of them themusic grows wilder and wilder the walls groan the temuengs sit frozen abanaskranjinga shifts about on his throne tries to stand beats his meaty fists on the throne arms the dance goes on inexorable as the passage of seconds into minutes minutes into hours the consort struggles to leave her chair panting and squealing as her body failsto answer her will brann and taguiloa touch and retreat swing away from each other swing back loop out converge dance wheeling away the brownrobes shrink together a mudgeyser surging and bubbling heads bobbing up and down throats throwing out a whining moan that is barely louder than the music they struggle to escape tugging and pulling at the forces binding them but they cannot like flies in honey they cannot pull away the drums beat louder louder louder negomas fierce and frightened half lost in the music his long black hands stroking and beating working as if they belong to someone else the flute sings harsh piercing dissonances that tug painfully at the rolling rumble of the drums denying its singing nature screaming its pain linjijan sways eyes closed entirely bound into his music hana slaps chords and runs from the daroud her eyes wild whiteringed her mouth pulled back and down the sound builds and builds filling the hall melding with the moans of the watchers the ragesqueals and growls from the emperor and those around him the walls sway and groan the floor slides back and forth branns feet come down solid and steady she circles taguiloa sweat runs down his face his eyes have a glazed sheen he touches her hand his flesh is cold and damp he swings away flute shrieks drum goes toomtoom daroud jangles the music stops sudden silence slya streams forth from brann takes form in the center of the mat gasps sighs a wind of sighs passing around the room the great red figure stood planted on the mat wisps of smoke from the smoldering cloth rising about legs like mountain pines coiling up around the lavish fiery female form one pair of arms crossed beneath her high round breasts the second set curved out as if to gather in all those about the throne her hot red eyes glared at the emperor mine she roared and the building shook some more you dare put your stinking hands on my people you mess with slya fireheart me she reached out and out fingers extending and extending two arms reaching four arms reaching fingers long and longer gathering in the brownrobes and the temueng mixes three to a handful ignoring the banes they cast at her plagues and poisons castfire and demon familiars all the kadda power and kadda skills their unnaturally extended parasitic lives had given them me me you attack me she squeezed stench of roasting flesh and burning cloth shrieks blood and other body fluids oozing between her fingers raining onto the floor and those remaining she flung the mess aside and started to reach again a round bald figure in dusty wrinkled black was suddenly there pushing the long fingers aside tungjii patted the back of the huge red hand grinned up at the ominous figure not the boy little darling not the boy slya glared at him hair stirring like serpents about her head then brann astonished taguiloa wearily appreciative the raking fingers shrank red eyes rolling red teeth showing in a broad grin slya patted the double god on hisser plump buttocks in a voice like the groaning of a mountain she said since you ask it tuti huge face returning to a savage scowl she turned her hot red gaze on abanaskranjinga you her voice the howling of a storm wind the roar of a forest fire you fool believing kadda promises one hand closed about him she squeezed his hoarse scream broke of abruptly though his arms and legs continued to writhe even after his body fluids began to drip on the marble steps hah lardarse attacking me brann wrapped her arms about her legs dropped her head on her knees relieved in a way to have the waiting over drowning in a vast lassitude she wanted to stretch out on the mat and sleep and sleep and never wake taguiloa sat on his heels breathing hard watching the flamered giant drop the squashed mass of the emperor of tigarezun ruler of temueng and hina a mess of charred meat bone and slime thats it then i gambled and lost he managed a tired smile as he saw linjijan gaping at the god even linji understood his life was being trampled under those large but shapely red feet slya flung the body of the consort aside and ripped the screen from behind the throne she winnowed through the women and children trapped there in the spell woven by the dance and the music plucking out and crushing some brushing others aside tungjii caught up the weeping boy and carried him over to taguiloa and brann heesh lowered hisserself to the tattered mat and sat placidly watching the god hunting down her enemies squashing and roasting them his eyes filled with sardonic amusement cheering her on with broken murmurs slya raked immaterial fingers through the palace and extended them until they swept garden and stable searching out and pulling to her all the kadda folk cuddling the heir against hisser plump bosom with one hand tungjii reached out with the other and stroked it over branns silky hair the touch warm and comforting one of ems going to get away heesh murmured that tricky little nit that came nosing about you you better watch out for her heesh stroked some more hisser hand feeling like her mothers steadying calming understanding you want to know wh all this brann sighed straightened her back and her cramping legs looked round at himmer yes glemma child the consort that was shes the reason ambitious got to be head oompah of the kadda meld wanted more tried to tap the fireheart ofcynatnacarnal ran into slya who brushed her off like a pesky fly which embarrassed her and made her maddern a cat in a sack made her think too she teased old krajink into marrying her and when she had him fast she made him kadda like her happy enough to do it old fool thought he was going to live forever and be young and handsome while he was doing it brought the meld here they tried again all of them stung slya woke her up some and cynamacamal rumbled and shook and spouted some hot rock scared them they wanted hostages to make red slya behave so she whispered into krajinks ear and teased him into sending his armies to take croaldhu and then round up the arth slyans and bring them here she thought she could hide behind them when she tried again to drive slya from cynamacamal then all the fire mountains thought she could make herself a god lot of lies told people had to be convinced it was a good idea to bring the slyans here you heard most of those lies and me brann looked at the worn smiling face of the little god and the children she touched yarils pale blond head then jarils look at slya they cant do a thing against her all the kadda can do is die why all that happened the kadda melds a lot strongern it looks little bramble falling apart now because red slya sneaked up on it trapped it before it could get going glemma and her crew threw up barriers that blocked our friend when she tried to get into the palace and stomp them they were more than she could handle without getting a jump on them though if you ask slya fireheart shed deny any limit to her powers claim she didnt act because shed have to harm the silly little mortals clustered about the roots of carnal tungjii chuckled we all have our pride bramlet anyway she used you and my gifted friend here he nodded at taguiloa who listened angrily but with interest to sneak her in past the barrier used you to spin the sticky web that caught the kadda and kept them from uniting against her clever when she wants to be our fiery dame slya straightened wiped her four hands down her naked sides burning the ooze off them four hot red fists on her smooth hips she looked around smiled and started to fade no brann leaped to her feet enraged not yet you dont she caught hold of the gods leg cried out as it seared her palm but didnt let go no she screamed you owe me you cant run out like that you owe me slya looked down at her made to brush her away again tungjii caught slyas hand heesh patted it an affectionate scolding look on hisser round face listen to her sweeting shes right you know you owe her a hearing the fiery fearsome god bridled like a girl the first time she came into mixed company after her passage rite it was such a startling sight brann almost forgot what she wanted to say almost forgot the children she cried as her anger came back send them home youre done with them why leave them away from kin and kind they dont belong here send them home and theres taga and his troupe why ruin them why leave them to face the mess you made you owe your triumph to us slya fireheart you used us make things right for us or the world will know you are worse than the worst of the kadda slya spat a gout of fire that took out a section of wall world what is the world to me nothing am i nothing slya turned that fearsome red gaze on her impersonal indifferent mildly angry yes brann shuddered drew a breath closed her eyes a moment searching for argument without much hope then im your nothing she shouted at the god she waved a hand at the temuengs beginning to stir about the fringes of the room will you let them crush me will you let them laugh and say slya lost half her chosen folk and let another dribble through her fingers slya looked thoughtful then her red eyes brightened with a sly malice that turned brann cold in spite of the heat radiating from the god true voice like lava bubbling my nothing she looked around her eyes lighting finally on maratullik who was calmer than most watching the destruction with an indifference equaling hers a hot finger stabbed at him you touch my nothing and camal will burn you to ash camal will bury you in hot stone so deep mayfly mortals will forget a city was ever here she stamped her foot the walls groaned and the floor juddered beneath them there she said complacently and once again began to lose solidity the children brann shrieked at her and taguiloa slya laughed a highpitched titter that cracked the walls i like you little nothing i make you a bargain i offer you two choices you choose which either i send the children home and change you back and forget about the dancer and his folk let them struggle to survive how they will or i protect the dancer and his folk for the rest of their mayfly lives torch anyone who tries to harm them and i forget about you and the children choose little nothing which will it be brann looked from taga to linji ilarra negomas to yaril and jaril crouching at her feet looked deep in the crystal eyes remembering yaril hunched and sad over the fire in the burntout storehouse when they were running from the temuengs on croaldhu remembering the closeness theyd shared the times theyd rescued her remembering also all the lives of men and beasts shed taken to feed them thinking of all the lives shed have to take for them if they stayed looked again at taga and the troupe all of them in this mess because of her her responsibility she lifted her eyes to the mighty figure rising high before her writhing red hair brushing the ceiling lamps a pleased smile showing the tips of square red teeth she said shed change me back i could go home the desire to be again what she had been at the start of summer to be back among her folk beginning her apprenticeship with her father that desire raged in her shouted at her back with her father learning his craft struggling to make a thing as fine as the dasn vuor pot and its hundred bowls her father she could see his calm brown eyes gazing at her affectionate understanding but implacable she could hear him speaking to her saying see your actions through brambleallthorns what you have done you must answer for i dont want to see you if you abandon your friends sick and angry she fisted her hands forced her head up so she was staring into the shallow red gaze of the god taguiloa she cried she wanted to explain why but she did not thats my choice let the children stay with me she finished and could say no more slya laughed several lamps shattered and spilled their burning oil onto the sluggishly stirring meslars and their companions so be it little nothing you out there hear me any of you contemplating harm to these folk of mine i name them taguiloa harra hazhani unman negomas see them hear this also contemplate or cause harm to them and you burn so she ran her red gaze over the temuengs stared a long moment at the hand moved on to a magistrate trying to straighten his tangled robes he had just time to look up startled then he was a torch hot enough to melt the stone beneath his feet ash and cinders a second later in a puddle of congealing stone slya laughed more lamps broke and a pillar cracked she stretched her four arms yawned melted into nothing tungjii calmed the wailing child heesh held on hisser knee set him down and beckoned to maratullik take your new emperor and serve him well hand hes your luck now make the most of him his fortunes and yours are paired heesh grinned at the calmfaced ternueng enjoy yourself web spinner maratullik permitted himself a small tight smile took the boys hand and led him away tungjii rolled onto hisser feet patted taguiloas head you too taga enjoy yourself over hisser shoulder he called to maratullik web spinner you better believe slya means what she says heesh chuckled she likes to burn things you know the chuckle lingering behind himmer heesh faded into nothing brann looked down at her charred palm already pink with new skin then at the space where tungjii had been that old fox she glared at taguiloa i am so damn tired of jerking through the sneaky plots of every damn god around i am so damn tired of being lied to and kicked around and having no idea whats really going on haaah tungjii taguiloa nodded absently his eyes following maratullik i told you bramble heesh is the family patron maratullik was busy talking in a low voice with several of his minions sending them scurrying on errands watching with cold amusement as the other meslars crept away from the hall hurrying to get away from the destruction and begin their own machinations as soon as a hina nursemaid led the childemperor off he walked over to taguiloa youve made things interesting hina taguiloa shrugged youll keep a still tongue about it you and your troupe why not if its to my profit dont count too much on your firebreathing patron if you prove too troubling a nuisance someone will find a way to remove you taguiloa smiled at him want to state that a bit more directly he laughed dont threaten me hand he moved his shoulders straightened his back feeling as if hed cast off a worn and cramping garment hear me temueng i dont give shit about you or your games im a player not a courtier what i want is to go back to silili with the emperors sigil so i can do the kind of dances i want before the fools who think that sigil means something youre insolent hina yes saх jura meslar taguiloa drawled the honorifics until they turned into insult you really dont care do you no you could use your protection to wield a lot of power hina i dont want a thing you want temueng maratullik narrowed his eyes oddly enough i think i believe you i dont understand you but i believe you he beckoned a guard to him get some slaves and see they pack up the players things then take an empushad and escort them to my house see them settled in he cut off the guards response turned back to taguiloa get out of here now get out of durat by sundown tomorrow with pleasure the sigil ill have the patent delivered to you before you leave anything else another way i can serve you there was a warning in the clipped words the hand had been pushed about as far as he was willing to go what about a barge and an empushad of imperial guards to keep us safe going south maratullik ground his teeth together his face got red breath snorted through his nose he couldnt speak he opened his mouth a grating sound came out taguiloa laughed never mind just wondering well take care of ourselves he turned and sauntered out the others trailing silently contentedly behind him the guard bringing up the rear of the procession harm had slipped on her finger bells and after a few steps started up a jaunty beat whistling a tune to match it turning their exit into a triumphal march moving on brann gave the pot a final burnishing and set it in its velvet nest she closed the lid and eased the flat little hook into its eye have to tell chandro to drop this off at perando for me she smiled sailing man like my sammang like another few ive known ive definitely got a weakness for them these sailing men she looked up as she heard the squawk of an albatross dipping low over the ship yaril commenting on something probably another ship hope its not trouble out of silili couldnt be not yet they wont have sorted out the mess in the tekoras palace yet she slid down in the chair until her neck rested on the top slat swung her feet onto the table and crossed her ankles lay stretched out contemplating the ceiling beams dismissing the recent events in silili thinking about her quest and its end a strange time that was gods and mortals jostling and elbowing each other all wanting something different getting in each others way scattering lies like seeds at spring planting nothing exactly what it seemed the ship heeled over suddenly the chair tottered and fell dumping her onto the floor she scrambled to her feet and rushed to the table caught the box before it tumbled off that was close sandbar i suppose they come and go round here what yaril was yammering about more than likely she stroked her hand across the smooth lacquer into the chest with you she tucked the box into the heavy seachest at the foot of the bed got dressed went out to hunt down the cook and get something to fill the hollow under her ribs a last notethe end being also a beginning the jade king drew the sword from its sheath smiled at the new bloodmarks on the blade curse still healthy very good he beckoned to his vizier pay her and that was the end of that she went out wondering who he was going to give that sword to and why he had to be so devious another mystery to add to those things shed probably never know brann went wandering through the jadehalimm market it was famous through half the world as much for the look of the place as for the rarities sold there a spacious sunny place with ancient vines coiling over equally ancient lattices living walls for the market stalls that were handed down from father to son mother to daughter they kept herds of small green lizards to eat the ivy clean of insects and sponged dust off the leaves every morning so these shone like the jade that gave the city its name she saw a potters stall and stopped to look over the wares picked up a simple unglazed cup ran her fingers over it made of a clay strange to her a pleasant redbrown thin tough with a satisfying solidity she held it and felt a shock of recognition a rightness so strong it burned like fire through her the stallkeeper a handsome young woman was busy with another customer brann fidgeted impatiently caressing the cup as she waited liking it more the longer she held it when the woman came to her she held it up who made this my grandfather kuralyn dayan acsic does he take pupils she set the cup down with great care so tense she was afraid of breaking it yes you would like to meet him yes she sighed then smiled yes very much indeed
