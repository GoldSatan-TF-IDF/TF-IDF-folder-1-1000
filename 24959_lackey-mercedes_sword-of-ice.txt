trained animals programmed computers and been a bodyguard to celebrities and princesses his hobbies include sailing scuba diving motorcycling aviation aikido and falconry yes hes a reallife hawkbrother prose and music however remain his highest passions he lives near tulsa with a cougar a bobcat two german shepherds and of course a mews full of hawks and falcons downwind the voice in savils head demanded and savil followed in the direction of the falcon as it changed trajectories the huge bird pulled its wings in tightly now an arrow slicing through the sky hurry the raptor pleaded and savil felt the urgency in the falcons mental message if only it could give me more than vague concepts savil mumbled imprecations under her breath as she scrambled over yet another boulder in this miserable craggy landscape all at once as if in answer to her unspoken wish savils mind flooded with images sensations of speed overwhelmed her as her vision was superseded by the birds point of view as it twisted and gyrated plummeting recklessly from the heavens vertigo swept savils footing from beneath her she scrambled blindly now her fingers clawing desperately at the granite face struggling for purchase as she slid down the side dangerously close to a ledge shut it down center she reminded herself this is novice stuff regain control in an instant savil was back in charge of her perceptions then she slowly let the birds sendings back in until they were vaguely superimposed on her true sight she couldnt see a man yet but from the birds eyes she could see what lay over the next rise rock scorched and molten trees burst their trunks still smoldering the scene was one of rampant havoc implying power turned loose to run wild in a way that sent atavistic chills up her spine and then the falcon swiveled around one last boulder kicking its feet out before its body the bird flared its long pointed wings and set down gently upon firm ground or what in her minds eye savil could see the falcon looking in what must be her direction the raptors sure steady gaze finding her amidst the mass of upthrown debris still quite some distance off but the birds vision was wavering rising and falling and then the falcon cast its gaze downward and savil saw the burned face of a man the rising and falling must mean shes perched atop his chest hes alive and breathing though the gods only know why her resolve hardened savil reached out with her special gifts locating the man and probing swiftly and delicately at his mind gently she pulled back a layer of unconsciousness moving deeper and pulled back as if stung this man this strange one somehow linked with a hawk was able to function while the full raw power of a major node of magical energy flowed in and through his body though still young savil was decidedly a master a full heraldmage and she could not do that for even an instant he must be like a sword of ice to channel such power and still be alive savil thought to herself still wondering what peculiar sort of being it was which she was being called to aid savil scrambled across the tops of the last few boulders and began climbing down into what used to be a mountain glade tayledras beloved savils companion spoke into her mind this is a hawkbrother until kellan had mindspoken savil had all but forgotten her companion amidst the excitement and shock of a birdseye view of flight as she was reminded savil realized kellans voice had been conspicuously absent during the usurpation was blocked kellan pouted feigning a sulk by your whirlwind rapport with that bondbird creature oh really and just how did that come about savil thought to question her companion further but the descent was over and she had other concerns now before her were the charred breathing remains of the only hawkbrother she had ever seen so badly wounded was he that savil was barely certain where to start something had ripped down the hawkbrothers side scorching and cauterizing flesh as it apparently continued from his shoulder to the ground it seemed to be a lightning strike but that was simply not possible no man could have survived even that one blow let alone the other tears and rips in this mans flesh and the agonizing burns across his skin as savils hands cleared his clothing from the wounds her mind sent him energy healing energy essential to his survival though she was no healer the going was slow as she gingerly pulled the fabric from the hawkbrothers devastated form the power was still flowing through him somehow and savil knew better than to attempt to touch him or his fragile dangerous mind again without warning the bird let out a scream from deep within its throat startled savil pulled away and turned to look at the huge falcon when she looked back again the tayledras eyes were open breathtaking iceblue eyes surrounded by a mass of seared flesh which was healing changing right before her eyes the hawkbrothers gaze met hers for a brief moment then his eyes closed again through the aura of pain which she now realized shed been feeling from him the entire time she could have sworn shed felt the faintest of smiles a myriad of sendings from the bird confirmed what savil had begun to suspect that the tayledras could heal himself better if shed just remain to protect him and continue to transfer energy to him well she said aloud looking down at him it looks as though you and i are going to be together for a while at least i was ahead of my schedule and there wont be anyone missing me for a couple of weeks then she waited for kellan to catch up with her picking his own way through the rocks and prepared for a long vigil throughout the rest of that day and the next she remained close to the stranger imparting as much healing energy as her own reserves would allow she left his side only to gather wood for the nighttime fires and to step behind a boulder to relieve herself she could see a gradual but marked improvement over that first day by the end of the second she sensed he had recovered enough for her to bathe him savils gentle hands lifted the hawkbrothers head and washed his neck and face with the meager supply from her waterskin even more carefully did she move his body from side to side to wash it removing his tattered garb and replacing it with a clean set of whites of her own at no time during those two days did the hawkbrother make movement or sound and his eyes remained shut as if he were locked in a very deep sleep early in the morning of the third day savils routine of preparing breakfast was interrupted once more by the falcons scream when she looked over at the tayledras he was struggling to rise to his elbows savil rushed to help him thank you but you have already done more than enough the tayledras said to her in clear and coherent mindspeech then though not entirely steady in his movements the hawkbrother rose carefully to his feet his bondbird began chittering pleasantly at him his eyes closed again for a moment and he nodded a warm smile upon his lips my friend has been telling me of your vigilance these past few days it would seem that i am in your debt it was a question phrased as a statement the tayledras were reclusive by nature even hostile toward strangers that she knew though little else even though savil had helped him and perhaps she had even saved his life he would probably be suspicious of her motivations by the customs of some of the strange people who dwelled in this wilderness the fate of one not of ones own tribe was usually left to the gods it was not for anyone else to interfere or concern themselves with what happened to strangers that might be the case with the hawkbrother it could be that while he was grateful for her assistance he would also wonder why she had done so and be suspicious of her motives savil noticed his wary mood and was quick to recognize the skepticism in his tone of voice you may start your repayment by telling me the name by which i am to call you she said smiling knowing that to some folk asking for a personal name was tantamount to asking for a weapon to use against them am called starwind he said with much dignity and the falcon you have been in rapport with is my bondbird you might refer to her as my familiar savil stole a quick glance in the direction of the bird and thought to herself that she wished shed had some bit of meat to offer the hawk as if it had heard her the bird launched itself from the stone it had been perched on taking to the sky with swift powerful beats of its wings soon it was circling high above them then all at once the bondbird dropped its head folded its wings and fell scorching straight downward from the sky toward the quarry its powerful vision had spied excited by the hunt the impressions the bird sent were intense once again savil was swept up in the birds aerial pursuit but not enough so that she was unaware of her companion starwind too appeared caught up in the bondbirds sendings his eyes narrowed a hint of fiery temper behind the hooded lids as he watched through the birds keen eyes when the falcon made impact with the prey starwinds fingers clenched just as the bondbirds talons closed on the ducks neck for another few moments savil knew that she and starwind were sharing in the bloodlust the falcon felt in the kill she found she was salivating along with the bird in anticipation of the rich red feast quivering beneath the falcons talons this was such a unique experience that savil allowed herself to remain caught up in it a little longer starwind was first to break from the trance and as she slowly disentangled herself she noted by his reaction that he had suddenly realized that savil had been linked with the bird during the kill as well as he at the same time his knees gave out and he sat down abruptly on the boulder beside him she made no move to help him as it was possible that such a movement could be misinterpreted he stood up again slowly clearly taking stock of himsetf then as though hed decided something of great importance starwind gathered himself and faced savil directly i may trouble you a bit more sister starwind said looking deeply into savils eyes fear i am yet too weak to return to my ekele without help thats hardly surprising savil said gently as she looked back awestruck by the strange beauty of this man im more than a little amazed that you are able to stand at all and id be happy to help you get to your my ekele my home starwind confirmed her guess your ekele then savil continued and you need not call me sister to convince me to do so she flushed a little wondering how he was reacting to her ln fact id rather that you not think of me as your sister though hardly innocent savil had never been so forward with any man before but there was something about this one something exotic and compelling about this starwind that had her heart beating fast her palms breaking a sweat she supposed shed seen it in him the first time he opened his eyes but shed been too busy tending to his wounds then to pay it any heed now though his face all but healed his elegant movements those iceblue eyes and that mane of snow white hair combined to make an irresistible package or perhaps it was just that she had been out on circuit for a very long time or perhaps starwind seemed very well aware of her reaction it is the fever of the bondbird sister he said gently but firmly and i would call you otherwise if i had your name she sighed but made a little resolution that the game was not over yet am savil heraldmage of valdemar chosen by kellan and at your serviceover the next couple of days starwind and his bondbird savil and kellan wove their way carefully through the mountains back to starwinds home the place where his tayledras clan lived when they finally arrived they were met by a small group of tayledras starwinds people all similarly exotic most with the same white hair and iceblue eyes they greeted starwind with warmth and relieved enthusiasm obviously glad for his safe return but kept savil at a goodly distance starwind spoke with them in a light musical language at once similar and different to the few words of shinain she knew apparently explaining how hed come to be hurt and how savil had rescued him at one point in his telling of the tale he must have said something shocking because all of the welcoming party turned at once to look at her their eyes wide in disbelief the group then quickly disbanded leaving the four of them alone again on the way to starwinds home savil had explained the nature of the relationship between heralds and companions starwind had not seemed overly surprised explaining that his people had stories of valdemar and even kept some fluency in the tongues of other peoples accordingly starwind directed kellan toward a meadow rich with herbs and grasses for him to eat before accepting savils assistance in the monumental ascent to the hawkbrothers home that home it was lodged somewhere up in the branches of a tree so huge she could hardly believe her eyes and to reach it one had to clamber up a contrivance that was more ladder than staircase savils one real fear was of heights but somehow she managed to put on a brave front showing no signs of her fear in climbing up into the ekele after only one look out the window though she decided shed prefer to seek lodgings on firm ground the vertigo she experienced while in the lofty ekele was simply too much for her starwind chuckled quietly but unkindly you have the tayledras ability at rapport but not our love of the heights it is merely foreign to you remain here a few days and you will come to cherish the hereabove as we do the mere idea was appalling a few days if i remain here a few days ill be in worse shape than you were when we met savil was already quite dizzy from the climb and getting more nauseous by the moment she could not help it now that she was no longer moving she felt a jolt of fear each time the ekele moved with the wind starwind took pity on her probably because although she could conceal the more obvious signs of fright with jokes she could not conceal her increasing pallor as you wish then i would not care to dwell in a deep cave belowground either he said the hertasi keep some rooms herebelow and you are welcome to make your stay in one of them there are some matters i must attend to affairs of my people with that starwind guided her back down from the ekele and to an oddly constructed building surrounding the trunk of the huge tree which somehow incorporated a warm spring and much green foliage as they walked starwind explained to her about the hertasi and how the sentient elusive lizardpeople tended to the tayledras needs in exchange for protection then he left her to er own devices promising to return within a couple of candlemarks savil used the time to rest and think to take in and shelve away all of the strange wonders shed discovered in the past few days she mindspoke with kellan about it all while he carried on a lively conversation with her savil made note that her companion didnt seem unduly surprised by any of this there are a great many things we know of my love which we are not at liberty to share with you before it is time to do so he said in that infuriatingly patronizing tone he very occasionally used with her it reminded her of her father and brother and how they used to pat her on the head and tell her that she would be told about something when she was old enough and then of course having dismissed the mere female they would go on about their business and never tell her anything at all savil was about to send kellan a scorching retort when all of the exertions of the last few days caught up with her it seemed like far too much effort to go to and besides she wasnt in the mood for an argument so instead of retorting she ignored him even to the extent of partly blocking him out of her mind while she searched for a place to lie down it didnt take long to find a kind of couch built among all the leaves and foliage and she fell into it and then into a deep and sudden sleep the meeting of the tayledras clan had been going on for hours starwind had been severely chastised for having brought savil into the midst not only of ktrevas holdings but into the very heart of the vale outsiders were never brought this far at the most one allowed them a little way into the fringes of clan territory before dismissing them it had caused no small commotion when starwind had argued that hed done no such thing since savil was not an outsider but one who deserved the title of wingsister the elders had called it nonsense and accused starwind of making up such an outrageous claim to justify his actions claimed his desire for this herald was the true cause of his behavior while starwind did have strong feelings for savil it was not the lust the elders suspected although he himself could not have explained the insistent feeling that he must bring this stranger into the very center of ktreva he could only feel it and without facts to bolster the feelings could only rely on thin logic to convince the others i bring this woman he cried out defiantly because she is one of us have i not told you of her rapport with my bondbird what greater testimony can there be than this tell me when has such a thing happened before there began a quiet murmuring amongst the elders though relatively young starwind had proven himself and his worth on numerous occasions he could only hope that they would decide that it would be unfair to take his word lightly it is not that we do not believe you one elder finally confessed but that we have no precedent for such a thing we are an ordered people as well you know never has anyone who was not of our cousinclans the shinain ever been granted the title of wingsib this woman has not even a drop of shared blood with us he set his jaw do we share blood with hertasti with tervardi or kyree with dyheli yet all of these are welcome here the elder sighed starwind you are young and eager for a change that you see as a clear necessity but we are not comfortable when someone wishes to make things change so suddenly this makes us unwilling to accept that which brings changes and it frightens us to think of how different we may one day become the honest wisdom of the elder held them all in silence for some time starwinds mind was running the whole while he had seen inside of savil knew her good heart how could he convince them of this or even get them to depart from the strictness of their ways long enough to look at her objectively the silence was deafening starwind knew if he did not speak up convince them somehow that they would retreat back into the safety of their routines savil should be no is wingsister to ktreva she has proven her worth with her rapport with my bondbird and earned her place by the acts of charity she performed for this member of the clan i speak for her hi claiming that place and challenge you to examine her spirit and say why this should not be so how could he tell them the things he only felt but had no reason to feel that he knew without doubt that this stranger would be important to the future of ktreva and that ktreva would be instrumental in shaping not only her future but that of many many people outside of the hawkbrother lands people that starwind would never see and who would probably never even dream that tayledras were anything but a fable he had never shown any trace of foresight never been able to look into the future without the aid of one who did have that talent he knew he was taking a chance that all of his actions for many years to come would be regarded with suspicion and mistrust if he could not convince them but he knew what he was doing was right and trusted in the wisdom of the elders to overcome their fears how can we know that you are not simply seeing what you wish to see the first elder asked she sleeps and she is too weary to awaken if you do not alarm her starwind said she trusts us you may touch her mind now and from there see into her heart read what you see there see what it is she represents for her own great clan kvaldemar and then tell me if she is not indeed worthy to be named our wingsister even if we find it so another elder spoke what difference will it make tell me starwind ktreva why we should bring her into our clan she has people of her own and the heralds of valdemar are different from us in more ways than they are similar we do not eat the same foods speak the same tongue we do not even swear by the same gods she should be made one of us because she is one of us she and her kind differ from us only in the names by which we swear not to the spirit behind those names he replied stubbornly and because we can learn much from each other the ktreva and this heraldmage in many ways our magic is much greater than theirs yet there are things they can do which we cannot it is my belief that what we learn from each other the combination will be greater than any that we can each of us perform apart another long silence followed each of the elders was considering what starwind had said surely they knew he was right that the ktreva could not live isolated in the pelagirs forever there had even been visions fore sight some of them had experienced which suggested that events in the future would require that they learn to broaden their ways finally the first elder spoke it will cost us nothing to look at this savil you bring us we must at least look before we judge savils sleep was interrupted by dreams memories and nightmares in them she relived experiences from the years since she had first donned whites the moment that kellan had chosen her battles fought in the service of valdemar even passionate feelings for those loved and lost then came a dream of a test a decision she was forced to make three times one which left her frightened exhausted and drained countless hopeless scenarios presented themselves to her over and over again she was forced to decide how to react just as her decision was made the scene would fade and another would take its place each was progressively worse than the last more hopeless more futile and in it she and those around her were suffering greater and greater loss only when the scenario required that she sacrifice kellan her companion did she wake from the nightmare unable to make the impossible choice she woke with a start her own voice screaming to be left alone tears streaming down from eyes wide open in the darkness it was only a dream dearheart kellan consoled her a hideous ugly necessary dream i am fine return to your sleep she was too sleepfogged to take in anything except kellans reassurance too exhausted to question anything kellan said relieved to have kellans voice in her mind she fell back into the embrace of the strange bed and slept until morning if she continued to dream she didnt remember any of it when she awoke she found starwind sitting beside her his hand resting gently on her shoulder she could feel the soft tingle of power as it flowed through him to her good morning wingsister he said cheerfully wind to thy wings wind to thy wings starwind ktreva she answered automatically her head throbbing she wished vaguely that he wasnt being so damned cheerful gods but ive one miserable headache he sobered and looked both contrite and a little guilty forgive me wingsister the elders felt it was necessary she frowned what have the elders to do with my headache then she sat up her own suspicions flaring were your people messing about in my head starwind closed his eyes and spoke quietly into her mind remember all little sister there is nothing to fear with that touch savil suddenly recalled the dreams and sendings shed gotten after the nightmare of sacrificing kellan the knowledge slowing coming forward to her consciousness in a single flash she knew as much about the tayledras as they knew themselves as if she had studied them and their ways all her life the history of the ktreva their philosophies their purpose as entrusted to them by their goddess their mysterious bond with their birds everything given to her including starwinds own memory of the meeting last night every newly gifted memory all rose up and became a part of her as they did her headache dulled and then faded savil lay there unmoving sharing starwinds loving gaze for quite some time they may have lain there for hours longer basking in the communion if a hertasi had not crept in quietly to bring them some fruit without conscious thought she thanked the hertasi who was already leaving in starwinds own tongue then she laughed out loud of the pleasure and strangeness of it all once before in her life she had known the incredible indescribable joy of finding that she belonged somewhere that there were people in the world who welcomed her as one of their own that had been when she became a herald and now it had happened again so this is what it means to be one of you she whispered not entirely shayana starwind replied but you now share the most of it savils eyes had been alight with the joy of the newfound knowledge and abilities of these strange and wondrous people she knew she could now call her own she was overwhelmed by the allpervasive sense of the peace of this place of the serenity of those who lived here after all the conflicts within and besetting valdemar ktreva vale seemed like a vision of paradise and she wanted to remain here forever and as soon as she had that thought she knew it was impossible for a moment her eyes stung with tears you know i cant stay you must know that im a herald first and always will be so of course ashke of course starwind patted her hand to console her it was that which finally convinced the elders of the trueness of your heart but i want to she confessed desperately as starwinds elegant fingers brushed a tear from her cheek i want to stay here live here in this peace we each have our duties wingsister mine is to the land yours to your people neither of us can fully understand the other yet it is so but we can revel in that which we share i believe that this sharing this exchange between us will be of great importance in times yet to come savil nodded understanding remembering the certainty she held in memories now her own shared with him neither of them knew why but the certainty was there as real as if they had absolute facts to prove it to be true there is much yet to learn wingsister and far too little time to learn it in we are now your clan as you are one of us every member of ktreva will do what he can to help you gain the skills that are ours and we know you will share willingly of your ways as well and i feel this will not be the last time that those of ktreva and kvaldemar will share their wisdom she thought about her duty but she had been far ahead of her schedule and there was time a little but there was time where do we start savil asked with your lessons or mine he smiled where both our powers flow from at the nodes then starwind took her hand guiding her to her feet and their journey toward knowledge was begun
