ian rankin standing in anothers man grave prologue i hed made sure he wasnt standing too near the open grave closed ranks of the other mourners between him and it the pallbearers had been called forward by number rather than name six of them starting with the deceaseds son rain wasnt quite falling yet but it had scheduled an appointment the cemetery was fairly new sited on the southeastern outskirts of the city he had skipped the church service just as he would skip the drinks and sandwiches after he was studying the backs of heads hunched shoulders twitches sneezes and throatclearings there were people here he knew but probably not many a gap appeared between two of the mourners and he caught a glimpse of the graveside the edges of the grave itself had been covered with sheets of green cloth as if to mask the hard facts of the matter words were being uttered but he couldnt catch all of them there was no mention of the cancer jimmy wallace had been cruelly taken leaving a widow and three children plus five grandkids those kids would be down the front somewhere mostly old enough to know what was going on their grandmother had given voice to a single piercing wail and was being comforted christ he needed a cigarette how well had he known jimmy wallace hadnt seen him in four or five years but theyd worked in the same cop shop a decade or more back wallace was uniform rather than cid but the sort of guy youd talk to anyway jokes and gossip and the occasional snippet of useful information hed retired six years ago which was around the same time the diagnosis appeared along with the chemo and hairloss borne with his trademark humour maybe so but better to be miserable and alive he could feel the pack of cigarettes in his pocket knew he could back away a few yards maybe hide himself behind a tree and spark up the thought reminded him of schooldays when there had been bike sheds blocking the view from the headmasters window teachers occasionally arrived and asked for a light or a cigarette or the whole damned pack a wellknown figure in the local community well known to criminals hed helped put away too maybe a few of the oldtimers had come to pay their respects the coffin was being lowered into the grave the widow giving cry again or perhaps it was one of the daughters a couple of minutes later it was all over he knew there would be a mechanical digger hidden nearby it had dug the hole and would be used to fill it in again the mound of earth had been covered with more of the green baize cloth all very tasteful the majority of the mourners didnt linger one man face heavily lined mouth permanently drooping stuffed his hands into the pockets of his black woollen coat and approached with the smallest nod of recognition john he said tommy rebus replied with another nod got to be us one of these days eh not yet though the two men started walking towards the cemetery gates need a lift rebus shook his head cars outside traffics a nightmare as per rebus offered a cigarette but tommy beamish told him hed stopped a couple of years back doctor advised me they stunt your growth rebus lit up and inhaled how long have you been out of the game now he asked twelve years and counting one of the lucky ones too many like jimmy get the gold watch and soon after theyre on a slab a cheery prospect is that why you keep working i heard you were in cold case rebus nodded slowly they were almost at the gates now the first of the cars was passing them family members in the back eyes fixed on the road ahead he couldnt think what else to say to beamish different ranks different cop shops he tried to conjure up the names of colleagues they might both have known ach well perhaps beamish shared his difficulty he was holding out his hand rebus shook it till the next time eh so long as its not one of us in the wooden suit with a snort beamish was gone turning his collar up against the falling rain rebus stubbed the cigarette out beneath his heel waited a couple of moments then headed for his car the traffic in edinburgh was indeed a nightmare temporary lights road closures diversions long tailbacks everywhere most of it to accommodate the construction of a single tramline between airport and city centre while stationary he checked his phone for messages unsurprised to find there were none no urgent cases required his attention he worked with the long dead murder victims forgotten by the world at large there were eleven investigations on the books of the serious crime review unit they went as far back as the most recent dating from where there were graves to visit rebus had visited them families and friends still left flowers at a few and the names on any cards had been jotted into his notebook and added to the file to what end he wasnt entirely sure when he turned on the cars cd player jackie levens voice deep and visceral emerged from the speakers he was singing about standing in another mans grave rebuss eyes narrowed for a moment he was back in the cemetery content to be staring at heads and shoulders he reached over to the passenger seat and managed to wrest the lyric booklet from its case the track was called another mans rain that was what jackie was singing about standing in another mans rain time to get your ears checked rebus muttered to himself jackie leven was dead too a year or so younger than rebus they shared a fife background rebus wondered if his school had ever played the singers at football almost the only time kids from different schools might meet it wouldnt have mattered rebus had never been picked for the first team consigned instead to offering encouragement from the frozen sidelines as tackles and goals went in and insults were traded and standing in every bastards rain he said aloud the horn was sounding from the car behind its driver was in a hurry he had meetings waiting for him important people he was letting down the world would crash and burn if this traffic didnt start moving rebus wondered how many hours of his own life he had wasted like this or sitting on a surveillance or filling in forms requisitions and time sheets when his phone pinged with a message he saw it was from his boss thought you said rebus glanced at his watch it was five minutes past the hour twenty more minutes would see him at the office more or less in days gone by he might have had a siren and flashing light he might have pulled out into the oncoming lane and trusted to the fates that he wouldnt end up in a ampe but these days he didnt even have a proper warrant card because he wasnt a cop he was a retired cop who happened to work for lothian and borders police in a civilian capacity his boss was the only member of the unit who was still a serving officer a serving officer and not at all happy about his latest posting nursing the geriatrics not happy either about the three pm meeting and rebuss tardiness whats the rush rebus texted back just to be annoying then he turned up the music repeating the same track as before jackie leven still seemed to be standing in another mans grave as if rain wasnt bad enough ii he shook himself free of his overcoat and let it drip across the floor of the office to the hook on the far wall thanks for taking the trouble cowan said apologies danny daniel cowan corrected him sorry dan cowan was seated on one of the desks his feet not quite reaching the floor exposing a pair of red paisleypattern socks above gleaming black leather shoes he kept polish and brushes in the bottom drawer of his desk rebus knew this because hed opened the drawer one day when cowan was out of the room having already checked the two drawers above it what are you looking for elaine robison had asked clues rebus had replied robison was standing in front of him now handing him a mug of coffee how did it go she asked it was a funeral rebus answered placing the mug to his lips if we can get started cowan snapped the grey suit didnt look right on him its shoulders seemed overpadded and the lapels too wide he pushed a hand defiantly through his hair rebus and robison took their seats alongside peter bliss whose breathing sounded laboured even when at rest but hed had the same wheeze twenty years ago and maybe the twenty before that too he was just a shade older than rebus and had been in the unit longer than any of them he sat with his hands clasped across his prodigious stomach as if daring the universe to spring on him something he hadnt seen before hed certainly seen plenty like detective sergeant daniel cowan and had told rebus as much on rebuss first day with the unit thinks were beneath his station reckons hes too good and the bosses know it and have shunted him here to take him down a peg or three prior to retirement bliss had reached the rank of detective inspector same as rebus elaine robison had been a detective constable and blamed the lack of higher achievement on the fact that shed always put family before career quite right too rebus had told her adding after hed known her a few more weeks that his own marriage had lost its fight with the job early on robison had only just turned fifty her son and daughter had left home graduated from college and moved south for work there were framed portraits of them on her desk alongside other photos showing robison herself posing at the top of the sydney harbour bridge and seated at the controls of a light aeroplane she had recently started to dye her hair not that rebus saw anything wrong in that streaked grey she would still have looked ten years younger than her age and might even pass for thirtyfive same as cowan cowan he reckoned had arranged the chairs they sat in a straight line in front of his desk so that they all had to look up at him wearing those socks for a bet danny rebus asked from behind the mug cowan deflected the comment with a thin smile do i hear right john youve applied to rejoin he waited for rebus to acknowledge the truth of this the retirement age had been raised meaning those of rebuss vintage could reapply thing is cowan continued leaning forward a little theyll come to me for a reference way youre going it wont be a fan letter you can have my autograph anyway rebus assured him it was hard to tell if peter blisss wheezing had just taken on a different timbre or whether he was stifling a laugh robison looked down into her lap and smiled cowan shook his head slowly can i remind you all he said quietly that this unit is jeopardised and if it closes down only one of us will be welcomed back into the body of the kirk he pointed a finger at his own chest a result would be nice progress of any kind would be nice they all knew what he was talking about the crown office was setting up a specialist cold case unit for the whole of scotland if it scooped up their workload their jobs would be history the ccu would have at its heart a database of ninetythree cases dating back to the s including all the ones from the lothian and borders police authority with the ccu up and running questions were bound to be asked about the usefulness of the smaller edinburgh team money was tight there were already mutterings that dusting off old unsolveds did little but drain cash from current and more urgent inquiries in and around the city a result would be nice cowan repeated he leapt from the desk strode around it and plucked a newspaper cutting from the wall brandishing it for effect cold case unit in england he intoned suspect charged for the murder of a teenager committed almost fifty years ago he paraded the clipping in front of their faces dna crimescene analysis witnesses whose consciences have been gnawing away at them we know how this works so how about making it work he seemed to require an answer but none was forthcoming the silence lengthened until robison broke it we dont always have the resources she countered never mind the evidence hard to apply dna tests to anything when the victims clothing got lost somewhere down the line there are plenty of cases where we do have clothing though arent there and can we demand that every male in a town gives us a dna sample so we can try for a match bliss added how about the ones whove died or moved away in the interim that positive outlook of yours is why i warm to you peter cowan placed the cutting on the desk and folded his arms for your own sakes he said not mine ill be fine and dandy but for your sakes he paused for effect for your sakes we need to make this work there was silence in the room again broken only by blisss breathing and a sigh from robison cowans eyes were on rebus but rebus was busy draining the last of the coffee from his mug iii bert jansch was dead too rebus had seen him play a few solo gigs in edinburgh down the years jansch had been born in the city but made his name in london after work that evening alone in his flat rebus played a couple of pentangle albums he was no expert but he could tell janschs playing from the other guitarist in the band john renbourn as far as he knew renbourn was still around maybe living in the borders or was that robin williamson he had taken his colleague siobhan clarke to a renbournwilliamson concert once driving her all the way to biggar folk club without telling her why when the two musicians stepped on to the stage looking as though theyd just roused themselves from armchairs by a roaring fire hed leaned in towards her one of them played woodstock you know hed whispered he still had the ticket to the biggar gig somewhere tended to keep them though he knew it was just one more thing that would need to be binned when he was no longer around next to his record deck lay a plastic guitar pick he had bought it years back after wandering through a music shop telling the young guy behind the till that he might be back later for an actual guitar the assistant had mentioned that the pick was manufactured by a scotsman called jim dunlop who also made effects pedals in the years since rebus had rubbed all the writing from the pick but had never used it on a guitar of any kind never learned to fly a plane either he said to himself he studied the cigarette he was holding hed undergone a medical a few months back and received the usual warnings his dentist too was always checking for the first signs of anything nasty so far so good every lucky streak comes to an end john his dentist had told him trust me can i get an eachway bet on that rebus had replied he stubbed the cigarette into an ashtray and counted how many were left in the packet eight meaning hed smoked twelve so far today that wasnt bad was it time was hed have finished one lot and broken open another he wasnt drinking as much either couple of beers of an evening with maybe a tot or three of whisky before bed he had a beer open now his first of the day neither bliss nor robison had fancied a drink after work and he hadnt been about to ask cowan cowan tended to hang around the office late they were housed within police hq on fettes avenue which gave cowan the chance to bump into senior officers people potentially useful to him who would notice how he kept a good shine on his shoes and always addressed them properly its called stalking rebus had once informed him having caught him laughing too heartily at an old joke one of the assistant chief constables had been telling in the corridor and i notice you dont pull him up when he calls you dan in a way though rebus felt sorry for cowan there were almost certainly less proficient officers around who had more successfully scaled the heights cowan certainly felt that and it gnawed away at him so that he was almost hollowed out by it the team had suffered as a result which was a pity rebus liked many aspects of the job he felt a small tremor of anticipation whenever he undid the binding from an old case file there might be boxes and boxes each one ready to take him on a trip back through time yellowed newspapers would contain not only reports of the crime but also general stories of national and world affairs plus sport and advertisements he would get elaine robison to guess how much a car or a house had cost in and would read out the football league tables to peter bliss who had a knack for remembering the names of players and managers but then eventually rebus would be pulled back to the crime itself to the details interviews evidence and family testimony somebody thinks they got away with it knows they got away with it he hoped all these killers were out there somewhere growing more ill at ease with each passing year as they read about advances in detection and technology maybe when their grandkids wanted to watch csi or waking the dead they had to leave the room and sit in the kitchen maybe they couldnt bear the sight of newsprint or werent able to listen in peace to the radio or tv news for fear of hearing about the reopening of the case rebus had posited the idea to cowan get the media to report breakthroughs on a regular basis real or not just to put the wind up the culprits something might shake loose but cowan hadnt been keen werent the media in enough trouble already for fabricating stories it wouldnt be them doing it rebus had persisted it would be us but cowan had just kept shaking his head the record finished and rebus lifted the needle from the vinyl it wasnt yet nine oclock far too early to be considering bed hed already eaten already decided there was nothing on tv worth watching the bottle of beer was empty he walked over to the window and stared out at the tenement opposite a couple of children in pyjamas were staring back at him from a firstfloor flat he waved which sent them scampering away now they were circling one another in the middle of their room bouncing on their toes not at all sleepy and he had been dismissed from their universe he knew what theyd been telling him though there was a whole other world out there and that could mean only one thing pub rebus said out loud reaching for his phone and his keys switching off the record deck and amp he noticed the pick again and decided it was coming with him too part one a man disappears down bar steps with a piece of wounded sky he was the only person in the office when the phone rang cowan and bliss had gone to the canteen and robison had a doctors appointment rebus picked up the receiver it was the front desk lady here wants to talk to di magrath then youve got the wrong office she says different rebus watched as bliss came into the room carrying a soft drink in one hand a sandwich in the other and with the edge of a crisp packet clamped between his teeth hang on he said into the receiver then to bliss any ideas about a di called magrath bliss placed the sandwich on his desk and removed the bag from his mouth he started this place he told rebus how do you mean first boss of scru were all his babies in a manner of speaking how long ago fifteen years maybe someone downstairs is looking for him good luck to them bliss saw rebuss look hes not dead or anything took up his pension six years back bought a place up north on the coast di magrath hasnt worked here for six years rebus explained into the mouthpiece can somebody else have a word then he was asked were a bit busy up here whats it about a missing person not really our department she met with di magrath apparently he gave her his card has she got a name rebus asked nina hazlitt nina hazlitt rebus repeated for peter blisss benefit bliss thought for a moment then shook his head what is it she thinks we can do for her rebus asked the front desk wouldnt it be a lot easier for you to ask her that yourself rebus considered for a moment bliss was seated behind his desk breaking open the prawn marie rose sandwich same thing he always brought back from the canteen cowan would soon appear his fingers scented by baconflavour crisps maybe a trip downstairs wasnt such a bad idea five minutes he said into the receiver ending the call then he asked bliss if the office had ever dealt with missing persons you dont think weve got enough on our plates bliss poked a toe against one of half a dozen mustysmelling storage boxes piled next to him maybe magrath worked mispers before he came here regular cid as far as i recall you knew him still do he calls me at home now and again to check scrus still here he was the one who signed me up almost the last thing he did before taking the gold watch after him came eddie tranter and then it was cowans turn are my ears burning cowan walked through the doorway he was stirring a cappuccino with a white plastic spoon rebus knew he would proceed to lick that spoon until not a trace of foam was left on it before depositing it in the bin then he would slurp the coffee while checking his computer for emails and the room would fill with the aromas of smoky bacon and vinegary prawn cigarette break rebus said shrugging his arms into his jacket mind you dont take too long cowan cautioned missing me already rebus asked blowing a kiss and making for the door the main reception area wasnt huge and she was easy to spot being the only person seated on the single row of chairs she sprang to her feet as rebus approached the bag on her lap fell to the floor and she crouched down scrabbling for its contents scraps of paper several pens lighter sunglasses and a mobile phone rebus decided to let her do it unaided then get back to her feet rearrange her clothes and hair and compose herself my names nina hazlitt she told him shooting out a hand for him to shake john rebus he replied her grip was firm several gold bangles dancing on her wrist her reddishblonde hair was cut in what rebus would have called a bob late forties at a guess with laughter lines either side of her pale blue eyes di magraths retired rebus nodded by way of answer and she handed him the business card it was smudged from age its edges curled i did try phoning long time since those numbers were active what brings you here ms hazlitt he returned the card and slid his hands into his pockets i spoke with di magrath in he was very generous with his time the words were tumbling out of her he wasnt able to help in the end but he did what he could not everyone was like that and its no different now so i thought maybe id come to him she paused hes really retired rebus nodded again six years back six years she was staring past him eyes unfocused as if wondering where the time had gone i was told youre here concerning a missing person he prompted her she blinked her way back into the here and now my daughter sally when did she disappear new years eve hazlitt recited no sign of her since the woman lowered her head and gave it a shake im sorry to hear that rebus told her ive not given up though hazlitt took a deep breath and met his gaze thats something i cant do till i know the truth i can appreciate that her eyes softened a little ive been told the exact same thing so many times im sure you have he turned his head towards the window look i was just headed outside for a cigarette maybe you could do with one too how do you know i smoke ive seen what you keep in your handbag ms hazlitt he said ushering her towards the door they wandered along the driveway towards the main road she had turned down his offer of a silk cut preferring her own menthols when his cheap lighter refused to work shed fished in the bag for her zippo dont see many women with these hed commented it was my husbands was he only lasted a year after sally vanished doctors decided it was an embolism they dont like putting broken heart on death certificates sallys your only child hazlitt nodded shed just turned eighteen six more months and shed have finished school university was next she was going to study english tom was an english teacher tom being your husband she nodded house full of books hardly surprising she caught the bug when she was little tom used to read her a bedtime story i walked in on them one night expecting it to be a picture book of some kind but it was great expectations the memory caused her to smile creasing her face although more than half her cigarette remained she flicked it on to the roadway sally and a bunch of her friends had rented some sort of chalet not far from aviemore our christmas present had been her share of the outlay the millennium rebus commented i dont suppose it was cheap it wasnt but it was supposed to be for four people and six of them squeezed in that helped a bit was she a skier hazlitt shook her head i know thats what the towns famous for and at least two of the girls could ski but sally just wanted to hang out theyd been in to aviemore itself got invites to a couple of parties they all thought she must be at the other one there hadnt been a row or anything shed been drinking i would assume so hazlitt buttoned her thin jacket against the chill id expected a phone call at midnight even though i knew the reception on her phone wasnt great at the best of times next morning her friends guessed shed hooked up with someone and was sleeping it off elsewhere she stopped abruptly and met his eyes not that she was like that did she have a boyfriend theyd split up that autumn he was questioned at the time rebus didnt remember the case at all but then aviemore was a long way north of edinburgh tom and i had to travel up to scotland where from rebus interrupted her hed taken it for granted that though her accent was english she lived in the city london she informed him crouch end do you know it rebus shook his head we were lucky toms parents helped us buy the place when we were first married theyd come into some money she paused im sorry i know none of thats relevant youve been told as much he guessed by very many police officers she admitted with another rueful smile so how did you end up talking to di magrath rebus asked genuinely curious i talked to everyone everyone who had time for me di magrath had been mentioned in a newspaper he specialised in unsolved crimes and after the second one she saw that she had his attention and took a deep breath as if preparing for a recitation may a near strathpeffer her name was brigid young she was thirtyfour and worked as a chartered accountant her car was parked by the road it had a flat tyre she was never seen again so many people go missing every year but something made this one stand out well its the same road isnt it is it strathpeffer is just off the a look at a map if you dont believe me right rebus said she gave him a hard stare i recognise that tone it means youre beginning to wonder about me is that a fact she ignored him and ploughed on the third was in on the a itself a garden centre between stirling and auch she frowned the place with gleneagles hotel auchterarder she nodded a twentytwoyearold called zoe beddows her car was in the car park all the next day and the day after thats when suspicions were raised rebus had smoked his cigarette down to its filter ms hazlitt he began she held her hand up to stop him ive heard it too many times not to know what youre about to say theres no evidence no bodies have ever turned up so as far as you lot are concerned theres no crime im just a mother whose reasoning has disappeared along with her only child does that cover it inspector im not an inspector he replied quietly i used to be but these days im retired i work for the police in a civilian capacity outside of cold cases i have no authority which means im not much use to you but what are these if theyre not cold cases her voice had risen and taken on a slight tremor its possible i can think of someone else for you to talk to you mean cid she waited for him to nod wrapping her arms around herself she turned away from him ive just come from there the inspector hardly gave me the time of day maybe if i speak to him first rebus reached into his jacket for his phone not a him a her clarke she said her name was she turned her face back towards him its happened again you see and its going to keep happening she paused and screwed her eyes shut a single tear began to trace its way down her left cheek sally was only the first hey you rebus said stepping out of his car whats wrong detective inspector siobhan clarke turned her head slightly to peer at the building from which shed just emerged bad memories stopping you coming in rebus took a moment to study the dreary twostorey facade of gayfield square police station just got here he explained though in fact hed been sitting in the saab for a good four or five minutes hands playing with the steering wheel looks like youre off out well deduced she gave a smile and took a couple of steps forward pecking him on the cheek howve you been still seem to have that old lust for life meaning booze and nicotine rebus gave a shrug returning her smile but keeping quiet to answer your question she said im taking a late lunch theres a cafe i usually go to on leith walk if youre asking me to join you there are certain preconditions and what might those be no smoky bacon crisps or prawns she seemed to consider this for a moment could be a dealbreaker she gestured towards his saab itll get a ticket if you leave it there theres payparking across the street at one eighty an hour im on a pension remember want to see if theres space in the car park i prefer the whiff of danger that bays for patrol cars ive seen civilians get towed she turned and started back up the steps telling him to give her a minute he realised his heart was beating a little faster than usual and placed a hand over it shed been right about his reluctance to enter his old station it was where hed worked with her right up until retirement half a lifetime as a cop and suddenly the force apparently had no need of him he thought of the cemetery again and jimmy wallaces grave and gave a small involuntary shudder the door in front of him was swinging open clarke waving something in his direction it was a rectangular sign with the words police official business printed on it kept behind the front desk for emergencies she explained he unlocked the saab and placed it inside the windscreen and for that she added youre treating me to a baked potato not just any baked potato either but one filled with cottage cheese and pineapple there were sticky formicatopped tables and plastic cutlery along with paper cups for the tea the drawstring hanging over the side of each classy rebus said fishing out his tea bag and depositing it on the smallest thinnest paper napkin hed ever seen you not eating clarke asked making a professional job of cutting through the skin of her potato way too busy for that siobhan still enjoying the life of an archaeologist there are worse jobs at sea i dont doubt it what about you promotion suiting you workloads no respecter of rank well earned all the same she wasnt about to deny it instead she took a sip of tea and scooped up a forkful of cottage cheese rebus tried to remember how many years theyd worked together not that long really in the scheme of things didnt see nearly so much of one another these days she had a friend who lived in newcastle weekends she was often down there and then there were the times when shed called or texted him and hed made some excuse not to make a meeting never quite sure why even as he sent the message back you cant put it off for ever you know she said now waving the emptied fork at him what the favour youre about to ask what favour is that then cant an old pal just drop by for a catchup she stared him out chewing her food slowly okay then he admitted its someone who came to see you first thing this morning sally hazlitt sallys the daughter he corrected her ninas the one you talked to after which she came running straight to you how did she know know what that we used to be colleagues hed thought for a second that she was about to say close but she hadnt shed opted for colleagues instead just as earlier she had used the word civilians she didnt a guy called magrath used to run scru and she was looking for him a sympathetic shoulder clarke guessed the womans daughter hasnt been seen in a dozen years clarke looked around the cramped cafe to make sure no one was eavesdropping then lowered her voice anyway we both know she should have put it behind her a long time back maybe thats not possible any more but its therapy she needs rather than us there was silence between them for a moment clarke seemed to have lost interest in what remained of her meal rebus nodded towards the plate two ninetyfive that cost me he complained then she seemed to think you brushed her off too readily forgive me if im not always sweetness and light at eight thirty in the morning but you did listen to her of course and and what rebus let the silence lie for a few seconds people were hurrying past on the pavement outside he didnt suppose there was one of them without a story to tell but finding a sympathetic ear wasnt always easy so hows the investigation he asked eventually which one the kid whos gone missing im assuming thats how she ended up speaking to you she told the front desk she had information clarke reached into her jacket and produced a notebook flipped it open to the relevant page sally hazlitt she intoned brigid young zoe beddows aviemore strathpeffer auchterarder she snapped the book shut again you know as well as i do its thin stuff unlike the skin of that potato rebus offered and yes i agree its thin stuff as it stands so tell me about the latest instalment clarke shook her head not if youre going to think of it in that way all right its not an instalment its a misper of three days standing which means theres still a decent chance shell wander home and ask what all the fuss is clarke got up and walked over to the counter returning moments later with an early copy of the evening news the photo was on page five it showed a scowling girl of fifteen with long black hair and a fringe almost covering her eyes annette mckie clarke continued known to her friends as zelda from the computer game she saw the look on rebuss face people play games on computers these days they dont have to go to the pub and put money in a machine theres always been a nasty streak in you he muttered going back to his reading she was taking the bus to inverness for a party clarke went on invited by someone she met online weve checked and it pans out but she told the driver she was feeling sick so he stopped by a petrol station in pitlochry and let her off there was another bus in a couple of hours but she told him shed probably hitch never arrived in inverness rebus said looking at the photo again sulky was that a suitable description but to his eyes it seemed overly posed she was copying a look and a style without quite living it home life he asked not the best she had a record of truancy took a few drugs parents split up dads in australia mum lives in lochend with annettes three brothers rebus knew lochend far from the bonniest neighbourhood in the city but the edinburgh address explained clarkes involvement he finished reading the report but left the paper open on the table nothing from her mobile phone just a photo she sent to someone she knows what sort of photo hills fields probably the outskirts of pitlochry clarke was staring at him theres really not a lot for you to do here john she said not unsympathetically who said i wanted to do anything youre forgetting i know you maybe ive changed maybe you have but in that case someone needs to quash the rumour ive been hearing and what rumour is that that youve applied to return to the fold he stared at her whod want a crock like me a very good question she pushed her plate away from her i need to be getting back arent you impressed by what that i didnt drag you into the first pub we passed as it happens we didnt pass any pubs that must be the answer rebus said nodding to himself back at gayfield square he opened the saab and made to hand her the sign keep it she told him might come in handy then she surprised him with a hug and a final peck on the cheek before disappearing into the station rebus got into the car and placed the sign on the passenger seat staring at it police official business was that grammatically correct what was wrong with official police business or just police he kept looking at that word he had given so much of his life to it but with each passing year he wondered just what it meant and how he fitted theres really not a lot for you to do here his phone was letting him know it had a message for him is it just me or is this turning into a world record attempt for slowest cigarette ever smoked cowan again rebus decided against answering instead he took a business card from his pocket he had swapped it with nina hazlitt for one of his own on one side were the details for di gregor magrath on the other was a scribbled telephone number with hazlitts name beneath it he placed it on the seat next to him tucked under the plastic sign and started the engine it took the best part of a week for the first batch of files to arrive rebus had spent a whole day trying to find the right people to talk to in the right departments of central scotland constabulary and northern constabulary central covered the garden centre near auchterarder though at first rebus had been told hed need to talk to tayside police instead northern covered both aviemore and strathpeffer but these involved different divisions meaning calls to inverness and dingwall it was all about to get simpler allegedly there were plans to merge the eight regions into a single force but this had been no help to rebus as he felt the telephone receiver generate heat under his grip bliss and robison had asked what he was up to and hed treated them to a drink in the cafeteria while he explained and were not telling the boss robison had asked not unless we have to rebus had replied after all one folder looked much like any other didnt it the first to arrive had been dispatched from inverness it smelled slightly of damp and there was a faint bloom on its outer covering it was the file on brigid young rebus spent half an hour on it and rapidly concluded that there was a lot of padding having no leads the local cops had interviewed everyone within reach adding nothing except pages of meandering transcript the photos from the scene shed almost as little light young had driven a white porsche with cream upholstery her shoulder bag hadnt been found and neither had the key fob her briefcase had been left on the passenger seat no diary but there was one at her place of work in inverness shed had one meeting in culbokie and been on her way to another at a hotel on the shore of loch garve she hadnt used her phone to call anyone about the puncture or let the client at the hotel know shed been held up for the simple reason that shed left it behind at her previous meeting the folder included some family photographs and newspaper clippings rebus would have called her handsome rather than pretty a strong square jaw and a nononsense way of looking at the camera as if the photo was just another task to be ticked off her list there was a note to say that the briefcase together with everything else in the car had eventually been returned to the family along with the porsche itself no husband shed lived alone in a house on the river ness mother resided locally in the same house as brigids sister the file had been added to sporadically since there had been an appeal for information on the first anniversary of the disappearance plus a reconstruction on a local tv news programme neither producing any new leads the most recent update consisted of a rumour that brigid youngs business had been in trouble leading to the theory that she could have done a runner when the working day was over rebus had decided to take the file home with him rather than leave it where cowan might find it in his flat he had emptied its contents on to the dining table in his living room soon after hed realised that it made sense not to haul it back and forth to fettes he found some drawing pins in a cupboard and began pinning the photos and newspaper cuttings to the wall above the table by the end of that week brigid youngs photograph had been joined by those of zoe beddows and sally hazlitt and the paperwork took up not just the table but sections of the floor and sofa he could see nina hazlitt in her daughters face same bone structure same eyes her file included pictures of the search that had taken place in the days after her disappearance dozens of volunteers scouring the hillsides along with a mountain rescue helicopter hed bought a foldout map of scotland and added it to the wall highlighting with a thick red marker the route of the a from stirling to auchterarder auchterarder to perth and from there through pitlochry and aviemore to inverness and beyond ending on the north coast at scrabster just outside thurso nothing there except the ferry that would take you to orkney rebus was sitting in his flat smoking and thinking when he heard someone thumping on his door he rubbed at his eyebrows trying to erase a headache that was gathering between them walked into the hall and opened the door whens that escalator getting fixed a thickbuilt shavenheaded man his own age was standing there breathing heavily rebus peered past him at the two flights of stairs he had just climbed hell are you doing here he asked you forgetting what day it is i was starting to get worried about you rebus checked his watch it was almost eight in the evening there was this arrangement they had a drink once a fortnight lost track of time he said hoping it didnt sound too much like an apology i tried phoning you must be on silent rebus explained youre not lying dead on the living room carpet thats the main thing cafferty was smiling though his smiles had more threat to them than most mens scowls ill get my coat rebus told him just wait there he retraced his steps to the living room and stubbed out the cigarette his phone was under a pile of papers switched to silent as he had suspected one missed call his coat was on the sofa and he started to shrug his way into it these regular drinks had begun soon after caffertys release from hospital hed been told that hed flatlined at one point and that rebus had brought him back not the whole truth as rebus had stressed all the same cafferty had insisted on a drink as a way of saying thanks then had arranged for the same thing to happen a fortnight later and a fortnight after that cafferty had once run edinburgh the worst of the city at least drugs and prostitution and protection these days he took either a back seat or no seat at all rebus wasnt sure he knew only what cafferty chose to tell him and could never bring himself to trust the half of it whats all this cafferty asked from the living room doorway he was gesturing towards the display on the wall his eyes taking in the files on the table and floor i told you to wait outside bringing the job home with you never a good sign cafferty hands in pockets entered the room rebus just needed his keys and lighter where the hell were they out he commanded but cafferty was studying the map the a good road that oh aye used it myself back in the day rebus had located keys and lighter both thats us he said cafferty was however in no hurry still playing the old records eh might want to he nodded towards where the needle had reached the runout groove of a rory gallagher album rebus lifted the tone arm and switched off the hifi happy now he asked taxis downstairs cafferty replied these some of your cold cases then none of your business not that you know of cafferty gave rebus that smile again all women though judging by the pictures never my style rebus stared at him what did you use the a for exactly cafferty shrugged flytipping you might call it you mean getting rid of the bodies ever driven the a moorland and forest logging tracks leading to the middle of nowhere cafferty paused beautiful scenery mind some women have gone missing down the years you wouldnt know anything about that cafferty shook his head slowly i could ask around though if you want me to there was silence in the room for a moment ill think about it rebus said eventually then if you did me a favour would that be us square cafferty made to place a hand on rebuss shoulder but rebus shied away lets get that drink he said ushering his visitor back towards the landing it was ten thirty by the time he returned to his flat he filled the kettle and made a mug of tea then returned to the living room switching on just the one lamp and the stereo van morrison astral weeks his downstairs neighbour was old and deaf upstairs was a group of students who never made much noise except for the occasional party through the living room wall well hed no idea who lived there hed never needed to know the area of edinburgh he called home marchmont had a shifting population a lot of the flats were rentals most of them short lets cafferty had made this point in the pub everybody used to look out for everybody else say you did end up on that floor of yours how long would it be before anyone came calling rebus had argued that it had been no better in the old days hed been inside plenty of flats and houses the inhabitant dead in bed or in their favourite chair flies and odour plus bills piling up behind the door maybe someone had thought to knock but they hadnt done much more than that everybody used to look out for everybody else i bet you used lookouts too didnt you cafferty rebus muttered to himself when you were burying the bodies he was staring at the map as he sipped his tea he had driven the a infrequently it was a frustrating road only some of it dualled lots of tourists many of them hauling caravans with regular bends and blind summits making passing difficult lorries and delivery vans struggling up the inclines inverness was just over a hundred miles north of perth but it could take two and a half maybe three hours to drive and when you got there to cap it all you were in inverness one radio dj rebus listened to called the place dolphinsludge there were certainly a few hardy dolphins in the moray firth and rebus didnt doubt that sludge figured too aviemore strathpeffer auchterarder and now pitlochry hed ended up telling cafferty some of the story adding the caveat about coincidence being a strong possibility cafferty had given a thoughtful pout swirling the whisky in his glass the pub had been quiet funny how people tended to finish their drinks and move on whenever cafferty entered an establishment the barman hadnt just removed the empties from their chosen table but given it a bit of a wipe too and the first two rounds had been on the house i doubt i can help much cafferty had admitted i didnt say i was asking for help all the same if it was villains going awol people who might well have fallen out with people they shouldnt have far as i can tell these were just ordinary women civilians you might call them cafferty had begun to outline the sorts of punishment he felt might be deserved should a single culprit come to light and had ended by asking rebus how he felt whenever people got less than they deserved less of a jail sentence less of a punishment not part of my remit all the same think of the number of times you saw me walk free from court or not even make it that far it rankled rebus had admitted rankled as in pissed me off royally pissed me off and made me that bit more determined it wasnt going to happen next time yet here we are sitting enjoying a drink cafferty had clinked his glass against rebuss rebus hadnt said what he was thinking give me half a chance id still put you away instead he had finished his whisky and risen to fetch another side one of astral weeks had finished and what was left of the tea had grown cold he sat down and took out his phone and the card nina hazlitt had given him punching in her number hello it was a mans voice rebus hesitated hello a little louder this time sorry rebus said is this the right number i was looking for nina hazlitt hang on shes here rebus listened as the phone was handed over he could hear a tv playing in the background hello her voice this time sorry to be calling so late rebus said its john rebus from edinburgh he heard an intake of breath have you is there any news nothing like that rebus had taken the plectrum from his pocket and was playing with it in his free hand i just wanted you to know i hadnt forgotten about you ive pulled the files and im taking a look on your own for the moment he paused sorry to interrupt your evening it was my brother answered the phone hes staying with me right rebus said not knowing what else to add the silence lengthened sallys case is reopened then nina hazlitts voice was a mix of hope and fear not officially rebus stressed depends what i turn up anything so far im only just getting started its nice of you to go to the trouble rebus wondered if the conversation would have been so stilted without the presence of her brother wondered too why the hell he had phoned her out of the blue late at night when the only reason for calling could be that there was news of some kind something that couldnt wait until morning filling her with momentary hope false hope well he said ill let you get on thanks again and call any time please maybe not quite so late though eh any time she repeated its nice to know somethings happening he ended the call and stared at the paperwork in front of him nothings happening he muttered to himself placing the plectrum back in his pocket and rising to fix the final drink of the evening the officers name was ken lochrin and he had been retired for three years rebus had been given his telephone number after a bit of pleading lochrins name was in the zoe beddows file he seemed to have done a lot of work on it his handwriting and signature cropped up over two dozen times having introduced himself rebus spent the first five minutes discussing retirement itself swapping stories and explaining how scru worked me i miss the job not one jot lochrin had said complete pain in the posterior by the time i emptied my desk bit frustrating not to get a result on zoe beddows its a lot worse when you feel youre getting close that never happened with her gets to the point where you have to move on unless cold cases is your job of course so youre part of this new crown office initiative not exactly im in a smaller team based in edinburgh then how come zoes turned up on your radar this kid who went missing on her way to inverness zoe was four years ago though all the same rebus liked it that lochrin used beddowss first name it meant shed become a person to him rather than a case number i did wonder about that myself actually what rebus prompted whether there could be a connection but like i say four years there was another in up near strathpeffer rebus said sounds like youve been talking to that woman the aviemore one nina hazlitt daughter went missing on hogmanay you know her i know she used to haunt central hq in stirling after zoe disappeared this isnt just about her though rebus felt it necessary to state theres annette mckie now known by the nickname zelda i read two papers a day gets me out of the house as far as the newsagents id drive the wife daft otherwise i didnt ask where you live mr lochrin tillicoultry world famous for our soft furnishings warehouse rebus smiled i think ive been there actually you and half of scotland so youre trying to find a link between this new girl and zoe beddows plus maybe strathpeffer and aviemore something like that and you want to ask me about the photo rebus was silent for a moment what photo the one zoe sent her friend didnt i just mention it probably a coincidence but i suppose you have to check it was in zoe beddowss file rebus explained to siobhan clarke he ran his hand through his hair distractedly i should have spotted it but it was buried in an interview transcript just the single mention not even one of her closest friends and no message with it just the picture sent the day she went missing he was standing with clarke in the corridor outside the cid suite in gayfield square police station clarkes arms had been folded as she listened but now she held up a hand to interrupt him youve got the files all the files yes and youve cleared this with ds cowan she rolled her eyes at the stupidity of her own question what am i saying of course you havent youre keeping it to yourself you know me too well clarke thought for a moment can i see the photo i need to speak to the recipient rebus paused well it doesnt have to be me of course you think im going to do it for you annette mckie sent a photograph from her phone the day she vanished back in zoe beddows did the selfsame thing from the selfsame road youre telling me we should ignore that what about the others strathpeffer and aviemore brigid young didnt have her phone with her besides could you send photos from a phone back then a man appeared in the nearest doorway tall slim good suit there you are he said clarke managed a halfsmile here i am she agreed the man was staring at rebus awaiting an introduction john rebus rebus obliged holding out a hand the two men shook im with scru this is dci page clarke told him james page page clarified youve changed a bit rebus said page looked at him blankly led zeppelin rebus explained guitarist oh right same name as me page at last attempted a smile before turning his attention to clarke meeting of the control team in five ill be there pages eyes lingered on hers a second too long good to meet you he said to rebus no interest at all in why im here john clarkes tone was warning rebus off but too late hed taken a step towards page i assume youre in charge so you should know that there could be a link between annette mckie and a series of other mispers oh page looked from rebus to clarke and back again but the phone he was holding had started to vibrate and he focused his attention on its screen need to take this he apologised then to clarke write me a short briefing will you he turned back into the office raising the phone to his ear there was silence in the corridor for a few seconds need any help with that briefing rebus asked thanks for adding another brick to the hod she folded her arms again he wondered if it was a defensive gesture he hadnt paid much attention to the reading body language classes at police college through the doorway rebus had a good view of pages back neat haircut no creases in the jacket he wouldnt be much more than thirty maybe thirtyfive tops the dcis were getting younger thought you had someone in newcastle you were seeing rebus asked casually clarke glared at him youre not my dad if i was i might have a few words of advice at the ready youre really going to stand there and lecture me about relationships rebus pretended to wince maybe not he conceded good so the only thing we need to discuss is this briefing for mr dazed and confused he tried for a conciliatory tone and a kindly face youll want it to be thorough nobody better placed than me to help with that id have thought she stood her ground for a further moment or two then made a sound that mixed frustration with resignation youd better come in then she said the cramped office was busy with detectives on their phones or staring hard at their computer screens rebus knew a few faces and offered a wink or a nod he got the feeling desks and chairs had been requisitioned from elsewhere it was a narrow mazy walk to clarkes corner spot with waste bins and electrical cables to be negotiated she sat down and sifted through the papers next to her keyboard here she said handing him a copy of a blurry photograph it showed a field and a line of trees beyond with hills in the distance sent from her phone at just after ten pm the day she went missing wasnt when the picture was taken of course id say late afternoon nobody on the bus remembers her taking pictures out of the window but then nobody paid her much attention till she said she was going to throw up rebus studied the landscape could be just about anywhere have you released it to the media its been mentioned in dispatches but we didnt think it meant anything someone out there is bound to recognise it grazing land farmer will know it if no one else does could the woods be forestry commission he looked up and saw she was smiling what he asked its just that i had the exact same thought thats because you learned from the best her smile started to slide just joking he assured her great minds and all that he peered at the photo again who did she send it to a friend from school best friend just a friend did she usually send them photos no rebus looked at clarke same thing with zoe beddows sent to someone she knew but no more than that and no message same as this time right right clarke agreed but meaning what exactly sent in a panic rebus speculated maybe a cry for help and any recipient would have to do or clarke knew there was more their eyes met again you know as well as i do she nodded slowly sent by the abductor a sort of calling card bit of work to be done before we can say that but that doesnt stop us thinking it rebus waited a while before speaking so do you want my help on this or not maybe for a time then youll get physical graffiti to tell my boss youre going to run out of led zeppelin titles sooner or later but itll be fun while it lasts rebus said with a smile this is all working out for you isnt it means you dont have to explain to cowan about the files plus you can keep in touch with nina hazlitt what makes you think id do that because shes your type oh aye what type do i go for then confused needy damaged im not sure thats exactly fair siobhan then why have you gone all defensive she was looking at his arms so he looked too they were folded squarely across his chest the file on zoe beddows had a home address and telephone number for her friend alasdair blunt when rebus called he got an answering machine mans voice scottish with a good education alasdair and lesley are otherwise engaged leave a message or try alasdairs mobile rebus made a note of the number ended the call and punched it in it rang and rang he looked around the walls of his living room clarke had asked him to scoop up all the files and take them to gayfield square sure youve got the space hed countered well find some no one was answering rebus stared out of the window down on to the street a parking warden was checking residents permits and payanddisplay tickets rebus had left his saab on a single yellow line he watched as the warden glowered through the windscreen at the police official business sign the man looked up and down the street his jacket was several sizes too big for him as was the peaked cap he lifted his machine and started to process the infringement rebus sighed and turned away from the window ending the call he was starting to phone blunts answering machine again this time to leave a message when his mobile trembled incoming number blocked hello rebus decided this was as much information as the caller needed you just phoned me alasdair blunt thats right who am i speaking to my names rebus sir im calling from lothian and borders police oh yes its concerning zoe beddows has she turned up i just need to confirm a few details about the picture she sent you from her phone you mean the case is still open he sounded incredulous isnt that what her family and friends would want blunt seemed to consider this and his tone softened yes of course sorry rough day what is it you do mr blunt im in sales though not for much longer if things dont pick up might help if you answered your phone i could have been a new client then youd have called me on my other mobile the one i use for business thats why i was busy when you rang understood blunt exhaled noisily so how can i help ive been looking through the records and there doesnt appear to be a copy of the photograph ms beddows sent you thats because it got deleted rebus rested his weight on the arm of his sofa thats a pity there was no message just a picture thats right showing what exactly blunt seemed to struggle to remember hills sky a sort of track off to one side trees maybe you didnt recognise the spot blunt hesitated no he said eventually you dont sound sure im positive rebus stayed silent for a moment inviting blunt to continue are we done the man asked not quite what time of day did you receive the photo sometime in the evening can you be more precise nine ten oclock something like that and when do you think the picture was taken ive really no idea was it bright sunlight or maybe the sky was growing dark the quality wasnt great blunt paused twilight i suppose same as with annette mckie rebus noted then can i ask how did you know ms beddows she cut my hair but you were friends she cut my hair blunt repeated rebus thought for a moment how many hairdressers kept their clients contact details on their mobile how many forwarded them photographs which of your phones was the photo sent to mr blunt what does it matter was it your wife who saw it when it arrived asked you who zoe was then maybe deleted it this has got nothing to do with anything blunt was sounding irritated again but is that what happened youd been spending a bit of time with zoe maybe in your car a wee drive to a farm track somewhere i wasnt sure at first blunt said quietly i dont think the photo meant anything to us it wasnt anywhere wed been did any of this come out at the time some rebus was looking at the zoe beddows file incomplete like most cases you were a cop at the end of another long day you wrote up only the stuff you thought was important theres not an easy way to put this mr blunt but were you ever a suspect only in my wifes eyes but you got through it you and lesley lesley came later after judith had walked out on me blunt paused zoe had quite a lot of friends you know wed stopped seeing one another several months before she went missing and theres nothing else you can tell me about the photo only that it ended my marriage sure that wasnt your doing mr blunt the line went dead rebus considered calling blunt back but decided against it he would almost certainly refuse to answer instead he walked over to the zoe beddows file its contents splayed across the dining table he knew he would have to read it again every single line of it he was fairly confident there was nothing about zoe and her friends if any more of them had been interviewed their relationship to the misper had not been flagged up laziness or a sense of propriety on the part of the investigators they would have known what the media would have done with it created a story distorted the facts sold the public another version in the process zoe beddows would have become slightly less mourned rebus had seen it a dozen times or more prostitutes were asking for it putting themselves in danger anyone with a chaotic lifestyle could be pitied less than the newspapers mass of readers the ones with families and steady jobs the ones who feasted on those same vicarious details rebus reckoned it had been a conscious decision on somebodys part to leave speculation out of the case which was problematic for anyone opening the files from cold the whole story wasnt there he thought about phoning ken lochrin again but decided it could be done later he called clarke instead she answered with a question what i was just thinking rebus said the stuff at my flat its been sorted into piles and pinned up on the wall wouldnt it be easier for us to work from here this is a police inquiry john not a hobby it needs to be brought to the station understood a caller was waiting rebus glanced at the display ill see you in an hour he told clarke then to daniel cowan rebus speaking i dont like this john not one little bit i take it dci page has been on the blower if its a cold case it should be run from scru you should be here believe me sir if it were up to me your patters pish john is this your way of sucking up to the big boys im a team player sir ask bliss and robison theyll vouch for me its not them you need to win over dont forget what i said without my approval youre staying retired but your approvals all ive ever really craved danny cowans voice was rising to something just short of a yell when rebus ended the call you cant just wander in you know it was the next morning and the uniform behind the desk at gayfield square police station didnt like the look of rebus rebus had some sympathy his eyes were probably bloodshot he had failed to locate a clean shirt and his razor definitely needed a new blade he had shown her his id and waited to be buzzed through the locked door leading to the stairs whos your appointment with im on secondment to cid thats not what your card says rebus leaned forward until his face was almost touching the plexiglas partition are we going to have this every morning hes with me juliet siobhan clarke said coming in from outside might as well get used to his ugly mug he needs to sign as a visitor then i can give him a badge clarke stared at the woman really i mean really juliet hes attached to the mckie inquiry until further notice then i should have been told so someone cocked up there had to be a first time eh im right here by the way rebus interrupted feeling left out the officers face broke into an eventual smile aimed at clarke rather than rebus some proper identification by the end of the day girl guides honour i thought you said youd never been a girl guide the smile was broadening as she pressed the button to let them through clarke led rebus into the heart of the building youll require a passport photo she told him got one handy never felt the need she looked at him no passport didnt bother renewing it im perfectly happy where i am she looked at him again when was the last time you actually left the city for pleasure i mean he gave a casual shrug as she continued to study him this time taking in his clothes james likes the officers under him to be presentable you might be under him from time to time but not me is this what i have to look forward to she gave him a stern look and asked where the files were at home he saw that she was ready to remonstrate so held up a hand im not being obstructive its just that i was awake till three going through them again slept late and didnt have time to pack them away making you the resident expert until someone else gets a lookin you might almost call me indispensable not even close john they were outside the cid suite the door as usual was wide open a couple of detectives already seated at their desks walking in rebus caught the aroma of freshly brewed coffee the pot rested on top of a filing cabinet clarke poured for both of them anybody get milk she asked there were shakes of the head that must make me the cavalry james page said striding into the office he carried a litre carton in one hand brown leather satchel in the other hello again he said to rebus morning sir first names around here john page handed the milk to clarke but kept his eyes on rebus any news from those files of yours only that theyre far from complete zoe beddows had been seeing a married man thats who she sent her photo to but i only found that out by speaking to him file just names him as one of her friends and the photo itself he didnt keep it from the description hills sky and a track similar enough to the one annette mckie sent clarke commented rebus felt compelled to qualify the statement if she sent it lets not jump to conclusions page countered what about aviemore and strathpeffer i did a bit of digging on the internet clarke said you couldnt readily send a picture from one phone to another until or really pages brow furrowed as recently as that might be worth showing the photo we do have to zoe beddowss lover rebus suggested even if theyre unlikely to be the same spot he paused and if i can add something else he was aware that siobhan clarke was holding her breath waiting for him to say the wrong thing yes page prompted we also need to get the new photo circulated it has to ring bells with somebody theres a press conference at twelve page said studying his watch there is clarke sounded annoyed at just finding out the mothers putting up a reward ten thousand pounds i think a fair bit of cash rebus stated for someone who lives in lochend do you want me at the press conference james clarke was asking well all be there need to let people know were motivated page broke off noticing rebuss shirt and stubble maybe not quite all of us eh john if you say so james public perception and suchlike page gave a thin smile and turned away heading for his own inner office he had to put his coffee down and take a key from his pocket to unlock the door im sure that was a cupboard when i used to work here rebus said to clarke keeping his voice down it was she confirmed but james seems to like it the door closed again with page behind it the room had to be near airless and with no natural light that rebus could recall yet james page appeared to flourish there did i pass inspection he asked clarke just about its only day one remember plenty of time for me to start letting the side down how about not doing that eh just for once in your life the schools rector had offered them his office but clarke had declined as she waited with rebus in the corridor outside she explained her reasoning too intimidating when youre in that room its because youre in trouble we want him a bit more relaxed and talkative rebus nodded his agreement he was looking out of a window towards the playground the window was doubleglazed but condensation had found its way between the panes the wooden frame was spongy could do with a bit of tlc clarke commented either that or knocking down new schools for all once we get independence rebus looked at her whats with the we are you forgetting thats an english accent youve got reckon im for deportation we might just keep you at a pinch rebus pulled back his shoulders as a teenager in school uniform entered the corridor hesitated then walked towards them his hair flopped into his eyes and he wore his striped tie with an oversized knot are you thomas rebus asked thomas redfern clarke added aye redfern didnt seem to have any gum in his mouth but he sounded as though he did youre in annettes class redfern nodded you all right talking here the boy shrugged and stuffed his hands deep into his trouser pockets ive already told the polis we know that clarke interrupted we just need to clear a few things up have you still got that photo rebus asked the one zelda sent aye mind if i see it rebus held out his hand redfern produced a phone from the top pocket of his blazer and switched it on sorry we had to pull you out of class clarke said the boy gave a snort double chemistry you can always walk the long way back he had found the photograph he turned the phone around so they could see its screen rebus lifted it from between his fingers he didnt think it was blurred enough to have been taken from a moving vehicle or even from behind glass he got a sense that the photographer had been standing up and was probably around his height how tall is zelda he asked bit shorter than me redfern was indicating his own shoulder around five six rebus nodded to himself she could be standing on a rock or something clarke suggested no message with it rebus asked the boy no did she often send you stuff a text now and then if there was a party maybe did you know she was going to inverness she told everyone nobody else from the school was invited timmy was but her parents wouldnt let her go the girls knew about the party from the internet some guy they talked to on twitter redfern confirmed year older but still at school we all told her told her what clarke asked to be careful people online you know not always what they seem clarke nodded her understanding well weve checked and hes a sixteenyearold called robert gilzean aye the other polis told me while clarke kept redfern talking rebus flicked through some of the other photos on the phone kids making faces kids making hand gestures kids blowing kisses none showed annette mckie how well do you know zelda tom he gave another shrug were you at primary school together no so youve been in the same class for what three years i suppose so ever been to her house couple of parties she seemed to spend most of the time in her bedroom oh aye redfern almost blushed online games he clarified showing off how good she was you dont sound impressed games are all right but i prefer books thats refreshing clarke said with a smile what did you think when you got the photo rebus handed back the phone didnt really think anything bit surprised maybe ten oclock at night not the sort of thing shed done before i suppose so and you texted her back redfern looked at him and nodded i thought shed hit the wrong button meant it for someone else in her contacts but she never answered no shed been sending texts to timmy from the bus last one just said she was feeling queasy the boy paused he looked from rebus to clarke and back again shes dead isnt she we dont know that clarke answered softly but she is though redferns eyes were fixed on rebus and rebus wasnt about to lie rebus tried the door to james pages room but it was locked he was on his own in the cid suite there was no tv but clarke had shown him how to watch the press conference on her computer he opened a few desk drawers finding nothing of interest the press conference was coming from a hotel round the corner from gayfield square rebus had picked up a couple of chicken slices from greggs on the trip back from the school they were long gone though a few crumbs of pastry lingered on his shirt and jacket lothian and borders police had their own camera at the hotel its unedited feed minus sound appearing on clarkes monitor rebus had failed to find any kind of volume control which was why he was prowling the office rather than sitting at the desk hed unearthed some nurofen in clarkes drawer and popped a couple in his breast pocket always handy to have hed drunk enough coffee and there didnt seem to be any tea bags other than mint and redbush back at the monitor proceedings had started rebus gave the plastic casing a thump but there was still no sound no sign of a radio anywhere either he knew he could go listen in his car but that was supposing one of the local stations was covering it instead he sat himself down and watched whoever was manning the camera needed either an instruction manual or a trip to specsavers the focus was all over the place and rebus was shown more of the table than the people seated behind it others were standing page was flanked by siobhan clarke and a detective constable called ronnie ogilvie behind annette mckies mother and the oldest of her brothers stood a man rebus half recognised the man squeezed the mothers shoulder whenever he sensed she was flagging at one point she covered his hand with her own as if in thanks annettes brother did some of the talking too reading from a prepared statement he seemed confident enough gaze surveying the room giving the photographers plenty of opportunities for a decent shot while his mother dabbed her reddened sorelooking eyes rebus didnt know the lads name guessed him to be seventeen or eighteen short hair spiked at the front with gel face bearing some residual acne pale and gaunt and streetwise but now the camera was a blur of movement it was pages turn he seemed ready eager even to start fielding questions after a couple of minutes however there was an interruption page turning to his left the camera caught annette mckies mother as she staggered from the room hand held to her mouth either overcome with grief or about to be sick the man went with her leaving her son still seated he was looking towards page as if seeking advice should he stay or should he go the camera swept the room taking in other cameras journalists detectives the double doors had swung shut behind the mother then the camera was pointing at the patterned carpet and the screen went black rebus stayed where he was until the team started to drift back into the office ogilvie shook his head at him saving himself the effort of saying anything page looked annoyed at having been cut off in his prime if the tv news concentrated on anything it would be the walkout he stabbed the key into the lock opened his door and disappeared into his cupboard clarke made her way between the desks catching her foot only once on a trailing cable she handed rebus a chocolate bar thanks mum he told her did you see it he nodded no sound though did page get round to mentioning the photos from the phones seemed to slip his mind when the mother did a runner she unwrapped her own chocolate bar and bit into it who was the guy standing behind her rebus asked family friend is he the one putting up the reward clarke looked at him okay spit it out ive not started eating it yet when this failed to raise a smile he relented his names frank hammell owns a couple of pubs and at least one club you know him i know his pubs but not the club its somewhere out in bandit country meaning west lothian rebus nodded towards the monitor pretty touchyfeely i thought not that sort of guy not unless youre really close clarkes chewing slowed she thought for a moment and what does any of this add a note of caution rebus answered eventually if hes the mums friend and shes upset you can bet hes upset too hence the reward its not the reward we know about that worries me its the one he might be putting out on the quiet clarke glanced towards pages door you think we should tell him your call siobhan while she considered this rebus had another question remind me what happened to annettes father did a runner to australia whats his name derek something derek christie not mckie thats the mother gail mckie rebus nodded slowly and the lad at the conference darryl still at school is he clarke called across to ronnie ogilvie what does darryl mckie do i think he said he was a bar manager ogilvie replied and he calls himself christie rather than mckie clarke looked at rebus eighteen is a bit young for a manager she commented rebus gave a twitch of his mouth depends whose bar it is he said rising to give her back her chair just like old times eh rebus said and at last im seeing a bit of scotland they were in clarkes car a newsmelling audi the trip had been rebuss idea take a look at the spot where annette mckie had last been seen check for possible matches to the photo they had left edinburgh heading north across the forth road bridge into fife crawling through what seemed like miles of roadworks with a mph limit then skirting kinross on the way to perth where they connected with the a it wasnt dualled and they seemed to have hit the midafternoon rush rebus took a cd from his pocket and swapped it for the kate bush album clarke had been playing who said you could do that she complained rebus shushed her and turned up the volume on track three just listen he said then after a few minutes so whats he singing about then how do you mean in the chorus something about standing in another mans rain you sure am i hearing it wrong rebus shook his head its just that i thought he was ach never mind he made to eject the cd but she told him to leave it she signalled and pulled out to overtake the audi had a bit of heft even so she just made it an oncoming vehicle flashing its lights in protest trying to prove something rebus asked i just want us arriving in pitlochry much the same time she did isnt that the whole point she turned towards him and arent you supposed to be looking for where that photo mightve been taken nowhere around here he muttered but he began to scan the overcast countryside anyway they passed a sign to birnam and a beatrix potter exhibition clarke overtook another lorry then had to brake hard when she spotted a speed camera causing the lorry to brake too accompanied by a blast of its horn and an angry flash of headlights the jackie leven cd had ended and rebus asked if she wanted kate bush back on but she shook her head where the hell are they all going rebus was peering at the traffic ahead of them not exactly tourist season not exactly she agreed then too casually hows cafferty by the way rebus stared at her what makes you think id know she seemed to take a moment deciding how to answer i was talking to someone from the complaints the complaints meaning internal affairs fox rebus guessed i see him sliming his way around hq the word is out john you and cafferty your little drinking sessions rebus digested this is fox coming after me you dont want to hang around with those scumbags siobhan might be contagious theyre not scumbags as you well know and to answer your question youre not a serving officer meaning at the moment i doubt fox could touch you even if he wanted to she paused keeping her eyes firmly on the road ahead on the other hand you go back a long way with cafferty so so is there anything for the complaints to find if they do come looking you know how i feel about cafferty rebus stated coldly doesnt mean favours havent been swapped somewhere down the line rebus drank from a plastic bottle of water bought when theyd stopped for petrol at kinross fox wants you to grass me up is that it he was just asking if i saw much of you these days and then he happens to drop caffertys name into the mix rebus shook his head slowly so what did you tell him he was right though wasnt he about you seeing cafferty the guy thinks he owes me for what i did at the hospital youre on free drinks for life i pay my way she overtook a tesco delivery van there were three articulated lorries at the very front of the queue slowing inexorably as the road hit an incline a sign theyd just passed suggested that sluggish vehicles should pull over to allow overtaking but that wasnt happening theres some dual carriageway coming up clarke said were almost at pitlochry anyway rebus countered then lowering his voice a little and thanks for the warning she nodded staring straight ahead hands tensed against the steering wheel just make sure theres no ammo fox can use eh from the look of him id say hes got a history of firing blanks any chance of another cigarette break you said it yourself were nearly there aye but they dont let you smoke in petrol stations which was why hed headed for the car park at kinross while clarke filled the fuel tank and bought drinks at the shop five more minutes she told him just five more minutes ten minutes later not that rebus was counting they turned off the a and took the slip road into pitlochry passing the petrol station where annette mckies bus had stopped to drop her off clarke drove through the town there was just the one main street with signs leading off to the festival theatre the hydroelectric dam and edradour and bells distilleries i went to the dam once when i was a kid clarke commented supposedly to see the salmon leap no salmon rebus guessed no salmon on the other hand you have to love a town with two distilleries it took only a couple of minutes for them to reach the far end of pitlochry she did a threepoint turn and headed back the way theyd come there was a small police station on the main road but not continuously manned for protocols sake clarke had phoned taysides divisional hq in perth before setting out alerting a local inspector to their trip she had stressed that a welcoming party would not be necessary its really just a recce she was signalling now to enter the petrol stations forecourt as soon as the car stopped rebus undid his seat belt and got out making for the pavement cigarette and lighter at the ready he watched as clarke went into the shop there was a middleaged woman behind the till and clarke showed her her warrant card followed by two photos one of annette mckie and one a copy of the picture annette had sent to thomas redfern directly across from the petrol station was the bells distillery and behind it the vast turrets of what rebus guessed was a hotel another car had pulled into the forecourt the man who got out looked like a salesman white shirt pale yellow tie his jacket had been hanging from a hook inside the car and he slipped back into it warding off the cold air he unlocked the cars petrol cap but then glanced towards the pavement and saw someone smoking there readjusting his priorities he headed in rebuss direction offering a nod of kinship before lighting up therell be frost tonight he offered just so long as theres not snow rebus responded last thing i need is them shutting the drumochter pass snow gates rebus guessed thats the ones last winter was a nightmare you going to inverness the man nodded how about you heading back to edinburgh civilisation eh this seems civilised enough rebus looked in the direction of town wouldnt know i only ever stop to fill up you travel a lot part and parcel isnt it five six hundred miles a week sometimes more he gestured towards his vehicle behind it rebus could see the woman at the till shaking her head in reply to another of clarkes questions cars not even two years old and its on its last legs the salesman was saying hows the audi seems okay rebus finished his cigarette what is it you sell exactly how long have you got lets say fifteen seconds then ill give you two words logistics and solutions i feel duly enlightened rebus watched as clarke made her way back to the audi thanks for that no problem the man took out his phone and was checking for messages as rebus headed across the forecourt anything he asked sliding into the passenger seat she wasnt working that day clarke obliged the staff who were have all been questioned one remembered annette coming in and asking to use the loo she bought a bottle of water and headed off again into town nice of the bus not to wait for her actually the drivers mortified but he was obeying company rules rebus peered out through the windscreen in search of cctv cameras caught her clarke confirmed busy on her phone could she have had a rendezvous no family or friends in pitlochry clarke thought for a moment theres another camera on the main drag but it failed to pick her out and none of the shopkeepers remember seeing her so shed maybe found a lift straight off maybe could she have started walking across country she was a city girl john why would she do that all rebus could offer to this was a shrug clarke checked her watch its half an hour later now than it was when she set off she could have passed through town without anyone noticing maybe not started thumbing till she reached the other end she started the ignition and put the car into gear as they left the forecourt the salesman gave rebus a wave he sells solutions rebus explained to clarke he should be in here with us then once they had passed through pitlochry again there wasnt much to do but rejoin the a they had the option south towards perth or north towards inverness clarke hesitated lets give it a few more miles rebus said scenerys changing might get more like the photo were not going as far as aviemore mind my skiing days are behind me you dont think it would impress nina hazlitt what me going skiing you being able to tell her you visited aviemore as part of your mission everything in its time after twelve years though you seriously think theres anything to find there no rebus was forced to admit turning the kate bush cd back on she seemed to be singing about her love for a snowman the moment they rejoined the a they hit roadworks traffic down to a single lane and moving at a crawl a barrier separated their northbound lane from the ones heading south meaning no opportunity for a uturn were stuck clarke commented major resurfacing rebus explained reading one of the signs expect delays for four weeks we might still be here in four weeks just as well we enjoy each others company she gave a snort at this at least they are working this was true in the lane that had been blocked off men in yellow reflective jackets were carrying tools or operating diggers the sky was filled with a pulsing orange glow from the warning lights atop the various vehicles the speed limit had been reduced to thirty thirty would be luxury clarke complained speedo says twenty slow and steady wins the day rebus recited thats always been your motto has it she managed a thin smile rebus was studying the workmen how about pulling over he suggested what if she hitched along here no way they wouldnt have noticed a line of cones separated inside and outside lanes but they were well spaced and it was easy to negotiate the audi between two of them clarke pulled the handbrake on not the worst idea ive ever had then rebus pretended to guess as they got out of the car a man strode towards them clarke had her warrant card ready the man stiffened whats happened he was in his mid fifties curls of grey hair escaping from the rim of his hard hat rebus got the feeling there were many layers of clothing beneath the highvisibility jacket and the fluorescent orange work trousers did you hear about the girl whos gone missing clarke asked the man looked from clarke to rebus and back again then nodded i didnt catch your name rebus added bill soames youre in charge of the crew mr soames rebus looked over soamess shoulder towards the workmen they had stopped what they were doing theyre probably worried youre revenue or immigration soames explained and why would either of those be a problem clarke asked they wouldnt soames stated meeting her eyes he half turned and gestured to the men that they should continue with their work best if we talk in the office though he led them past the audi along a carriageway stripped of its tarmac chunks of which were piled up next to the verge temporary overhead lights powered by diesel generators had been switched on adding to the noise and fumes you work nights clarke asked twelvehour shifts soames confirmed the night crew are in there he pointed to a portakabin they were just passing six beds one shower plus a kitchen best avoided there was a row of three portable toilets then another portakabin its windows covered with protective grilles soames opened its door and ushered them inside he switched on a light and an electric heater i could probably rustle up some tea thanks but this shouldnt take long there were plans of the roadworks on the rooms only table soames rolled them up making space sit yourselves down he said so the crew are polish rebus asked soames gave a questioning look and rebus nodded towards the dictionary on the worktop englishpolishpolishenglish not all of them soames answered but some yes and their english sometimes falls a bit short so whats the polish for tarmacadam soames smiled stefan acts as their foreman hes got better english than i have they sleep on site long way to travel home every day and cook meals here basically live by the side of the road soames nodded thats how it is what about yourself mr soames clarke asked im over near dundee its a slog but i make it home most nights there must be a nightshift supervisor soames nodded and checked his watch hell be here in an hour and a half id rather he didnt catch me having a chinwag when im supposed to be out there point taken clarke said without making it sound like an apology so youve heard about annette mckie of course has anyone talked to you you mean police soames shook his head youre the first she was probably hitching north out of pitlochry that means she would have had to pass right by here if she was on foot someone would have noticed thats what we were thinking well she didnt i asked the men all of them all of them soames confirmed time she was in the area it would have been the day crew the night crews portakabin has windows though rebus countered did you ask them too no soames admitted but i will if you like give me a number and ill get back to you be easier if you did it just now some might still be asleep wake them up rebus paused please soames thought for a moment before making his decision he pressed his palms against the tabletop and started rising to his feet and while were waiting rebus added maybe we could have a word with stefan when soames had closed the door clarke moved closer to the heater warming her hands can you imagine it working all hours and in all weathers rebus was doing a circuit of the room examining health and safety notices pinned to a corkboard letters and forms piled high next to the dictionary there was a phone charger but no phone the calendar showed a photo of a blonde model atop a bright red motorbike its a job he commented these days thats something so whats your thinking theres no way she could walk past here without being spotted clarke nodded maybe she took a detour across the field at the back why would she do that to avoid the wolfwhistles she looked at him it still happens youd know better than me yes i would she looked around the room what do you think they do here between shifts im guessing booze card games and porn youd know better than me clarke was echoing as the metal door shuddered open a grizzled man in his early forties stood there eyes hooded and with a weeks worth of stubble on his chin and cheeks his gaze met that of rebus hiya stefan rebus said to him keeping your nose clean i hope stefan skiladz had lived in scotland for more than half his life spending three of those years in prison for a serious assault after a days heavy drinking at a friends flat in tollcross rebus had been cid at the time and had given evidence in court skiladz having pleaded not guilty despite the blood on his clothing and his fingerprints on the kitchen knife clarke listened to rebus explain all of this as the three of them sat around the table when he had finished skiladz broke the silence with a question what the hell is this all about clarke responded by pushing the photo of annette mckie across the table towards him shes gone missing last seen in pitlochry getting ready to hitchhike north so what skiladz had picked the photo up his face showing no emotion whatsoever your guys must go into pitlochry rebus answered someone has to do the tobaccoandvodka run sometimes so maybe they took pity on her and dropped her here better to wait for someone to take her further skiladz looked up from the photograph no i suppose so could you keep the photo show it around clarke suggested sure he took another look pretty girl i have a daughter not so very different has that helped keep you out of trouble skiladz stared at rebus i stopped with the drink i got my head together he tapped a blackened finger to his brow and i stopped getting into arguments rebus thought for a moment any of the other lads got form trouble with the law you mean why would i tell you because then we wouldnt have to come back here with immigration officers and maybe the tax man too and while we checked every persons id and history wed make sure your name was mentioned in dispatches skiladzs eyes drilled into rebus you were a bastard back then too just not so fat and old hard to disagree so whats your answer clarke added skiladz turned his attention towards her one or two he said eventually one or two what have had some trouble in the past she got up and found a pad of lined paper placing it in front of him making sure not to obscure the photograph lying there write them down she said this is crazy she held out a pen and made him take it from her when she retrieved the pad a minute later it contained three names day shift she asked only the first thomas robertson she read out doesnt sound very polish hes scottish the door opened again bill soames was standing there he watched as clarke tore the sheet from the pad folded it in half and slipped it into her pocket nothing he said turning to close the door no one saw her then laying a hand on skiladzs shoulder everything all right stefan can i go now skiladz asked rebus ask her not me rebus indicated clarke she nodded at skiladz and he got up to leave whats been going on soames asked rebus waited until skiladz was outside mr skiladz has been helping us with our inquiries he told soames necessitating another visit he rose and held out his hand for soames to take soames looked as though he had questions but rebus was already opening the door clarke shook soamess hand and asked a final question of her own how far do we have to drive before we can start heading south again a bit over half a mile if you dont mind doing a uturn on a dangerous bend i dont mind that in the slightest clarke gave him a smile as she made to follow rebus back in the car she asked him for his thoughts we cant just barge in and interview them he obliged tayside constabulary need to be told agreed so you talk to tayside in the morning and come back later in the day that way everythings above board you dont want to be involved rebus shook his head im just the hired help earning your keep so far maybe let communication breakdown know that clarke smiled what about stefan skiladz worth doing a background check but i doubt anything will come up she nodded to herself and started the car i might have to buy you a pint when we get back to edinburgh what makes you think i dont have plans youre not the type she answered signalling to pull out always supposing a gap would eventually emerge in what looked like a solid convoy of lorries rebus let her buy him two drinks in the end afterwards he walked her back to her car and turned down the offer of a lift home its hardly on your route he explained so youre either going to take a taxi or keep on drinking flexing those sleuthing muscles of yours eh today went pretty well but if you start coming into gayfield square with the sweat of the previous nights ale on you understood he gave her a mock salute then watched until the audi disappeared from view the town was quiet with plenty of cabs plying for the largely nonexistent trade rebus held up a hand and waited twenty minutes later he was paying the driver his money adding a quid as a tip and stepping on to the pavement outside a pub called the gimlet it was situated next to a busy roundabout off calder road one of the main routes into the city from the west the area was a mix of commercial and residential car showrooms lowrise industrial units but also twostorey terraces with the usual array of satellite dishes pointing up at the sky the gimlet dated back to the s it was a squat freestanding box of a place with a sandwich board outside advertising quiz and karaoke nights and a cheap allday breakfast rebus hadnt been there in years he wondered if it still operated as a glorified bazaar for shoplifters and housebreakers only one way to find out he told himself there was music blaring from loudspeakers and a glamorous blonde on the tv reading out the sports news half a dozen sullen drinkers examined rebus as he made for the taps he studied the available beers then checked the glassfronted chiller bottle of ipa he decided the barmaid was young with tattooed arms and an array of facial piercings rebus reckoned she had chosen the soundtrack whether the punters liked it or not as she poured his beer he asked if frank was coming in frank who hammell this is still his place isnt it no idea she threw the empty bottle into a bucket with more force than was strictly necessary rebus handed her a twentypound note which she checked beneath an ultraviolet scanner prior to opening the till how about darryl rebus tried again are you from the papers she placed his change on the bar top rather than handing it to him it comprised a few coins plus three of the ropiestlooking fivers rebus had seen in quite some time guess again he said hes a cop one of the drinkers called out rebus turned to face the man he was in his sixties and nursing a glass of dark rum there were three empties in front of him do i know you rebus asked the man shook his head im right though rebus took a mouthful of beer it was too cold and a bit flat a door to the left of him was rattling open a sign explained that it led to the beer garden as well as the toilets the man who walked in was coughing as he pocketed his pack of cigarettes he was well over six feet tall shavenheaded and wearing a black threequarterlength coat over dark trousers and poloneck stood to reason the gimlet would have someone manning the premises rebuss arrival had coincided with a break that was all the man stared hard at him knowing him for a stranger and sensing the atmosphere in the room problem he asked cop the barmaid answered the doorman stopped a foot or so from rebus and studied him from top to toe too old he offered thanks for the vote of confidence i was hoping to talk to frank or darryl is it to do with annette one of the other drinkers asked the doorman warned him off with a look before turning his attention back to rebus there are official channels he said and youre not following them i didnt realise i was speaking to one of franks legal team rebus took another sip of beer and put the glass down reaching into his pocket for his cigarettes without saying any more he headed for the door letting it swing shut after him as he had guessed the beer garden was a rectangle of cracked concrete with weeds growing through no tables or chairs just empty aluminium kegs and beer crates the walled enclosure was topped with plenty of razor wire stray ribbons of polythene snagged in it rebus lit his cigarette and walked in a circle there was a highrise block in the distance a couple staging a shouting match on one of its balconies the traffic at the roundabout would be oblivious just another small scene in a world full of them rebus was wondering if the door behind him would open someone might want a quiet word or a boxing match he looked at his watch and his phone just passing the time with the cigarette reduced to little more than butt he flicked it on to the concrete where it joined dozens of others then he opened the door and went back inside there was no sign of the golem presumably he was back at his post the barmaid was eating a bag of crisps rebus saw that his beer was no longer where he had left it thought youd finished she took pleasure in explaining can i buy you one he asked she didnt manage to conceal her surprise but eventually shook her head pity rebus said nodding towards her piercings i wanted to see if you leak when you drink out front the doorman was busy speaking into his phone hes right here he said when he spotted rebus he handed the phone to him hello donnys not convinced youre a cop officially im not but im on secondment to the team investigating annettes disappearance any way you can prove that talk to di clarke either her or dci page who am i speaking to by the way darryl christie rebus remembered him from the press conference spikyhaired and wheyfaced sorry about your sister darryl thanks so whats your name then rebus i was cid but now i work cold cases so how come page and his lot need you thats something youd have to ask them rebus paused you dont sound enamoured i would be if page spent as much time grafting as he does on his skincare regime id probably be wise to offer no comment darryl christie made a snorting noise he didnt sound like an eighteenyearold or rather he sounded like an eighteenyearold who had grown up fast and selfconfident does frank hammell share your concerns about the investigation rebus enquired whats it to you i just reckon hes a man who has his own ways of getting to the bottom of things and and i think he should share whatever he finds might hamper the eventual trial otherwise rebus paused again of course mr hammells probably of the opinion a proper trial wont be necessary not when he can act as judge and jury rebus waited for darryl christie to say something he had turned his back on doorman donny and walked with the borrowed phone towards the roundabout watching the traffic negotiate its way in and out of town eventually he spoke into the silence frank hammells a man with enemies darryl you know that as well as i do is that what hes thinking one of thems got their hands on annette more silence see my feeling is hes wrong to head that way and i dont want you and your mum following him if you know anything spit it out maybe i should talk to him first thats not going to happen will you let me give you my number just in case there was another pause on the line before darryl christie told rebus to go ahead he recited his mobile number and spelled out his name frank might have heard of me christie took a moment to form his next question rebus watched the passing parade of headlamps while he waited are your lot going to find my sister well do our damnedest thats the only promise i can make just dont hold it against her hold what against her that frank hammells dating our mother thats not the way it works darryl prove it then get busy the line went dead rebus got another cigarette going while he replayed the conversation there was steel to the kid but brains too and plenty of concern for his sister rebus pressed a few buttons until the screen presented him with the number of the last call he took out his own phone and entered the details into his contact list under the name darryl when the cigarette was done he headed back to the gimlet and returned the phone to doorman donny that took a while rebus shook his head finished talking to your boss ages ago phoned one of those premium chatlines after enjoy your next bill part two i see the dead men shuffling in their bones young girls laughing on their mobile phones what was it about cafferty even in a busy midmorning cafe customers kept their distance rebus had found them a corner table the table next to it once vacated stayed empty people might head towards it then glance up at the hulking figure in the black leather jacket and change their minds turnup for the books cafferty had said you asking me for a drink he had then demolished a flat white and requested another with the complaint that the cups were like something out of a dolls house he was pouring sugar into this second coffee when rebus asked him about frank hammell hammell shorter fuse than i like to see on a man never a great one for realising that actions have consequences i forget did he ever work for you back in the day caffertys phone which had been sitting on the table began to vibrate he checked who the caller was but didnt answer is this about the missing girl rebus nodded saw hammell on tv cafferty continued thats some reward hes put up why do you think he did it cafferty considered this he knew what rebus meant a man like hammell could get information without needing to pay for it he loves her he answered eventually the mother i mean this is his way of showing it you know he put the frighteners on her husband rebus shook his head thats why the poor sod scarpered to new zealand australia i heard same difference other side of the planet thats how far he needed to be from frank hammell what about the missing girls brother cafferty thought for a moment enlighten me his names darryl christie kept his dads surname he spoke at the press conference manages at least one of hammells bars i didnt know that rebus could see cafferty storing the information away seems like a bright kid then he should get out while he can how many places does hammell own these days caffertys mouth twitched hard to say even for me half a dozen pubs and clubs fingers in a lot more pies than that of course hes had meetings in glasgow and aberdeen meaning meetings with men like himself rebus watched as cafferty stirred his coffee you sound like you still take an interest he commented call it a hobby some hobbies end up allconsuming mans got to have something to fill his retirement thats where you went wrong nothing to do with yourself all day so you ended up back in the game cafferty scooped up some of the mousse from the surface of his drink and spooned it into his mouth any idea who might bear a grudge against hammell present company excepted cafferty smiled probably too many to count but i doubt theyd bring a kid into it if they did though then any day now theyll get a message to hammell and thats when hell go supernova youll want to know about it if that happens we should keep a watch on him you should be doing that anyway i seem to remember a fair few surveillance operations mounted against me in the dim and distant past caught you redhanded too cafferty gave another twitch of the mouth best not to dwell on it actually i think we need to just for a moment cafferty looked at him and whys that because the complaints are keeping tabs on me tuttut they know for example that weve been out a few times together someone must have told them wasnt you was it caffertys face remained a mask see it makes sense to me rebus continued his hands were wrapped around his own mug of coffee but he hadnt taken so much as a sip since sitting down in fact i cant think of a neater way of setting me up you keep taking me out for these little drinks and chats making everyone think were bosom buddies im insulted well someones been talking to them not me cafferty shook his head slowly as he placed his spoon on the table his phone was vibrating again sure you dont want to answer that rebus asked i cant help it if im popular you might want to look that word up in a dictionary the shit i let you get away with caffertys eyes were sudden dark tunnels leading to darker places still there you are rebus said giving a thin smile knew you were still in there somewhere waiting to come out and play were finished cafferty stated rising to his feet and snatching his phone you should try being nice to me rebus sometimes i think im the only friend youve got left weve never been friends and never will be you sure about that rather than wait for an answer cafferty started threading his way between the tables nimble for such a big man rebus sat back and looked around him studying the cafes morning clients he wished the complaints had been watching and listening just this one time it might have put their minds at rest did you miss me rebus enquired as he walked into the scru office have you been somewhere cant say id noticed peter bliss was hauling files and folders from a large plastic container some sheets fell free sliding across the floor elaine robison helped pick them up how are things at gayfield square she asked coffees not a patch on here i meant the case rebus shrugged im not sure anyones convinced about the links to the other mispers it was always going to be a hard sell john i seem to be in luck here though no cowan to speak of hes at some meeting bliss explained seating himself at his desk huckling for a move to the ccu robison added resting her hands on her hips seems theres a vacancy at the top table i was under the impression our dear leader hates cold cases but the one thing he does like is advancement theyd have to promote him di fast track to dci and above bliss said with a shake of his head well his wardrobes good and ready even if hes not rebus turned to leave not staying for some of that famous coffee robison asked places to go people to see rebus said by way of apology dont be a stranger she called to him as he headed out of the door ethics and standards was what it said on the wall next to the office but everyone called them the complaints rebus tried the handle it didnt budge combination lock he knocked pressed his ear to the door knocked again further along the corridor was the deputy chief constables office and the chief constables beyond that rebus hadnt been hauled up here for a carpeting in quite some time his years on the force hed seen the penpushers come and go they were always full of new ideas tweaks they were keen to make as if you could change the job by means of strategy meetings and focus groups the complaints was part of that every year or two their name seemed to change complaints and conduct professional standards ethics and standards one cop rebus had known the complaints had gone after him because a neighbour had complained about the height of his leylandii the whole process had taken the best part of a year after which the cop had decided he didnt like the job any more another result for the complaints rebus gave up and took the lift down to the cafeteria bottle of irn bru and a caramel wafer he walked over to a table by the window the window looked on to the sports field where you could sometimes see offduty officers playing rugby not today though the chair made plenty of noise as rebus pulled it out from the table he sat down and returned the stare of the man sitting there malcolm fox he stated fox didnt deny it he was twenty years younger than rebus and a stone and a half lighter a bit less grey in his hair most cops looked like cops but fox could have been middle management in a plastics company or inland revenue hello rebus fox said there was a plate in front of him nothing on it but banana peel the glass next to it contained tap water from the jug by the cash till thought maybe we should meet properly rebus took a mouthful of irn bru and stifled a belch im not sure thats such a good idea we work in the same building any reason we cant be sitting together every reason there was nothing confrontational in foxs style no emotion when he spoke he had the casual confidence of someone who knew they were on another plane from those around them because youre putting together a file on me todays police force is very different from the one you got used to methods have changed and so have attitudes fox paused do you really think youd fit in youre telling me not to bother reapplying thats a decision only you can make who was it told you about me and cafferty foxs face changed slightly and rebus realised hed made a mistake the man knew where rebus had got that gen siobhan clarke a black mark against her ask yourself this rebus ploughed on could it have been cafferty himself using an intermediary just to screw up my chances better if youd simply kept clear of him in the first place hard to disagree so why didnt you maybe i was hoping he might let something slip i work cold cases remember and has he rebus shook his head not so far but the amount of skeletons around cafferty theres always a chance fox looked thoughtful as he sipped his water rebus unwrapped the wafer and bit into it the file on you fox said eventually goes back to the s in fact to call it a file is doing it an injustice it takes up one whole shelf ive been called into the headmasters office a few times rebus conceded never been given my jotters though i wonder is that down to luck or guile there was always a good reason why i did what i did and it got results the high hiedyins recognised that room should always be made for one maverick fox quoted thats what a former chief constable wrote about you he underlined the one i got results rebus repeated and what about now think you can break cases without bending a few rules along the way weve no room for even one maverick these days rebus shrugged fox spent a moment studying him youre on secondment to gayfield square he said that brings you back into contact with di clarke so since you retired shes managed to unlearn some of the stuff you taught her shes going to keep rising through the ranks fox paused unless youre saying im a bad influence siobhans her own woman thats not about to change just because im around for a week or two i hope not but back in the day she covered up for you a few times didnt she ive no idea what youre talking about rebus tipped the bottle to his mouth again fox managed to force out a smile studying rebus the way a sceptical employer might an underqualified job candidate weve met before you know we have sort of we were on the same case one time back in my cid days i dont remember fox shrugged not so surprising really i dont think you made it to a single briefing probably too busy doing real work with a mint on your tongue to mask the smell of booze rebus gave him a hard stare is that what this is about me not giving you the time of day did i nick your sweets in the playground and now you need to get your own back im not that petty you sure about that quite sure fox was rising to his feet one more thing he said you know therell be a physical if you go ahead with your application i mean constitution of an ox rebus declared thumping his chest with a fist he watched the other man leave then finished his caramel wafer before heading outside to the smoking zone rebus had brought the misper files with him to gayfield square he made sure page saw him lugging them to siobhan clarkes desk it took three trips the saab parked out front with its police official business sign prominent thanks for the help rebus said to the room at large he was sweating so removed his jacket and draped it over clarkes chair a female officer came across to ask him about the boxes missing persons he explained three of them between and all last seen on or around the a just like annette mckie she lifted the lid of the topmost box and peered inside she stood a little over five feet tall short dark hair in what rebus might have called a pageboy cut she reminded him of an actress maybe it was audrey hepburn im john he said everybody knows who you are then im at a disadvantage detective constable esson but i suppose you can call me christine you always seem to be glued to your computer he told her thats my job oh she placed the lid back on the box and gave him her full attention im our link with the online community you mean you send emails i contact networks john missing persons networks ive been posting on twitter and facebook plus updating the l and b website asking for sightings esson nodded making sure her photo is disseminated as widely as possible an ask can circulate the globe in seconds these networks rebus asked would they have details of historic cases esson looked at the boxes again might well have want me to check could you do that give me their names and dates of birth photos if you have them she paused i thought your theory was theyre all dead as of now thats all it is a theory worth challenging wouldnt you say sure names dobs photos she nodded and anything else relevant distinguishing marks where they were last seen got it rebus said and thanks she accepted this with the beginnings of a blush and retreated to her desk rebus found a pad of paper and began to write down a few salient details about sally hazlitt and the others twenty minutes later he took the information along with a selection of photos over to esson she seemed bemused ever heard of email is there something wrong with my handwriting she smiled and shook her head then read out a line from his notes on zoe beddows liked the men im sure you can find a way of rephrasing it i certainly hope so she studied the photographs ill scan these in as best i can nothing a bit more highres afraid not oh well i see youve met christine siobhan clarke said approaching the desk she had a bag slung over one shoulder and a laptop tucked under her other arm dont let her challenge you to one of her shootemup games shes lethal esson was blushing again as rebus followed clarke to her own little parcel of land how was pitlochry he asked fine the police station serviceable clarke looked over towards esson thing about playing games online she went on you get to know people annette mckie played online games rebus commented and christines been in touch with dozens of people she played with if any of them hear a peep from their friend zelda christine will know about it she broke off and stared at the boxes well done you by the way though now theyre here she made show of scanning the office for a spare desk is there another room we could use rebus suggested ill look into it she shrugged herself free of her coat and sat down heavily before noticing his jacket draped over the chair let me get that rebus said no leave it she was opening the laptop got the interviews on here she explained audio only was there someone there from tayside police an inspector all the way from perth we didnt exactly hit it off but you spoke to everyone you needed to she nodded and rubbed her eyes the fatigue obvious want me to get you a coffee rebus suggested she looked at him so its true what they say there is a first time for everything and a last if youre going to have a go at me sorry she allowed herself a yawn the two poles work the night shift stefan skiladz did the translating both were involved in petty crime in their younger days back in the homeland gang stuff fights and pilfering they swear theyve kept their noses clean since coming here ill run their names through the system just to be sure i already ran a check on skiladz and he was telling us the truth never a hint of backpedalling since he got out of jail why do i get the feeling youre leaving the interesting stuff till last she looked up at him maybe i will take that coffee she said rebus obliged on his return he saw that she was busy on her desk computer she accepted the mug with a nod of thanks thomas robertson she said works the day shift doesnt like nights prefers to spend them in the watering holes of pitlochry theres a particular barmaid hes keen on though he didnt say if the feeling is mutual he told me he was in trouble just the once resisting arrest after a fight with a girlfriend outside a club in aberdeen and he wasnt telling the whole truth she tapped a fingernail against the computer screen and angled it a little so rebus could have a better view robertson had been charged with attempted rape the victim someone hed met that night the assault happening in an alleyway behind the club hed served two years in hmp peterhead and had been out of prison less than twelve months rebus did a quick calculation in his head zoe beddows had vanished in june only a couple of months prior to robertsons arrest what do you think clarke was asking what does he say about annette mckie denies seeing her says they were working flat out that afternoon he doubts hed have noticed a supermodel strolling past rebus was looking at robertsons mug shot short black hair plenty of stubble and a scowl darkbrown eyes chiselled features i think we need to talk to him again a bit more formally clarke was saying and maybe have a team search the area around the roadworks its a mix of woodland and fields plus a stretch of river needleinahaystack stuff rebus commented he realised christine esson was standing just behind him holding out some sheets of paper he took them from her two essays she explained both looking at where killers choose to leave their victims bit of light reading for you any chance of you giving me the gist ive not looked at them just printed them off plenty more like them out there if youre interested rebus was about to tell her that he really wasnt but he noticed the look clarke was giving him very helpful he said instead thanks christine clarke added as esson returned to her desk then to rebus shes like that theres about thirty pages here half of it equations clarke took the two documents from him i know one of the authors by reputation i mean i wonder if james has considered bringing in a profiler and maybe a ouija board at the same time times have changed john for the better im sure she made to hand the essays back to him and he wrinkled his nose you take first look he said you know how much i value your opinion christine gave them to you rebus looked over to essons desk she was watching he managed a smile and a nod as he placed the printouts on top of one of the storage boxes want to come with me while i tell james the news clarke asked not really i suppose i should have asked you what youve been up to me not much rebus paused apart from dropping you in it with the complaints so i should probably say sorry for that clarke stared at him tell me she said that evening rebus barely had time to open the days post and stick an album on the deck before his phone rang he checked the number not recognised hello he said he was in the kitchen staring at the meagre contents of the fridge rebus whos asking frank hammell darryl gave you my number get your arse down to the gimlet lets do some talking before i can agree to that ive got a question go ahead does the gimlet do food this time of night takeaway pizza was the answer it was waiting in a box for him still warm at a corner table there was no one else in the place just donny on the door no tv or sound system no one serving behind the bar right little mary celeste rebus commented lifting a slice of pizza from the box and heading towards the bar hammell stood behind it arms stretched along the polished surface he was around five ten with a look that mixed entrepreneur with scrapper he wore a dark blue shirt open at the neck and his sleeves were rolled up his thick saltandpepper hair was well groomed close up rebus could make out scarring leading from his top lip to his nose one eyebrow had a permanent nick in it here was a man who tended not to back down when things got heated ill have a malt if youre asking hammell turned and reached for a bottle of glenlivet the stopper squeaking as it was removed he didnt bother measuring just poured freely im guessing no water he said placing the drink in front of rebus then palm extended thatll be five on the nose rebus stared at him then smiled and handed over the money hammell didnt ring it up just stuffed it into his pocket there had been no sign of surveillance outside and rebus had to wonder what it would do to malcolm foxs head if he ever learned of this meeting so youre john rebus hammell said his voice was a deep gargle sounded as if his throat needed clearing rebus had known a con once whod sounded like that because someone had tried to strangle him with a towel in his cell i suppose i am he said just like youre frank hammell i used to hear about you you know i worked with cafferty way he tells it you worked for him rather than with him back in the day he hated you with a vengeance should have heard the things he was prepared to do to you and yours hammell gave this time to sink in he walked to the corner table and retrieved the pizza placing it on the bar top and helping himself to a slice its not bad rebus informed him better not be i told them what id do to them if the cheese was too stringy he took a bite i cant abide stringy cheese you should write restaurant reviews there was silence for a moment as the two men ate know what i think hammell said eventually i think they left the cheese out altogether one solution to the problem rebus stated so you and cafferty hammell went on dabbing at his mouth with the back of his hand best of pals these days eh news gets around ever wondered what his game is all the time bastard says hes retired as if carpet bowls and a pair of slippers were ever his style rebus took out his handkerchief to deal with the grease on his fingers one slice of the pizza was enough you dont like it hammell asked not as hungry as i thought rebus lifted the whisky to his lips darryl tells me youre working cold cases so how come youre suddenly interested in annette rebus considered how to answer there may be a pattern what do you mean other young women have vanished down the years three that we know of the first in all of them were on the a or near it at the time first ive heard i wanted you to know hammell stared at rebus narrowing his eyes a little why because youre probably drawing up a list of enemies thinking one of them might have her what makes you think ive got enemies business youre in id say its an occupational hazard you think ill go after your old pal cafferty is that what this is about you covering his arse if you want cafferty be my guest but i think youd be making a mistake rebus put down the halfempty glass hows annettes mum doing how do you think its ripping her to shreds you really reckon theres some sick bastard out there whos done this before how come hes kept himself under the radar as of now its only a theory but you believe it its a theory rebus repeated but one you need to be aware of if things arent to get ugly fair enough how long has darryl been working for you since before he left school i notice he kept his dads surname hammell glowered at rebus kid can do what he likes free country last time i looked i assume the dad knows about annette of course youve known the family a while what business is that of yours rebus offered a shrug and watched hammell do some thinking anything i can do to help the man asked eventually rebus shook his head a bit of cash maybe case of hooch rebus pretended to consider this maybe just dont charge me for the pizza what makes you think i paid for it in the first place frank hammell answered with a snort siobhan clarke lived in a highceilinged firstfloor flat that was part of a georgian terrace just off broughton street a fiveminute walk took her to work each morning and she liked the areas mix of bars and restaurants there was a cinema complex at the top of the hill a concert venue nearby and every kind of shop you could ever wish for on leith walk the flat shared a drying green at the back of the building and shed got to meet most of her neighbours down the years edinburgh had a reputation for being cold and distant but shed never found that some residents were shy or quiet just wanting to get on with their lives without fuss or incident her neighbours knew her as a police officer but had yet to ask for help or a favour when one of the groundfloor flats had been broken into everyone had gone out of their way to let clarke know they didnt blame her for the eventual lack of a result she had been thinking about an evening visit to her gym and had even changed in readiness before slumping on the sofa and checking the tv schedules instead when her phone let her know she had a message she decided to ignore it then her door buzzer sounded she went into the hall and pushed the button next to the intercom yes she asked di clarke its malcolm fox clarke sucked air in between her teeth how do you know where i live or is that a stupid question can i come in no you cant any particular reason im expecting someone dci page perhaps christ the complaints really did know everything something to hide di clarke fox was asking i just like my privacy yes me too and that time we happened to bump into one another i was trusting that youd have understood our little chat was meant to be kept private then you should have said still i can appreciate that john rebus is an old and dear friend you probably feel no qualms about sharing information with him though two doors seventeen stone steps and a passageway separated them it felt as if his mouth was only an inch or so from her face she could hear each of his individual breaths john rebus is proving invaluable to the mckie inquiry she stated you mean hes not gone out on one of his famous limbs yet not as far as youre aware why cant you just leave him alone why cant you see that hes the same liability hes always been dont tell me life wasnt simpler before he managed to inveigle his way on to the mckie case what do you mean why do you think hes there what titbits might he be passing back to his good friend cafferty working cold cases is one thing but now he has access to an entire floor of cid offices in gayfield square you dont know what youre talking about i know a cop gone bad when i see one rebus has spent so many years crossing the line hes managed to rub it out altogether as far as hes concerned his ways the right way no matter how wrong the rest of us might know it to be you dont know him clarke persisted then help me get to know him talk me through some of the cases the pair of you worked so you can twist it all around im not that stupid i know youre not far from it and this is your chance to prove it to the people at the top the people i talk to each and every day i grass up my friend and you put in a word come promotion time john rebus should be extinct clarke somehow the ice age came and went and left him still swimming around while the rest of us evolved id rather bludgeon darwin with a claw hammer than evolve into you she heard him give a sigh were not so different he said quietly sounding weary were both conscientious and hardworking i can even see you joining the complaints maybe not this year or next but sometime i dont think so my instincts usually right and yet you couldnt be more wrong about john rebus that remains to be seen meantime take care around him i mean that and feel free to call me any time you think hes floundering floundering or diving to the bottom she released the intercom button and walked back into her living room crossing to the window and peering down on to the street craning her neck left and right where the hell did he go she said to herself failing to see malcolm fox anywhere then she looked at the message on her phone im minutes away and hope we can discuss your friend some more fox they had her home address and her mobile number and they knew about page she sat back down in front of the tv but her head was swimming gym she said rising again and looking around for her holdall rebus was most of the way home when he got a text message it was from nina hazlitt missoni hotel too late for a drink he stayed on melville drive and took a left at the junction with buccleuch street then he thought of something and pulled over checked his phone again and opened the list of recent callers adding hammells mobile to his contacts page five minutes later he was parking on george iv bridge a member of the hotel staff asked him if he was checking in the man was young and toned and wearing a kilt with a zigzag pattern rebus shook his head just visiting he said there was a bar off the main reception rebus couldnt see nina hazlitt so he texted to let her know he had arrived the people in the bar seemed to have a thirst for cocktails rebus decided one more whisky wouldnt do any harm except to his chances of passing a breathalyser test two minutes later hazlitt joined him pecking him on the cheek as if it was the most natural thing in the world have you eaten she asked the restaurants supposed to be good or theres a fish place next door im fine rebus assured her how about you i ate on the train one of the bar staff asked her what she was drinking she studied rebus not really your kind of place she guessed not really he agreed maybe we should go somewhere else theres the bow bar right around the corner she waited for him to finish the whisky and placed her arm in his as they exited the hotel hows your brother rebus asked she looked flustered as if trying to remember how rebus knew about him he answered the phone that night rebus explained ah she said then hes all right does he have a name alfie is he just visiting or are you always this inquisitive she asked with a laugh then stretching out an arm to point at the bow bar is this the place rebus opened the door for her she took one look at the interior and declared it charming there was a table by the window recently vacated rebus took the empties to the bar and ordered ipa for himself and a vodka tonic for her the place was just noisy enough no chance of anyone eavesdropping on their conversation back at the table they chinked glasses so how are things she asked things are interesting ive got a foot in the door with the annette mckie inquiry they accept theres a connection they accept the possibility well thats progress she seemed immediately more energised pulling her shoulders back eyes gleaming theres no proof yet and to be honest the mckie case is throwing up other possibilities the photos are the real link photos he realised she didnt yet know annette mckies phone was used to send a photograph of a landscape at dusk same thing happened with zoe beddows she took a moment to digest the information that cant be coincidence what about brigid young the technology wasnt around back then sally had her phone with her in aviemore yes i remember you saying i dont think it could take pictures though she thought for a moment some of the people she knew at school keep a page for her on friends reunited thats kind of them it has photos of her school trips parties concerts any way to know who visits it i dont think so might be worth finding out she stared at him eyes narrowing why but before he could answer she had worked it out you think someone took her one person stalking all these girls and then sending out photos and he might have gone online posing as a friend her voice was rising and rebus gestured for her to bring it down a little she took a couple of sips of her drink trying to compose herself ill ask she said voice trembling ill ask sallys friends rebus thanked her and decided to try for a change of tack asking what brought her back to edinburgh you of course she eventually answered me youre the first person in such a long while whos taken me seriously and when you phoned the other night you decided to drop everything im selfemployed wherever i lay my laptop thats my office what do you do publishing sort of i edit peoples books do proofreading sometimes research sounds interesting she managed a laugh youre not a very convincing liar but it can be interesting last book i did was an encyclopaedia of myth and legend it covered the whole of the british isles quite a lot from scotland oh aye did you know theres a dragon buried beneath the royal mile she did a quick calculation we might be perched on one of its wings no shortage of stories in this city ive heard alibis that were harder to swallow she smiled i was a teacher for a while same as tom except primary school used to love telling my class a folk tale once you had their attention you kept it her voice trailed off he knew she was thinking of her daughter again doubted sally was ever out of her thoughts for more than a few minutes at a time on any given day she kept threatening to place her glass on the table but it hadnt quite happened yet it was almost reduced to ice in any case get you another rebus asked my turn im fine he said having hardly touched the pint got the car outside and this isnt my first tonight she decided to have another drink anyway reaching into her bag for money rebus played with a beer mat while he waited for her to return so anyway she said squeezing around the table and sitting down again youve managed to unearth the files on those other poor women the records arent as complete as id like he saw her look it happens things get mislaid notes that should have been written up arent oh not that there were gaps in sallys case he sought to reassure her is there any possibility that i no i suppose not she lowered her eyes i doubt theyd come as any consolation you might find them a bit upsetting i was going to say cold nobody working the case knew sally you see she nodded her understanding youre trying to protect me im not sure id put it like that they focused on their drinks for a minute rebus didnt know what else to say to her he didnt like to think of her as being trapped in limbo but thats where she was the past had its grip on her and wasnt letting go he worked with the past too but he could always put it back in a box and have it delivered to a storeroom or warehouse is there a draught he asked i dont think so thought you were shivering it happens sometimes you know that saying about someone walking over your grave never really understood it though now you come to mention it im not sure i understand it either sure you dont want another trying to get me arrested for drunkdriving couldnt you talk your way out of it not these days she grew thoughtful again working cold cases you must meet a lot of families whove lost loved ones she watched him nod i talk to a lot of them too over the internet mostly you know that in england and wales they cant issue a death certificate no matter how long the persons been missing its hell for the families means they cant sort out the estate up here you wait seven years and the court gives you a presumption of death certificate and thats what happened to you she shook her head presumptions not what i want i need to know what happened to her even after all this time even after all this time she echoed then she sighed finished her drink in two gulps and asked if he would walk her back to the hotel my pleasure he said as they walked back up victoria street he told her hed not been in the missoni before i doubt id be able to afford it normally she explained but i got a late deal the kilted doorman didnt seem to be around they stopped at the steps both lighting cigarettes standing in companionable silence as the traffic and pedestrians rolled past the rooms are nice she said eventually in fact she looked in her bag there was something i wanted to give you but its upstairs she looked up at him do you want to but he was already shaking his head then will you wait here while i fetch it sure so she stubbed out her cigarette and headed indoors three minutes later she was back holding a book here she said handing it over rebus read the title aloud the british isles myth and magic is this the one you did research for she nodded watching as he flicked through a few pages thanks he said i mean it ill start it tonight look about earlier i hope you dont think i was trying to proposition you he shook his head again not a problem nina it would have been flattering if you had are you heading back in the morning she gestured towards the building across the street bit of research i need to do the national library yes is this for work she nodded i was thinking of staying another night there was an invitation there or at least an opening but rebus ignored it you know youll be the first person i call supposing i make any progress he said instead you seem to be my best hope john i cant thank you enough she moved forward to kiss him but he leaned back a little at the waist and instead took her hand in his shaking it her grip was almost fierce her whole body seemed to be vibrating maybe next time we can compare myths and legends he said she nodded averting her eyes then turned and hurried back into the hotel rebus got into his car turned the key in the ignition and signalled to make a uturn all the way home he was anticipating her call but it never came lochend at midnight darryl christie slipped out of the house hed been home less than an hour his mum was dead to the world having been prescribed sleeping pills darryls two younger brothers joseph and cal shared the bedroom next to annettes darryls own room was downstairs in what had been built as a conservatory hed added blackout blinds when hed taken it over several times frank hammell had offered to find them a bigger and nicer place but darryls mum had grown up in lochend as had her parents before her all her friends lived within walking distance of the house and besides darryl and annette would be moving out before long growing up with their own lives to live darryl had examined every inch of his sisters bedroom finding nothing to help explain her disappearance hed even contacted a few of her very closest pals but nobody seemed to have any ideas it had been darryl too who had broken the news to his father having reminded gail that someone needed to do it youre the man of the house darryl shed said reaching for the vodka bottle the house had seen more than its fair share of visitors faces darryl hardly knew wanted to offer sympathy sit with gail for a while and feed on her grief her closest friends had become like bodyguards fending off curious neighbours and rubberneckers the landline rang dozens of times a day and gails mobile was always needing to be recharged darryl had tried his best to stay out of it retreating to his room he could hear the voices in the living room and kitchen and often they tried offering him tea and beer and a sandwich tapping on his door and calling out to him and when everyone had departed for the day the house felt cold and empty joseph and cal walking on tiptoe so as not to disturb their mother doing homework without needing reminding making their own dinner if necessary when darryl was required elsewhere he would tell them youre in charge anything urgent phone me frank hammell had asked him if he needed time off but he had shaken his head cops are useless darryl hammell had said but ive got feelers out well get to the bottom of this one way or the other outside the house darryl paused to examine the sky overhead you never saw many stars too much light pollution there was the beginning of an overnight frost on the pavement and the car windscreens plenty of people still awake tvs glowing from living room windows some music from a distant party a dog barking desperate to be allowed back indoors darryl walked to the corner and shook the hand of the man standing there i thought we might walk cafferty said not far just to stop us freezing our backsides off sure darryl said slipping his hands into his pockets weve not met before have we cafferty asked him no its just that sometimes i forget a face and that looks like a lack of respect next time i see the person he glanced towards the young man dont want that happening between us darryl okay mr cafferty how long have you been working for frank a while he used to work for me you know your names been mentioned probably not with any great enthusiasm a taxi rumbled past driversside window down seeking an address cafferty watched it as did darryl cant be too careful eh the older man said with a thin smile then i should have said at the start im sorry about your sister anything i can do to help you only have to ask thanks frank doesnt need to know it can be between us if thats okay with you darryl cafferty seemed to study the young man i met your dad a few times back in the day really just in the pub you know he was friends with frank aye he was but then they say loves no respecter of friendship cafferty turned a corner and darryl realised they were doing a little circuit that would bring them back to his house i like that you kept your dads surname cafferty was saying are you still in touch with him darryl nodded well tell him i said hello ill do that look i hope you dont mind me asking but why are we out for a walk together at the dead of night cafferty chuckled then sniffed and reached into his pocket for a handkerchief you know a cop called rebus he asked as he wiped at his nose ive spoken to him he mentioned your name to me ive got a lot of friends in this town people who make sure im as well informed as i need to be you might think frank has a lot of friends too but theyre not the sort that can always be trusted what do you think he would do if it turned out one of them had snatched your sister what if they were using her as a bargaining tool of some kind thats not what the cops think happened and theyre always right are they come on darryl we know better than that but im hearing that youre a bright one and thats why were out here together tonight frank hammells enemies are going to see you as their enemy too which means a friend like me makes sense thats all im asking cafferty stretched out his arms to consolidate the point anything you feel able to share ill listen later on it might be that youre ready to step out from franks shadow and youll be there to help im here for you and your family darryl any time you feel you need me frank says youre retired maybe i am so why the interest lets just say theres a bit of history between us a score to be settled maybe outside the house they shook hands again still living at home eh cafferty commented for the moment ive got a few flats i could let you take a look at but darryl shook his head you know your own mind i like that about you too cafferty patted the young mans arm and turned starting to walk away darryl watched him disappear slowly into the darkness then angled his head towards the night sky again there were stars up there plenty of them you just had to believe ive always liked perth siobhan clarke said just maybe not this particular bit of it she was standing outside the divisional police hq with rebus keeping him company while he smoked a cigarette the building itself was a tall concrete lump hacked up from the s or s tenements across the street and a petrol station next door when are you ever in perth rebus asked away games st johnstones ground is just off the m you go to away games rebus sounded disbelieving clarke supported hibernian fc time was shed taken rebus to a few home matches back in the days when you could smoke in the stadium he couldnt remember ever seeing a goal just a succession of nilnil draws made bearable by nicotine and the halftime pie theres a game in edinburgh this weekend if you fancy it she was saying thought not she added seeing the look on his face so what did you get up to last night i had a quiet one just a bit of reading those papers christine got off the internet christ no what then hell are you smiling for i can read you know someone behind them cleared his throat he stood in the doorway doing everything but tap his watch when youre ready he told them he was a uniformed inspector by the name of peter lightheart same cop who had been with clarke the previous day at pitlochry clarke had introduced rebus to him on their arrival this morning rebus taking the proffered hand briefly before advising that he would need a quick cigarette before they got started lighthearts demeanour belied his name clarke had already warned rebus that the man lacked patience wit and cunning so we need to crowd him out of the interview if we can two ticks rebus told lightheart indicating that hed almost finished with the cigarette to deflect the mans attention clarke asked if the search team had been given its orders of course lightheart replied probably been at it for the past hour how many officers a dozen search warrant for the sleeping quarters lightheart nodded looking annoyed that she would think it necessary to check why here rebus asked getting rid of his cigarette butt sorry lightheart enquired doesnt pitlochry have a perfectly usable cop shop we could have talked to him there no proper interview room clarke explained and no technology meaning video camera and audio equipment a uniformed officer was checking both as lightheart clarke and rebus filed into the groundfloor room there was nothing on the creamcoloured walls except a no smoking sign and some attempts at scratchwork graffiti the camera was high up in a corner pointing towards the table and three chairs thomas robertson was seated hands gripping the edge of the table one knee bouncing nervously he would be thinking to himself this is all looking serious which was the whole point of course all set lightheart asked the officer yes sir already recording lightheart settled himself opposite robertson clarke taking the only free chair left that was fine with rebus he rested his back against a wall facing robertson and quite visible to him lightheart waited for the officer to leave then got busy with the formalities making introductions for the benefit of the camera and announcing location date and time as soon as he was finished robertson spoke theyre going to kick me off the job he complained whys that twice in two days youve dragged me away from my shift theres a reason for that mr robertson clarke told him she had printed out the details of his arrest and conviction if youd told us the truth yesterday we might not be here i did tell you the truth lets be charitable and say you played down the seriousness of the assault clarke began to read from the charge sheet robertsons eyes met rebuss but saw no sympathy in them when clarke had finished the room was silent for a moment resisting arrest after a fight with your girlfriend clarke commented no mr robertson attempted rape of a woman youd only just met it wasnt like that we were both smashed she was keen enough at the start clarke held up a photograph taken at the victims hospital bedside cuts bruises abrasions and a black eye youre not telling me she was keen on that things got a bit he shifted in his chair he was the same man as in the mug shot clarke had shown rebus but something in him had changed life had roughed him up a bit maybe prison where he would have been segregated with the other sex offenders maybe just the passage of time he had been handsome but was rapidly losing those looks where did you grow up clarke asked pretending to sift her notes for the details quick change of tack classic interview technique robertson was going to be kept on his toes rebus had never seen clarke lead an interview before lightheart had having spent the previous day with her and rebus hoped the man knew there was nothing to be gained from interrupting nairn robertson told her not too far from inverness she checked far enough he said what road is that he looked quizzical the a you were born in thats right in nairn correct clarke made show of studying her notes again robertson ran his tongue over his lips drymouthed do you remember the millennium mr robertson lightheart failed to hide his surprise at the question half turning his head in clarkes direction eh robertson asked hogmanay everybody remembers where they were robertson had to think aberdeen probably with mates probably im sure it was aberdeen clarke wrote this down she was still writing as she threw out her next question any partners since you got out of jail women you mean she looked up at him or men he gave a snort no thanks women then she conceded thereve been a few he ran his hands down either side of his face making a rasping sound of palm against stubble there were homemade asterisk tattoos on his knuckles and now theres this barmaid in pitlochry gina yes she knows youve done jail time i told her same story you told us clarke was staring at him across the table maybe i should just check that look ive already said i never saw that girl lets try and keep calm lightheart advised so you were living in the northeast clarke asked into the silence what the attempted rape it took place at the back of a nightclub in aberdeen so so you were living there sort of clarke read from her notes sleeping on friends floors you were unemployed at the time thats right but looking for work yes travelling about a bit what is all this robertson looked at all three of them in turn what are you trying to do here how well do you know the a mr robertson when he didnt answer clarke asked again i fucking work on it dont i he spat easy lightheart said in warning look yesterday it was all whether id seen that girl or not but now its and and god knows what okay i spent some time in the nick okay i didnt tell you the whole truth its not something i go around shouting from the rooftops he leaned forward its not something im proud of he stressed having made his point he sat back again the chair making a single creak of protest clarke let the silence lie studying the paperwork again you didnt spend the millennium in aviemore she eventually asked no robertson answered sounding suddenly tired youre sure about that why the hell would i go to aviemore maybe someone invited you they didnt its not that far from aberdeen robertson just gave a slow shake of the head strathpeffer he looked at her couldnt even place it on a map auchterarder nope and you didnt see annette mckie the day she disappeared clarke held up the photo of the missing girl so it was facing robertson for the hundredth time no weve got some officers going through the portakabin where you sleep want to tell us what theyll find there dirty washing anything else a bit of hash or speed i wouldnt know anything about that porn maybe one of the lads has a laptop then itll be taken away and examined making me mr popular do your workmates know why you went to jail something tells me theyll be finding out the look he gave clarke had hardened you cant pin the girl on me so something else will have to do and if all else fails at least youll see me kicked out of a job youre not being charged clarke gathered up her papers is that it then robertson looked around the room clarke nodded towards lightheart and he formally concluded the interview did you bring him here in a patrol car she asked yes lightheart replied send him back the same way clarke stared at robertson he was wiping perspiration from his palms on to his trousers he can catch a bus clarke said striding from the room not a good sign clarke said entering the office at gayfield square dc christine esson was standing next to clarkes desk looking fretful what is it clarke asked her best if you come see so they followed esson to her computer and stood either side of her as she sat down and got busy twitter rebus said clarke looked at him you know what it is right of course rebus said theres a missing persons network esson explained they use twitter to get information out annette mckies got her own hashtag clarke gave rebus another glance its how you get something trending she explained uhhuh the screen was filled with messages all of them ending annettemckie mostly esson said theyre linking to annettes profile just trying to get her description out there but look at this one she zeroed in on a particular message police iving road crew a north of pitlochry annettemckie then theres this she added highlighting another police team scouring woods near a north of pitlochry loads of them annettemckie posted by different people clarke commented locals by the look of it esson added heres another cop car near totalled me doing a uturn heading s from roadworks siren and lights theyve got so annettemckie looks like tayside constabulary went about things with their usual subtlety rebus muttered straightening up i dont think you realise john clarke turned to esson show him with a few deft clicks and taps esson did just that half a dozen blogs are on to it she said plus local media ronnie has had to fob off a couple of reporters already as if on cue the phone rang again on ronnie ogilvies desk he picked it up said a few words then put the receiver down rising to his feet he walked towards them bbc he said wanting to know if its true were connecting annette mckie to three other disappearances they didnt get that from twitter esson said nina hazlitt clarke guessed eyes fixed on rebus he offered a shrug spoken to her recently clarke persisted last night rebus conceded esson was studying the bbc scotland news feed on her monitor here it is she declared it was only a paragraph of text no video or photo to accompany it the mother of a teenager who disappeared from aviemore at hogmanay says detectives in edinburgh are probing links between that mystery and missing schoolgirl annette mckie who vanished a fortnight ago while travelling from edinburgh to inverness it is believed that other women have gone missing from the same stretch of road one in and another in nina hazlitt whose yearold daughter sally disappeared from a new years holiday in aviemore hopes that fresh clues including photos sent from the victims phones can help provide answers to what she calls the a abductions there was a link to the mckie press conference accompanied by a still of gail mckie fleeing the room ogilvies telephone was ringing again so was clarkes mobile she was looking in the direction of james pages door in for a penny she said but there was no need the door was flung open and dci page stood there his own phone pressed to his ear as he listened his pointed finger seemed to include rebus then jerked in the direction of the corridor clarke led the way rebus following close behind once they were outside the office page ended the call and closed the door then he folded his arms explain he said explain what sir clarke countered maybe you were huddled round christines screen to look at cats being funny on the internet no james we were looking at twitter and the bbc then you know what im talking about of course but i still dont see what needs explaining everyones a reporter these days a patrol car turns up at the same spot on the a two days running people nearby are going to gossip about it used to be the garden fence would do but now its twitter and the like no way we can stop it in fact we should do the opposite rebus offered get tongues wagging peoples memories whirring page glowered at him what about this hazlitt woman wheres she getting her information from speculation rather than information clarke jumped in its the same story shes always told only thing thats changed is theres a new misper for the media to hang it on page considered this eyes still on rebus clarke was looking at him too willing him to keep his mouth shut we need to get the photo from annette mckies phone out there rebus stated ignoring her if the public want a story we should give them one get them working for us looks like our only hope anyway of finding out where it was taken and you should give a statement to the press clarke added turning her attention to page just you this time set the record straight page tried not to seem overly keen on the idea you think so definitely rebus added dampen down some of the wilder speculation make sure everythings kept in proportion nothing too formal clarke went on maybe outside the station its not very photogenic page argued hq maybe can you get on to our media people siobhan sure show the press the photo at the same time rebus nudged theyll lap it up page seemed to be visualising the scene he nodded slowly has to be today though clarke prompted while the storys still hot ill need a full briefing from the pair of you full and quick he thought of something else and looked down at the clothes he was wearing your suit looks fine clarke reassured him after the briefing in pages airless office rebus headed outdoors for a cigarette he punched nina hazlitts number into his phone but she wasnt answering he was in the car park just about invisible to prying journalists for some reason he had an image in his mind of the tattoos on thomas robertsons knuckles there had been no mention of them on the original charge sheet and he wondered if they had been part of the prison experience robertson had barely been out of his teens when sally hazlitt had vanished not that this meant he couldnt be responsible zoe beddows had disappeared not long before hed attacked the victim outside the nightclub the thing was the nightclub attack had been brutal and stupid hed been apprehended straight away by people nearby who had heard the screams could the same person have plucked four women from the world without leaving evidence behind rebus doubted it but that didnt mean he hadnt done something to annette mckie spotted her gone after her left her somewhere sometimes you had to allow for coincidence the same road photos sent from mobile phones a song jumped into his head connection not the version by the stones but a cover by a band called montrose he had bought their album thinking they came from the town but they were american connection versus no connection just random events given shape by sheer force of a mothers will on cue his phone rang and he placed it to his ear hello he said sorry nina hazlitt explained i had to come outside theyre not keen on phones in the library youve been doing your research then yes but leaving enough time to talk to the bbc a news agency actually they must have passed it along everything you told them it could only have come from me oh she paused are you going to get in trouble would that bother you well yes of course im not so sure nina he waited for a response but heard only the passing traffic on george iv bridge you know that book you gave me he continued i started it last night a lot of things people used to believe turned out to be just stories feel free to mock me john dont imagine for a second that youre the first im not mocking you you think im seeing things that arent there she paused i dont have time for this the agency are taping an interview with me in an hour everyone needs to be aware john someone out there knows what happened im on your side nina i dont need anyone on my fucking side ive managed this far with a minimum of effort from the likes of you her voice had grown shrill it cracked on the last few words nina i didnt mean that she took a deep breath composing herself you know i didnt its okay if you dont want me to talk to them just tell me dci page is about to give a statement see what he has to say then make up your own mind okay okay youre still staying in town tonight changed my mind im on the six oclock train she hesitated i should have thought before i spoke to that journalist i hope youll still feel able to trust me lets see you promised id be first to know john im assuming you always keep your word say hello to your brother for me i hope ill see you again sometime john remember to keep in touch he ended the call back in the cid suite there was no sign of page or clarke rebus went over to christine essons desk and asked if she wanted a coffee dont drink the stuff tea she shook her head hot water thats what i like you should see the looks i get in cafes so he made himself a coffee and brought her her chosen drink youre a cheap date he commented she seemed to have twitter up on her screen again how does it work he asked drawing over a chair so she showed him and he told her to get the photo from sally hazlitts phone up there twitter facebook youtube and anywhere else you can think of no problem she said and the message to go with it we need to know where it was taken thats all anything else rebus thought for a moment then nodded any way i can watch custard pie while he does his thing for the great unwashed she looked uncomprehending pages meetthepress rebus elucidated shouldnt be a problem esson said with sound if at all possible of course she paused her eyes narrowing custard pie page and plant rebus said then seeing the look on her face never mind just get me that feed eh rebus spent the early evening reading more of the book nina hazlitt had given him concentrating on the scottish chapters filling his head with stories of cannibals shapeshifters witches and monsters when the buzzer sounded telling him someone was outside the main door of the tenement he went to the window he couldnt quite make out the figure but it wasnt cafferty his phone pinged with a text it was from clarke going to let me in rebus went into the hall and pressed the button next to the intercom as he opened his own door he could hear her pushing at the main door he went out on to the landing and leaned over the rail what happened to you after the press conference he called out summoned to the chief constables office he wanted a briefing of his own she took the two flights of stairs at a canter he knew she used a gym sometimes or had done in the past still go jogging he asked some weekends nothing too strenuous she looked over his shoulder towards the flats interior do i wait for an invite or rebus hesitated for a second then led her inside as they reached the living room he asked her if she wanted a drink im okay she said just a social visit is it she shrugged seeming distracted the photo from annette mckies phone is out there now yes rebus said now we wait for someone to pinpoint where it is he paused theres something you want to tell me while we were at fettes she eventually explained malcolm fox happened by oh as you guessed he wasnt exactly thrilled id been talking to you id say hes the type whos seldom thrilled by anything he had a word with james too asked why youd been brought in to the mckie case is he trying to get me thrown off it im not sure but at the very least page now sees me as a bigger liability than ever i did have to fight your corner she had settled on the arm of the sofa as if planning only a short stay rebuss book was on the floor by his chair and she angled her head to read the cover myth and magic and old wives tales rebus added so did you manage to convince your boss i think so and did that involve using your feminine charms she gave him a cold look sorry rebus apologised its just that hes a showroom dummy i know it and you know it but hes not youre seeing what you want to see has there ever been anyone of a higher rank that youve not dismissed out of hand plenty rebus paused in the old days these arent the old days john and james is good at what he does youve seen the team hes put together do they seem unmotivated no rebus was forced to admit is there anything theyre not doing that they should be no he repeated well then page is one of the good guys thats what youre saying but her attention had been diverted to the wall above the dining table and the large map of scotland pinned there the route of the a marked in red highlighter meant to take that down rebus said clarke was walking towards the map looking not at it but at the three large shopping bags sitting on the table stuff needs putting away rebus said casually but he wasnt fooling her she pulled a few sheets of paper from the first bag you made copies she stated all those files you brought to the office not all of them rebus countered just the official reports and statements i skipped the newspaper cuttings jesus john youve seen what the office is like siobhan i lugged all those boxes in there and theyve not been opened yet you might not have noticed but weve been a bit busy you were going to find another room we could use and i will given a bit of time she paused but thats not what this is about you made the copies before you handed the boxes over you never intended to let them go not completely i get bored siobhan a bit of reading whiles away the hours she gave him another look this sort of thing its meat and drink to the complaints only if they find out about it what makes you think they wont rebus shrugged this is the way ive always worked siobhan you know that its also why people you work with tend not to last long remember brian holmes and jack morton she watched as his face darkened okay sorry thats a low blow did fox just happen to drop those names into your wee chat hes out to get you john he even came to my flat when last night warning me off telling me i should be on his side rather than yours she began to slide the sheets of paper back into the shopping bag then asked him if hed seen nina hazlitts interview was it on tv clarke shook her head webcast for some news agency she thanked us for everything we were doing nice of her she handles herself well in front of a camera no sign of craziness shes not crazy but rebus was remembering her last phone call voice verging on the hysterical she still needs reining in if at all possible and im the man for the job is this your thinking or pages rebus waited for an answer but none was forthcoming he told you to come here he walked to the window and peered down on to the street is he waiting in his car what does he drive it was a bmw doubleparked twenty yards up there was someone in the drivers seat why didnt you bring him in afraid it might have diluted those feminine charms of yours she glowered at him this was my idea john and if i had brought him up youd be off the case right now she pointed towards the shopping bags he wouldnt have got over the threshold she closed her eyes for a second a text arrived on her phone thatll be him rebus muttered wondering whats taking so long clarke read the text and turned towards the door ill see you in the morning she said quietly is he dropping you at yours or is it back to his she didnt rise to it just walked out of the room rebus stayed by the window watching her exit the tenement and head towards the car its lights came on as she approached picking her out as though she were an actor making her entrance the passengerside door opened and closed the bmw remaining motionless as a dialogue took place then it began to crawl down arden streets gentle slope towards the junction passing rebuss building in the process driver and passenger staring straight ahead he willed clarke to look up but she didnt played that with your usual charm and grace he muttered to himself siobhan clarke was stuck somewhere between page and fox and he could see how much it was hurting her how much he was hurting her good at her job ready for the next step up life on an even keel and then in walks john rebus not even bothering to wipe his shoes leaving bits of muck everywhere without even noticing aye nicely played john he lit a cigarette and poured himself a whisky stopping when the liquid was halfway to the top of the glass he sat himself at the dining table eyes focused on the road map after a while the glass needed refilling and the ashtray emptying without music he realised how empty the room felt but he couldnt find an album to match his mood he thought of calling siobhan clarke apologising for everything or maybe a text keep it short and sweet instead of which he ended up in his armchair with the book nina hazlitt had given him there were no serpents buried beneath edinburgh and no monster swimming in loch ness it was all just superstition and the basic human hunger for explanations answers reasons when his eyelids began to droop he decided that was fine just one more night when he wouldnt quite make it as far as the bedroom the guardian of the front desk at gayfield square still showed reluctance to allow rebus entry each morning she printed him a fresh visitors pass and at the end of each day she needed him to return it be easier doing me one for a week rebus suggested trying to remember her name you might not be here a week she countered think of the environmental damage youre doing i recycle them she handed him that days pass needs to be worn at all times remember absolutely as he climbed to the first floor he unclipped the badge and stuffed it into his jacket the office had just started work for the day he nodded towards ronnie ogilvie and passing christine essons desk asked her if she had any new wonders to show him just these she said he took the sheets of paper from her theyre efits she explained theres a guy i know on a force down south hes a dab hand with the software rebus stared at the three faces in turn sally hazlitt brigid young and zoe beddows had been aged so that each photo showed them as they might look in the present day hazlitt was the most changed not surprising since she had been missing the longest a woman of thirty eyes and cheekbones still much like her mothers beddows and young were more recognisably the same women who had disappeared a few lines had been added to youngs face her eyes hollower mouth sagging slightly beddows was shown in her late twenties still sharpfeatured but losing some of her spark what do you think esson was asking pretty good rebus admitted he did some others different hairstyles rebus nodded and she knew what he was thinking pretty pointless if theyre dead she commented i think you should circulate them but get pages permission first mr trampled underfoot she gave rebus a smile i did my research last night pages door opened and he fixed his eyes on rebus then gave a little flick of the head by way of summons rebus helped himself to a mug of coffee first then knocked and went in there was no space for a chair for visitors yesterday with three of them in there it had been a sweat box yet somehow it suited page a man who liked his parameters tight no room for manoeuvre john he said sitting down behind his laptop yes james good to see you here so early rebus just nodded ready for whatever was coming shows motivation but we need focus also absolutely pages words were just filling time while he considered how to broach the real subject rebus decided to spare him any more effort is it to do with the complaints he guessed in a way meaning yes specifically and definitely sorry if i seem to be bringing a bit of baggage with me rebus said rest assured it wont interfere with my work good man and hows that work going slower than id like you appreciate that annette mckie has to be our priority of course and we cant let your historical cases get in the way nina hazlitt isnt going to take a telling from me shes been waiting years for this opportunity is she still in edinburgh as far as i know she went back to london last night well thats something i suppose he pressed his palms together as if in prayer resting his mouth against the tips of his fingers dont suppose youve seen siobhan this morning rebus asked trying to keep his tone casual page shook his head and checked his watch not like her to be tardy unless she was late to bed page stared at him i dropped her home at quarter past nine if thats what youre getting at rebus pretended to show surprise no nothing like that i just thought he was interrupted by his mobile phone siobhan clarkes name was on the screen talk of the devil he said pressing the phone to his ear where are you clarke asked in the office why im parked outside better get down here whats happened robertsons bunks not been slept in he didnt get back to the camp last night the m again but only once theyd escaped the sluggish morning traffic in edinburgh heading towards perth and the a a quick pit stop to pick up beakers of tea and dry croissants kate bush still singing about snowmen as they crossed the forth road bridge rebus asked clarke if she noticed anything different she studied him and shook her head no scaffolding on the rail bridge she looked to her right and saw this was true cant remember the last time i saw it without he added yes she agreed then look im sorry about last night me too hope you didnt have words with james afterwards she glanced towards him what makes you think that nothing he paused for effect its just that i was in his bolthole when you phoned and he was giving me a slap on the wrist about the complaints and she repeated growing a little more irritated and nothing rebus stressed i just got a feeling the two of you had you know maybe had words before he dropped you at your flat and if thats the case im sorry i was the cause you can be a real bastard sometimes john she shook her head slowly it has been said he admitted and believe me im not proud of the fact thing is though you are proud of the fact she looked at him again you really are they drove in silence after that rebus staring at the scenery the elongated stretches of hillside near kinross the merest glimpse of loch leven the way the view opened up as they rounded a curve in the road and entered perthshire snow visible along the topmost ridge of the distant ochils he guessed they were the ochils didnt feel like checking with clarke when her phone rang she pressed a button on the steering wheel and answered with a voice raised above the engine noise di clarke she informed the caller its lightheart the inspectors dull drone seemed to emanate from the same speaker as kate bush clarke pressed another button to mute the cd give me an update she said he seems to have got on the bus all right it dropped him near the works some of the men gave him short shrift though didnt like that their portakabin had been searched so he didnt hang about told them he was going into pitlochry that was the last they saw of him hes done a runner clarke confirmed looks like anyone talked to his girlfriend the barmaid you mean not yet could he be shacked up with her it would solve all our problems and if someone had checked first thing it would be saving me this bloody drive want me to do it then no ill talk to her when i get there rebus took note of that i not we are you in pitlochry she was now asking lightheart yes but i need to head back to perth eleven oclock meeting i cant be late for you do that then well talk again after she ended the call and signalled to overtake the lorry in front want the cd back on rebus eventually asked clarke shook her head a little later she decided to put a question to him you dont think its him do you no because hes got a short fuse and thats not the sort of person who goes years between victims right rebus agreed she nodded slowly so why did he run its what people like him do act on instinct no forethought rebus decided it might be okay to throw in a question of his own did the search turn up anything they want to know if its worth putting a couple of frogmen in loch tummel and is it jamess call what about robertsons stuff pretty much as you said half an ounce of cannabis a few knockoff dvds porn some hard core no s and m if thats what you mean she looked at him again this from the man who doesnt rate profilers common sense comes cheaper she managed a smile the ice between them was melting that book in your flat did nina hazlitt give it to you how did you know its on her facebook bio that she edits books including myths and legends did you know that ringaroses is about the plague i thought everybody knew that rebus decided to try again sawney bean clarke thought for a moment cannibal except he probably never existed it was antijacobite propaganda according to one theory doesnt take much to get a rumour started is the burry man in your book clarke asked he is you ever seen him in the flesh last august took the car to queensferry and watched him marching around taking a drink from anyone that offered covered top to toe in burrs no idea how he managed to pee she paused could nina hazlitt be putting together a new bogeyman i as good as asked her the same thing and she wasnt happy about it shes an editor by trade so she creates order john if theres one person responsible for all these disappearances that gives some sense to whats otherwise senseless and were back to psychology again not got much else have we weve got a lot of people who dont seem to be around any more there is that when she asked him if he wanted to choose a cd he knew hed been forgiven his latest transgressions the tummel arms wouldnt open for business for another hour but its door was unlocked it was a bright bustling morning on pitlochrys atholl road neighbours stood on the pavements grocery bags or dog leads in hand and shared the local gossip they were used to visitors and hadnt paid clarke and rebus a moments notice hello clarke called out pushing open the pub door the place smelled of bleach stools and chairs had been placed on tables so the floor could be sluiced a woman appeared from the direction of the ladies loo toting a mop were looking for gina andrews clarke explained the woman pushed a stray hair behind one ear shes at the bakers wont be long though well wait if thats okay the cleaner shrugged then disappeared again trusting souls up here rebus remarked eyeing the unguarded row of optics on the gantry not really clarke replied nodding towards the cctv camera above the door the door itself swung open and another woman negotiated her way inside carrying a large plastic tray piled high with individually bagged rolls and sandwiches she heaved it on to the bar and exhaled noisily police she said turning towards her visitors thats right clarke said about tommy thomas robertson yes his cars still parked out the back how long has it been there only since last night he was in here then gina andrews shook her head she was in her thirties short and stocky with shoulderlength blonde hair she had that attitude necessary to good bar staff the world over fair but firm when the need arose someone it wouldnt be wise to get on the wrong side of he must have driven here but he didnt come in one of the regulars told me his car was there so i sent him a text nothing back she shook her head again and started transferring the rolls to a metal salver there was a printed label on each packet identifying the filling how much do you know about him ms andrews hes all right likes a drink and a laugh is he your andrews looked up from her work my bidiein nothing that serious just a friend then most nights would you say he had a temper on him if the winds blowing in the right direction do you know where he was yesterday morning no he was answering some questions at a police station in perth about the girl who went missing what makes you say that andrews gave a snort youre not exactly in downtown chicago she counts as big news words out that the police were up at the construction site did you know that mr robertson has a criminal record he told me hed been in jail did he say why rammy outside a nightclub tommy steps in and ends up being the one you lot lift she had filled one tray and was starting on another it was attempted rape rebus told her she froze for a moment victim was pretty traumatised clarke added and that makes him a suspect she had gone back to the task but with slightly less enthusiasm hes always been okay with you clarke enquired nice as ninepence she thought for a second did you tell him you were going to put me in the picture does it matter might explain why he lost his bottle got as far as the car park but couldnt bring himself to face me so why abandon the car clarke asked no idea mind if i take a look at it rebus added help yourself clarke nodded at rebus to let him know he could go she would be staying questions still to be asked outside rebus got a cigarette lit and made for the rear of the building the gravel car park had space for only four vehicles a sign explaining that it was reserved for staff that wouldnt have bothered robertson as far as he was concerned he was practically family the only car there now was a beatup ford escort mostly blue in colour though one door panel and a front wing were of different shades the rear bumper was missing one tail light smashed it was a private enough spot no buildings overlooking it rebus examined the gravel surface around the car for any obvious signs of a struggle then peered in through the windows the car itself was locked the interior messy empty crisp bags and softdrink cans newspapers and petrol receipts he jotted down the details of the licence plate and did another circuit of the vehicle the tax discs time was almost up and it would take a friendly mechanic and possibly a backhander to see the escort through any mot at least two of the tyres were balder than bobby charlton on a windy day when he planted the toe of his shoe against the modified exhaust it wobbled badly back inside the pub the cleaner was taking her leave rebus held the door open for her andrews had finished one chore and started another loading clean glasses into their shelves rebus gave clarke a shrug to let her know he had nothing for her she responded with the exact same gesture he wouldnt happen to be hiding out at your place rebus asked andrews your pal here just made the selfsame accusation she turned towards them and folded her arms nothing defensive about the body language quite the opposite if her face was anything to go by ill take that as a no then rebus pointed towards the display of rolls mind if i buy one you can get them at the bakery the roast beef with horseradish he told her their staring contest lasted a good ten seconds during which time he placed some money on the bar she relented and handed him the first roll that came to hand it was ham and mustard but rebus thanked her anyway ms andrews clarke informed him was telling me she reckons hell have headed back to the northeast he has friends there he keeps in touch with any names rebus asked not that she can recall rebuss look said it all thats a big help then he bit into the roll their next stop was the road crew bill soames and stefan skiladz providing another lessthanenthusiastic welcome you planning to scare off every man ive got working here soames asked hands stuffed into jacket pockets the traffic was its usual diesel growl choking the air and ensuring they had to shout the weather was closing in the temperature dropping and fog creeping towards them across the valley way it looks to me clarke responded it was his workmates who sent him packing tommy never needed much excuse to go into the town skiladz said theres been no word from him rebus asked nothing his cars at the back of the tummel arms no surprise there he didnt go in though clarke added well he didnt come back here either sure about that soames gave rebus a hard stare you saying were lying rebus tried to make his shrug seem casual or being lied to maybe is any of his stuff missing soames left it to skiladz to answer nothing the pole said see if i was thinking of doing a runner rebus went on id want to pack a few things first maybe he wasnt thinking straight soames said you lot had just given him a grilling dredging up his past and it was all tea and sympathy when he got back here rebuss smile was thin and humourless were not covering for him look around you soames made a sweeping motion with one arm pisspoor place for a game of hide and seek did your search team find anything skiladz interrupted no clarke admitted because theres nothing to find youre wasting time and effort and i dont think the girl ever made it this far not on foot and that means youve fucked over an innocent man soames added then with a glance towards clarke pardon my french were wasting our time here clarke told rebus isnt that what stefan just said soames commented but clarke was already heading back to the car james page had been busy essons efits of the missing women had been released to a few favoured media outlets tv liked them and that evenings scottish news would carry them the public had also started suggesting locations for the photo sent from annette mckies phone some had even submitted their own photos to back up their hunches page had made space on a wall of the cid room and esson had pinned them up more were arriving all the time page led clarke and rebus into his office is he a serious suspect was pages first question im not sure clarke admitted the fact that he ran hes the type who acts without thinking a wanderer rebus added never seems to stay anywhere for long do we have any idea where he would go aberdeen or thereabouts clarke speculated worth letting grampian police know they should keep an eye out wouldnt do any harm page glanced at his watch im briefing the chief in an hour is there anything more substantial i can give him everybodys working flat out thus far without a result and the longer that situation persists if annette got a lift rebus said it would be in a vehicle heading north any of the suggestions or photos from that stretch of the a between pitlochry and inverness you mean page checked his computer screen not that i can see he concluded a nice big wall map is what we need rebus told him that and plenty of drawing pins throughout the rest of the day people phoned and emailed their thoughts and suppositions some had no firm ideas but just wanted to say the team were doing a grand job at which point theyd be thanked and gently nudged off the line with the explanation that other callers were waiting rebus had driven home and returned with his own map sticking it to the wall with blutack i see youve already highlighted the a esson commented that was fast work yes and there were pinholes too near auchterarder strathpeffer and aviemore okay esson said taking a sip of hot water before beginning to recite the list appin taynuilt salen kendal inveruglas lochgair inchnadamph slow down rebus complained i dont know where half these places are and you made that last one up ive been to inchnadamph ronnie ogilvie piped up his hand smothering the mouthpiece of his phone johns got a point though clarke said lets pinpoint them on google maps and when we know where they are we flag them up on the wall she looked around the room everyone happy with that there were nods of assent divvy the list up christine clarke told esson she saw that rebus was studying the photos submitted by the public comparing them with the one from mckies phone any of them take your fancy a couple he tapped them with his finger clarke had to agree where are they from she asked ones the a south of durness thats way up in the northwest isnt it rebus showed her on the map miles from anywhere what about the other the a little place called edderton wheres that rebus shrugged so clarke went to her computer and let it do the work two minutes later she had her answer the dornoch firth she said not more than a couple of miles off the a just north of tain where they make glenmorangie rebus asked youd know better than me rebus traced the a north from inverness it cut across the black isle and skirted the cromarty firth heading inland again until it reached the dornoch firth hugging the coast from there until wick tain was marked and so was the a not many major roads up that way and thousands upon thousands of inland acres of wilderness weve got plenty more contenders clarke cautioned as ogilvies telephone rang again so lets just keep at it by the end of the day they felt numb ogilvie said he was willing to stay another hour by himself manning the phone clarke shook her head we all need a break ive asked one of the uniforms to take over until nine after that the switchboard will make a note of numbers and say well call them back in the morning good work though everybody i mean it these would normally have been pages words but he was at fettes hq attending yet another briefing clarke rubbed tension from her forehead as she walked over to the wall map rebus was standing in front of it looking thoughtful therell be more to do tomorrow he advised with a bit of luck the efits of the three women you really think well get sightings it would be nice to think so he turned towards her so what do you make of it she studied the map how many votes does that make for edderton four and counting must be just about the whole population rebus managed a smile three for lochgair but its way over on the west here he tapped the map next to loch fyne and a couple for durness clarke added the map was studded with drawing pins and a further cluster had been added to the wall beneath the maps bottom edge offerings from england clarke surmised and wales and northern ireland she puffed out her cheeks and expelled a blast of air isnt this the sort of thing profilers are supposed to be good at dont start im just saying she gave a weary smile then studying the map again youre still thinking the a or just off it so thats what six suggested locations six and counting she nodded slowly glancing behind her to ensure no one else in the team was close enough to hear all the same she lowered her voice what if it doesnt mean anything we narrow it down maybe even convince ourselves weve got the right spot what if it tells us nothing then we try something else what though have a bit of faith siobhan if you can say at the end that you put in the hours and tried your damnedest im sure the family will send us a nice thank you card they might and they might not rebus placed a hand on her shoulder whatever you do tonight make sure its a long way from this she nodded her agreement same goes for you she told him absolutely he said i might even have a nice wee drive out into the country a couple of city pubs first though there was a different face on the door at the gimlet he was on his phone and didnt seem to sense any threat in rebus the pub itself was busy same barmaid as on his previous visit he gave her a wink of recognition but didnt stay for a drink his second watering hole of choice was even less gentrified the tytler sat in the middle of a housing scheme in the north of the city half of which was due to be torn down the tytlers clients looked similarly ready to have a demolition notice slapped on them again rebus chose not to linger a quick word with the monosyllabic barman and he was off again a longer drive this time heading west out of the city into the badlands of west lothian broxburn bathgate blackburn and whitburn tribal towns exmining communities jojo binkies was the name above the door of a converted art deco cinema on a main street predominated by closed businesses and for sale signs three hulking doormen gave him their best stare they all bore armbands on their coats identifying them as security and earpieces with a thin cord which disappeared into the space between neck and collar all right pal one of them asked rebus plenty of scar tissue on the mans face and a nose that had been broken at least once fine rebus said making to pass him but a hand stopped him meeting someone the doorman enquired maybe see its couples night so unless its a threesome youre after old folks home is down the road one of the other bouncers added they might do a bit of dancing there rebus broke into a smile mind if i steal that one for my book what book would that be im calling it fuds say the funniest things the young man moved closer fud am i maybe we should go round the back and find out the third bouncer who looked the most experienced had kept his counsel thus far but now he patted his young colleague on the back easy there marcus our friends a police officer rebus stared marcus down hes right you know and the reason ive got to the age i have is that i never start a fight i cant win little tip for you there wee man rebus turned his attention to the leader of the group who is it you want to see the man asked shaven head neat moustachebeard combo peppered with grey he too was a survivor mr hammell rebus told him he knows youre coming not exactly might not want to see you then maybe if you tell him its about annette the doorman chewed this over at the same time working the gum in his mouth does mr hammell know you rebus nodded okay then follow me inside the foyer lay an acre of red carpet there were tiny twinkling lights set into the ceiling and the old box office was where you still paid your entrance money behind two sets of swing doors rebus could hear pounding dance music and a few drunken female whoops the doorman had stopped long enough at a narrow stairwell in one corner to unhook a red rope the sign next to it said staff only they climbed to the balcony area the walls throbbing from the sound system that marcus needs a bouncer of his own rebus commented its turning into a young mans game same as everything else emerging at the top of the stairs rebus saw that some of the old cinema seating remained rows of plush velour awaiting an audience that would never come a mirror ball was working hard at entertaining the dancers below red and blue lights pulsed the doorman led rebus past the back row of seats to an office where he knocked and entered without waiting to be asked stranding rebus on the doors other side half a minute later he was back leaving the door open this time and signalling for rebus to go in thanks rebus said i mean it the doorman nodded aware that he was now owed a favour something he could tuck away in his back pocket for the future the office surprised rebus by being large bright and modern pale wooden furniture ochrecoloured leather sofa there were framed publicity shots for old films on the walls including many rebus had seen in his youth found them when we bought the place frank hammell explained hundreds of them left to rot in the roof space i think they were supposed to be insulation he had come from behind his desk to shake rebuss hand he held on to it and asked if there was news not much rebus conceded mind if we sit hammell took one end of the sofa and rebus the other tonight hammell was wearing stonewashed denims with brown brogues a silvertipped belt strained in combat with the gut it encircled white shortsleeved shirt open at the neck he ran a meaty hand through his hair robs a gent he told rebus nodding towards the door certainly seems to have a bit more grey matter than doorman donny at the gimlet brains and brawn dont always mix its getting harder to find good guys hammell gave a dismissive wave of the hand anyway i leave the hiring and firing to darryl so what brings you here rebus i was hoping you could tell me where thomas robertson is mind if i ask you a question first go ahead who the hell is thomas robertson rebus tried staring him out but hammell seemed to have played the game before hes someone we were questioning he eventually decided to explain okay and now hes gone missing you think hes the one who took annette no but im pretty sure you think he did hammell stretched out both arms palms upwards never heard of him till you walked in he protested he was part of a road crew working north of pitlochry drove into town and thats the last anyone saw of him so hes a fugitive hes not been charged with anything how come he ended up on your radar then he has a bit of previous abduction rebus shook his head assault and now youve questioned him and let him go we searched his sleeping quarters didnt find anything linking him to annette hammell was thoughtful how exactly am i supposed to have known about him there was some gossip on the internet only net that interests me is the away teams at tynecastle he paused i saw on the news photos of those other women and the picture annette sent is there anything i can tell gail just something to chase the gloom weve had plenty of suggestions tomorrow or the day after well be checking the shortlist personally no sightings of annette though her pictures been everywhere rebus didnt say anything to this hammell got up and walked behind his desk opening a drawer and bringing out a bottle of vodka want one when rebus shook his head hammell lifted a single glass from the drawer and poured an inch into it hows annettes mother doing rebus asked how do you think there was no knock at the door it just opened and a young man rebus recognised as darryl christie was standing there he saw that hammell had a visitor and began to mutter an apology the two of you should meet hammell said gesturing for the young man to come in rebus reckoned christie merited standing up for we spoke on the phone he explained extending his hand im john rebus is it to do with annette just a progress report hammell reassured him nothing to worry about christies phone buzzed and he checked the message on the screen he was a handsome enough lad and his tailored suit looked brand new a suit was an interesting choice it belonged to the world of grownups of serious business hammell dressed sloppily because he could afford to no one was going to misjudge him whatever he chose to wear darryl had to work that bit harder in denims there was always the chance he would be mistaken for a nobody whats this i hear about photographs christie asked your sister sent one rebus explained or at least one was sent from her phone same thing with a missing person from a few years back right now thats about as much as we have plus a suspect whos gone awol hammell interrupted weve not got him locked in the cellar have we darryl not last time i looked christies phone buzzed again alerting him to a new message always the fucking texts hammell complained take him to a show or the best restaurants he hardly looks up from that bloody phone its how business gets done christie muttered his fingertips busy on the touchscreen hammell wrinkled his nose and caught rebuss eye people like you and me we prefer things face to face that was all you had in the old days tonight you could have phoned me but you came in person he nodded his approval sure you wont take that drink im fine rebus said you could offer me one darryl christie commented but then id have to pour you into a cab at the end of the night christie ignored this he waved his phone in his employers direction i have to deal with this he said turning and exiting the room not even a word of goodbye eh hammell shook his head in mock despair hes a good kid though how long have you known his mother didnt you ask me that already i dont recall you answering maybe because its still none of your business line of work im in every little detail counts you knew darryls dad derek was a mate hammell offered a shrug any truth in the rumour you ran him out of town is this coming from your mouth or your pal caffertys ive told you hes not my pal hammell poured himself another generous shot of vodka rebus could smell it wasnt the worst aroma in the world caffertys finished anyway game over hammell tipped the glass and drained it can you tell me what annettes like rebus asked or is that none of my business either annettes a proper little madam always needs to get her own way i was thinking that rebus said nodding his agreement her bussing it to inverness one of my guys would have driven her hammell growled you suggested as much but she had to do it her way and see where that got her hammell made an exasperated sound and started refilling the glass again you blame her if shed just listened to reason none of this would be happening he paused stared down into his glass swirling its contents look you know me right you know who i am it annoys me that i cant do anything to help you put up the reward and all thats done is flushed out every nut job and greedy bastard in a fourhundredmile radius i doubt you could be doing anything were not it only gets problematic if you decide to go your own way ill say it one more time i dont know anything about this guy robertson but if you need a hand getting him back hammell fixed rebus with a look i dont think thats necessary or wise hammell gave a shrug the offers there and how about that bonus bankers cant be the only ones eh he had reached into one of the pockets in his jeans and produced a fat wad of what looked like fiftypound notes no rebus said aye hammell stated reckoning he knew the truth of it cafferty already pays you a big enough retainer rebus decided it was time to go but hammell had other ideas id been told youre like him and its true you could almost be brothers now im feeling insulted hammell smiled dont be its just that one like cafferty has always seemed too many he stared into his drink before lifting it to his lips shame you didnt leave well alone in that hospital when you had the chance it was two am when darryl christie got back to the house in lochend his mother had dozed off in front of one of the tv shopping channels he roused her and sent her to bed though shed demanded a hug first the hug had been forthcoming in exchange for a promise to take things easy with the booze and the pills joseph and cal had tidied the kitchen and washed up after dinner darryl checked the fridge plenty of ready meals and milk hed placed a twentypound note on the table for groceries and it was still there upstairs his brothers were in their bunk beds but the small tv was warm to the touch and there were video games strewn across the floor some of them looked like they belonged to annette joseph had asked permission to borrow one or two and darryl had agreed i hope you two are asleep he warned them though they werent about to open their eyes and give up the pretence closing the door he slipped into his sisters room and switched on the light the walls had been painted black but then decorated with posters and stickers there were little stars and planets on the ceiling that glowed in the dark those had been a christmas present from darryl he sat for a moment on her single bed he could smell her perfume reckoned it was coming from the pillow he lifted it and sniffed there was no real sense of absence at any moment she could come bounding in demanding to know what he was doing there theyd been competitive when younger landed a few slaps kicks and bites but not recently having come to inhabit different worlds just come home you silly bitch darryl said quietly rising to his feet and heading back downstairs he lay down fully dressed on his narrow bed leaving the lights off in the conservatory so he didnt need to close the blinds then he tapped a name into his phone and waited until his father picked up its me he said any news nothing its been two weeks i know hows your mum not great i cant come back darryl why not hammell wouldnt dare touch you this is my life now darryl christie stared at his faint reflection in the glass panels overhead light pollution again no stars visible we miss you he told his father you miss me derek corrected him is frank still treating you right yes and cal and joe theyre okay there was silence for a moment is frank there tonight not since annette went missing his choice or your mums im not sure they spoke for a few more minutes until derek christie reminded his son how much the call was costing i keep telling you darryl said its franks tab even so and that was that goodbyes and talk of the trip to australia darryl would someday make afterwards he swung his feet on to the floor and sat on the edge of the bed he had been lying to his father he did have a phone paid for by frank hammell but this wasnt it this belonged to darryl which was why he used it to send a text message to cafferty he reckoned the old boy would be sound asleep maybe it would wake him and maybe it wouldnt he punched it in anyway and hit send your pal rebus has taken a shine to hammell he was at jojos tonight proper spelling and punctuation only the best for mr cafferty darryl switched to his other phone to send one final text afterwards he might manage a few hours sleep a few hours seemed to be all he ever needed by six or six thirty hed be on his laptop at the start of a new working day he checked the wording of the message and made sure it was going to the right number then pressed send and lay back on his bed again eyes open he reached for the remote and used it to close the blinds around and above him the system had cost a fortune more than three times what hed told his mother even after frank hammell had negotiated a hefty discount darryl started to unbutton his shirt judging by the illuminated screen a message had arrived already on one of his phones part three and looking from a low ridge to loch waters in the west where darkened hills are dreaming it was as rebus had explained to james page a nobrainer youve got the engine here running beautifully me im by way of a spare light bulb in the glove box im the part you can afford to be without and page had agreed despite clarkes protestations which was why rebus had filled his saab with petrol and hit the road north again perth with its roundabouts then pitlochry and the roadworks and on to house of bruar where he stopped for lunch his parking bay was right outside the menswear shop and he glanced at the window display deciding that he was still not ready for strawberrycoloured cords a sign at the drumochter summit informed him he was feet above sea level the mountains either side of him looked forbidding yet hillwalkers had set out for the day their cars parked in laybys or else were returning to their vehicles cheeks ruddy breath visible in the air at aviemore he signalled right deciding on a detour through the town there wasnt much to it but it was bustling loch garten was signposted he recalled taking his daughter there thirty years before the rspb had built a hide complete with telescopes and binoculars but there had been no sign of the famous ospreys just an empty nest how old would sammy have been five or six a family driving holiday these days he had to call her samantha on those rare occasions when he called her at all she preferred sending her father texts rather than actually engaging in a conversation rebus couldnt blame her not when the conversations his fault almost always ended up in another petty disagreement he had told nina hazlitt that he couldnt know what shed been going through but more than once he had almost lost sammy he had to wait at the tjunction before he could rejoin the a losing count of the number of lorries and vans he was now going to be tailing some of which he was sure he had overtaken on a stretch of dual carriageway many miles back he had to remind himself that he was in no rush he had plenty of cds with him and a box of chewing gum purchased at the petrol station a spare packet of cigarettes and a halflitre bottle of irn bru when he passed a turnoff to the tomatin distillery he gave it a little salute having done the same for dalwhinnie fifty miles or so back despite inverness being only ten miles away now and the road mostly dualled it seemed to take an age to reach its outskirts culloden battlefield was nearby another site theyd visited on that holiday it had been a bleak place with a small visitors centre in a building no bigger than a bothy sammy had kept saying how bored and cold she was the four pm news was on the car radio as rebus entered inverness traffic here was more congested still and he made no friends by getting himself into the wrong lane then trying to get out of it again so he wasnt forced into the city centre he crossed the kessock bridge on to the black isle then another bridge across the cromarty firth where he had to salute another distillery glen ord he knew this route from the foldout map but had bought another map before leaving edinburgh there seemed to be four huge construction platforms in the water to the right rain was falling and the windscreen wipers provided a hypnotic rhythm it took a moment for him to realise what the sound reminded him of waking up to the stylus still plying its course around an albums runout groove alness was fourteen miles south of tain and boasted dalmore distillery while tain itself had glenmorangie at the next roundabout he left the a for the a signposted towards bonar bridge ardgay and edderton he had a phone number for a local farmer and punched it into his mobile five or ten minutes he told the man ending the call and five or ten minutes was all it took the farmers name was jim mellon and he was waiting with his venerable land rover he signalled for rebus to park by the side of the road well take mine he called out having decided that the saab might not be up to the task rebus got out and locked the car the farmer smiling at what he probably saw as a townie precaution he was younger than rebus had expected cleanshaven fairhaired and handsome i appreciate you doing this rebus said and thanks for taking the trouble to get in touch in the first place you said on the phone i wasnt alone rebus nodded his agreement a few others are of the same mind as you well lets see what you think mellon gestured towards the land rover not allergic to dogs are you in the back of the vehicle sat a collie rebus guessed a sheep dog intelligent eyes and not about to demean itself by looking for a pat from a stranger the engine started with a roar and they headed up the narrow muddy road past a sign warning them that if its lights were flashing the snow gates ahead were closed how often do vehicles use this route rebus asked a few times a day mellon speculated not much up here its signposted to aultnamain not much there either but were not headed that far he was turning on to a singletrack road punctuated by passing places it was tarmacked but with grass sprouting through cracks in the surface only a minute or two later he brought them to a juddering stop and pulled on the handbrake id say this is it rebus opened his door and got out he produced a copy of the photo from his pocket the sky was darker now but not too dark mellon was pointing out the direction to him rebus gazed then held up the photo his eyes moving between the image and the real thing could have been taken at any time mind mellon cautioned rebus knew what the man meant there was probably little in this landscape that had changed in a hundred years or more the thing is rebus said this time of day she couldnt have been much further north than pitlochry by the time she got here it would have been pitch black then the photo cant have been taken here can it but rebus wasnt so sure he got out his own phone and snapped the view it wasnt professional quality but he started sending it to clarke anyway his phone however had other plans no signal rebus commented its usually pretty good you just have to find the right spot so even if the photo was taken here she might have had trouble sending it the farmer nodded his understanding do you have other locations that could fit the bill one or two any of them near where she was last seen theyre not as good a match as this rebus was looking around some would call it a peaceful spot others a lonely one the wind was whistling around them rebus didnt quite know what he was looking for other than a sense of the why and the who why here and who had chosen it i dont suppose youve seen anything suspicious he asked mellon any strangers stopping for longer than usual the farmer plunged his hands into the pockets of his barbour nothing like that and ive asked around everybody says the same tyre tracks where there shouldnt be any the farmer shook his head and at the top of the road left at the junction brings you back to alness eventually and if you turn right you join the road to bonar bridge what are the chances of a stranger finding this road mr mellon the man shrugged its on the maps i dare say satnav has it too rebus was taking a couple more photos but it was getting too dark for them to be of any use he just felt he should be doing something youve come a long way the farmer said theres tea at the house if you want it thanks but ive got a few miles ahead of me and have you seen enough rebus surveyed the horizon as much of it as he could make out i think so you reckon the poor lassies out here somewhere i dont know rebus admitted back at the land rover the dog gave him what could have been taken for a sympathetic look for some reason mostly because he had failed to make any other decision he was back on the a but heading further north soon though he turned off into dornoch passing what he assumed must be its cathedral though no bigger than a village kirk and stopping in the neardeserted square a hotel and a shop seemed to be open but the streets were empty he found he could get a signal and got out of the car to walk up and down a bit while he made the call well siobhan clarke asked im pretty sure but not absolutely certain no so what now ive taken a few photos on my phone so you can see what i mean are you heading back not quite yet ive stopped in dornoch at this rate youll not be home till midnight rebus thought of the overnight bag on the saabs back seat thing is siobhan theres no way she could have sent that picture on her phone not from edderton not at the time she did okay so how else could it have been sent all i can come up with is its not an actual photo as such what is it then a photo of a photo might explain why it looks slightly blurry and sent why to throw us off the scent because wed then spend days scouring the countryside around pitlochry looking for it reckoning it for the crime scene clarke was silent for a moment we could check that she said just need someone who knows about photography agreed so it doesnt really get us anywhere it tells us were dealing with someone who puts a bit of thought in and whoever they are looks like they have this calling card thats two things we didnt know before id probably trade them for a name and address though you and me both he had crossed the road and was standing beneath a signpost to the beach was one option isnt dornoch where madonna got married to that film director clarke was asking ill ask next time i see her meantime any news your end still no sign of thomas robertson but other locations for the photo are coming in any good ones nothing we havent heard before durness got another vote though does that put it level with edderton just tucked in behind oh one other thing you remember alasdair blunt the charmer who reckons zoe beddows ruined his marriage we showed him the photo from annettes phone and he said he couldnt be sure ill tell you who might have a better memory of it his exwife her names judith inglis youre earning your sweeties today siobhan what was her opinion a pretty good match she reckons i mean its far from definitive rebus grunted a response and she changed the subject asking him if hed seen any dolphins there are supposed to be some up that way bit dark now he replied have you clocked off for the day more or less lucky you i seem to remember the road trip was your choice it was and you wanted to do it alone what are you getting at just wondering if you maybe had another navigator in mind nina hazlitt you mean did i say that nice to be held in such low esteem you really are on your own there rebus looked up and down the empty street i really am he said she mentioned you by name in one of the interviews she gave surprised your ears werent burning what did she say apparently youre one of the very few persons in authority to take her seriously im a person in authority dont believe everything you hear besides itll probably count against you with james because hes not the one getting the plaudits were all working hard john nobody likes it when one figure gets picked out understood he ended the call with a promise to send her his photos from edderton he did so while he still had a signal noting that his phones battery was getting low back at the car he started the ignition and headed down a narrow lane which widened as it passed a caravan site and a coastguard station the wind off the firth buffeted the saab the track ahead covered in a shifting swirling layer of sand he found himself in an empty car park a steep grassy slope behind him there were steps down to the beach and the moon revealed the tide line from what little he could see the beach stretched for hundreds of yards rocky outcrops jutted from the sand the waves had that insistent pulse to them never quite the same twice he felt utterly alone in the world no traffic sounds no other humans nothing but clouds visible in the sky overhead only his car to remind him what century this was that and his phone which rang obligingly it was nina hazlitt hello he said answering receptions terrible its the wind i think im heading back to the car are you on top of a mountain or something at the coast actually he climbed the steps opened the driversside door and got in is that better he asked weather sounds foul up there were used to it what can i do for you nina nothing really i just wanted a chat ill warn you ive not much battery left she paused as if seeking the right gambit how are you getting on with the book she offered really interesting youre just saying that the burry man versus the green man selkies versus mermaids i remember the selkie in that film local hero wasnt she a mermaid maybe she was sounds like you are reading it though told you he peered out towards the swell of the sea dolphins not tonight and selkies shapechangers not in a million years is there any progress a bit he conceded do you have to keep it secret from me its more to do with annette mckie rebus thought for a moment did you get a chance to ask sallys friends none of them remembers anyone out of the ordinary visiting the friends reunited page it was always a long shot long shots seem to be my speciality mine too im a long way from giving up on this i hope thats true john but it might help if you didnt mention my name to the media oh doesnt go down well with the other troops i didnt realise she paused again i seem to keep letting you down dont i you werent to know the call lasted a few more minutes it seemed to him that despite the presence of her brother in her life the woman was lonely friends had probably fallen away as her range of interests had narrowed he was relieved when his phone beeped telling him the battery was about to give out any second now my phones going to die he explained to her in other words youre fobbing me off her tone had stiffened nothing like that nina but shed already hung up on him he exhaled noisily and began to reverse out of his parking spot but then stopped again and reached for the road map durness was on the a which ran along scotlands jagged northern coastline to get there all he had to do was follow the a the same road that ran through edderton how long that journey might take was another matter his phone summoned up just enough life for an incoming text from siobhan clarke dear david bailey hard to tell looks promising though x he headed back into the centre of dornoch and saw that the hotel opposite the cathedral was brightly lit and inviting there would be beer there and a good range of malt whiskies hot food too if he was lucky he had filled his wallet before setting out knowing a night away was probable so he parked the saab directly outside the hotels front door and got his bag from the back seat he was awake early and first into the breakfast room a fryup two glasses of orange juice and a couple of cups of coffee dealt with a head thickened by one whisky too many there had been a slight frost overnight and a milky sun was doing its best to penetrate thin layers of cloud the citizens of dornoch were readying for the days business or returning home with their newspapers of choice rebus dumped his overnight bag in the saab scraped the frost from the windscreen with his credit card and started the engine the a started off as a twolane road busy with local traffic but few tourists heavily laden logging lorries squeezed past rebuss car as they headed south he refilled the fuel tank at the first petrol station he saw unsure when there might be another the attendant didnt seem to know either depends which roads youre taking true enough rebus responded unable to fault the young mans logic then realising how much each litre was costing he requested a receipt back in the car he looked at the map book again the peaks all had gaelic names none of which hed heard of cnoc a ghiubhais meall an fhuarain cnoc an daimh mor there was a whisky called ancnoc so cnoc had to mean something maybe next time he would take the trouble to read the label on the bottle after the village of lairg the road narrowed to a single lane with passing places and the terrain became more desolate cloud covered the tops of peaks whose steep slopes were dusted with snow he passed conifer plantations and the remains of such plantations stumps like tombstones in a vast cemetery the sky was leaden and weathered signs warned of lambs on the road at altnaharra the hotel was open all year round he saw that a few cars had parked up walkers and climbers prepping for the rigours ahead he pulled over and sat for a few minutes with his windows down overhearing snatches of conversation and watching as they set out for the day some had ordnance survey maps strung around their necks protected from the elements by clear plastic pouches their backpacks bulged with provisions and waterproofs and most carried a long pole and sometimes two to help take the strain he waited until the last one had clambered over the stile and had their back to him before he lit a cigarette blowing smoke into the crisp unpolluted air half an hour later he was driving into the village of tongue where he would join the road west along the coast to durness but he had one detour to make there was a photograph in his jacket pocket it had been sent to him a few years back and he used it to find where he was looking for the village itself was off to the left of the road but rebus headed for the causeway across the kyle of tongue the bungalow was next door to a youth hostel there were no names next to the doorbell he pressed and waited then pressed again the view was breathtaking but the house had been battered by the elements and would be again he peered in through the living room window then walked around to the back no fence separated the property from the field behind it the kitchen showed signs that someone had been home earlier cereal packet next to the table milk waiting to be returned to the fridge rebus went back to the saab and sat there wondering what to do now he could hear seabirds and gusts of wind but nothing else he tore a page from his notebook and jotted a message returning to the front door to push it through the letter box he drove off again in silence not in the mood for a cd or whatever radio reception could be mustered soon he was entering something calling itself northwest highland geopark the landscape grew more alien almost lunar rocks barely covered by any form of vegetation but now and then there would be a spectacular cove with pristine white sand and blue sea rebus began to wonder if hed ever been further from a pub in his life he checked petrol gauge and cigarette packet both durness was still some miles off and he had no idea what he would find there he skirted loch eriboll and headed north again durness wasnt quite at the tip of scotland if you reckoned your vehicle up to the task you could follow a track all the way to cape wrath rebus had a phone number for one of the locals but no signal as yet durness itself when he reached it consisted of a few cottages and larger modern houses plus a smattering of shops there were even a couple of venerable petrol pumps he stopped next to them and crossed the road to the spar where he asked the shopkeeper if she knew where anthony greenwood lived he went to smoo this morning she told him im not sure if hes back rebus then showed her the photo youre the police she surmised from edinburgh anthony told us all about it the spot youre looking for is just by keoldale two minutes later armed with a fresh pack of cigarettes he was back in the saab and driving a further couple of miles following her precise almost too precise instructions but as he neared the site he knew it was wrong not all wrong just wrong enough gusts snapped at him as he gazed down towards the kyle of durness then up the slope towards the bare hillside beyond a row of embattled trees some of which looked permanently stooped no he said the hillside was too steep but then hed known that all along and even more so since edderton he drove slowly up and down the road just in case he was missing something but the shopkeeper in durness had sent him to the right place it just wasnt the right place he consulted his map again he could go back the way hed come or keep going the road made a circuit of sorts before joining the a again rebus had never been one to retrace his steps so headed southwest towards laxford bridge the route was still narrow dotted with passing places but there was no traffic rebus reckoned hed come a hundred miles or more since leaving dornoch and not once had he been stuck behind a vehicle of any kind there was sporadic tourist traffic along with a few delivery vans but everyone was very polite flashing their headlights to let him know they had pulled over and he didnt need to or acknowledging him with a wave whenever the roles were reversed having crossed to the west coast he found himself heading inland again south and east past miles and miles of nothing but scenery and sheep twice he had to stop for ewes on the road and once he caught sight of a large bird of prey gliding over one of the distant summits there were patches of snow up there and a huge greasy sky he passed lochs with wildfowl resting on the glassy surface and his tyres pressed ancient roadkill further into the tarmac he had just reached a narrow doglegshaped loch when his phone sounded he had one missed call he pulled over and returned it the signal was fine dad it was samanthas voice where are you i got back and saw your note rebus had got out of the car the air was clear and sharp as he inhaled would you believe i was just passing no she was stifling a laugh happens to be the truth there was something i had to check in durness how did you find the right house that picture you sent he held it up samantha was standing in front of her bungalow arm around the waist of the tall young man next to her so where are you now she asked nowhere quite literally he looked around him saw the hillside reflected in the still surface of the loch if i remembered any of my geography classes i might be able to describe it too far south to turn around id say so i think im about sixty miles from tongue thats a shame next time eh he said rubbing at his forehead with the meat of his thumb or maybe if youre ever in edinburgh how are things anyway its a beautiful location you looked in the windows didnt you place is a right tip no worse than mine hows keith doing hes okay got some work on the decommissioning project at dounreay do you check him for radioactivity i dont need a bedside light any more she joked then you should have told me you were coming it was more of an impulse thing he lied sorry ive not phoned for a while youre kept busy i saw that woman mention you on the news meaning nina hazlitt is that why you were in durness sort of so that means you might be back i dont think so but everythings all right with you and keith we were trying ivf oh aye at the raigmore hospital first one didnt take sorry to hear that were not giving up not yet good for you he closed his eyes and opened them again the scenery took its time coming back into focus i wish id been here i was only out seeing a friend her babys nine months at least i know where you are now when were on the phone like this in future i can picture the view from your window its a nice view it really is rebus cleared his throat id better get going this is supposed to be me working take care dad you too samantha im touched you came to visit really i am he ended the call and stood there staring ahead of him without taking any of it in why hadnt he told her hed be dropping by did he want to see the look on her face so he could judge whether she was pleased or not probably but then there was the other possibility that hed not wanted her to be home that way they couldnt end up falling out he had made the effort without any of the possible repercussions ever since durness had been mentioned hed thought about samantha seeing an excuse to visit her without it looking as though he had gone out of his way just passing youre a basket case john he told himself as he headed back to the idling car and who wants a basket case as a grandad ivf shed not mentioned it before never really talked about kids he wondered what the problem was shed been hit by a car a decade or so back could that have caused complications or maybe it was keith and his job theyd already had a shot at ivf without telling him wanting to surprise him maybe or did he just not figure in their lives to that extent at bonar bridge instead of taking a right and passing through edderton again he headed along the northern side of the dornoch firth picking up the a at clashmore hello again he told the road he was driving south now through tain and inverness and aviemore and pitlochry no room in his stomach for a late lunch but he refilled the saabs tank at a petrol station and bought a paper and a bottle of water there was a veritable convoy on the opposite carriageway led by a transporter with earthmoving equipment on its trailer the traffic on rebuss side of the road was moving more freely for which he was grateful just south of aviemore he pulled into a layby behind an articulated lorry and a delivery van getting out for a stretch and a rolling of the shoulders busy as the route was he got the feeling he could walk a few dozen yards into the hills and be stepping where no feet had ever passed the wilderness remained wilderness precisely because nobody bothered to stop he turned at the sound of the vans door opening the driver jumping down any chance of sparking me up the man said waving a cigarette rebus obliged the dashboard lighters buggered the man explained nodding his gratitude before inhaling greedily what about the hgv rebus asked drivers dead to the world curtains shut and everything we could be in the back emptying the container and hed still be snoring rebus managed a smile sounds like youve given it some thought not really dutch number plate meaning youre more likely to get a few buckets of flowers than a flatscreen television you really have thought about it the man laughed and took another drag on his cigarette how do you know hes all right rebus asked meaning the lorry driver if he drives those things every day hes far from all right the man tapped a finger to his temple then asked rebus if he was in sales just had to go up north rebus answered keeping it vague inverness further wick northwest towards cape wrath i didnt think there was anything up that way youre well informed rebus paused as an artic rattled by followed by a stream of cars there was a change in air pressure as if some force were trying to suck him on to the carriageway its worse on motorways the van driver said try taking a piss on the m hard shoulder duly noted you use this road a lot like clockwork invernessperthdundeeaberdeen i could drive it blind maybe not when im in the vicinity eh worried id dunt your saab rebus shook his head worried id have to arrest you edinburgh again long tailbacks into the city a fortymileperhour limit enforced by average speed cameras bloody roadworks and then as he entered the city itself signs warning him about the tram project with its diversions and road closures his back was on fire too much time at the wheel and hardly the most relaxing of drives at gayfield square he stuck the police sign on the dashboard before getting out patting the saabs roof in thanks for not breaking down on him then he headed inside expecting his nemesis to be waiting instead there was a new face behind the plexiglas and she accepted rebuss id at face value buzzing him through he climbed the stairs and entered the cid office everyone was clustered around christine essons computer what have i missed page looked up briefly welcome back he said gesturing for rebus to come and look its the cctv from the bus station siobhan clarke explained it had been looked at before but only to make sure annette really did board the inverness coach christine had the idea of winding it back a bit esson was using her mouse pad to move the action forwards and backwards a few frames at a time annette skipped towards the bus queue then seemed to retreat until she left the frame altogether there was a cut to another camera showing her from further away different angle but obviously shot at the same time back back back towards the glass doors of the bus station the door opening as she got closer to it closing as she went through it her hand pressed to the metal handle she was on the pavement now their view of her opaque glass in the way can we zoom in rebus asked not necessary page said watch what happens a figure was approaching her speaking to her rebus sucked air through his teeth it was recognisably frank hammell his hand was grasping her arm and then the pair of them moved out of shot again esson paused the recording then played it forward in real time hammell and annette walked into shot his hand grabbing her as if reluctant to let her go she shrugged him off and pushed open the door striding purposefully across the concourse cut to the other camera was that relief on her face she was up on her toes a bag slung over one shoulder joining the short queue to board the singledecker coach glancing back just once to see if hammell was there the one and only james page said straightening up he rested his palm on essons shoulder good work christine then he clapped his hands just once keeping them pressed together so now we bring mr hammell that good friend to the mckie family in for a little chat he never mentioned being at the bus station rebus guessed clarke answered with a shake of the head and weve just managed to get an itemised list from annettes mobile network she sent a dozen texts from the bus ten to her pal timmy the other two to a phone belonging to frank hammell only time her phone was used after that was for the photo to thomas redfern incoming calls we dont have those be interesting to know if hammell texted her back well ask him page responded crisply this is a man with a criminal record isnt that right john hes a criminal all right but as yet weve never nailed anything on him well hes lied to this inquiry and thats quite enough to be going on with obstruction at the very least ronnie ogilvie agreed page nodded slowly back to your desks then everyone siobhan get on the phone to mr hammell and request his company page caught rebuss eye gesturing towards his office rebus followed him not bothering to close the door hed had enough of close confines for one day how did it go page was asking im convinced the photo was taken at a place called edderton siobhan seems to agree but she also said something about it being some sort of hoax not exactly but i think the abductors playing a game with us page took a moment to digest this and hammell he asked needs to be interviewed he could have followed her to pitlochry he could rebus admitted page remained thoughtful how was the rest of your trip largely uneventful rebus handed over the petrol receipt expenses he explained page studied it dated today thats right i thought you went yesterday the trip took longer than expected you were away overnight a hotel rebus said receipt page held out a hand but rebus shook his head on the house as it were he turned to go but page hadnt quite finished with him nina hazlitt picked you out for praise im sorry about that as long as it doesnt go to your head quite the opposite james i assure you back in the body of the kirk it struck rebus once again that he had nowhere to sit not when the team was accounted for there was a metalframed chair that had come from the interview room but no desk to go with it rebus placed it next to clarke and checked that the legs were not going to collapse beneath him somewhere to put the boxes he hinted prodding one of them with his finger all in good time otherwise ive busted a gut lugging them here for nothing she stared at him poor you then turning back to her computer how was the rest of the trip i took a look at durness thought as much explains why youre only just getting back its not a contender on her screen she had found a contact number for frank hammell she pressed her phone to her ear and waited mr hammell she said di clarke here do you think we could have a word at the station she tapped the nib of her pen against a notebook next to her keyboard today if at all possible she listened to his response then asked when he would be back well if thats the best you can do sir noon tomorrow well see you then she ended the call and looked at rebus again he says hes in aberdeen on business rebus pursed his lips thomas robertson business clarke shrugged rebus was studying the map on the wall more pins had been added new locations suggested the biggest cluster was still around edderton christine esson was approaching have you told him she asked clarke told him what the sightings oh clarke opened her mouth to speak but page called out from his doorway gesturing for her to join him in his office you better do it she said to esson rising from her chair and squeezing past rebus im all ears rebus offered you know we put out the efits of the missing women esson obliged yes weve had some sightings okay and interestingly most are of sally hazlitt why is that interesting because shes been missing the longest means the efit is less likely to be accurate easier to age a photo a couple of years than a dozen rebus nodded his acceptance of this so where did all these sightings take place she went back to her desk returning with a pad of paper covered in her writing brigid young was spotted last year working in a bar in dublin she now has an australian accent by the way are you okay if we discount that one esson smiled i think we can scratch most of them but not all she looked at her notes again zoe beddows has been seen in brighton bristol dumfries and lerwick all within the past three months she gets about a bit and as for sally hazlitt she did some addition her mouth forming the numbers eleven sightings in total everywhere from dover to dundee theres something youre not telling me two people claim to have seen her in inverness working in a hotel same hotel both times esson nodded the two callers dont know one another and they stayed there on different weeks one was in september the other october its got to be coincidence right i mean inverness being on the a whats the hotel called whichers its part of a chain i dont know much more than that was she a chambermaid receptionist esson paused im sure its nothing rebus nodded slowly and this is the only example where two people have come forward with the exact same information so far yes well i suppose its worth checking not a priority though what do you think i think theyre long dead and annette mckie theres still a chance albeit a slim one which is why the focus needs to be on her rebus said that was good work by the way the bus station cctv shows what happens when youre thorough her head dropped just a fraction to be honest i feel a bit bad about it why because it wasnt picked up straight away she glanced in the direction of pages closed door it was siobhan who looked at the footage originally rebus guessed esson gave the slightest of nods you reckon shes in there getting a spanking rebus watched as the colour rose to the young womans cheeks i still think you deserve a prize what do you say to a nice big mug of hot water the oxford bar was midevening quiet rebus was seated in the back room with an ipa and the evening news when siobhan clarke arrived she asked him if he wanted a refill have i ever been known to refuse she retreated and returned a couple of minutes later with a fresh pint and a glass full of something greentinged and fizzy lemonade and lime he guessed gin lime and soda she corrected him raising the glass and taking a gulp exhaling noisily afterwards sign of a tough day he commented we cant all go swanning off around the highlands did page have a go at you about what not spotting hammell at the bus station she looked at him christine told you she surmised rebus gave a shrug and waited for her to answer i think he was more annoyed that he cant get his teeth into frank hammell until tomorrow am i invited to that interview no just you and physical graffiti thatll be cosy dont start he held up his hands in a show of surrender they sat in silence for a minute or two eventually she asked if there was anything in the paper not much christine told you about the efits he nodded they got me thinking she went on maybe the accountant had money worries and the hairdresser mightve decided shed had enough of married men and sally hazlitt clarke shrugged lots of people go missing john for all sorts of reasons look at annette mckie bit of a wild child she has a fallingout with her mums boyfriend and decides to hide out for a while maybe to punish him or put her mum through the wringer and the photo might have nothing to do with anything meaning im seeing things your job is tying up loose ends maybe these are just random threads he concentrated on finishing his first pint so he could get started on the second its something we have to consider john i know that he wiped a line of foam from his top lip so is this you politely telling me my services are no longer required its not up to me page then are you running his errands to get back in his good books she glared at him james doesnt think youve got anything meantime hes got thomas robertson and frank hammell to be getting on with why would hammell abduct his lovers daughter well have to ask him rebus shook his head slowly then asked her if she wanted another she checked the time on her mobile phone i need to be heading off she said are you planning on hanging around where else am i going to go home maybe i was thinking of inviting you to dinner not tonight she paused another time though for definite christine essons worried about you he stated as clarke began to get to her feet worried that youll blame her for getting called to the headmasters office it wasnt her doing maybe you could tell her that when you see her tomorrow sure she slung her bag over her shoulder how long do you reckon ive got before page sends me packing i dont know a day maybe two i really dont know john ill see you in the morning lets hope so rebus raised his glass toasting her as she turned her back on him and made for the exit he was on his own again the other tables wiped clean and awaiting customers he finished the paper while sounds of laughter came from the bar area the usual crew were in half a dozen familiar faces some of them he didnt even know what they did for a living it didnt matter in here and although some regulars were given nicknames hinting at their jobs no one had mooted this for rebus not to his face at any rate he was always just john when he looked at the table in front of him the pint siobhan had bought him was down to its dregs he lifted the empties preparing to join the throng in the front room then he paused remembering the drive to tongue and back the isolation and stillness the sense of a world unchanged and unchanging where are you nowhere quite literally but i prefer it here he told himself making for the bar just a few questions mr hammell page said the suit he was wearing seemed more tailored than ever this place smells like a wrestlers kecks hammell replied his mouth twisting in distaste its not great page agreed casting an eye around the interview rooms scarred walls but its whats available so not just psychology then page looked at him all innocent sorry thinking it might unnerve me get me to say something i shouldnt siobhan clarke looked down at the floor and pretended her tongue was dislodging something from between two teeth it was the only way to stop from smiling hammell had read pages thinking to the letter anyway many thanks for sparing the time page said just want to clear up a slight discrepancy oh hammell sat low on the chair legs splayed in front of him like a boxer at rest between rounds what were wondering clarke interjected is why you didnt tell us you were at the bus station with annette i dont remember anyone asking you didnt need to be asked mr hammell who says i was there anyway cctv page interrupted trying to wrest the interview back from clarke looks like you were having a few words with her the camera doesnt lie id told her one of my guys would drive her to inverness but she didnt want that might i ask why not because shes a stubborn little madam and she thought she might have to say thanks hammells tone betrayed his irritation didnt turn down cash for the train though next thing i know shes at the bus station cheaper than the train and she can pocket whats left were you following her clarke asked sort of why to make sure she was telling the truth way she is it was just as likely she was going to see one of her junkie pals in sighthill and crash there for a few days so you followed her to the bus station to waverley first she checked the train prices on one of the machines then didnt bother buying a ticket trailed her to st andrew square and well youve got that on camera right an argument james page said just me telling her to catch the bloody train but she dug her heels in and you didnt tell us any of this because for one thing its not relevant and for another clarke asked there was a moments flickering selfdoubt in hammells face i didnt want gail to know why not hammell shifted in his chair i wasnt sure how shed take it me snooping like that but its how i am i need to have a bit of control over a situation page considered this leaning back and folding his arms he was about to ask something but clarke got there first what can you tell us about thomas robertson look im giving it to you straight not holding back and we appreciate that mr hammell page assured him okay then hammell paused hes the one you think snatched annette is that why you were in aberdeen robertson has previous not in the abduction line he doesnt no but he probably knows a few villains up where he comes from you were finding out if one of them might have taken her why would they do that to get at me and did you make any progress nobodys talking but robertsons names out there now they know i want a word with him the room fell silent again until siobhan clarke asked a question who told you thomas robertson was of interest to us what hammells eyes narrowed its not common knowledge isnt it no clarke stated well his names out there yes but who told you his eyes met hers i dont remember he said his voice level and emotionless and for some reason siobhan clarke knew who else was it going to be after all what are you doing here rebus looked up from his toasted sandwich its a cafe he replied im having something to eat the usual the guy behind the counter called to clarke just a flat white she told him sitting down opposite rebus didnt realise you had a monopoly on this place rebus commented glancing through the window towards leith walk i dont but youre annoyed im here im annoyed at you full stop rebus put down the sandwich and wiped his fingers on the tissuethin napkin whatve i done now you went and talked to frank hammell didnt you is that what he says he didnt have to say it does page know he watched her shake her head the coffee arrived it was instant some granules floating on the surface are you going to tell him she glanced up at him this is the sort of thing that would have fox and his team dancing in the street when thomas robertson went awol my first thought was that hammell had nabbed him something you decided to keep to yourself i went to see hammell he denied it so you gave him robertsons name half the internet knew wed lifted someone for questioning it would have taken him ten minutes to find out what i told him she placed her elbows against the edge of the table and leaned in towards him youre not cid john this isnt your job any more so people keep reminding me he had prised open the remains of the toastie in order to study its contents a processed cheese slice and thin pallid ham did your own chat with hammell shed any light he says they argued because hed given her money for the train did you ask him what he was doing in aberdeen he was looking for robertson rebus stared at her he admitted it she nodded meaning he doesnt have robertson always supposing you take him at face value which you dont i suppose odd that hed just come out and tell you if anything does happen to robertson hammells just put himself forward as chief suspect clarke was thoughtful rebus lifted his beaker of tea but a cooling scum had gathered on its surface i need a drink he said you really dont i think i do otherwise im going to be tasting that ham all afternoon you coming ill stick to coffee as he started to get up she gripped his forearm if page smells it on your breath thats why pubs sell mints siobhan and with a wink and a smile he was gone she picked up the coffee and blew on it fox was right of course john rebus was the loosest of cannons and no constabulary had room for those any more hed also warned her that rebuss mere proximity might damage her chances of further promotion and hadnt everything been fine at gayfield square until rebus had barged his way in a good team a great boss and no errors of judgement not that rebus had had anything to do with her missing hammell on the cctv she alone was to blame and shed apologised again that morning to james page malcolm foxs words were sloshing around in her head call me any time you think hes floundering floundering or diving to the bottom but that was how rebus worked kicking up all the sand and sediment then studying what effect it had and what was uncovered in the process its too hot the guy behind the counter called over to her she realised she was still blowing on the coffee blowing so hard some had sloshed over the side no its fine she assured him and to prove it she took a sip in truth the liquid in the beaker was lukewarm at best but she drank it anyway it didnt help that rebus was doing a good impression of a man coughing up his lungs when page encountered him in the corridor outside the cid suite you all right john never better rebus replied wiping a hand across his eyes something stuck in my throat the butt of a cigarette maybe page made show of sniffing the air and polo mints for lunch interesting diet you have there works for me rebus pulled back his shoulders well i wanted a word with you anyway is this me getting my jotters youve done good work here john but the inquiry seems to be moving in different directions while im stuck on the hard shoulder trying to thumb a lift i wouldnt have put it quite like that but its true that im starting to think your time here may be drawing to a close in which case ive a favour to ask pages eyes narrowed slightly yes dont tell scru just yet i need a bit of time to shift those boxes rebus gestured in the vague direction of clarkes desk shouldnt take more than an hour or two page countered i can get one of the team to help you rebus was shaking his head not your best use of resources james im happy to move them myself ill be out of your hair by this time tomorrow he held out a hand which page studied for a moment before extending his own to meet it ten minutes later rebus was on leith walk again with a takeaway coffee and a box of paracetamol from the local pharmacy he swallowed two and browsed the windows of local shops one of them sold secondhand vinyl but he knew he didnt have time for a browse having convinced himself that he was fit to drive he headed to his car tucking the police official business sign under the passenger seat and turning the ignition it was approaching three pm and he was going to meet the rush hour somewhere on his route but all the same back in the saddle he told his car patting its dashboard for luck i could drive it blind he remembered the van drivers words as he headed for the m escaping the city centre provided the usual problems temporary traffic lights teams digging up the roads many a potential ratrun had been blocked off meaning little was to be gained by diverging from the main route north out of the city traffic slowed again on the approach to the forth road bridge and remained heavy until he had passed the turnoffs to dunfermline and kirkcaldy he stopped at the kinross services for fuel the woman behind the till gave a little nod of recognition maybe she had a good memory but it was more likely he had taken on the tics and rhythms of the regular traveller and she was merely acknowledging him as a member of the tribe perth with its busy roundabouts and then the end of the dual carriageway and the sense that time was working against each and every traveller on the road turbocharged bmws and audis weaved in and out of the procession driven by men in shirts and ties any one of whom could have been the man hed talked to at the petrol station in pitlochry the one with solutions to offer pitlochry itself eventually arrived bringing a welcome stretch of dual carriageway though this was also when slow lorries decided to overtake other slow lorries rebus yelling curses at them as he was forced to brake he studied the roadworks as he passed them men in highvis jackets and hard hats were still busy with their tools and machines he couldnt make out bill soames or stefan skiladz when the michael chapman cd finished he swapped it for spooky tooth and reached over to the passenger seat for a slug of water from the bottle hed bought darkening skies and no sign of any hillwalkers today no stopping at bruar on to glen truim and past newtonmore aviemore to his right where he prayed for more lorries to turn off than actually did then tomatin and another salute in the direction of its distillery evening now the sky over inverness illuminated by sodium feeder roads still busy with the remnants of the homeward rush it was only as he approached the city that he thought i could have taken the train but he liked his car too much and patted the dashboard again to convey this feeling to it ten minutes later he was in the car park at whichers hotel rolling his shoulders and clicking his spine back into place while listening to the saabs engine start to cool he paused long enough for a cigarette taking in his surroundings there was a newlooking shopping mall within walking distance plus business units some of them not yet leased this was an area of the city for sales reps rather than tourists when he eventually headed indoors to reception he noted that the carpet was tartan and there was a stags head on the wall plenty of wood panelling and piped music a man in a pinstripe suit was checking in your usual room mr frazer the receptionist was assuring him the receptionist was young early twenties maybe even late teens curly blonde hair and lashings of aquamarine eyeshadow behind her a man much the same age was busy with paperwork when rebuss time came she had the same smile as for mr frazer it faltered only when he showed her his id and the efit of sally hazlitt recognise her rebus asked looks a bit like susie the receptionist said what do you think roddy the young man turned from his work long enough to give a crisp nod rebus noted that he was wearing a waistcoat of the same tartan as the carpet susie works here rebus asked the receptionists badge identified her only as amanda yes do you know if anyone showed her this photo its been on the news shes a different shift from me she was growing wary now when was she last seen she had picked up the phone next to her you need to speak to the duty manager the duty managers name was dora causley and she sat with rebus in the lounge as a pot of tea was fetched she held the efit and studied it carefully its very like her she admitted susie susie mercer shes been with us nearly nine months not at work today though she phoned in sick a few days back by rights she should have produced a doctors line by now id like to speak to her causley nodded slowly i can get you her details thank you and do you happen to know if anyone might have shown her this photo or mentioned the likeness to her no idea sorry she left him to his tea and shortbread returning a few minutes later with a slip of paper home address and phone number do you know where this is rebus asked causley shook her head ive only been in inverness a couple of years amanda can find it for you on the computer rebus nodded his acceptance of this what about susie mercer is she a local english accent causley said no shortage of them in these parts is she married dont remember seeing a ring she must have a personnel file any chance i could take a quick look id need authorisation for that my words not good enough the firmness of her smile was answer enough armed with a route map printed from the internet by amanda rebus set out to the car park the saabs bonnet was still warm to the touch sorry oldtimer he apologised were not quite done yet the address was a flat above a charity shop in the city centre rebus pressed the bell and waited he had been forced to leave his car on a double yellow line parking didnt seem to be possible otherwise he pressed the bell again checking the name beneath it mercer there was one other buzzer the name next to it scored out rebus tried it anyway and a minute later the door opened a man in his mid twenties stood at the foot of the stairs chewing a mouthful of dinner sorry rebus said i was looking for susie mercer havent seen her today shes been off sick workmates are a bit worried the man seemed to accept this im in the flat next to hers i can usually hear her television he was leading rebus up the narrow flight of uncarpeted stairs there were two doors at the top one standing open revealing what looked to rebus like a bedsit sofa bed cooker all visible the man tapped on susie mercers door after a moment rebus tried the handle without success there was no letter box for him to peer through when was the last time you saw her few days back you think shes in there could be i hope shes all right is there a landlord hed have a key wouldnt he the tenant nodded his agreement want me to fetch him he lives nearby few streets away id appreciate that sorry again to interrupt your dinner its fine the man said heading indoors to fetch his jacket he hesitated about to lock his door then told rebus he could wait inside if he liked thats good of you rebus said accepting the offer the room was small the only available window open a few inches presumably to release the smell of cooking looked like chilli from a tin with a bag of nachos to accompany it there was no tv just a computer on a desk and the bowl of leftover food next to it a movie had been paused rebus recognised the actor but couldnt put a name to him he plucked a nacho from the bag and popped it into his mouth from envelopes on a ledge behind the door it seemed the tenants name was g fortune rebus could only presume the g stood for something other than good next to the narrow single bed were a reading lamp and some wellused paperbacks thrillers picked up for between ten and fifty pence possibly from the charity shop downstairs no music system other than an mp player attached to a large pair of headphones no wardrobe either just a rail for jackets shirts and trousers and a chipped chest of drawers for everything else rebus heard the downstairs door open and close and two sets of feet begin to climb the stairs the landlord took rebuss hand when it was offered but he had a question ready youre from the hotel i never said that rebus commented geoff here says you did rebus shook his head he may have got that impression he took out his id i work for the police mr ralph ellis so whats going on here just a few questions for ms mercer shes not been seen at work for a few days called in sick but hasnt provided a doctors line you think maybe shes ellis nodded towards the locked door only one way to find out sir ellis debated with himself for a few seconds then produced a bunch of keys from his pocket and found the right one opening the door calling out to susie mercer as he did so the room was dark rebus switched the light on the curtain was closed the bed unmade the place was very similar to fortunes down to the clothes rack and chest of drawers but the hangers had been stripped and the drawers emptied looks like shes done a flit fortune said rebus made a circuit of the room and the shower room off toiletries gone some womens magazines left on the floor next to the bed pinholes on the wall above the headboard of the bed rebus pointed to them any idea what the pictures were a couple of postcards fortune said one or two photos of her and her friends what friends fortune shrugged i never saw them in the flesh what about a boyfriend ive heard guys voices from time to time well the landlord interrupted shes not here and shes not dead so i think we can lock up again he looked at rebus unless youve brought a search warrant with you rebus didnt want to leave on the other hand he couldnt see anything worth lingering for is the tv hers he asked i think so fortune said its not mine ellis added it might be now rebus said quietly susie mercer had left in a hurry taking only what she could carry he handed business cards to both men in case she gets in touch he explained you dont think shes coming back though the landlord asked rebus shook his head slowly in reply not now her efit was out there he sat in his car and considered the situation then he remembered the cop hed spoken to in northern constabulary when hed been tracking down the case files on sally hazlitt and brigid young he had a name and contact number in his notebook so he made the call the police switchboard answered and he told them who he was and that he needed to speak to sergeant gavin arnold hes not on shift he was eventually told its a bit urgent would he mind you giving me his home or mobile number we cant do that maybe if i give you my number then and you can get a message to him ill see what i can do after ending the call rebus knew that all he could do was wait in inverness aka dolphinsludge on a dreich weekday evening with the temperature falling rapidly he drove around without taking much of it in a couple of supermarkets were open and looked busy men stood outside pubs sucking hard at cigarettes keen to get back inside when his phone rang he pulled over to the kerb what is it i can do for you gavin arnold asked do you remember me sergeant youre the reason i spent almost half a day covered in the dust of ages while i hunted those damned files havent stopped sneezing yet im grateful to you so has there been some progress itd be easier if i explained in person youre planning to drive up im already here man you should have said im at the lochinver just along from the railway station if its a pub i think i passed it a couple of minutes ago im towards the back of the main room next to the dartboard do you play not really pity its a league night and were a man down more double yellow lines outside the bar every legal parking spot filled rebus left the sign on the dashboard locked the saab and pushed open the door of the lochinver arnold waved to him from the bar the two men shook hands whats your poison arnold asked just a lemonade got the car eh arnold looked sympathetic he was in his mid forties slim and tall dressed in duncoloured chinos and an opennecked white shirt his cheeks glowed but that could have been the result of one whisky too many your turn gavin came the call arnold gave rebus an apologetic smile this takes precedence im afraid fine by me rebus said he rested his weight on a bar stool and watched the game arnold was good but his opponent had the edge the players teammates offered noisy encouragement from their tables arnold lost to a single eighteendoubletop outshot and the two men shook on it this it turned out had been the fixtures decider after a bit of banter between the teams arnold slid on to the stool next to rebus unlucky rebus offered ive never beaten the swine yet arnold replied his voice betraying his irritation but he shrugged it off ordered another whisky for himself and turned his attention to rebus what brings you all the way from edinburgh what brought you all the way from lancashire arnold grinned yorkshire actually some days youd swear the english outnumber the scots up here not that you can always tell by appearances he gestured towards the barmaid and she approached with a smile sue he said this is a friend of mine his names john nice to meet you john she reached between the pumps to shake his hand any friend of gavins as the saying goes sue owns this place arnold informed rebus then to sue john here reckons he can place an accent he looked at rebus go on then where was sue born ill even give you a clue her surnames holloway rebus studied sue holloway her smile told him this was a game he was fated to lose though it was incumbent on him to try manchester he offered eventually tell him sue arnold said youre almost right john holloway obliged but i was born in kirkcaldy makes you a fifer then he said same as me youve probably been back more regularly than i have of late only as far as the m but you grew up in manchester right right she conceded and for that you get a drink on the house are you sure you want to stick to lemonade with fresh drinks in front of them rebus warned gavin arnold that the tale he was about to tell might take a while as long as you like arnold reassured him so rebus laid out the whole story finishing the lemonade and accepting yet another arnolds darts team had drifted away the bar only half full by the time rebus finished he ended by saying he would let arnold mull it over while he stepped out for a cigarette but arnold followed him into the cold and stood there with him so you think mercer might be the hazlitt lassie she might rebus conceded blowing smoke into the night air and when those photos were published she decided it was time to leave its a possibility arnold thought for a moment could be a few clues in her personnel file rebus nodded youre local im not easier if you were the one to do the asking arnold looked at his watch bit late now there must be a night manager at the hotel rebus suggested even so id really appreciate it my one bloody night off arnold muttered but he was smiling as he said it theres a whisky on me afterwards rebus said by way of encouragement that seals the deal he was told they took the saab and stopped at arnolds police station on burnett road long enough for him to change into his uniform looks better that way more official he explained then with arnold navigating they headed to whichers the night porter had started his shift but said there was nothing he could do the office was locked until dora causley arrived in the morning how do you contact her in an emergency rebus asked the porter plucked a card from one of the pockets in his tartan waistcoat call the number rebus commanded arnold was standing at his shoulder saying nothing but looking stern and definitely not to be messed with the porter did as he was told his eyes on both men its gone to voicemail he said eventually rebus gestured for the receiver took it and told causley she should call him as a matter of urgency he recited his mobile number then handed the receiver back and told the porter theyd wait bar still serving guests only the man explained arnold took a step forward and glowered at him until it was decided he might be able to bend the rules just this once a single malt for arnold and tea for rebus they sat in the lounge leather chesterfield chairs piped music only three guests were in there with them huddled around the remains of their drinks discussing as best they could the next days business meetings voices slurred eyes drooping arnold had removed both jacket and tie but was still recognisably an officer of the law he asked rebus how long he had left until the gold watch im already retired rebus admitted cold case units staffed by crocks like me you never told me that arnold seemed to be weighing up whether to take offence or not eventually he chuckled into his glass i never even asked for id did i you could have been anybody sorry rebus said arnold chuckled again but more wearily this time he looked at his wristwatch cant wait here all night can we i suppose not she could be out on the town arnold yawned stretching both arms wide straining the buttons of his shirt you planning on heading back south that was the general idea i could get the stuff in the morning and send it to you but rebus was thinking of something else he hadnt brought his overnight bag with him this time but all the same one for the road he asked arnold signalling for the barman when he ordered whisky for both of them arnold knew he could no longer rely on his designated driver to get him home another dining room breakfast there was no sign of the businessmen from the lounge bar most of the guests seemed like rebus to be travelling solo it was half past seven and amanda on reception had informed him that dora causley didnt get in until eight hed texted this information to arnold along with the offer of bacon and eggs when arnold arrived however in full uniform and showing no hint of the previous nights intake he wanted nothing but coffee and orange juice dont do breakfast he informed rebus as he pulled out the chair across the table me neither unless its already paid for rebus polished off the last triangle of toast sleep all right like a baby wet the bed three times rebus smiled as he felt was expected how about you arnold asked i never seem to be able to sleep late in hotel rooms thats hardly fair is it hardly rebus agreed their waitress was pouring refills when causley forewarned by the front desk marched towards them eyes only slightly bloodshot good morning she said rebus was about to say something about her inability to check her phone for messages but arnold had sprung to his feet and was shaking her hand sergeant arnold he reminded her we met when you had that breakin yes of course good job it was kept out of the papers eh arnold turned towards rebus turned out to be one of the housekeeping staff causley busied herself trying not to squirm arnold was still holding her hand and she knew what was expected youll be wanting to see that file she said if its not too much trouble arnold replied only now loosening his grip having played his part arnold had headed off to work and half an hour later rebus was checking out of the hotel taking with him photocopies of susie mercers cv application letter references and twelveweek performance review he sat in the saab and went through everything for a second time the references were from other hotels one in northern ireland and one on mull mull was the more recent and rebus called the number yes he was told susie mercer had worked there the previous summer the hotel in northern ireland on the other hand had no record of her though we did have a susan merton here around that time rebus waited for the woman to pull mertons photograph from her personnel file then described mercer to her sounds about right she conceded rebus asked if a copy of the photo could be sent to him she snapped it with her phone and a couple of minutes later it arrived on his screen it was blurry and the cut and colour of the hair were different but hed bet his pension susan merton and susie mercer were the same person he had tried mercers number half a dozen times leaving messages when prompted now he punched in a text and sent it asking her to get in touch without revealing who he was looking down the cv he saw more hotel and restaurant work plus stints in department stores and as an office temp high school in aylesbury further education college in the same town rebus had only the vaguest notion that aylesbury was somewhere near london her date of birth was june while sally hazlitts was the reverse january and easy to remember when his phone rang he answered automatically it was peter bliss someones looking for you bliss said keeping his voice down cowan gayfield square told him youd be back here first thing nicely played page just a smidgen of revenge im in inverness rebus confided ill be another three hours at least inverness its a long story you should call in on gregor magrath it took rebus a moment to place the name the guy who started scru he remembered the card nina hazlitt had given him the one with magraths number on it he lives up that way you reckon cowan would be happier if i told him that was what i was doing probably not well thanks for the warning anyway so well see you this afternoon will there be bunting bliss was stifling a laugh as he ended the call cowan was on the phone when rebus walked into the scru office bliss gave rebus a wink and elaine robison added a little wave their attitude suggesting that the workload had been managed more than adequately in his absence hes here now cowan was saying into the receiver eyes on rebus better late than never i suppose he paused as he listened yes ill tell him straight away yes he ended the call and told rebus not to bother taking his coat off dci page wants to see you any idea why that might be rebus was stumped all he could come up with was that the case files were taking up space and needed to be moved where the hell have you been anyway didnt realise you would be pining for me dan out in the car park rebus apologised to the saab one more time before starting the engine there was a single dry cough of complaint before the motor caught he got on the phone to siobhan clarke before she could speak he told her that hed just been to inverness and the thing is i think sally hazlitts definitely still alive soon as that efit went public she did a runner i dont suppose it counts as conclusive but all the same throwing into doubt your whole serialkiller theory yes thing is john theres a problem with that its why james wants to see you oh couple more victims by the look of it well tell you all about it when you get here two of the gayfield square detectives would be hotdesking so that rebus could have the one going spare the boxes had been piled next to it and on it the desk drawers are out of bounds ive been told to advise you page said dc ormistons keeping his stuff in there for the duration they were in his office page seated behind his desk siobhan and rebus standing siobhan tells me youve changed your thinking about the first victim she tells me rebus countered that there may be others page nodded and picked up a sheet of paper reading from it its the photo sent from annette mckies phone it chimed with a couple of families both have lost teenage daughters in the past five years suspected drownings neither body recovered they sent photos from their phones the day they vanished rebus guessed page nodded slowly in one case the photo no longer exists but the parents swear it was the same as the one they saw on the news and the other family kept all their daughters things heres the picture they were sent page was tapping the screen of his computer rebus walked around the side of the desk so he could see it christ was all he could think to say it was edderton no doubt in his mind at all that night rebus stayed late at the office clarke had volunteered her services and the two of them were giving some order to the boxes sorting out what might be important page wanted a precis something he could take to the chief constable northern constabulary would need to be persuaded to cooperate in the inquiry the area around edderton searched local people questioned at length and in detail and that meant putting together the facts while trying to predict queries and problems then prepping possible responses clarke was working on the timeline do we add sally hazlitt or not was one of her questions rebus didnt really know and to which we can add and she stared at the figures i know what a profiler would say enlighten me if you must theyd say serial offenders start out slow then become more prolific the longer they get away with it oh aye three possibilities one its because they want to be caught two its precisely because theyre not being caught three its because theyre becoming addicted to it each new victim satisfying them for a shorter time is that the sort of stuff you need to know these days to be a di i think its worth looking at those essays christine printed out our guy has given us one big problem no disposal sites to work with but we do have edderton it has to mean something to him unless he chose it at random to throw any police investigation off the scent could be somewhere he stopped just the once maybe someone else snapped the original picture and he got hold of it somehow clarke considered this trying not to look too disheartened they worked in silence for a few more minutes until she asked him about inverness and he filled her in on the details of his trip and the saab didnt break down not ready for the knackers yard just yet apparently not rebus stretched his spine and rolled his shoulders we about done here i should type all this up ready to present to page first thing it would make sense a cold drink would make sense too give me another halfhour and what will i be doing all that time getting your inverness adventure down on paper clarke suggested afterwards they walked to a bar on broughton street clarke sucking in lungfuls of the night air as if tasting freedom after long captivity the pub was well lit and filled with conversation rather than music a pint of beer and a gin lime and soda rebus feeling reckless even threw in salted peanuts and a bag of crisps how are you feeling clarke asked as they clinked glasses im all right i meant with all the driving youve been doing you offering to apply the deep heat no she smiled and took a sip its weird up there rebus said beautiful and bleak and eerie all at the same time he swallowed a mouthful of beer one particular stretch south of durness i doubt its changed since the time of sir walter scott you should have taken a navigator i really did think you were needed here and i know thats not the whole truth she paused inviting him to comment but he opened the crisp bag instead what about edderton she asked eventually farming and tourism id say a distillery an easy commute away plus some rigs in the cromarty firth dornoch nice wee place goodlooking beach no sign of madonna he wiped foam from around his mouth everything seemed so normal he shrugged just normal his phone went and he checked the screen nina hazlitt he informed clarke you going to answer she watched him shake his head why not because id probably lie to her tell her theres no news why not the truth because i want to be a hundred per cent sure maybe a hundred and ten they waited until the phone had stopped it sounded once more to tell rebus he had voicemail if sally is alive clarke said what do you think her story is ive no idea what was her place like in inverness pretty anonymous i think she moves around a lot never stays anywhere long maybe its like the song says she hasnt found what shes looking for who has rebus said lifting the pint to his mouth again youre not doing too badly clarke commented causing him to raise an eyebrow this case she explained its put a spring in your step im a regular fred astaire all right you know its true though he managed to lock his eyes on to hers i dont think it is the jobs changed siobhan everythings he struggled to find the words its like with christine esson ninety per cent of the stuff she does is beyond me the way she thinks is beyond me youre vinyl were digital clarke offered contacts used to be the way you got things done the only network that mattered was the one out there on the street he nodded towards the pub window thinking that frank hammell had said much the same to him that night in jojo binkies after darryl christie had gone your way works too john edderton susie mercer those were shoeleather results so dont go thinking youre obsolete she pointed to his nearempty glass are we having another might as well eh he watched her as she queued at the bar then his phone rang again and he decided he might as well answer john hello nina i called you a few minutes back signals patchy here you sound like youre in a pub guilty as charged you sound tired too is everything all right as well as can be expected and the inquiry see my previous answer there was silence on the line for a moment do you mind me calling he closed his eyes no he told her and when you get news youll tell me didnt i promise i think your daughters alive promises arent always kept john should i come north again id like to see you i dont think thats a good idea your daughters alive but why did she leave you sound tired no not just tired strange are you sure youre all right i have to go nina why would she not get in touch when she knows youre out there desperate and searching john i he ended the call just as clarke returned to the table let me guess she said watching him switch off the phone and place it on the table then sitting down you really dont want to tell her about susie mercer no i can see how it might make things worse on the other hand rebus ignored her and picked up the fresh pint cheers he said heres tae us as he drank he couldnt help but think of the rest of the toast whas like us gey few and theyre a deid malcolm foxs drink of choice was appletiser he never touched alcohol not these days he always recycled the empty bottles along with paper cans plastic and cardboard now the council was asking him to recycle kitchen waste too and he was running out of room in his bungalow for all the boxes and bags he already had a compost bin in his back garden though it was only ever added to in the summer lawn trimmings and the few weeds he could be bothered to dig up fox wasnt convinced any of it made a difference yet he found himself unable not to comply though the bungalow had no party walls he always kept the volume low on the tv and seldom listened to music he liked reading almost as much as he liked work it would have been against regulations to bring home the files on john rebus even if he could have carried them but he prided himself on his memory and had jotted down pages of salient details along with several decades worth of supposition rumour and claim he felt he knew the man almost as well as anyone hed ever met right now rebus would be in some boozer somewhere probably running up a tab that would never require paying rebus wouldnt see that as either bribe or inducement but rather as standard operating procedure time was plenty of his fellow detectives would have felt the same but those days were past the combatants long retired from the field fox wished rebus would just take his carcass overseas to some beachside taverna where he could pickle himself at his leisure while spending some of that accrued pension instead of which he had reapplied for a cid posting the sheer bloody nerve of the man what was more he still had at least one champion on the force the chief constable had sided with him and had told fox that if the complaints were going to raise an objection theyd best build a bloody good case look at the mans record malcolm who else managed to put big ger cafferty away yes that counted as a big tick for rebus but fox himself was suspicious cafferty hadnt served much of a stretch how convenient to have someone on the force who seemed to be his nemesis seemed being the operative word who was to say the two hadnt been in cahoots cafferty had returned to the city apparently stronger than ever his empire undiminished how was that possible and why had no one managed to put him back inside since come to that wasnt it convenient that rebus had been on hand at caffertys hospital bed ready to give cpr when he flatlined would you bring your worst enemy back from the dead the staff had had to drag rebus away such had been the intensity of his focus enemies fox didnt think so the chief constable had challenged him to build a case and fox in turn had asked for permission to look at rebuss phone accounts landline and mobile the chief had been reluctant but fox had worn him down the relevant paperwork was on its way he was hopeful there might be a little bomb tucked away there though he didnt like to admit it there was something else about rebus that gnawed at him it was the lifestyle the smell of smoke on the mans suits always supposing he owned more than one suit the pale pasty face and the three or four extra stone he seemed to carry and the drink the drink above all fox had ceased to take alcohol because he was an alcoholic while rebus continued to sup for the exact same reason somehow though rebus still functioned while fox seldom had alcohol fogged his mind and made him shorttempered it gave him the sweats and the shakes and nights of the worst possible dreams rebus was probably the kind who slept better after a dozen or so malts damn the man then there was the fact that fox had seen rebus in action their time together in cid had been short but it had been enough the preening ego obvious from the start always late or off somewhere the paperwork piling up on his desk while he coughed his way to another cigarette break if in doubt fox had been told try the pub across the street you can usually find him there deep in thought with a whisky in front of him did i nick your sweets in the playground and now you need to get your own back it wasnt that at all the force had spent generations tolerating and turning a blind eye to cops like rebus those men were gone now memories of them fading their foibles no longer humoured by officers of foxs generation rebus was the last he had to be convinced that his time was past then there was siobhan clarke a good detective who had flourished once freed from rebuss influence now that he was back her loyalty to him could well prove her undoing so fox sat on his sofa with the tv news channel muted sifting through his pages of notes on the man exarmy divorced one daughter a brother whod served time for drugdealing no current relationships other than with the bottle and anyone who happened to sell tobacco a flat in marchmont bought back when he was first married that no cop would be able to afford these days a string of onetime colleagues who had fallen by the wayside including a couple killed in the line of duty whichever way you looked at it rebus was bad news siobhan clarke had to know that she wasnt stupid the chief constable should know it too did rebus have something on the boss was that the explanation something buried in all the paperwork and maybe there was some hold he had over di clarke too missed by fox despite his diligence he knew what he had to do start reading again start from the very beginning information was always worth paying for that was the way cafferty looked at it the cops name was ormiston and he didnt come cheap but he had delivered tonight cafferty tapped darryl christies number into his phone and waited the young man answered you on your own cafferty asked just driving home thats not what i asked im on my own it sounded like darryl was using the cars speakerphone i thought id have heard back from you before now it was certainly an intriguing text reckon your man rebus is in franks pay i wouldnt put anything past rebus but its hammell im phoning about yes police have got cctv of him and your sister what do you mean at the bus station arguing cops pulled hammell in for questioning seems hed tailed her from home to the train station and then on to st andrew square why would he do that his story is she took money from him for a train and he was annoyed she then went for the cheaper option youre well informed mr cafferty always darryl is this coming from your man rebus that would be telling i just felt you ought to know im not sure your mum does and im guessing franks said nothing to you about it he hasnt darryl christie confirmed anything else a quid pro quo maybe whats your boss up to at the moment hes just been hosting a drinks party at his house any faces id know a couple from up north calum macbride and stuart macleod alliances being forged i didnt hear much business being discussed interesting all the same and how are things with the family much the same still keeping an eye on your mum well be fine of course you will but remember anything i can do to help thanks mr cafferty your dad would be proud of you my dad is proud of me safe home then darryl cafferty said ending the call darryl took a mug of tea into his bedroom it was after midnight again hed phoned both pubs and the club quiet nights in all three he lay on his bed phone active checking the net while he played back the events of the evening frank hammell lived in a mews house near raeburn place hed put darryl in charge of the catering and welcoming the guests plus making sure glasses were kept topped up that was fine by darryl he could listen in on as many conversations as he liked the bottles of whisky wine and champagne were stored in the room hammell used as an office meaning it was easy for darryl to boot up his bosss laptop get it working and plug in the memory stick hed brought with him left it to do its job while he poured more drinks frank hammell enjoyed playing the host treating darryl like a lackey more whisky more samosas more of those mini hamburgers and darryl was happy to look obliging hammell had even ruffled his hair at one point in front of calum macbride calling him a good lad a good lad yes a good lad who knew almost every aspect of the business and was learning more every day a good lad who was paying off longterm employees and replacing them with leaner hungrier models who knew where their loyalty lay stretched out on his bed with his head supported by a pillow and his laptop balanced on his flat stomach darryl slotted home the memory stick financial records not all of them passwordprotected those that were would be the kind the taxman never saw hammell had trusted darryl with some passwords the rest wouldnt be a problem darryl had a friend who spent his whole life hacking one good reason darryl himself would never succumb to online banking hammell had however makes life simpler hed said simpler yes if you were stupid enough the blinds hadnt been closed yet and he glanced up at the sky overcast again the house silent apart from the hum of his laptops fan he thought about his sister taking cash from her mothers lover she wouldnt have said please or thanks frank hammell would have offered but following her to make sure she got on the train arguing with her at the bus station darryl wondered what that was all about no way he could ask without his employer asking in turn how he knew then he remembered the package page was just starting the briefing when rebus arrived at gayfield square next morning christine esson handed him nine sheets of paper held together with a staple rebus scanned them while page spoke the final five pages comprised the material gleaned the previous night from the files but they were preceded by details of the two new mispers august jemima salton age fifteen had failed to return home from a party some of her clothing turning up in a picnic area on the banks of loch ness the party had been held in invermoriston and jemima lived six or so miles away in fort augustus her plan had been to walk or hitch home in the early hours divers had been sent in but the loch stretched for miles accidental drowning had been the verdict no body ever turned up and her phone and bag remained missing her family had maintained her bedroom almost as a shrine the photo had been sent to them at three in the morning though they hadnt seen it until later no message theyd checked the bedroom no jemima either november sixteenyearold amy mearns had had an argument with her parents and gone to visit various friends in the village of golspie there had been a trip to a nearby beach and at some point amy had drifted away her jacket was found the following day attached to a fence above the seashore blown there perhaps amy herself had not been seen again accidental drowning page intoned once more rebus could feel the mans eyes on him youll note from the map that golspie is on the a north of tain and dornoch while invermoriston is on the a south of inverness and within easy reach of the a two patterns seem to be emerging the photos plus that road and that means im taking them seriously he paused any thoughts so far john rebus only now looked up from his reading its a busy enough route tourist traffic as well as vans and lorries it also covers a lot of ground not easy to get an investigation going nevertheless page barked but he didnt seem to know what to say next clarke saved his blushes by suggesting that the various constabularies needed to be contacted and a summit of sorts held all sorts of jurisdiction and protocol issues she said page nodded we also need to do what john did with the previous cases esson piped up talk to families and friends try to get a better sense of the mispers lives in general and their movements on the day they vanished page nodded at this too the photo is just about all were left with ogilvie added if were confident its edderton we should organise a sweep of the area and interview anyone who lives locally or visits regularly page puffed out his cheeks visibly daunted by what lay ahead something to bear in mind rebus interrupted the earliest victim we have is sally hazlitt and im beginning to think she may still be alive same might go for one or more of the others how much do we let the media know clarke asked page at this stage as little as possible if we turn up mobhanded in edderton they may start to get an inkling we need to talk to grampian constabulary first or is it northern the latter rebus answered we also need to talk to the families of jemima salton and amy mearns as soon as possible clarke said for several years now theyve been under the impression their daughters drowned weve just put the idea in their heads that they may have been abducted and murdered instead good point page was rubbing a hand up and down his jaw an order of priority is needed can i leave that with you siobhan she nodded her agreement youll be wanting to brief the chief constable she told him trying her best to make it sound like a reminder rather than the strong suggestion it actually was ill call his office page said glancing at his watch a moment later he had retreated to his cupboard there was silence in the room all eyes on clarke she on the other hand was staring in rebuss direction john she said can you divvy up the cold cases we need fresh interviews with all concerned did our abductor lie in wait or had he met the women beforehand could he be in some job that took him to those specific places or to those particular victims its a tall order rebus warned her worth a try though wouldnt you say her look dared him to defy her absolutely he responded the team gathering around him to receive their orders rebus had lost count of the number of cases hed worked cases often as complex as this one requiring interview after interview statement after statement he thought of the material in the boxes now being pored over by those around him paperwork generated in order to show effort rather than with any great hope of achieving a result yes hed been on cases like that and others where hed despaired of all the doors knocked on the blank faces of the questioned but sometimes a clue or a lead emerged or two people came forward to furnish the same name suspects were whittled down alibis and stories unravelling after the third or fourth retelling pressure was sustained enough evidence garnered to present to the procurator fiscal and then there were the lucky breaks the things that just happened nothing to do with dogged perseverance or shrewd deduction just sheer bloody happenstance was the end result any less of a victory yes always it was possible that there was something he had missed in the files some connection or thread watching the team at work he couldnt decide if he would want them to find it or not it would make him look stupid lazy out of touch on the other hand they needed a break even at the expense of his vanity so he watched them their heads bowed as they sifted through the documents chewing on their pens underlining making notes or typing their thoughts into their computers putting together more detailed chronologies deciding who should be questioned ready to suggest some avenue that had been missed either by the original inquiry or by rebus more chewing of pens more notes trips to the kettle and coffee pot the occasional offer to fetch snacks from downstairs rebus was the only one who took cigarette breaks during one he made sure the cars in the car park were empty before tapping a number into his phone i want to talk to hammell he told the person who answered tell him its rebus after a few seconds the mans voice was back in rebuss ear he cant speak at the minute tell him its important hell phone you back and that was the end of the conversation rebus stared at the display cursing under his breath he lit a second cigarette and paced the car park it was hemmed in by the twostorey police station and the back of a georgian tenement lots of windows no signs of life pigeons on the rooftops just getting on with things a large redbrick chimney belonging to some art studio on union street a plane making a sharp turn heading for the airport car horns sounding from the direction of leith walk and a siren in the distance failing to come any closer lifes rich tapestry rebus muttered as if to the friendly cigarette held between his fingers a couple of minutes later he was readying to discard it when his phone rang not a number he recognised he answered by giving his name something youve got to tell me hammell enquired all business no time for chat it isnt thomas robertson rebus stated so it just isnt you need to let him go or stop hunting him down which would you prefer depends if you have him or not what makes you so sure hes not the guy he was in jail when one of the women disappeared doesnt mean he didnt snatch annette yes it does were pretty confident theyre all linked convince me have you got him or havent you this is bullshit rebus rebus pondered his options for a moment then took a deep breath it looks like there are at least two other victims we didnt know about one was snatched in november robertson was in peterhead at that time both these new victims photos were sent from their phones same as with annette rebus paused i could get in trouble for telling you this but i need you to understand all right i understand but i never did find that little gobshite frank hammell ended the call the rest of the day felt a lot like limbo things were happening but not in the vicinity of gayfield square page had taken clarke with him for his meeting at hq with the chief constable rebus had asked her to text him updates but shed probably thought it bad manners to whip her phone out in the middle of the chiefs office northern constabulary had requested copies of everything pages team had esson and ogilvie were given the job of collating and sending it gavin arnold called rebus from inverness to tell him the station was buzzing rebus decided the corridor was the best place to continue their conversation were having to draft officers in from all over arnold went on dingwalls the nearest cop shop of any size but its too far from edderton itll be portakabins on site and a loan of some land i know a friendly farmer rebus said giving arnold jim mellons name and contact number hes the one who recognised the locus in the first place thanks john i might get a brownie point or two for that one favour less i owe you rebus peered through the doorway the team was restless impatient for the return of james page with their instructions how long till the media gets wind of it one of my colleagues is probably blabbing to the local paper as i speak bound to happen i suppose will you be back up this way im not sure i remember that drowning the one in loch ness nobody thought anything of it at the time no reason to what about golspie any memory of that none slapbang on the a though do you reckon thats what theyll call him the a killer im just hoping this is the end of it that depends on us catching him i suppose it does rebus said positive news on that front is a chief super called dempsey will probably head the case at our end good is he one of the best weve seen up here not a bloke though first names gillian my mistake rebus watched as page and clarke reached the top of the stairs ive got to go gavin give me a bell if you hit town and if im in your neck of the woods for a caley away game the pies are on me rebus confirmed following two stern faces into the cid office it took only seconds for everyone to gather around page bottom line he began chiefs not entirely convinced by edderton as he says its a photo of a photo thats been confirmed by the way could have been taken at any time and used merely to throw us off the scent on the other hand the a connection is too strong to dismiss and since pitlochry seems to be getting us nowhere hes spoken with inverness and requested a search of the area where the photo was taken plus interviews with the locals northern constabulary are already actioning this but they may be short a few bodies so were going to pitch in christine and ronnie i want you to go talk to the parents in golspie and fort augustus northern are okay with that esson checked page gave a nod of confirmation ill be headed to northern constabulary hq with siobhan page sought out dc ormiston dave youll be running the show here understood rebus caught clarkes eye she hesitated a moment before speaking john has been to edderton spoken with people there might be useful to have him on the ground with us at least at the start page fixed his gaze on rebus while he made up his mind fine he said it was mid afternoon before nina hazlitt called rebus didnt answer but listened afterwards to her message is it true theyve found two more the internets full of gossip about it i should have known i cant believe i didnt spot them in the papers but it means im right doesnt it right about the a right about them all being connected she was sobbing between sentences please call me back you promised you would you said id be the first to know i need you to tell me whats happening sally was the start of this john dont forget that i have a stake do you hear me dont shut me out clarke emerged from pages office and approached his desk just as nina hazlitt broke down into sobs again and ended her call hazlitt knows about the two new additions he said so soon all over the internet apparently clarke gnawed at her bottom lip as some might say this shit just got serious it was always serious siobhan true she agreed but now everyones taking it seriously did you get a rough ride at hq not particularly though it was made clear that if were reading more into this than is actually there you can always lay the blame on me rebus suggested ill bear that in mind she managed the beginnings of a smile so inverness in the morning it could almost be a country song rebus paused thanks for inviting me along by the way least i could do and you almost didnt do it at all its as though my reputation precedes me well there is that seems to me the focus has shifted from annette mckie rebus commented only because weve no new leads i cant see her family being thrilled about it clarke could do nothing but shrug then think i should talk to her mother might be nice if someone did before she hears about golspie and loch ness yes youre right maybe get christine and ronnie to do it though good training before they head north and best be quick news travels at broadband speeds these days that evening cafferty turned up at the door of rebuss flat cant be that time already rebus complained just fancied a drink cafferty responded he was dressed as usual in a black leather jacket with a black poloneck beneath you seem happy rebus said im fine rebus had already finished packing and had been considering setting out on the road a drink was a decent enough alternative it would stop him driving meaning hed get to inverness in daylight rather than the middle of the night somewhere walking distance he stipulated cafferty bowed his head i dare say you know the local hostelries ill get my keys then and this time you stay that side of the threshold the tannery was fairly busy there was football on the tv and most of the drinkers seemed to be there to watch it rebus and cafferty found a spot at the far end of the bar not having a clear view of the screen it was quieter than the rest of the pub cafferty insisted on buying the first round im the one dragging you out after all a man had risen from one of the tables he waited until he had their attention then nodded towards the barman hes too young to know who you are but im not we dont want any trouble here cafferty looked at rebus is he talking to you or to me then to the man dont sweat it he stuck out a hand which the man presumably the landlord took before returning to his table a relieved look on his face didnt even offer us one on the house cafferty complained demolishing his whisky and ordering another so is it true about all these poor wee girls is what true the counts up to six now is it i can use a computer same as the next man silver surfers they call us so annette mckies just the last in a long line looks that way maybe thats the way its meant to look rebus put his glass down what are you saying shed had an argument with frank hammell hadnt she who told you that cafferty just smiled could he maybe have followed her with a view to settling it youd like us to put hammell in the frame cafferty laughed away the suggestion im just speculating here so how did that photo end up getting sent from annettes phone how could hammell have known about the others frank has fingers in many pies but rebus was shaking his head he lifted the pint again he just didnt want her taking the bus turns out he was right too she probably wouldnt have got travelsick on the train i still think its too convenient cafferty offered hammells a player and shes the next best thing he has to a daughter of his own it cant be down to chance that she was snatched have you spoken to calum macbride or stuart macleod never even heard of them they run aberdeen theres been a bit of tension between them and hammell same questions then why the photograph and how did they know im not the detective here no youre not what you are though is the same conniving bastard youve always been six missing women and youre trying to conjure something out of it for your own entertainment caffertys eyes darkened careful what you say rebus i speak as i find rebus pushed his drink away and headed for the door the landlord was outside puffing on a cigarette and with his phone pressed to his face he recognised rebus and wished him all the best as it dawned however that cafferty was staying inside he began to look a little more anxious rebus lit a cigarette of his own and kept walking fox watched him leave he was slouched in the passenger seat of a ford mondeo parked across the street from the pub outside a lateopening grocers shop his colleague tony kaye was inside the shop itself making it look as though theyd pulled up to buy provisions kaye emerged toting a fourpack of beer and munching on a mars bar he dumped the cans on the back seat and walked around to the drivers side caffertys still in there fox told him but only a minute or two later the man emerged he must have phoned for a taxi because one drew to a halt and he climbed in a further figure left the pub straight afterwards and jogged towards the mondeo for me he said climbing into the back and opening one of the beers better be worth it kaye muttered joe naysmith was the youngest member of foxs small team he swallowed and stifled a burp before making his report football on the telly helluva din could you make out any of what they were saying fox demanded seemed to be about frank hammell him and the girl who went missing what about them naysmith offered a shrug like i say it was noisy if id got too close theyd have clocked me useless tony kaye growled he turned towards fox all this effort malcolm for what exactly for a result some result kaye paused who tipped you off that theyd be meeting text message number blocked same as before then makes you wonder doesnt it what kaye gestured in the direction rebus had taken if hes being set up fox stared at his colleague am i missing something didnt a retired detective a current police employee by the way with his nose deep in an ongoing case just have a known gangster turn up at his door and didnt the two of them then go out together for a drink and a catchup it doesnt mean anything it means everything especially when they start discussing the very case rebus is working on throw frank hammells name into the mix and it gets more interesting still i dont see it kaye said shaking his head i do fox retorted and at the end of the day thats what really matters want one joe naysmith asked holding out a can towards kaye why the hell not kaye snatched at it in which case im driving fox said pushing open the passengerside door afraid well be pulled over why not take a risk for once were swapping fox persisted kaye looked at him and knew the man wouldnt give up he sighed and reached for the door handle part four i took a jar of pain to the soaking field if hed been putting together a mix tape for the journey it would have featured plenty of songs about roads canned heat and the rolling stones manfred mann and the doors he refuelled at kinross checked out the roadworks north of pitlochry and stopped for tea and a cheese scone at bruar where he looked at his phone and found a missed call from nina hazlitt making four in total and a message from siobhan clarke telling him that rooms had been booked for a couple of nights at whichers he doubted this was coincidence maybe it was the only hotel clarke knew in inverness inverness however was not his immediate destination he stayed on the a crossing the kessock bridge alness followed by tain and finally the turnoff to edderton jim mellon had been contacted and hed made sure the police located the spot a portakabin was being unloaded from a flatbed lorry which would have the devils own job reversing back to the main road the crane arm dropped the portakabin on to the narrow lane ahead of it maybe the fields were too marshy to take its weight the end result was that diversions would be needed no traffic was going to be able to pass this way until the police operation had finished a uniform gestured for rebus to lower his window rebus obliged holding out his id mellon was in consultation with a woman in a smart twopiece suit the pair of them pointing towards the hills the woman held a copy of the photo sent from annette mckies phone she had come prepared shoes swapped for green wellies rebus wished hed thought of that he manoeuvred the saab up on to what verge there was give me a shout when the lorry needs to get out he told the uniform the man nodded adding rebuss licence plate to the clipboard he was holding mellon had recognised him and was giving him a wave rebus walked forward and shook hands the woman was waiting for an introduction im john rebus he obliged attached to the edinburgh inquiry she nodded slowly mr mellon was telling me about you im dcs dempsey yes maam they shook hands and sized one another up she was around forty buxom and bespectacled and with shoulderlength ashblonde hair wheres dci page she asked on his way what do you make of the comparison rebus gestured towards the photo she was holding i think it was taken pretty much where were standing she paused though im still not sure what its significance might be whoever sent it if hes being really clever then hes brought us here to waste our time and effort she stared at him were praying hes not that clever rebus nodded then lets hope thats the case she gestured towards the line of police vans parked on the carriageway past the portakabin they would have to head towards aultnamain and circle back towards home no way they could squeeze past the obstruction officers were being arranged into groups and shown maps presumably marked with the grid they would be covering what is it they should be looking for anything out of place rebus advised scraps of clothing cigarette ends a discarded bottle or can he paused how about the interviews a team of six she replied there really arent that many habitations for them to visit would it be cheeky of me to ask them to check cafes and petrol stations too within what sort of radius she had narrowed her eyes a little as if reappraising him dornoch bonar bridge tain for starters anyway this merited the thinnest of smiles you know this part of the world a bit whats your thinking a traveller might not be someone who lives locally but they must know the area well see what we can do she had been about to add his rank until realising she didnt know it i rose to the giddy heights of detective inspector rebus informed her past tense he nodded again there was an incoming text on his phone lucky you dempsey said im getting no signal half a bar rebus said and as mr mellon will tell you a gust of wind the wrong way and ill lose it the message was from clarke letting him know theyd reached hq in inverness and were about to go into a meeting with the brass but rebus knew that the only brass worth dealing with was right there with him when he looked up dempsey was on her way over to one of the search teams they carried thin sticks and evidence bags and seemed enthusiastic about the task ahead of them when dempsey started giving them what rebus guessed must be a pep talk they paid close attention a fine woman mellon said in an undertone youd be proud coming home to that of an evening the uniform with the clipboard was standing by rebuss shoulder time to move your car sir he said as the air brakes on the flatbed gave a loud hiss if you want it kept in one piece mid afternoon neither page nor clarke had put in an appearance from her texts it seemed to rebus that this was not clarkes favoured strategy but page had lined up a series of meetings presumably so he could listen to his own voice and clarke had felt obliged to stick with him sandwiches and bottles of water had appeared from somewhere they filled the back of a patrol car its doors wide open so people could help themselves no hot drinks though mellon had offered to see what he could do the portakabin contained little more than a table and a couple of chairs there was an ordnance survey map of the area on the table the whole scene reminding rebus of that first trip to the roadworks outside pitlochry a generator was on its way so that the structure could have both lighting and heat another halfhour or so and the search would be called off for the day light was fading at least thirty minutes earlier than in edinburgh rebus was sipping water when the van arrived it parked at the rear of the line of vehicles there was no sign of the officer on clipboard duty a uniform emerged from the drivers seat and nodded a greeting towards rebus rebus got a bit closer so he could read the writing on the vans side grampian police canine unit the back had been opened and a cage unlocked a dappled springer spaniel emerged and began a keen examination of the road surface long way from home rebus commented northern doesnt have anyone like ruby the officer explained youve driven here from aberdeen the man nodded his attention focused on the dog left it a bit late rebus studied the sky rubys not using her eyes though means she can work that bit longer you in charge rebus shook his head dcs dempseys the one you need but shes had to head back to inverness maybe ill just get started then the dog handler looked like he came from farming stock plenty of girth and a ruddy face black hair swept back from his forehead the gate to the field stood open and ruby was itching to explore but she wasnt going anywhere until given permission dont you need what a bit of cloth or something belonging to the misper thats not rubys speciality the officer said so what is shes a cadaver dog he gave a signal to the spaniel and she bounded across the field in front of him one of the search teams was arriving back from the hunt meagre gatherings in their evidence bags they headed for the portakabin so they could record what theyd found and leave the bags on the table when they went over to the food car rebus took a look at their haul a rusty bottle top crisp bags and chocolate wrappers an old paint can half a brick bits of twine a few shredded remains of a carrier bag a mouse skeleton some feathers it was desperate stuff if the team had looked full of energy at the start they were now a lot more sombre pessimism setting in rebus had lost sight of the dog handler but he found him again already halfway across the field heading for the line of trees beyond he was passing another of the search teams as it headed back one of the officers bent down as if to stroke ruby but then straightened up warned off rebus reckoned ruby had been trained for work not play there were mutterings at the food car phones were being checked for messages held high in the air as a signal was sought better luck tomorrow someone commented as long as the weather holds rebus asked about the forecast grim he was told maybe sleet another voice added then are you from edinburgh rebus nodded i hate that place the cop said cannot bloody stand it im guessing youre from inverness the man scowled at rebus hate that place too dingwalls good enough for me isnt it time for your meds bobby someone else enquired causing a few tired smiles half an hour later the message came through from hq call it a day dempsey would not be coming back someone was given the task of locking the portakabin were leaving the evidence here overnight rebus asked if you can call it evidence the chief will take a look at it in the morning and decide what to do how much more ground still to cover plenty rebus watched the teams prepare their escape there were mutterings from those whose vehicles were stuck the wrong side of the portakabin long detours lay ahead of them cars had to be manoeuvred past other cars one got stuck muddy tyres spinning and had to be pushed off the verge as the last patrol car reversed down the lane the four officers inside gave rebus a little wave they were talking about him breaking into grins rebus didnt bother waving back the doghandling van was still there about twenty yards separating it from rebuss saab these were the only two vehicles left dusk had descended and rebus could see about two thirds of the field there was no sign of ruby and her colleague he leaned against his car and smoked a cigarette stubbing it out afterwards into the saabs ashtray didnt want to leave anything behind that could be misread as a clue not that this seemed to have occurred to the search teams crusts of bread and bits of sweetcorn were scattered on the roadway next to where the food car had been there was even a discarded plastic water bottle in the ditch rebus picked it up and threw it on to his passenger seat a waste of time maybe but all the same another fifteen minutes or so and it would be pitch black no street light of any kind out here he could already pick out a few stars in the sky and the temperature was dropping he sounded his horn three times in the hope that the dog handler would get the message when he heard a whistle he reckoned it was in response but it came again and again after that more urgently it wasnt the sort of sound you made when you were communicating with your dog and it was followed by a shout from somewhere the other side of the field rebus couldnt see anything he knew from the search teams footwear that the field was far from dry no torch in his saab meaning hed only have the light from his phones screen if he happened to get lost another cry bollocks rebus said to himself setting out through the gate the field contained dips and shallow hollows and this was where it was most treacherous rebus felt himself sink up to his ankles he cursed again but kept moving breathing heavily a fence separated the field from the trees beyond it was the best part of four feet in height topped with a strand of barbed wire rebus peered beyond it you there he called out here the dog handler said where a thin beam of light appeared the woods were deeper than rebus had expected ruby and her master were somewhere within rebus looked at the fence then to left and right seeking a stile or another gate seeing neither he shrugged out of his coat and draped it over the barbed wire easing one leg over the fence then the other his trousers snagged on something and he heard them tear one jagged tine had pierced coat and trouser leg both bastard he said under his breath he sank up to his ankles again almost losing a shoe as he pulled himself up a low bank and into the woods where the hell are you here the dog handler said shining the small torch again can you go fetch a team theyve all gone rebus could see both dog and man ruby was seated on the damp ground tail wagging tongue lolling what is it rebus asked trying to catch his breath in answer the handler directed the torch to a spot just beyond ruby the dog turned her head in the same direction licking her chops the earth had been disturbed and rebus knew what it was he was being shown an alltoohuman hand jutting up from the makeshift grave christ he hissed thing is the officer said playing the torch over the clearing i dont think rubys done yet not by a long chalk the diesel thrumming of the generators half a dozen arc lamps illuminating proceedings officers reeling out lengths of crimescene tape a mud track led from the lane into the trees this track was now out of bounds bordered by the blueandwhitestriped tape a vehicle must have been used doubtful the bodies had been dragged or carried all the way has to be allwheel drive rebus had posited to clarke mind you that probably accounts for three quarters of the cars in these parts she had nodded staring at him what he had asked i just cant believe you were here to which he had offered only a shrug page was in consultation with dempsey he had done well to borrow boots from somewhere rebuss own shoes needed drying out either that or chucking away clean socks wouldnt be a bad idea either and as for his trousers you bleeding clarke asked as he checked the damage just a scratch might need a tetanus shot tot of whiskyll do me fine they were discussing anything but what lay in front of them ruby had located three bodies so far and was now on a break her handler having fetched a bowl and a bottle of water from the van the sceneofcrime team had arrived and were busy a doctor had been found and a couple of evidence officers were busy with video cameras so how was your day rebus made show of asking clarke oh you know just the usual she folded her arms across her chest in an attempt to stay warm checked into the hotel yet seems all right she shuffled her feet they were standing well away from the three graves there being not enough overshoes and the like to go round trace evidence again the integrity of the locus had to be maintained page had used those exact words when explaining to clarke why shed have to stay this side of the tape for now rebus hadnt merited any such apology or even an acknowledgement of his existence even though hed been the one to call it in or maybe because hed been the one to call it in dempsey had thanked him though rebus reminding her that it was rubys result more than his sore point clarke had said to him afterwards as i was hearing at hq not much love lost between northern constabulary and their neighbours in grampian she was looking at her phone now reciting the time ten fifteen feels later rebus offered how long have you been out here rebus didnt like to think instead he moved aside to let more socos through they ducked beneath the tape dressed in their hooded white overalls and elasticated shoe covers making a rustling sound as they walked they carried cases and folded plastic sheets the mortuary van had yet to arrive it would bring the body bags but nothing was being moved just yet rudimentary tents had been erected over only two of the graves someone having been dispatched to inverness for more this is interminable clarke said shuffling her feet again we could sit in the car rebus offered she dismissed this with a firm shake of the head if page needs you hell know where to find you hell find me right here she stated well im going for a cigarette she nodded and he left her to it emerging on to the road and lighting up looking back he saw the long shadows of the players as they moved around the clearing one of the generators was really making a hellish racket but it was better than silence better than overhearing snatches of the discussions the socos would be having it was a lonely spot he couldnt help wondering if theyd been brought here alive bound and gagged perhaps or in a stupor or maybe already dead trace evidence again there had to be some of it in the vehicle fibres of clothing strands of hair maybe even saliva or blood did they arrive here in daylight or at night he guessed the latter but a car left on the lane at night would look suspicious to anyone happening to drive past another reason to take it into the woods where it might have left tyre tracks scrapings of paint against a trunk or branch the forensic team would get busy in the morning they needed daylight for their work a cordon had been put in place at both ends of the road diversion signs posted when a man approached on foot rebus tensed his shoes and trouser bottoms were soaked meaning hed got past the guards by crossing the fields journalist he had his phone out held in front of him to film what he saw rebus covered his face with his hand put that bloody thing away unless you want a night in the cells he barked then turn yourself around and bugger off the way you came can i quote you on that officer he was young with fair curly hair spilling from the hood of a green barbour jacket i mean it rebus checked and saw that the phone had been lowered big operation the reporter said rising up on to his tiptoes to peer over rebuss shoulder socos and everything im guessing that means youve found something youll know when everybody else does rebus growled what the hells going on rebus turned in the direction of the voice dcs dempsey was striding towards him pond life rebus explained but her eyes were on the young man might have guessed youd be first out of the traps raymond anything youd care to share dcs dempsey he was busy with his mobiles touch screen turning it from camera to tape recorder therell be a press conference in the morning too late for our early edition throw me a bone here will you the internets killing us dempsey gave a theatrical sigh there seem to be human remains but we dont know much more than that now off you go when the reporter tried asking a further question she shooed him away he gave a lopsided grin see you at mums on sunday then she nodded avoiding eye contact with rebus the reporter was already on the phone to his newsroom having turned back the way hed come is raymond his first name or his last rebus enquired first dempsey confided and before you say anything hes my nephew doesnt mean he gets special treatment i thought he just did she made no response well rebus went on i hope hes got sharp elbows when word gets out theres going to be a media scrum they stood in silence for a moment how many are we up to he asked eventually five i think four in an advanced state of decay and the other i wouldnt bet against it being annette mckie rebus watched as page and clarke emerged from the woods page removing his shoe protectors clarke was stonyfaced as she checked her phone for a signal page looked pale and queasy he turned away and dryheaved hand clamped to his mouth to muffle the sound rebus offered him what water was left in his bottle page accepted it with a nod of thanks clarke had got through and was talking to either esson or ogilvie letting them know the game plan had just changed i need to get back to inverness dempsey announced gee up some pathologists and see what can be done before morning she studied the three edinburgh detectives you lot should get your heads down big day in front of all of us she started walking towards her car shoulders slumped page was offering rebuss water back to him its yours now rebus said clarke had ended her call will the restaurant still be open at the hotel she asked rebus shook his head a sandwich in the bar if youre lucky crisps on the side can you pair stop talking about food page requested angling his head away from them as another wave of nausea struck almost two am page had retired an hour back and esson and ogilvie soon after the original plan had been for the pair of them to head to edinburgh at days end but clarke hadnt wanted either of them nodding off at the wheel neither had seemed to mind they had interviewed the parents of the golspie and fort augustus victims gleaning not very much in the process it was weird seeing jemimas bedroom esson had said it really is exactly as she left it some people just cant let go can they reception had doled out little toothbrush sets for both esson and ogilvie and found them a couple of rooms at the lastminute rate rebus guessed the place might be busier next day depending on how many news channels decided to cover the story he was nursing his fourth whisky of the night you thawed out yet he asked clarke almost ive half a mind to head back out there rebus told her what good would it do she was staring at her phones screen using the hotel wifi to scour the internet for mentions of edderton none rebus admitted id just be in everyones way on the other hand i dont think im going to be able to sleep fours not enough any more she gestured towards his whisky glass never has been this is just taking the edge off she picked up a shred of lettuce from the plate in front of her the sandwiches crisps and cherry tomatoes had been dispatched though rebus had abstained with the complaint that hed already eaten his own weight in white bread that day this is just beginning isnt it clarke speculated totally different case now nothings really changed rebus countered weve got confirmation thats all you always knew it would turn out like this it was a possibility we all knew that whether we said so or not youve worked more of these cases than i have where do we go from here local interviews crimescene analysis appeals for information what sort of person are we looking for isnt that a question for one of your profiler chums i dont have any profiler chums and its out of my hands anyway rebus looked at her im not convinced our pal page is up to the task you might need to be at his shoulder james will be fine hes just not been to many murder scenes hes an office manager siobhan could be cid or a company selling fitted kitchens this needs someone a bit different dcs dempseys at the head of the table thats a definite bonus but even she wont have covered something like this before and you have youre asking me to get you an invite into the boardroom more or less that might make it a bit crowded unless you want me left outside he shook his head i just need to be there wont always be possible john she finished her orange juice and checked the time whats the breakfast like substantial i forgot to ask when they start serving seven she gave a tired smile its like sitting with the michelin guide then she rose to her feet bidding him good night he sat for the length of one final drink adding it to his tab his phone was on the table in front of him he picked it up and turned it over in his hand he could call nina hazlitt or frank hammell or darryl christie by morning the news would be out there broken by dempseys nephew no he decided eventually give them one last night of unknowing one last sleep sprinkled with hope when he tried getting to his feet the backs of his legs ached too much standing around in the cold there were some books on a shelf in the bar area and he asked if it was all right to borrow one thats what theyre there for sir the one he picked for its title more than anything was cracking the code he took it upstairs to bed with him the barmans last words echoing in his head pleasant dreams the first news crew arrived at breakfast time rebus was out front smoking a cigarette rain had arrived in heavy gusts and he was sheltering next to the hotels entrance the crew chatted among themselves as they sprinted past him they didnt have reservations but were hopeful an early checkin would be a bonus quick shower and something to eat then they could get on the road to edderton english accents unshaven blearyeyed rebus got the idea theyd driven through the night to get there he flicked away his cigarette and headed for the breakfast room page was busy on his phone while clarke started on the second pot of coffee slight problem rebus told her nodding towards the open doorway clarke had a clear view of the reception desk one of the arrivals held a fullsized news camera at his side page saw it too and told the person he was speaking to that he would call back if theyre staying were not he commented agreed clarke said then any news from dempsey page nodded slowly first autopsy will start in an hour pathologist reckons itll take a couple of days to get through them meantime forensics are busy at the locus weather wont be helping rebus interrupted theyve covered what they can with plastic sheeting page informed him i need to buy some wellies clarke said me too rebus lifted one foot so she could see his rudimentary attempt at shoecleaning and trousers while im at it the reception desk had provided a needle and thread but his repair wasnt going to hold how about the tetanus rebus shrugged what are the symptoms headache dry mouth she examined his sewing lack of handeye coordination page was busy checking messages are christine and ronnie on the road home he asked yes clarke confirmed dempseys going to want the families brought to inverness page said its a murder investigation now that reminds me we should buy ruby a nice juicy bone rebus said all three of them watched as the news crew entered the dining room grabbing a table before heading for the buffet there was a swagger to them as though they suddenly owned the place i think thats our cue to make an exit page said getting to his feet they decided not to check out not until they knew there was somewhere else for them to go there wasnt much leg room in the back of clarkes audi but that was where rebus ended up on the way to northern constabulary hq page decided to entertain them with a pep talk about protocol and how they were representatives of lothian and borders police so should showcase their talents and not make waves or any foulups rebus got the feeling the speech was aimed squarely at him he met clarkes eyes in the rearview mirror but she wasnt giving anything away the building they were looking for was next to a roundabout and across the road from a twentyfourhour tesco the police hq was a modern threestorey construction of pink stone and smoked glass there were journalists waiting on the roadway and pavement in front of it setting up cameras or busy on their phones a uniformed constable checked pages warrant card before nodding the audi in the direction of a parking space rebus spotted a sign next to the entrance with the motto protect and serve on it written in gaelic as well as english bit late for the protect part all that was left was the serve once indoors they learned that detective chief superintendent dempsey had already left for the first autopsy it was being held at nearby raigmore hospital rebus couldnt help thinking same place as sammys ivf page was asking for directions when a text arrived on his phone dempsey he explained to clarke and rebus resident pathologists apparently annoyed by the number of bodies live rather than dead and wouldnt welcome us adding to the total he gnawed at his bottom lip rebus knew what hed be thinking they were here as guests of northern constabulary it wasnt really their case not until annette mckie was formally identified even then common sense dictated that the mckie inquiry would be bundled with the others with edderton as the locus it was northerns case no contest if page complained or made a fuss they could be sent packing at a moments notice on the other hand what use were they to anyone just hanging around waiting to be told what had already happened in their absence we could head out to edderton clarke suggested after a moments consideration page nodded his agreement so it was back on to the a the rain growing heavier as they crossed the kessock bridge side winds buffeting the car clarke had set the wipers to their maximum speed but they still struggled to cope never did buy those wellies rebus commented from the back seat theres an umbrella somewhere at your feet he was told he reached down and picked it up it was pink and retractable and looked to have a circumference no bigger than a drum cymbal its yours if you want it clarke said thanks rebus replied without enthusiasm the uniform at the cordon was dressed for the elements he even had a plastic shield for his clipboard their names were jotted down along with the audis registration number a camera crew were sheltering in the back of their van doors open so they could keep an eye on things raymond dempseys nephew was seated in his own car a white volkswagen polo his window was down and he offered a nod of greeting towards rebus as the audi crawled past the cordon and started to ascend the hill rivulets of rainwater either side of it the portakabin had been unlocked and was providing shelter for those taking a break from the crime scene socos cupped their hands around beakers of instant soup trying to get warm page decided to keep moving up the slope towards the locus clarke glanced back and saw that rebus was happy where he was but gesturing for her to stick with her boss there was just about room enough for rebus inside the portakabin a couple of socos were waiting for the kettle to boil mugs at the ready bottles of water empty cupasoup sachets no sign of the evidence bags from the previous evening the lab had probably taken them not the best of days for it rebus said to no one in particular and no sign of the heater we were promised then have all the bodies gone now there were nods of confirmation still just the five just im thinking we should be thankful there arent more theyve brought the dog back for a final recce one soco said any effects in the graves rebus asked trying to keep his tone conversational sorry who are you again im with the annette mckie team i was here when ruby found the first of them this seemed to satisfy the room just about no effects he was told no clothing no jewellery nothing and one body a good bit more recent than the others there were more nods she should be easy enough to identify someone conceded the others wont be dental records maybe or a dna match do you want some soup the offer told rebus that he had been accepted thanks he said even though he was still full from breakfast grabs them from the a another of the team was saying buries them here and sends a picture got to be local might just be someone who knows the road rebus cautioned any tyre tracks up there nothing useful as yet only three or so weeks since he was last here though ground might have been frozen dipped below zero the night the mckie girl went missing rebus nodded his understanding youll keep looking until were told to pack up clothing and personal effects might have been buried separately weve a metal detector coming later today plus the offer of geophys if we want it the mans eyes were on rebus daring him to doubt the effort being made rebus blew across the surface of the soup instead reconstituted peas and carrots had never held such fascination for him late in the afternoon they reconvened at northern constabulary hq in inverness dempsey was due to host a press conference at the top of the hour but wanted her team to hear the news first the mood was solemn photographs were handed round according to the pathologists report all five corpses were women but only one was readily identifiable rebus stared at the face of annette mckie her eyes were closed and bits of earth still clung to her eyelashes hair and ear lobes manual strangulation dempsey was intoning we may even get lucky and come up with a thumbprint youll see signs of bruising to the neck especially around the voice box large hands the pathologist says judging by decomposition and insect activity victim has been deceased for between twenty and twentyfive days she looked up at the room three weeks today since she was abducted so i think its fair to say she wasnt kept alive for long dempsey returned to her notes from the visual evidence im prepared to name the victim as annette mckie but the family are on their way from edinburgh to make the formal identification did the other victims die the same way someone asked interrupting dempseys flow she glowered at the miscreant no way of telling deterioration is too advanced all the pathologist would say is that she cant see initial signs of stab wounds or gunshots on any of them regarding annette mckie theres probable sexual activity but as yet no indications of forced penetration pathologists got a mountain ahead of her however and we cant expect a full report for a few more days we have the particulars of the missing women provided by our friends at lothian and borders and those will be useful in the preliminary stages i have to stress that we dont know for sure who the other victims are i dont want any of you jumping to conclusions there were nods and grunts of acknowledgement clarke had raised her hand dempsey considered for a moment before deciding to grant permission for a question whos iding annette mckie one of her brothers i think apparently her mothers in bits probably been watching the live feed on tv the mention of tv caused her to glance at her watch i need to get ready to face the jackals she said we can have another confab after meantime thinking caps firmly on heads i want constructive ideas as many as you can throw at me now back to your posts everybody as the meeting broke up page lunged forward ready to press his case for inclusion in the media conference rebus turned to face siobhan clarke we dont have posts do we she looked around the room no she admitted we dont nor do we have a place to sleep tonight unless we risk the hotel another good point and the pair of us still need boots of some kind she couldnt deny it her shoes were caked with mud from earlier are you suggesting a shopping trip and maybe a quick visit to the tourist office check out the bedandbreakfast situation clarke was staring towards page page was smiling at dempsey bowing his head in gratitude he was in well only be an hour rebus pressed her fine siobhan clarke said through gritted teeth they were walking back into northern constabulary hq with the address of a willing guest house when the press packs interest was aroused a car was arriving a white range rover sport with tinted rear windows frank hammell was driving darryl christie in the passenger seat his attention focused on the screen of his phone a few photos were taken tv cameras hoisted to shoulders but otherwise they were allowed some room and a bit of respect as they parked in the bay allotted to them and got out no one thrust a microphone into their faces while demanding to know their reaction to the news rebus ended up holding the door open for hammell and christie neither man seeming to recognise him perhaps because they were avoiding all eye contact while the two men gave their names at the reception desk rebus and clarke flashed their respective ids and preceded them into the body of the building dempsey must be meeting them here clarke said in an undertone nicer than the mortuary thats still where theyll end up though true rebus thought he had been present dozens of times as relations and friends mums and dads partners lovers watched the uncovering of the sheeted figure they would blink away tears maybe utter a gasp or a choking sound and be asked to verify the identity of the person lying coldly inert in front of them never a task to be relished and rebus had always proved hopeless afterwards not quite finding the right words the comforting phrase they usually all wanted the same reassurance that he or she hadnt suffered it would have been quick that was what you were supposed to say no matter how untrue smashedin skulls cigarette burns broken fingers and gouged eyes it would have been quick what do we do now clarke was asking lets see what the boss thinks she glanced at him told you youd run out of song titles sooner or later page was on his phone in the teeming inquiry room when he spotted clarke and rebus he ended the call and made his way towards them where have you been he demanded buying boots clarke answered and finding rooms for tonight so were well away from the media scrum how did the press conference go she did well the praise sounded grudging page fixed rebus with a look she wants you to brief the team why because shes traced the timeline all the way back to you and your missing persons thats what she needs from you the details of all those cases two of them we only just found out about the other three then ive already briefed on annette mckie were one body short clarke added six a victims five recovered it was her turn to look at rebus are you going to tell them you think sally hazlitts still alive i probably should rebus determined then to page whens this briefing scheduled for about five minutes from now i suppose if we hadnt turned up in time youd have been happy to fill my shoes page opened his mouth to say something but thought better of it i need to go for a slash rebus said into the silence then to clarke you going to tell him hammell and darryl have arrived clarke was doing just that as rebus made his exit as he headed down the corridor however he came face to face with frank hammell and darryl christie as a uniform led them towards dempseys office for a retired crock hammell said placing him eventually you dont half get about a bit rebus focused his attention on darryl who was only now looking up from his phone sorry about your sister he offered hows your mum doing how do you think shes doing hammell snarled rebus ignored him what about you darryl you all right the young man nodded what happens now he asked calmly youll be taken to the hospital for the identification and youre sure its her rebus nodded slowly darryls mouth twitched and he lowered his eyes to the screen of his phone again fingers busy texting some bastards going to pay big time hammell spat this probably isnt the place to be saying that rebus warned him its true though he stabbed a finger towards rebus and none of your lot better find themselves in my way a door opened further along the corridor dempsey stood there wondering what was taking her visitors so long is everything all right she called out hammell had time for one last glare in rebuss direction before shouldering past him and walking towards her rebus held a hand out towards darryl christie but the young man ignored it attention focused on his phone as he followed hammell into dempseys office rebuss presentation went as well as he could have wished the team had plenty of questions for him none of them stupid bright kids he commented afterwards to clarke its how they make them these days they had checked out of the hotel driven to the guest house near the battlefield at culloden and inspected their rooms there was no evening meal so theyd headed into town and stopped at the nearest indian restaurant page wasnt with them hed been invited to dine with dempsey and a few other senior officers when clarkes phone rang she wasnt at the table having gone to visit the toilets rebus saw that the call was from gayfield square and decided to answer its rebus he said is siobhan there who wants her dave ormiston im the one whose desk you were given shell be back in a minute is it anything i can help with thomas robertson has rejoined the land of the living oh aberdeen sent us the message hes in hospital there what happened to him from what i can tell he took a bit of a pasting from person or persons unknown local police involved they found him next to some rubbish bins down by the docks unconscious but with id in his pocket credit cards and cash untouched so not an obvious mugging hes going to be okay though sounds like rebus took out a pen and reached across the table for a paper napkin whats the name of the hospital he asked plus a name and contact number for someone in aberdeen cid if you have them ormiston gave him what he had then asked how things were going in inverness things are fine rebus said i saw you on the news holding open the door for frank hammell common courtesy did you speak to him at all why do you want to know no reason ormiston made a sound as though he were clearing his throat people usually have reasons for asking questions rebus persisted not this time youll let siobhan know about thomas robertson of course rebus said by the time clarke returned her phone was off and had been returned to its original position next to her glass of water she was yawning covering her mouth with the back of her hand minute my head hits that pillow she told him i know what you mean rebus pretended to agree reckon we should be getting back she nodded and signalled for their waiter to bring the bill this is my shout by the way she said i can always claim it on expenses and besides im not the pensioner here having returned to the guest house rebus stayed in his room long enough to give his phone a bit of a charge and check the quickest route to aberdeen the a seemed to be the answer it was a trip of a hundred miles though which caused him to hesitate on the other hand as soon as he was well enough there was nothing to stop robertson doing a runner tonight might be rebuss only chance as he crept down the stairs and out of the threestorey house he wondered how he was going to break the news to the sleeping saab it was well after eleven when he reached aberdeen royal infirmary he hadnt been to the city in years and didnt recognise any landmarks along the route oil was aberdeens core business and the industrial units he passed all seemed to be oilrelated he got lost a couple of times before chancing on a sign that pointed him towards the hospital he parked in the area reserved for ambulances and headed inside the reception area was claustrophobic and whoever manufactured beige paint had made a killing here the blearyeyed front desk sent him to the lifts and he emerged a couple of floors up pushing open the doors to the ward and explaining to the only duty nurse around that he was a police officer and needed to talk to a patient called robertson there were eight beds seven of them filled one man was awake plugged into headphones and with a book held in front of him the others all seemed to be asleep one of them snoring loudly there was a light over thomas robertsons bed and rebus switched it on illuminating the pulpy face eyes blackened chin gashed and sporting thick black stitches the nose presumably broken had been strapped there was a folder at the foot of the bed and rebus opened it one broken toe two broken fingers one cracked rib a tooth missing damage to the kidneys someone did a job on you tommy rebus said pulling up a chair and sitting down there was a jug of water on the cabinet next to the bed and he poured himself a glass gulping it down his head was throbbing from the drive palms tingling after so long at the steering wheel he opened the cabinet and reached in for robertsons wallet credit cards and driving licence plus forty pounds in cash no mugging just as ormiston had said rebus replaced the wallet handkerchief small change belt watch this last with its face smashed he closed the cabinet again and leaned forward so his mouth was inches from robertsons ear tommy he said remember me he reached out a finger and pressed it against the sleeping mans temple robertsons eyes fluttered and he gave a low moan tommy rebus repeated time to wake up robertson did so with a jolt which quickly turned into a wince of pain his whole body seeming to spasm evening rebus said by way of greeting it took robertson a few moments to get his bearings he licked dry lips before fixing his puffy eyes on his visitor who are you he asked in a dry croak rebus refilled the glass with water and held it to robertsons lips so he could sip the cop shop in perth rebus reminded him i was the one standing by the wall he placed the glass back on the cabinet what are you doing here ive just got a couple of questions about frank hammell who rebus described hammell and waited robertson blinked and tried to shake his head no rebus said so maybe hes telling the truth for once when he says he doesnt know you either thing is though somebody did this i was jumped thats all there is to it there was a lot of sibilance when he spoke the air whistling through the freshly made gap where a tooth used to be jumped some wee bastards wee bastards who didnt bother taking any of your stuff and this happened down by the docks docks where do you think you are tommy rebus gave a thin smile you dont know do you they lifted you from behind the pub in pitlochry and took you somewhere kept you there until they were sure you had nothing to do with annette mckie thats a bit of news for you by the way theyve found her body in some woods up past inverness four other bodies next to her so youre off our list of contenders might explain why youre here rather than in a shallow grave somewhere rebus saw that hed hit a chord robertsons eyes were suddenly fearful what is it nothing robertson said trying to shake his head i keep telling you i got jumped and which city did you get jumped in tommy no you were brought here and dumped here rebus paused anyway hammells probably finished with you now but as a wee insurance policy you need to tell me it was him how many times do i have to say it ive never heard of the guy the nurse was standing at the foot of the bed everything all right she asked in a stage whisper i need to sleep robertson told her of course you do am i due another painkiller in two hours if i had it now maybe id sleep through till morning the nurse had placed a hand on rebuss shoulder you have to be leaving now before you wake the other patients five more minutes but she was shaking her head off you go robertson said i can come back tomorrow come back as often as you like ill tell you the exact same thing you heard tonight robertson focused his attention on the nurse it isnt right im being grilled like this not when im in so much pain ive driven a long way to see you you little shitebag youre leaving right now the nurse said tightening her grip on rebuss shoulder or ill have you forcibly removed rebus debated whether it was worth standing his ground instead he got to his feet ill see you around he told robertson pressing down on the back of the mans hand the hand with the two strapped fingers robertson let out a wail loud enough to silence the snorer and wake the other patients he might be needing that medication early after all rebus informed the nurse before making for the lifts that night in a hotel room provided and paid for by northern constabulary darryl christie sat at a desk with his laptop plugged in and his phone charging he had already spoken to his mother and brothers plus a neighbour who was keeping an eye on all three of them afterwards he had called his father telling him about the identification without bothering to add that frank hammell had also been present eventually it was the turn of morris gerald cafferty how are you holding up cafferty asked never mind that this blows a hole in your notion that it has anything to do with frank granted so why am i even talking to you because whatever happens youre still a kid with ambition im not a kid and all that stuff you told me about franks enemies what made you think i wouldnt rank you among them abductions not my style darryl nobody innocent ever gets hurt is that right other people might disagree but i like to think i have standards im not sure that squares with some of the stories about you stories told by hammell no doubt not just frank though lots of disappearances lots of the wrong people ending up behind bars these are changed days darryl exactly my point you belong in the history books cafferty easy son im not your son im not your son and im not a kid whatever you say darryl i know youre under a lot of strain and all you dont know the first thing about me christie ended the call and ignored the phone when cafferty tried ringing back he busied himself with his laptop slotting home the memory stick caffertys words echoing in his head nobody innocent ever gets hurt tell that to thomas robertson you dont look like you slept much clarke said next morning at breakfast rebus was last down having managed a rudimentary shave and a shower under a dribble of tepid water wheres page he asked already gone to hq clarke was trying not to bristle i take it your services were not required the owner of the guest house had started clearing the other two tables she wore a blue check apron over her stylish clothes and had made an effort with her makeup not forgetting plenty of perfume when she apologised that they were out of bacon rebus said hed be happy with coffee and toast porridge a poached egg maybe toast will be fine when she had gone clarke held up a newspaper so rebus could read the front page splash a killer mass grave found its all over the radio too she added even managed to rustle up a few people who said they wouldnt be using that particular route for the foreseeable do you get the feeling its going to be another long day reckon youll manage without a nap at some point me im as chipper as they come she had some flyers sitting on the table next to her and rebus started sifting through them dolphinwatching mrs scanlon says you dont need to pay theres a place called chanonry point where they practically come to the shore reckon weve got time to play tourists that depends on our dear leader the landlady had returned with his coffee just the one small cup rebus stared at it better bring the rest of the pot mrs scanlon siobhan clarke advised brigid youngs mother and sister lived in inverness and were filmed by the tv cameras as they left home to make the drive to edderton the mother carrying a small wreath and a framed photo of her missing daughter zoe beddowss family had decided not to make the trip north not until they had absolute confirmation that she had been found a dna swab had already been taken from her father nina hazlitt had texted rebus to say she was on the road and would rebus meet her when she arrived he hadnt replied as yet a television had been set up in the inquiry room so the team could keep up to date the room itself was half empty some were at edderton others at the mortuary or the forensic lab someone had pointed out raigmore hospital to rebus it was right around the corner from northern constabulary hq phones dripfed updates from all three locations looking out of the office window rebus could see a couple of camera crews and a posse of print journalists plus curious locals with nothing better to occupy their time darryl christie had formally identified his sister and he too was on his way to edderton in the passenger seat of hammells range rover one of the news channels had blown the budget on a helicopter and it tracked the cars progress cutting now and then to aerial shots of edderton itself and the woods where the socos and search teams were still at work ruby and her handler were on their way back to aberdeen services no longer deemed necessary on the tv rebus saw the portakabin then the field hed stumbled across in the dark between the treetops could just be made out the canopies covering the graves there was no journalist on the helicopter itself the running commentary coming from the studio anchor and were going now to our man at the scene richard sorley richard whats happening there rebus watched as the action shifted to the police cordon the reporter held his microphone to his face jostling for position as hammells car arrived and was let through the barrier two stonyfaced figures in the front its wheels spun as it moved off again kicking up stones the camera following its route up the singletrack road back to the helicopter pictures as the range rover found its way blocked by a line of parked police vans the two men got out as usual darryl christie seemed glued to his phone hammell appeared to give the helicopter the finger before plunging his hands into his pockets striding in the direction of dcs gillian dempsey she then led the way towards the track into the woods the figures disappearing from view rebus realised siobhan clarke was standing next to him is page out there he asked she nodded where else would he be the studio anchor was back in business announcing that he now had nina hazlitt on a video link her face appeared on a screen behind him she was adjusting an earpiece the caption had her location as inverness shes outside raigmore clarke said identifying the backdrop as hazlitt began explaining to the anchor that she was readying to provide her own dna to help investigators establish that her daughter sally was among the victims when the anchor reminded her that she had been the first to spot that the missing persons were linked by the a she nodded so briskly that her earpiece slipped out and she had to push it back in i feel vindicated trevor she announced until recently i was dismissed as a crank by every police force i approached i want once more to thank john rebus a retired detective inspector in edinburgh for pushing my case isnt that nice clarke said rebus just grunted one of the other officers in the room mimed a burst of applause and you can bugger off too rebus told him at the end of the interview nina hazlitt removed the earpiece and handed it to a member of the news crew before turning towards the doors of the hospital and walking through them head held high shes loving this clarke commented maybe a bit too much shes waited a long time for the attention rebus retorted the camera seemed to want to follow her inside but a member of the hospitals security team had other ideas the studio anchor announced that they were returning to edderton where the helicopter was watching the white range rover reverse down the lane didnt take them long clarke said not much to see another cut this time to the cordon and richard sorley the reporter craned his neck to watch as the range rover arrived at a spot where it could do a threepoint turn when it reached the crimescene tape it stopped and both hammell and christie got out hammell was dressed in his usual jeans and opennecked sports shirt with a gold chain around his neck darryl christie was wearing a dark suit white shirt black tie every inch the dignified bereaved blood had risen to hammells face and he was ready to talk to anyone who would listen whoever did this he told the reporters theyre going to hell whether they believe in it or not thats where theyre headed he stared straight into the lens of the camera id like to see them swing from a fucking scaffold at which point the sound feed was muted so that only the pictures remained the anchors voice apologised to viewers before beginning a commentary based on what hammell was saying mr hammell he intoned a close friend of the family and understandably upset by his visit to the crime scene rebus was watching closely the incandescent hammell was the focus of the cameras attention but over his shoulder could be seen glimpses of darryl christie his face showing no emotion whatsoever when someone tried asking him a question he simply shook his head hammell was now stabbing a finger towards the camera as if he had the culprit himself in front of him wish i could lipread clarke was saying more microphones were being thrust in front of hammell but he was beginning to run out of steam when darryl christie placed a hand on his arm hammell acknowledged him with a nod and the pair of them headed for the car the studio had handed back to richard sorley who was talking about the extraordinary tirade weve just witnessed here the range rovers horn sounded as it drove past the cordon and the scrum of journalists slaloming before picking up speed along the main road im going to have to interrupt you richard and they were back outside raigmore hospital again as nina hazlitt emerged tearyeyed and trembling with emotion the gist being her dna was not required at this time and she would be contacted at some later date how does that make you feel she was asked by the reporter with the microphone absolutely livid ive placed my faith in the scottish justice system and this feels like a slap in the face not just to me but to all the relatives out there something tells me youll be getting another text clarke commented to rebus a small box had appeared at the top of the screen showing dempsey and james page being driven away from edderton in the back of a large black saloon car is there anything we should be doing one of the officers in the room asked look busy when they get here someone else suggested five minutes later rebuss phone sounded it was nina hazlitt pretty much on cue clarke watched him as he shook his head slowly and let the call go to messaging he stared from the window but saw no sign of her after three quarters of an hour dempsey and page arrived dempsey gathered her team together and gave them an update a stray pubic hair had been found on annette mckies body a comparison was under way but it didnt appear to be one of her own dna had been gathered from the families of jemima salton amy mearns zoe beddows and brigid young not sally hazlitt clarke interrupted dempsey shook her head pathologist doesnt think any of the bodies goes back that far shes not even sure about when brigid young disappeared if we end up with a body lacking a match well bring sally hazlitt back into the running clarke nodded her understanding and dempsey went on with the briefing afterwards clarke and rebus sought out james page were feeling a bit marooned here clarke informed him theres plenty you can be doing he snapped back his eyes on gillian dempsey making sure she didnt leave him behind a bit of leadership might help he directed a moments furious attention towards clarke would you prefer to be back in edinburgh that can always be arranged you know youre acting like a groupie she said putting up with any old crap in exchange for proximity she turned and stormed out of the room rebus lingered meeting pages look something to add page asked rebus shook his head just enjoying the moment he explained with a smile clarke wasnt difficult to find she was seated in her car hands gripping the steering wheel staring hard at the windscreen rebus got into the passenger seat and closed the door you all right he asked just fine but there was a tremor in her voice its not all his fault you know its me she said in edinburgh i got used to being needed reached the point where i even started to believe i ran the show and now youre not even the drummer in the support band some of the tension melted from her face did i really just call him a groupie i believe you did ill have to apologise for that she exhaled loudly so what do we do now maybe we should take a look at some dolphins you mean go for a drive weathers starting to clear theres even a bit of blue up there rebus nodded towards the sky maybe we could take your car rebus looked at her and in explanation she lifted her hands from the steering wheel they were shaking my car it is he said they drove over the kessock bridge and took a right on to the black isle another right at fortrose took them to chanonry point the moray firth was ahead of them a golf course laid out either side of the singletrack road busy despite the gusts of wind you ever played golf clarke asked from the saabs passenger seat christ no you must have tried what because im scottish i bet you have though rebus thought back when i was a kid he conceded couldnt get the hang of it its an odd little country this isnt it clarke was staring out of the window not so much of the little dont get all prickly i just mean its hard to fathom sometimes ive lived here most of my life and i still dont understand the place whats to understand everything there was a car coming from the opposite direction rebus pulled into a passing place and acknowledged the wave from the other driver people are just people he said good bad and indifferent its just that we tend to deal with the second group they had reached a turning circle with some parking spaces beyond rebus stopped the car the water looked choppy the beach made up of pebbles seaweed and shells there were gulls overhead hovering as best they could vehicles had been parked but there were no signs of anyone in them then far over to the left just past a lighthouse rebus saw figures standing by the edge of the shore looks like thats where the action is he said you game siobhan clarke was already opening her door and getting out but he called her back ive screwed things up between you and page havent i maybe its because i dont want you selling yourself short settling for second best youre not my dad john i know that he paused in fact thats something else i wanted to tell you what he looked out at the water that trip i took there was a reason i didnt want you along oh i had a notion to visit sammy and did you he gave a slow nod she wasnt at home though because you didnt tell her you were coming a slight oversight on my part thing is siobhan i nearly lost her years back before you joined cid some nutcase got his hands on her so this is personal for you she nodded her understanding didnt they teach you at college you dont get emotionally involved she stared at him as he shrugged youre a complicated sod arent you who isnt i thought you said people are just people and dolphins are just dolphins so lets see if we can nab one they walked side by side rebus with his coat zipped to his throat wishing he had a hat of some kind as protection from the horizontal wind as they got closer he saw that half a dozen people were all facing the same direction almost like statues albeit statues with cameras someone had even brought a tripod and a zoom lens plus binoculars a folding chair and a flask the resident expert rebus guessed so he asked if thered been any sightings the man nodded in the direction everyone was facing about thirty or forty feet into the firth he said rebus turned and watched too clarke had wrapped her arms around herself cheeks reddened squinting towards the water is that one she asked pointing not yet the man said she kept looking as the man offered some advice the harder you look the more you start to see things especially when you want to see them true enough rebus agreed under his breath siobhans mouth opened in a gasp as a sleek paleblue shape emerged almost exactly where the man had said it would after a moment the creature disappeared again but there seemed to be a second dolphin just behind it and then a third there were laughs and whoops from the spectators feeding time the expert explained when the currents right they hang around here until their bellies are full did you see clarke was asking rebus i saw he said but his attention had been caught by the opposite shore there seemed to be battlements there fort george the man on the folding seat said as if reading rebuss mind then he got busy with his camera as the dolphins broke the surface again clarke had taken out her phone and snapped a photo but was disappointed with the result she angled the screen towards rebus too far away and the dolphins themselves too similar in colour to the water around them here the man said handing her his binoculars she thanked him and pressed them to her eyes adjusting the focus rebus stood with his hands in his pockets a couple of the onlookers were tourists tanned faces brandnew mountain jackets bought to ward off anything the scottish climate threw at them they were grinning whenever anyone made eye contact one woman had brought her dog and she was soon off again rounding the point and tossing a ball for the collie to fetch after a couple of minutes rebus retreated to the lighthouses boundary wall seeking enough shelter to get a cigarette lit the show seemed to be over anyway clarke had handed back the binoculars and was being shown some of the photographers collection of shots she caught up with rebus and they started walking towards the car fun he asked her she nodded its good to be reminded theres another world out there maybe wed see seals too if we hung around long enough or selkies even did you finish reading that book he shook his head dodging a puddle in the car park there was a cairn in front of the saab and he went to take a look at it a plaque told him it was the work of a local school and was dedicated to the brahan seer now theres a coincidence rebus said what rebus nodded towards the cairn he gets a mention in that book who was he supposedly prophesied stuff like oil rigs and the caledonian canal but he might not even have existed like sawney bean you mean exactly rebus unlocked the saab as they closed the doors after them he turned the ignition and got the heating going maybe we can just sit here for a minute clarke said sure she was wriggling the warmth back into her body and you can tell me a story what kind of story from your book i didnt finish it go on she encouraged him rebus stared out towards the water while he made up his mind theres one about a selkie actually he said eventually its supposed to have happened in the southwest on the coast outside kirkcudbright young lad there saw a creature emerge from the water and it scared him so he killed it which brought bad luck to the surrounding area the local landowner didnt like that but the villagers protected the boy they knew he was responsible rebus nodded hed owned up to his father anyway the landowner decided the whole village had to be punished he was going to starve them out the boy saw only one answer to that walked into the solway firth until the water closed over his head the curse was lifted rebus nodded again but each night his head rose above the water staring towards land eyes full of sadness hed become a selkie and he knew that if he ever came ashore again there might be another scared child waiting for him with a rock rebus paused the end and the moral of the story is he thought for a moment before shrugging does there need to be a moral actions have consequences clarke stated thats what i take from it plus therell always be people wholl cover up for the guilty rebus added reaching into his pocket for his ringing phone hazlitt clarke guessed no rebus said checking the screen and then answering what can i do for you peter it was peter bliss calling from scru just thought youd want to know thats us being put out to pasture the units for the chop effective nearasdammit immediately youll want to start clearing your desk scrus being shut down rebus explained to clarke then to bliss hows elaine taking it shes philosophical and our lord and master seems pretty confident that hes on the shortlist for the crown office job a shortlist of one if he has his way bliss chuckled at the truth of this so where are you anyway got somebody there im with siobhan clarke were up north thought as much tv cameras dont seem to be spotting you today though one bullet im happy to dodge rebus pointed through the windscreen so that clarke could share his sighting of another dolphin as it made its way towards the feeding grounds but as of right now he told bliss were actually sitting in my car watching a passing parade of dolphins at chanonry point then youre minutes away from where gregor magrath stays oh aye rosemarkie its called youve been there just the once cottage facing the beach only red door on the street i seem to recall maybe well drop by could you do that bliss paused im serious gregors always wanting to know what were up to at scru and you want me to be the one to tell him its on its last legs bit nicer than a phone call bliss argued and saves you the grief rebus countered youre a gentleman john otherwise known as an easy touch well have a night out when you get back toast the old place before it shows us the door will cowan be on the guest list what do you think peter bliss said ending the call clarke was on the lookout for more sea life might find some further up the coast rebus suggested starting the engine along with a retired detective and a cup of tea rosemarkie was only five minutes away a narrow main street a church and a pub rebus lost sight of the coastline and signalled right turning down a narrow lane until he hit the seafront a row of houses faced the water bookended by a childrens park at one end and a restaurant at the other the house with the red door was a cottage with dormer windows jutting out from its roof there was an enclosed sun porch with enough space for a single armchair the man seated there held a newspaper close to his eyes peering hard at the print there was a venerable olivegreen land rover parked next to the house and enough land for a footwide strip of weedfree garden the man eventually realised that rebus and clarke werent passersby he put his paper down and opened the door he had heft but the years had given him a stoop and slowed his movements he would be in his mid sixties his hair silver but neatly trimmed his eyes small but piercing gregor magrath rebus said thats me im john rebus this is siobhan clarke peter bliss asked us to drop by peter i was speaking to him just a few days back well he says hello rebus magrath studied him i seem to know that name he thought for a moment lothian and borders cid rebus bowed his head in acknowledgement and siobhan here is a serving di so what brings you north mind if we come in the place is a bit of a guddle i promise we wont look magrath led them inside past the front door they were immediately in a small overheated living room with a kitchenette beyond there was a patterned threepiece suite a tv and shelves filled with books and knickknacks including mementoes from magraths time on the force you live here on your own wife passed away many years back i think i remember peter telling me rebus said with a nod clarke suggested that she make them a pot of tea magrath made to help her but she told him she would manage as she busied herself at the worktop the two men sat down either side of the electric fire bills must be grim rebus commented place isnt hard to heat good glazing helps magrath slapped his hands against his knees you were telling me why youre so far from home you must have seen it on the news rebus said glancing towards the blank screen of the tv or read about it at least the missing women magrath guessed five of whom might just have turned up magrath nodded solemnly bad business he commented before calling out to clarke that the sugar was in a bowl next to the bread bin youve been living up here a while rebus said ever since i retired its a glorious location rebus had risen to his feet and crossed to the window it is that are you from here originally no just always had a soft spot for the place and hows edinburgh these days any sign of those trams getting nearer theyre still laying the tracks waste of bloody money council never seems to have had its wits about it i work at scru rebus announced turning away from the window again maybe thats why i know the name peter probably mentioned you he probably did rebus said ive just got off the phone with him he told me to let you know scrus days are numbered that crown office units taking over magraths mouth twitched doesnt really surprise me shame to lose it though magrath nodded slowly i always saw it as my legacy it meant id made a difference clarke had found a tray and was bringing everything through from the kitchen didnt see any biscuits she said if i get them in i just eat the lot magrath explained when she glanced in rebuss direction magrath knew why your colleague has broken the news he told her they drank the tea in silence for a moment then magrath asked how bliss was keeping still breathing rebus answered and every one of them sounding like his last eh rebus acknowledged the truth of this tell me something he said during your time in charge how many cases did you manage to close magrath thought for a moment just the two made progress on six more but it never got as far as a prosecution he leaned forward a little actually of those two one fell into our lap guy came forward to confess as soon as he heard wed reopened the inquiry i think it was a weight off his conscience we could do with a few more consciences in the world clarke stated that we could lass is that an old wooden truncheon rebus asked gesturing towards the bookshelves from before your time im sure rebus had walked over to the shelf in question mind if i he picked it up and felt its heft it was nicely weighted with a leather wrist strap and grooves wide enough for his fingers were barely allowed handcuffs these days he commented and pepper spray and extendable batons clarke reminded him rebus waved the truncheon in magraths direction ever use it came in handy a few times i have to admit magrath leaned back in his chair you came all this way just to tell me about scru actually clarke said we were watching the dolphins at chanonry point bliss called me rebus went on and explained we were near your place magrath smiled and nodded to himself he didnt want to be the one to break the news rebus replaced the truncheon on its shelf there were family photos there posed groupings in giltedged frames you know nina hazlitt dont you magrath seemed to take a second to place the name mother of sally hazlitt rebus prompted him she went missing from aviemore at the millennium oh yes magrath nodded again memorys not what it was he apologised shes been all over the media this past week or so rebus added shes full of praise for you magraths eyes widened why would that be because you gave her the benefit of the doubt when no one else would i listened to the womans story and looked into it yes i suppose so she heard about a woman vanishing from somewhere near strathpeffer convinced herself it might tie into her own daughters disappearance others werent nearly as helpful and she hasnt forgotten it i really dont think i did very much all im saying is dont be surprised if youre mentioned in dispatches id much rather she didnt say anything mind if i ask why because its just one more case that went nowhere magrath had risen from his armchair seeming to need the reassurance of the unchanging view from his window another in a long line of failures he said more to himself than anyone else in the room she may have been right though rebus said about the abductions i mean you have to wonder about the human race sometimes dont you magrath said with a sigh they stayed a few more minutes rebus listening as magrath told clarke about sightings of whales and explaining the difference between dolphins and porpoises the man seemed at peace in his retirement with its cottage sea views and village life it was just a pity none of it appealed to rebus when they left magrath returned to his chair on the porch giving them a wave before settling with his newspaper once again reckon the land rovers his clarke asked its the right vintage she looked at rebus something wrong not really youre lying i just think his memorys fine thats all and judging from the pile of papers by his chair he keeps up with the news so so why pretend nina hazlitts name meant nothing to him on the way back to inverness page sent clarke a text suggesting dinner you should take him up on it rebus suggested the two of you need to talk can i take you along for moral support rebus shook his head i need an early night when they arrived at northern constabulary hq however the first person he bumped into was gavin arnold cant keep you away can we arnold said shaking rebuss hand rebus introduced him to clarke giving her all the information she needed by explaining that sergeant arnold is one of the good guys arnold responded by asking if they fancied a drink later clarke told him she couldnt while rebus said hed consider it well you know where to find me eh by the dartboard rebus guessed arnold nodded and explained that like every other uniform in a fiftymile radius he had been drafted in to work on the inquiry as a result of which the building was bursting at the seams this should all be happening at burnett road he complained thats where cid is he waved a hand around him this is suits and beancounters so why base the inquiry here because of the suits and beancounters means they get to feel important as they walk past the cameras the inquiry room was certainly filled with bodies those who had been elsewhere were now gathered to listen to another of dempseys briefings dna matches were coming in and she could now name two of the victims as amy mearns and jemima salton the families are on their way here she said to be told the findings her voice was hoarse and she paused to take some water from a plastic bottle clearing her throat afterwards her face was pale and exhausted and somehow rebus knew she had to find strength for these two meetings and the emotions they would bring any questions she asked how long till we have positive ids on the other victims not long hopefully tomorrow or the day after cause of death thats still going to be hard to determine ive requested a couple more pathologists from aberdeen to speed things up what steps do we take next we continue doortodoor maybe some of the farms have cctv we can look at same with shops and garages we need to talk to everyone all the evidence collected from the field and the woods is at the lab nothing to report so far the pubic hair yes we know it doesnt belong to annette mckie dempsey nodded once we get a dna fingerprint from it ill be asking to take swabs from every male within shouting distance of edderton the officers in the room exchanged looks knowing the amount of work this would entail i know im asking a lot she said but we need to be seen to be doing our utmost yes rebus thought to himself because if nothing else it might flush the killer into the open he remembered the tactic hed suggested at scru and found himself proposing out loud that dempsey tell the media there was dna evidence even if none existed she stared him down have you considered approaching a criminal profiler maam the question came from siobhan clarke maybe to deflect attention away from rebus dempsey met her gaze im open to any sensible suggestions di clarke its just that theres been a lot of research done into what makes serial killers choose their particular disposal sites the fact is the victims came from a wide geographical area but ended up in that one spot meaning it has some significance for the perpetrator dempsey was nodding ive already fielded a few emails on the subject if anyone wants to suggest a friendly profiler who isnt going to break the bank she looked around the room or maybe di clarke could do an internet search and see what she comes up with dempseys eyes were fixed on clarke again be happy to maam good dempsey checked her watch well if there are no more questions ive got a couple of grieving families i need to prepare for there were sympathetic sounds from around the room page was pushing past a few officers in order to get to siobhan clarke where have you been he asked here and there she answered i was looking for you earlier he sounded disappointed in her i was at the end of the phone mine needs charging he muttered nobody seems to have the right adaptor did you get my text about dinner tonight shes delighted to accept rebus interrupted receiving a stern look from clarke and though id love to be there too it so happens i have other plans having said which he made his exit that evening despite best intentions rebus took a cab from the guest house to the pub he sat in the front and told the driver he never seemed to be able to find a parking space in inverness you should see it at weekends he was informed multistoreys supermarket car parks full all day place must be booming the driver gave a snort wish i could say i was seeing some of the benefits when rebus walked into the lochinver gavin arnold was lining up an outshot his dart ended up just the wrong side of the wire and he continued to shake his head as he watched his opponent end the game with double seventeen they exchanged handshakes and pats on the arm arnold saw rebus and waved him towards the bar what are you having an ipa would do the trick two please sue arnold said sue holloway smiled a greeting at rebus and got to work as they watched her pour rebus asked arnold how things were going im on doorstepping duties he replied reckon the shocks have gone on my car already the number of farm tracks ive been up and down with no result to show for it which dcs dempsey insists is a result in itself narrowing things down she calls it in a way shes right it just makes for a bloody tedious day thats all stop moaning holloway said and these are on the house as a way of saying thanks for what rebus asked trying to find the twisted bastard and stop him doing it again cheers then arnold said clinking his glass against rebuss before taking a sip how about you john any progress i seem to be surplus to requirements gavin spent half the day sightseeing culloden arnold guessed black isle actually if they widen the search any further ill end up there before long what did you think of the place i saw some dolphins did you go to culbokie arnold watched rebus shake his head nice wee pub there with a beer garden looking over the cromarty firth rebus remembered how he knew the name culbokie was where brigid young had left her mobile phone the day shed been abducted hey gav one of the other darts players called you seeing this the man meant the tv set above the door it was tuned to a news channel on the screen some people were settling themselves around a table looked like another bar this time with menus and napkins flashbulbs were going off and at one point the news camera was jostled rebus recognised frank hammell and nina hazlitt they were shaking hands as if theyd just been introduced to one another another couple were there too not looking comfortable at the amount of attention and the proximity of the cameras thats brigid youngs sister and her man arnold explained across the bottom of the screen ran the words a families meet isnt that the claymore sue holloway said looks like arnold admitted then for rebuss benefit its right across the road from here someone had gone to the door to check rebus arnold and half a dozen others decided to follow suit sure enough an outside broadcast van with a satellite dish on its roof and lots of lights moving around inside the claymore bar rebus crossed the street and peered through the window he saw the table and the four figures seated at it a man emerged from the back of the van and started setting up a tripod with a lamp at the top of it he ran a cable back to the van and plugged it in further illuminating the interior hammell glanced towards the window his narrowed eyes meeting rebuss then he turned back towards the microphones and continued with his speech rebus could see no sign of darryl christie nina hazlitt was handed a drink from a tray brigid youngs sister had her hand clamped around that of the man next to her as other gawpers closed in around him rebus retreated to the lochinver arnold was stationed in front of the tv watching proceedings someone had turned the volume up impromptu press conference he stated dempsey wont be happy what have they been saying rebus asked mr hammells complaining about a lack of effort ms hazlitt wants to be swabbed for dna and the other two seem not to know what theyve gotten into you ready for a topup my shout rebus said lifting arnolds empty glass from him and making for the bar when his phone buzzed he reckoned he knew who it would be but he turned towards the tv screen to check nina hazlitt was talking frank hammell could be seen next to her studying the screen of his own phone rebus checked the message you still here he texted back then paid for the drinks it was a further halfhour before hammell walked in the only surprise was that he had brought nina hazlitt with him this is nina hammell said john knows me hazlitt said though you might not know it from the way hes been behaving this seemed to come as news to hammell who had a twentypound note in his hand ready to attract holloways attention rebus looked around the bar everyone seemed to have recognised the visitors while pretending to mind their own business arnold was halfway through another game of darts his glance towards rebus managing to pose both question and warning same again hammell was asking hazlitt why not she said what about you rebus im fine as i am rebuss eyes were on hazlitts so how are you doing ill be better when i get some news tomorrow or the day after thats what im hearing then you know no more than we do she stated when hammell handed her a glass rebus asked him where darryl christie was back in edinburgh needs to be there for his mum shouldnt that be your job too hammell glared at him what about you boozing it up when theres a freak out there you should be catching im sure johns doing all he can hazlitt broke in might explain why hes too busy to reply to messages i saw thomas robertson rebus told hammell the man had ordered both a whisky and a pint sinking an inch of the latter before adding the former to the mix remind me he said the road worker from pitlochry rebus obliged and why bother telling me hed gone ten rounds with a battering ram hammell shrugged and took out his phone checking its screen rebus turned his attention back to nina hazlitt what was all that in aid of across the road media awareness she answered your idea or his rebus nodded towards hammell does it matter it was rebuss turn to shrug arnold was gesturing from the dartboard where he had just finished his game rebus walked over to him hell are you doing arnold hissed i cant help it if those two decide to wander in so its just coincidence arnold didnt sound convinced you sure all the tv people have packed up if this ever gets back to dempsey i wont tell if you dont rebus gave a wink and returned to the bar hammell asked him if he was finally ready for that drink rebus shook his head better be off another early start in the morning one more wont hurt nina hazlitt pressed a certain amount of pleading in her eyes rebus couldnt tell if she wanted his company for its own sake or was merely reluctant to be stuck alone with hammell hey guys the bars door was wide open someone standing there with their phone held up in front of them rebus hazlitt and hammell couldnt help turning towards the voice the young man smiled as he checked the quality of the photo hed just taken then offered a thumbsup as he backed out on to the pavement the door swinging shut after him rebus had recognised raymond dempseys journalist nephew and so had gavin arnold the two men shared a look if this ever gets back maybe a whisky rebus told hammell thats the stuff hammell replied waving towards sue holloway the tension seemed to leave hazlitts body she threw a smile in rebuss direction thanking him for staying he was in bed when he heard a knock at his door just shy of midnight according to his watch he got up and padded across the floor yes he prompted its me siobhan clarke said are you decent rebus looked around the small room give me a minute he pulled on his trousers and shirt then opened the door not interrupting anything i should be so lucky whats up seen this she was holding up her phone so he could see the screen it was a news feed from the local paper the photo from the lochinver was there along with a subheading a families thirsty for answers not subtle is he rebus commented want to tell me about it i went out for a drink hammell and hazlitt had been talking to reporters they wandered into the pub and tintin got busy with his phone clarke gave him much the same disbelieving look as gavin arnold but to get to the important stuff he added how did your meal go we were civil to one another did you tell him you resent being dumped for the chief super can we just drop it she sounded exhausted sorry rebus said ill see you at breakfast if dempseys not sent me packing by then he gestured towards clarkes phone i might not be far behind james says hes struggling to find a viable role for me hes a real charmer clarke checked the clock on her phone better get some sleep night john everythings going to work out he was telling her as he pushed the door shut he listened as she crossed the landing and headed to her own eaves bedroom a further flight up another door opened and rebus heard pages voice asking her if she was all right fine was all she said the stairs creaking as she climbed them dempsey didnt wait for them to arrive at hq her chauffeured car drew up as postbreakfast rebus page and clarke emerged from the guest house rebus already in the process of lighting a cigarette asked dempsey if he needed a blindfold to go with it what in gods name did you think you were doing she asked him i was in a pub having a quiet drink hed had time to prepare this version of the story hammell and hazlitt were across the road after theyd posed for the cameras they found themselves next to me at the bar we know each other so we said hello thats when raymond burst in and took his little paparazzi shot whats this about page asked frowning your officer dempsey told him is all over the internet thanks to your nephew rebus reminded her she ignored the jibe so what did you tell them about the investigation whats to tell im not exactly in the loop dempsey pointed at him but her eyes were on page i want him gone do you hear me loud and clear page responded dempsey was already getting back into the car her driver started pulling away thanks for backing me up there boss rebus commented go back inside page said get your stuff together and check out of your room gayfield square will pick up the tab well see you in edinburgh rebus thought of things he could say things like i was solving murders when you were in your pram he didnt though he just gave a little bow of the head in clarkes direction as if to wish her the best of british then flicked the cigarette to the ground and did as he was told when he reemerged mrs scanlon makeup immaculate as usual came with him and wished him well on the journey south page and clarke were gone rebus watched as mrs scanlon closed the door then decided on another cigarette before the off when his phone rang he considered not answering but it was gayfield square who is it he asked christine esson hiya christine if youve not already heard ill be joining you shortly any news to report way this things going the internetll know before i do i did see that photo of you with hammell and hazlitt and you thought youd call me to gloat what is there to gloat about nothing he crushed the butt of his cigarette underfoot and got into the saab would this be the day it refused to start the engine growled into life none of the dashboards warning lights came on so anyway esson was saying i said id pass on her number sorry christine i missed the start of that whose number the woman who phoned wanting to speak to you about sally hazlitt rebus rolled his eyes another sighting how much of a crank did she sound she seemed perfectly sane told me to give you her name and get you to call her rebus sighed but reached into his pocket for his notebook and pen when esson read the womans name out he stiffened then he asked her to repeat it susie mercer she obliged keeping her intonation nice and clear thats what i thought you said first time rebus told her glasgow rebus had told the woman who called herself susie mercer this has to be in person shed asked him why i need to be sure she was in glasgow a south then m west it was lunchtime before rebus arrived parking in a multistorey near the bus station and walking the short distance to buchanan street as arranged he called her again im here he said where heading down buchanan street turn left at royal exchange youll see a cafe there called thompsons sit at the counter by the window im hardly james bond material just do it or i walk so rebus did it ordered a coffee and an orange juice and sat with them staring out at the passing parade of shoppers glasgow wasnt his patch it was a sprawl compared to edinburgh as long as he stuck to a halfdozen streets he could navigate his way around outside that tight circumference hed be lost it was a good five minutes before she came in she eased herself on to the stool next to him had to be sure you werent bringing her she announced rebus studied her shed cropped her hair and bleached it then plucked her eyebrows till they almost ceased to exist but the eyes and cheekbones were still those of her mother youve gotten good at this down the years rebus said staring into the eyes of sally hazlitt not good enough she snapped back that efit was a fair likeness though no wonder you panicked he paused so do i call you sally or susie or have you already fixed on a new name she stared at him nina keeps mentioning you on the news then i saw that photo of the two of you and and she needs to be told to stop stop looking for you or stop thinking youre a murder victim her eyes remained fixed on his both why not tell her yourself she shook her head no way she said then tell me why you did it rebus lifted the coffee to his mouth first i need you to tell me something why do you think shes doing it shes your mother what other reason does she need but sally hazlitt was shaking her head again has she told you anything about what our lives were like rebus thought for a moment your mum and dad were teachers lived in london thats as much as you know crouch end she told me a nicer area than they should have been able to afford a relative left some sort of legacy he paused shes still in the same house by the way sharing with your uncle alfie at the moment your dad liked reading you stories when you were a kid he paused again maintaining eye contact you know hes dead she nodded good riddance and at last rebus thought he began to see theres lots he liked teaching me she went on meaningfully lots and lots the silence lay between them until he broke it his voice softening did you say anything to your mum at the time i didnt need to she knew thats the whole reason she wants to know if im still around because if i am i might spill the beans she was looking down at the floor eyes glistening why wait till aviemore to make your move it took her a moment to gather herself again i knew i didnt want to study english at university that had always been his idea and the more we all sat around the chalet in aviemore talking about the future the more i knew i couldnt tell him to his face rebus nodded his understanding hed stopped by that time stopped when i was fourteen she cleared her throat sounds crazy but i thought back then it must be my fault and that made it worse somehow id spent the years since thinking how to punish him and that night december st i had just enough dutch courage in me or gin at any rate the whole thing felt so much easier being in a strange place hundreds of miles away from them but once you found out he was dead too late by then i knew i wasnt going back it cant be much fun always living in fear of being recognised thats why you need to tell her to stop im alive and im fine and i never want to see her or talk to her again itd be a lot easier if you told her yourself not for me it wouldnt she slid from the stool and stood in front of him so will you do it rebus puffed out his cheeks youre sure this is the life you want its what ive got she gave a shrug plenty of others out there worse off than me you should know that rebus thought for a moment then nodded his agreement thanks she said managing a sliver of a smile rebus tried to think what else to say but she was already at the door once outside however she hesitated then came back in something else youve got wrong i dont have an uncle alfie or an uncle anything come to that she pulled open the door and left the cafe again striding away with her bag slung over her shoulder head held high until the ranks of pedestrians swallowed her up and she was gone rebus took out his phone adding her mobile number to his contacts list she would probably change it just as she would slip into a new identity gifting herself a different past he couldnt help but see it as a waste of a life but then the life was hers to waste with her number safely stowed he slipped the phone back into his pocket and ran his hands down his cheeks as he replayed the meeting theres lots he liked teaching me i might still spill the beans i dont have an uncle alfie or an uncle anything come to that so who the hell is alfie rebus asked himself staring at his reflection in the window part five smell of blood is everywhere even in stone rebus walked into the scru office at fettes hq and saw that the packing crates had arrived peter bliss and elaine robison were busy with labels and inventories come to give us a hand robison pleaded this lot going to the crown office he asked prodding one of the boxes with his toe thats right bliss said and itll all be in a damned sight better order than when it first arrived dont worry robison added weve left one or two for you didnt want you to feel you were missing out wheres danny boy another meeting with the bigwigs hes going to get the job isnt he looks like bliss conceded hell be insufferable rebus commented wont be our problem though will it well be reduced to daytime tv and cold callers in place of cold cases robison added with a smile though i might manage a wee holiday back to australia first she picked up the photo of the sydney harbour bridge from her desk and kissed it then to rebus we were thinking next friday for a meal and a drink rebus moved one of the empty crates from his chair and sat down at his desk ill have to check my diary he said how was inverness tv made it look like a bit of a circus nothing the media likes more than a new sawney bean to scare us with who cannibal probably mythical did you call in on gregor magrath bliss asked rebus nodded and i passed along the news how did he take it philosophically picked a nice spot for himself up there hasnt he might be all right on a calm day bliss chuckled aye before he retired gregor was always chasing the sun him and margaret used to come back from tenerife brown as berries margaret was his wife rebus guessed remembering the photos on the bookcase when did she die couple of years before he took retirement bloody shame he used to bring cruise brochures in tell everyone where he and margaret were going to go when he got the gold watch hows he keeping seems fine you didnt work here when nina hazlitt met him did you dont think so hed have mentioned her it would have been just before my time then he never discussed her with you bliss shook his head someone rapped their knuckles against the open door rebus looked up and saw malcolm fox standing there can we have a word fox asked if you must rebus responded maybe along the corridor rebus followed him to the complaints lair fox punched in the code for the lock making sure to shield the combination from the visitor the room was much the same size as scru with an almost identical layout desks and laptops and a window with a view on to fettes avenue there was another suit waiting for them he was foxs age but wirier with ancient acne scars on one cheek rebus got the feeling this man would happily play bad cop to foxs good or vice versa fox introduced him as tony kaye then asked rebus to take a seat im fine standing fox gave a shrug then eased his backside on to the corner of tony kayes desk thought you might still have been up north fox said thats why i phoned inverness first only to be told youd been given the heaveho his eyes drilled into rebuss mind telling me why i was showing them up as amateurs you know how prickly other forces get when that happens so it had nothing to do with frank hammell then why should it that photo of you and him enjoying a friendly drink tony kaye suggested just a coincidence dont take us for mugs rebus switched his attention to fox waiting for the man to speak morris gerald cafferty fox obliged and now francis hammell you dont half pick your friends rebus theyre as much my friends as you are funny that said kaye because weve not been to any pubs with you while youve been spotted drinking with both of them rebus kept his eyes on fox were wasting each others time here scrus being wound up i hear thats you off the force again fox paused unless youre serious about reapplying being a civilian suddenly has its merits rebus said turning and heading for the door means i dont have to listen to you and your shit enjoy the rest of your life rebus kaye called out to him whats left of it that is when he got home that evening a note had been pushed under his door he unfolded it it was from mgc morris gerald cafferty and it was just to let rebus know how disappointed cafferty was in him for consorting with scum like frank hammell the word scum underlined three times for emphasis rebus scooped up the rest of the mail and went into the living room it felt stuffy so he prised open one of the sash windows then turned up the radiator to compensate the hifis turntable had been left switched on rotating lazily rebus added a bert jansch album and lowered the stylus on to the vinyl then he started charging his phone before heading to the bedroom and emptying his overnight bag filling a couple of polythene carriers with laundry it would be another hour before the nearest launderette closed so he decided to drop the stuff off and collect some food on the way home leaving his phone behind and lifting the tonearm from the record he locked the flat and walked down the two flights of stairs yes i know he apologised to the saab as he approached it hed just tossed the laundry on to the back seat when he heard someone call his name tensing he turned and saw darryl christie getting out of a black mercedes mclass the driver stayed behind the steering wheel but lowered his window the better to keep a close eye on proceedings rebus recognised him as the lippy doorman from jojo binkies marcus or something like that hello darryl rebus said resting his back against the saab is it worth me asking how you come to know where i live this is the information age if you hadnt noticed hows your mum doing and the rest of the family theres a funeral needs planning theres also a friend of your mothers who needs calming down you think im bothered about him i think youve got a head on your shoulders in a lot of ways youre smarter than frank hammell someone needs to bring him back from inverness tomorrow christie stated he was dressed in the same dark suit with a fresh white shirt but no tie he slipped his hands into his trouser pockets and studied rebus frank says you might be okay im flattered despite being caffertys man im not doesnt matter franks wondering if you might keep your ears open on behalf of the family oh any names that come into the frame all wed need is a head start frank wants his hands on them before they can be brought into custody christie nodded slowly but i dont want that to happen no things could get messy afterwards and i dont want my mum being more upset than she already is frank hammell has a pretty good track record darryl if he gets hold of someone theres not going to be a trace of them afterwards not for a long time this is different ive not seen him lose it the way hes been doing it was rebuss turn to study the young man in front of him you really are smarter arent you im just a bit more rational at this point in time plus itll put my job on the line if he does something stupid its more than that though id say youre canny by nature my bet is you kept your head down in school did well in exams but always watchful learning how things are and what makes people tick darryl christie offered a shrug of the shoulders when he removed his hands from his pockets he was holding a card in one ive got lots of phones he said if you ring this number ill know its you you really think im going to hand over whoever did this a name and an address thats all he looked through the windows of the saab at the carrier bags on the rear seat you never know there might be the price of a washing machine in it rebus watched him turn and head back to the merc no swagger to the walk just an easy confidence the drivers eyes were on rebus as if daring him to go against christies wishes whatever those wishes might be rebus managed a wink as the window began to slide up then got into the front seat of the saab and started the engine by the time hed reversed out of his parking space and reached the junction at the foot of arden street the merc was nowhere to be seen the guy in the launderette told him it might be a couple of days rebus remonstrated that he didnt have a couple of days to which the owner responded by waving his arms in the direction of the backlog of service washes way things are he said id almost pay you to load the machine yourself on the way back to the flat it was a threeway contest between fish and chips indian and chinese indian won and rebus stopped at patakas ordering a rogan josh and saying he would wait he was offered a lager but turned it down the place was doing good business the booths filled with couples sharing platters of food and bottles of chilled wine there were three or four pubs within a twominute walk but rebus flicked through that days evening news instead by the time hed finished his food was ready he drove back to arden street with maggie bell playing on the radio he wondered if she was still going strong his kitchen filled with aromas as he opened the containers scooping out the meat sauce and rice on to a plate there were beers in the cupboard so he opened one and added it to the tray which he carried through to the dining table the living room felt a bit better so he closed the window again and put the bert jansch album back on his phone sounded letting him know he had a message he decided it could wait a couple of minutes later it issued another reminder and this time he got up to check the screen one missed call one voicemail it was nina hazlitt guess where i am she was saying they met at an oldfashioned bar behind the railway station she was booked on to the sleeper service down to london a couple of hours still to kill before boarding she was seated at the bar when he arrived the pint shed bought him had been there some time and had gone flat rebus said it would be fine anyway i thought youd still be in inverness she told him surplus to requirements theyve identified all the bodies now he nodded and took a sip of beer no sign of sally she went on lowering her eyes meaning shes unconnected to the case he offered but she has to be wasnt i the first person to see it the barman cast a warning look towards them this wasnt a place for raised voices rebus noticed that the couple at the table next to the window were readying to leave he picked up his own glass and nina hazlitts suitcase after a moment she followed him carrying her vodka and tonic when they were settled she waited for him to meet her gaze her eyes were bloodshot her face sallow and taut lacking sleep and answers what did you think of frank hammell rebus asked he seems very caring hes a gangster thats certainly what the papers imply hes not someone you want in your life hes not in my life the two of you looked pretty cosy in inverness which one of you arranged that bit of filming what does it matter just trying to get things straight in my head i dont see that its any of your concern john maybe not he paused what about the other guy i suppose hes none of my business either she gave a sigh which guy are we talking about now the one who lives with you is his name really alfie i told you hes my brother you dont have any brothers nina her mouth opened a little he watched as colour flooded her cheeks what makes you say that she was eventually able to ask im a cop were good at finding stuff out rebus paused so who is he he lives with me rebus nodded slowly why did you lie i dont know did you reckon your feminine charms wouldnt work on me if there was someone else in the picture she had lowered her eyes again her hands had dropped into her lap resting there palms up perhaps she conceded quietly plus the grieving mother probably plays better with the media if there isnt somebody else waiting at home john he gestured for her not to go on he wasnt even halfway down the pint but knew he was going to leave it his stomach felt queasy filled with undigested meat and swelling rice he rose to his feet nina hazlitt didnt move she seemed fascinated by her hands or maybe it was just that the pose had worked for her in the past rebus rested his knuckles against the edge of the small table and leaned down towards her lowering his voice she doesnt want to see you he told her but for what its worth i dont think shes got any intention of telling the world about her father nina hazlitt flinched her head jerking up where is she she said rebus shook his head as he straightened up youve seen her he was turning away towards the door she was on her feet now im begging you she called out i just want to say sorry thats all will you tell her im sorry john will you tell her but rebus had pulled open the door leaving her world well and truly behind him during the drive back to his flat he expected any number of calls or messages but none came once hed parked his car he took out his phone and found the number for sally hazlitts mobile he tapped in a text she says sorry and sent it unsure if it would ever find a reader after bert jansch it was the turn of the stones and after that some gerry rafferty rebus had emptied a fair amount of highland park into himself and didnt know if it made him feel better or worse he had taken the nylon plectrum from his pocket the one made all those years ago by jim dunlops company and was rubbing it between his fingers while he did some thinking about nina hazlitt had he told her the truth out of simple spite would it have been better to leave it unsaid hed almost called his own daughter just to hear her voice for five minutes but it was too late in the day five families able finally to grieve properly but with accompanying horror five victims plucked from the world stripped and buried was their killer keeping his trophies his store of clothing purses phones rebus really hoped so he knew that dempsey would make an appeal at her next press conference it would be based on detailed descriptions of the womens belongings when theyd disappeared he wondered if dempsey was married she didnt wear a ring but that was hardly conclusive these days maybe she had children rebuss phone was on the arm of the chair and he kept checking it wondering if he could maybe call siobhan clarke just to tell her about his evening instead he flipped the vinyl to side two turned the volume down a shade and trickled a final measure of malt into his glass the tv was playing silently a news channel the a story had lost its top billing to a new political crisis in europe there was a fresh interview with frank hammell but they only played half a minute of it already he was losing his novelty when they cut back to the studio a still frame of hammell from the edderton cordon was behind the newscasters shoulder hammells eyes bulged flecks of saliva either side of his open mouth finger stabbing at the viewer as if ready to gouge out an eye if a suspect ever did come to light only to go missing hammell would get both blame and acclamation rebus was trying to work hammell out was he so fiery because it was in his nature or was he trying to impress annettes mother did he maybe just like all the media attention the other families had learned stoicism or had come to embrace defeat not frank hammell even though he wasnt family not family trailing annette arguing with her but not family rebus considered this as he finished what was in his glass and decided against another instead he made tea and used it to wash down a couple of paracetamol after which despite the lateness of the hour he called frank hammell an automated female voice told him the number had not been recognised he checked and tried again same result so he took darryl christies card from his pocket and punched that number into his phone already christie said answering straight away i need to speak to hammell i thought i had a number for him he changes it every few weeks hes worried your lot might be tapping him is it anything i can help with no care to give me a clue rebus could hear soft music in the background as far as he knew darryl still lived at home maybe he was in his bedroom its nothing important rebus said do you always call people at midnight with stuff that isnt important christ this kid was sharp sorry to bother you rebus said readying to end the call but christie told him to wait he seemed to be weighing something up rebus heard sounds of glasses and coughing some sort of bar or club but nowhere busy the music sounded recorded is that jazz rebus asked you like jazz not hugely and id have thought you were about three decades too young for it got a pen on you yes christie recited hammells new number which rebus added to the back of the card before thanking him ill let you in on the secret of jazz the young man said if you like go on then its all about control when the music died rebus realised that christie had ended the call he stared at the number jotted on the card suddenly unwilling to talk to hammell he would sleep on it after adding the number to the list of contacts on his phone there was an inch and a half of whisky left in the bottle he decided to leave it there and call it a moral victory its all about control he said to himself sliding the guitar pick back into his pocket and heading for bed rebus was leaving the house next morning when a horn sounded hammell was beckoning to him from the white range rover sport rebus crossed the road as hammell wound the driversside window down i need to change addresses rebus complained seems every bugger in creation knows where i live when did you get back middle of the night didnt seem to be any point sticking around hammell hadnt shaved for a couple of days and hadnt had much sleep either darryl seemed to think youd be calling me i was planning to well here i am here you are rebus couldnt help but agree hammell was waiting for more rebus looked up and down the empty street phone might be better though why less chance of you being tried for assault hammells eyes narrowed still further maybe you should just spit it out rebus considered his options okay then he said leaning in towards the open window and lowering his voice is annette mckie your daughter the car door swung out suddenly catching rebus a glancing blow as he backed away by the time hammell got out rebus had put some distance between them they stood in the middle of the road twelve feet apart hell are you saying hammell snarled sure you want to do this here frank rebus indicated the dozens of tenement windows either side of them shes fifteen years old hammell went on taking a couple of steps towards rebus fists bunched you saying i was doing her mum behind dereks back im saying youre acting like a parent tailing her keeping tabs on her giving her money and then having fights about how she spends it and who she sees and if thats not the case which its not hammell spat then theres another scenario we need to discount and whats that hammells eyes were huge and he was breathing heavily as if pumping himself up for combat theres forensic evidence frank a pubic hair that doesnt belong to annette once the lab get a dna profile theyre going to match it against her sexual history they want to know if it belongs to whoever killed her or just someone shed been seeing rebus had backed away a couple of steps but hammell was no longer moving so i have to ask frank were you and annette an item because if you were then theres a good chance of that dna coming straight back to you and meantime the team will have been tied up on a wild goose chase giving the real killer more time to cover his tracks youre asking if i was sleeping with my girlfriends daughter rebus didnt say anything is that what youre asking hammell persisted when rebus stayed silent he launched himself forward his whole weight landing on rebus both men hitting the ground rebus felt all the air being punched out of his body hammell was trying to gain some purchase rebus rolling so he could dislodge his attacker a delivery van had entered the street but stopped dead its driver emerging to watch rebus gave hammell a shove and started getting to his feet but hammells foot caught him in the ribs and he went down again grazing his knuckles against the tarmac you piece of hammell didnt get the chance to finish the sentence his groin was just the right height for a headbutt and that was what rebus delivered hammell gasped and pitched forward rebus grabbing him by the hair and pulling him down until his face met the road surface the van driver had made tentative progress towards the two men you need to break it up he cautioned somebodys going to be calling the police rebus was on his feet heart racing head pounding from where it had made contact with the ground when he inhaled his ribs complained hammell was on hands and knees spitting dribbles of blood from his mouth rebus made sure there was distance between them and waited for the man to get up hammells face was almost purple bits of grit stuck to it lost a fucking filling he said wiping a string of blood and saliva from his chin rebus waved the van driver away without taking his eyes off his opponent probably one of my balls as well hammell stared hard at rebus dirty bastard of a fighter arent you only way i was going to stop you frank rebus said are we ready to talk now or what hammell had a finger hooked into his mouth checking the damage he gave a slow nod come up to mine then you can have a wash and a cleanup rebus led the way out of breath by the time he reached his landing his hand was shaking so much it took several attempts to retrieve his door key from his pocket and fit it into the lock bathrooms through there he said the door closed and he heard the tap being turned in the kitchen he switched the kettle on before checking the back of his head for a cut that wasnt there he removed his jacket and unbuttoned his shirt his ribs were sore when he touched them and thered be bruising later he just hoped he hadnt cracked one his shoes had been scraped by contact with the tarmac but there was no obvious damage to his suit he placed his hands under the cold tap and felt the immediate sting as he rinsed them clean he had buttoned his shirt again and tucked it in by the time the kettle boiled he made two mugs of black coffee and carried them through to the living room when hammell arrived rebus was seated at the dining table sugar he asked hammell shook his head and sat down pretending to study the room so he wouldnt have to meet rebuss eyes there were nicks and abrasions on his face but nothing too dramatic im sorry rebus said but someone would have asked eventually hammell nodded slowly he saw that rebus had extended a hand across the table with no great enthusiasm he took it and the two men shook my balls are nipping hammell confessed rebus repeated his apology and the two men started on their drinks the bottle of highland park was over by the armchair still containing a couple of good measures but rebus didnt offer and hammell didnt ask they can really get dna from a pube hammell enquired eventually rebus nodded well hammell cleared his throat i suppose it could belong to me he waited for rebus to say something but rebus was blowing across the surface of his coffee no judgement forthcoming hammell seemed to relax slightly things happen you know youre not always as in control as you think did the two of you manage to keep it under wraps would gail still be seeing me otherwise rebus thought fleetingly of nina and sally hazlitt of families and the secrets they succeeded in keeping from the world what about darryl hammell shook his head so what happens now he asked does this all have to come out not the way you think rebus considered for a moment a dna swab takes seconds it can be done in private if theres a match with the hair it can be ruled out as evidence and the team can focus their attention elsewhere unless they decide to pin all five on me of course hammells eyes were on rebus now your pal cafferty would love that not going to happen rebus stated you really think this isnt going to get out we both know what cop shops are like was it a longstanding arrangement you and annette hammell glowered at him mind your own fucking business she wasnt pregnant was she what she felt sick on the bus hammell shook his head the landline started ringing but rebus ignored it could be important hammell said its a prerecorded message about a missold payment protection plan that i never had in the first place thats detective work right there hammell said theyre the only people who ever bother to call as the ringing stopped hammell broke into a grim smile this is all going to turn to shit he commented yet somehow i cant bring myself to loathe your guts he started to get to his feet ill have a word with di clarke rebus told him ask her to pass the message to dcs dempsey direct the swab can be done somewhere private doesnt have to be a police station hammell studied him why would you want to help he asked im a public servant mr hammell and you whether i like it or not are the public rebus rose from his chair and the two men shook again ill have the beating of you next time mind hammell stated i dont doubt that rebus agreed showing him to the door you know what police stations are like siobhan clarke advised she was still in inverness rebus was standing next to his car parked in the police bay outside gayfield square phone pressed to his ear thats what hammell himself said its why youre the only one im telling and why you should take it straight to dempsey even so she sounded sceptical and its not as though we owe frank hammell anything its not just him though is it havent annettes family got enough on their plates i suppose well then rebus watched as a traffic warden approached the man studied the sign on the saabs dashboard and kept walking thing is though clarke was saying if james finds out i went behind his back no reason why he should whats to stop dempsey telling him youll ask her not to its not like she wont owe you think how much of the budget shed have wasted getting dna from every bloke up there rebus listened to her sigh hows everything else he asked whole community around eddertons been questioned no lightbulb moments to report hints of anyone protecting a nearest and dearest nothing and the search hasnt turned up a damned thing i get the feeling dempseys going to give james and me our ticket home today best talk to her quick then in person rather than on the phone im looking forward to seeing edinburgh again its been pining for you believe me its crying on my shoulder as i speak rebus arched his face towards the rain it was only a shower the sky to the west brightening already so what are you up to today she asked him clearing my desk in your office quickly followed by the desk in my office and thats it game over especially if the complaints have their way youve done so much on this case john someone needs to tell them that im sure my fan clubs queuing up with testimonials he paused so youll talk to dempsey shes bound to ask me how i know information received she wont like that not much she can do about it youre coming home soon ive ordered balloons and everything come to think of it ive got to brief her anyway serial killers and their disposal sites did you dig up anything from the trusty internet only that theres usually a reason the most basic being that its in the vicinity of where they live or to put it another way their spatial behaviour is empirically modelled i preferred your first answer thought you might when theyd finished speaking he headed upstairs the office felt a bit like limbo with page and clarke absent and the case hijacked by dempsey and her team no one really had anything to do plenty of hard work no real sense of achievement glad to see you so idle rebus said because i need a hand shifting all these boxes in the end esson and ogilvie helped take everything down to the saab esson asked if the files were heading to inverness he told her he didnt know and she suggested they be kept at gayfield square just in case if im not staying here neither are they rebus explained to her afterwards they celebrated with mugs of tea and hot water and the remnants of a packet of bourbons no new marvels to report from that computer of yours rebus asked esson she shook her head taking tiny nibbles of her biscuit while ogilvie dunked his in his tea before sucking the life from it best put your feet up while you can then rebus went on looks like page might be back here by days end and youre headed back to fettes ogilvie asked not for long scrus been earmarked for closure so whatll you do the question had come from esson rebus made show of shrugging his shoulders carpet bowls maybe antiques roadshow reruns when she grinned it made her look younger than ever been good working with the pair of you though rebus conceded taking a last look around the office and gracing everyone with a wave as he made his exit at the top of the stairs he stopped and watched dave ormiston climb towards him reading from a sheaf of papers ormiston spotted him and managed a thin smile is this me getting my desk back he asked rebus nodded slowly ill say goodbye then ormistons hand was out but rebus refused to take it and the man stiffened heres the thing rebus said all that nosiness of yours on the phone it got me thinking about big ger cafferty oh aye see cafferty knew about that cctv from the bus station when there was no way he should have its an open secret hes a pal of yours but you and i know differently dont we dave we know hes got someone in his pocket someone based right here rebus leaned in towards ormiston until their faces were only a couple of inches apart time you stopped being so chatty or i might have to gather up a few brownie points from the complaints ever seen them in action dave theyll go through your phone and computer theyll look at your spending habits theyll find stuff and thatll be the big cheeriebye to your pension rebus paused fair warning walk away from cafferty and keep walking back at the saab rebus reached across the dashboard and lifted the police official business sign he started up the steps readying to hand it back at the front desk then he paused after all no one had requested it had they he had only driven fifty or so yards in the direction of broughton street when his phone buzzed it was siobhan clarke problem with dempsey he guessed lifting the phone to his ear are you near a television no he looked to left and right plenty of pubs he could dart into ill try for a screengrab then give me two minutes the phone went dead rebus pulled over slipped the sign back into place on the dashboard and walked into the nearest watering hole when the barman asked what he could do for him rebus told him he could change channels for a start sky or bbc news he guessed there were no customers to complain so the man did as he was told when the bbc turned out to be focusing on a story about afghanistan he switched to sky where a reporter was interviewing jim mellon the farmer from edderton but they were already cutting back to the studio and rebus hadnt even caught the headline he got on his phone and told clarke what hed seen ive sent you a photo she said g here so it might take a while has there been a break a break no theyre just talking to the farmer for want of anybody more interesting half the news teams have already skedaddled back to wherever they came from call me when the picture gets there cant you just tell me might be nothing she paused probably is the phone went dead again and rebus stared at the screen willing clarkes message to arrive the barman asked if he wanted a drink while he waited half of ipa then rebus obliged it was poured presented to him paid for and demolished before his phone let him know he had one new message when he opened it he was looking at the scene from the tv interview newscaster plus mellon they were in the farmyard and close behind them stood a small white van with a name on the side in thick black capitals magrath rebus called clarke back well he asked reckon its coincidence not such an unusual surname actually it is spelled that way i just checked the local phone book you think gregor magrath runs some sort of business google to the rescue theres just one magraths within about fifty miles an electrician based in rosemarkie rebus was thoughtful did he act like an electrician to you seemed more your typical pensioner and the van wasnt there either was it its probably nothing rebus told her then have you had a chance to speak to dempsey yet not quite but shes in the building somewhere and you reckon youll be back down here tonight want to meet for a drink not a session mind just a drink absolutely ill call you im happy to bow out if page makes a counteroffer goodbye john he smiled at the phone and dropped it back into his pocket the barman was standing behind the ipa pump ready to offer a refill but rebus shook his head and left the pub at scru bliss and robison helped him empty the car robison asking the same question esson had were the files going to inverness quite possibly was all he said in reply at the very moment they deposited the last box on the floor and stood up to wipe the sweat from their eyes and get their breathing back to normal daniel cowan walked in from some meeting or other looking both more dapper and more generally pleased with himself than ever im not one to criticise he told them but isnt our strategy to empty this office rather than fill it the a case rebus informed him cowan looked suddenly interested and even ran a finger along the edge of the topmost box the a was a real investigation current live and in the news there was a momentary longing in cowans eyes he wanted it and could not have it moreover if he took on a role at the crown office cold case unit he might never work a contemporary inquiry again i was just going to treat the troops to a kit kat in the canteen rebus said im not invited cowan asked i thought youd want to stay put and make the phone call cowan looked at him what phone call to inverness letting them know the files are here when they want them cowans eyes brightened yes i suppose it should be me that does that shouldnt it well see you later then rebus said leading bliss and robison from the room once they were settled at a table rebus asked bliss about gregor magraths electrical skills he could change a light bulb bliss said not sure id trust him to wire a plug rebus explained about the van has he got any relatives up there none that i know of hed have said wouldnt he i mean the two of you have kept in touch youve been to his house on the other hand it might explain why he headed north rather than retiring somewhere with a bit of sun suppose so robison bit into her apple having turned down rebuss offer of biscuits or crisps could just be someone with the same surname she offered between chews could be rebus agreed meantime she went on while the three of us are here maybe we could decide where we want to go for our night out that evening rebus met siobhan clarke at the oxford bar they took a table in the back room and rebus asked her if there was any more news from inverness the wheels are grinding she told him more conscripts have been drafted in dempseys widening the search area locals are queuing up to help along with a full complement of hunky firefighters rebus thought back to the original misper cases lots of legwork most of it so there could be no accusation of slacking thing is he cautioned one of those locals could be hiding something she knows that every team of civvies has one of our lot attached with orders to watch out for anyone acting nervous or odd and all this in the hope of finding clothes and belongings they have to be somewhere rebus nodded slowly and asked her if shed spoken to dempsey clarke nodded back lifting her drink i could see she wanted to ask me why i hadnt taken it to my boss but she didnt just said shed arrange for hammell to be swabbed how did she react when you told her annette and hammell had been lovers a slight raising of the eyebrows and your source remains confidential clarke paused theres always a chance the hair wont belong to hammell in which case it becomes useful again rebus agreed she took another sip of her drink by the way i phoned that electricians no answer still reckon its a coincidence peter bliss has stayed in touch with gregor magrath doesnt see him as a sparky and isnt aware of any relatives in the area he thought for a moment then reached for his phone who are you calling jim mellon just remembered ive got his number here it was mellons wife who answered her husband was in one of the barns and wouldnt be back for a while rebus gave her his number and asked if mellon could phone him back nothing i can help you with then she enquired actually maybe you can its just that mr mellon was on tv earlier hes getting too much of a taste for it if you ask me i was wondering about a van i saw parked in the farmyard behind him it had the name magrath on the side i think it belongs to an electrician kenny magrath she stated kenny magrath rebus repeated for clarkes benefit lives in rosemarkie does he thats right its just that i know another magrath in rosemarkie name of gregor might be the brother the brother rebuss eyes were on clarke as he spoke im sure kennys mentioned a brother that must be it rebus said do you still want jim to phone you i dont think thatll be necessary youve been a great help mrs mellon rebus ended the call eyes still fixed on siobhan clarke so she said so gregor magrath retires and buys a place up north despite the fact that he and his wife were always after holidays in the sun making the black isle an odd choice unless he has family there which he does but how come he never mentions as much to peter bliss even when bliss visited the brother never cropped up maybe theyd had a fallingout somewhere down the line its not unknown in families but there were photos on the wall unit a mum and dad with a couple of young kids plus the same kids after theyd grown a bit that has to have been the brother and his family not necessarily ive always loved that positive attitude of yours that used to be my line she paused then asked him what he reckoned it all meant im not sure worth another word in dempseys ear he gave a shrug and concentrated on his beer clarke checked the time on her phone a quick one rebus suggested got a home life waiting for me she said with a shake of the head meaning post to open bills to pay washing to do he nodded his understanding and glanced at his watch hed left it too late to collect his own laundry well catch up again soon he said she had risen to her feet and extended her right hand towards him rebus took it and they shook though it felt wrong too formal was it her way of saying that their time together was done before he could ask she was gone just you and me eh he said to his pint glass same as it ever was then he leaned back and focused his attention on the wall opposite thinking some more about gregor magrath and families and secrets it was mid evening at jojo binkies frank hammell had gone to see his dentist earlier for some repair work nobody had dared to ask him about the cuts on his face he was watching from the balcony as the dj twitched and danced behind his decks not that the man played records it was all cds mps and laptops the music wasnt to hammells taste but darryl was after a younger crowd a crowd less careful with its money the place was hipper these days and people came from all over sometimes in coaches from out west or fife or the borders a few dozen dancers gyrated below hammell checked out the talent there was one skinny blonde he could almost see down the front of her short lowcut dress almost a couple of staffers patrolled the periphery on the lookout for trouble hammell didnt know their names they were new almost everybody was new darryl had explained people not turning up on time people badmouthing hammell behind his back they had to be replaced people too old to handle the job people who didnt pull their weight tonight as hammell had walked into his own club he hadnt recognised a single person working the door even rob the reliable had gone awol it was the same with the staff at his pubs out with the old and in with the new darryl called it refreshing the brand still there was money coming in no mean feat in a recession as darryl himself had suggested and thanks to some creative accounting not all of it went out again hammell ran his tongue over the replacement filling it didnt seem quite smooth but he liked the coarseness he felt movement next to him and turned to see darryl himself standing there hammell patted the young mans upper arm in greeting not a bad crowd for a week night he said over the music itll get busier darryl stated he was in another newlooking suit dark with a palegreen shirt beneath wheres rob tonight darryl turned his attention from the dancers to his employer i had to let him go he said hammell lifted an eyebrow what happened nothing happened but with you up north it made it easier for me to tell him to take a walk he got a bit of money same as the others he was a good guy he was your guy frank that was robs problem christie gestured towards the dance floor now its all my guys hammell pulled back his shoulders and bunched his fists what the fucks going on darryl christie answered with a cold smile youre out frank thats whats going on ive got some paperwork arriving from your lawyer now my lawyer too youre going to sell me your entire business for one pound sterling you little shit bag get your arse out of here hammell was standing toe to toe with him flecks of saliva flying from his mouth after all ive done for you ungrateful wee bastard he jerked a thumb towards the stairwell go on before i rip your head from your fucking neck look again christie said calmly hammell looked and saw three men appearing at the top of the stairs doormen men whose names and faces he didnt know darryl christies men ive got everything christie went on his voice still icy calm passwords account details everything the offshore banks the numbers you dont think anyone knows about it did for al capone and itll do for you taxmanll have a field day whats your mum going to say not one damned thing because youre not going near her again youre steering clear of my family from now on christie paused unless you want me to tell her about you and my sister hammells face froze it was annette who told me christie went on thats how she was no way she could keep it to herself i nearly whacked you over the back of the head for that that and everything else theres not a chance in hell of me signing anything then a memory stick arrives at hmrc sometime tomorrow not even enough time for you to leave the country not when ive got your passport in the same safe place as everything else the three doormen were standing behind hammell awaiting orders when hammell made his move they grabbed him by the shoulders stopping him from getting to their employer i made you who you are hammell growled trying to wrestle free gave you a job took you to my house and pretty soon ill have a house just like it christie said but therell always be a difference between us hammell glared at him what he couldnt help asking christie leaned closer i wont trust anyone he confided gesturing for the doormen to take hammell to the office im signing fuck all hammell called out as he was led away but he would sign darryl was sure of it he rested his forearms on the balcony as he entered the text into his phone it was to his father and the message was succinct all done and dusted even though he knew that wasnt quite the case having managed a broken nights sleep rebus arrived at the fettes hq car park to find it half empty the sky wasnt fully light yet street lamps still burning he locked his car and entered the building the main reception was manned by the same officer whod called up to scru that first day to tell him there was a visitor downstairs for di magrath another member of the team might have answered or rebus could have been on a cigarette break and everything would have been different he took the stairs rather than the lift every little bit helped as his doctor had told him at his last checkup even so he needed the help of the banister and a breather at the halfway stage the corridor was deserted as were the offices he passed he opened the door to scru and stood on the threshold the place was frozen in time halffilled crates waste bin emptied by a cleaner and waiting to be used again marker pens and paper clips mugs needing to be rinsed at his desk he found a clean sheet of paper dated it and jotted down the barest details of his meeting with sally hazlitt then he signed it and opened her case file clipping it to the inside front cover cowans desk he noticed was as tidy as ever just in case any of the brass decided to drop by there was a stapler with the name cowan on it cowan had purchased it himself after each and every one of its predecessors had gone missing rebus lifted it from the desk and pocketed it same as with the others then headed out of the office and back down the stairs it wasnt a bad day for a drive and he wasnt in the mood for stopping hed filled the saab on his way to fettes and knew it was good for the trip north he promised himself he would book the old warhorse in for a full service and valeting when this was all finished a little reward for its efforts drumming his fingers against the steering wheel nazareth on the cd player rebus drove he wasnt really thinking about anything other than the journey and its punctuations the moment a particular section of dual carriageway ended the passing of landmarks such as the pitlochry roadworks and house of bruar familiar signposts pointing him to places he would most likely never visit such as the waltzing waters and killiecrankie there was still a good covering of snow on most of the hills sheep continued to graze inured to the passing parade of trucks vans and cars rebus remembered siobhan clarkes words as they drove towards chanonry point its an odd little country this hard to fathom shed accused him of coming over all defensive well it was a natural enough reaction but in fact he agreed with her a nation of five million huddled together as if cowed by the elements and the immensity of the landscape surrounding them clinging to notions of community and shared history some of them identified or hinted at in the book of legends nina hazlitt had given him even bogeymen were useful because if there was a them there was also an us and if there was a them there was someone to blame aviemore inverness kessock bridge then munlochy avoch fortrose arriving finally at his destination the row of houses fronting the coastline at rosemarkie there was no sign of gregor magrath in the sun porch the venerable olivegreen land rover was parked in the same spot as before rebus knocked on the door of the cottage and waited when there was no answer he peered in through the living room window noting no movement within he could just about make out the framed photos on the bookcase straightening up he fought the elements to get a cigarette lit then stood beside his cooling saab gazing towards the distant shore a dog was barking on the beach way over to rebuss right its owner lagging many dozens of yards behind there was a figure by the waters edge rebus shielded his eyes and watched as the man continued to trudge along the tide line not bothering to lock the car he headed in the same direction the wind flinging granules into his face mr magrath he called magrath turned towards him but then seemed to dismiss him he had his back to rebus when rebus called his name a second time you again magrath sounded irritated he was digging the toe of one shoe into the wet sand watching each new indentation fill with seawater whats the matter rebus asked cant bear to look me in the eye magrath accepted the challenge the two men standing in silence for a moment how come nobody knows about your brother rebus enquired dropping his voice kenny everybody knows kenny rebus nodded up here maybe but all the times youve spoken to peter bliss on the phone and all the years you were at scru and when bliss visited you and i came to your house that last time magrath had broken off eye contact his interest shifting back to the beach beneath his feet he opened his mouth but said nothing the only sounds were the breaking of the waves and the stropping of the wind youve always been so interested in scrus caseload pestering your pal bliss for details didnt i start the blessed thing magrath complained you did rebus agreed but i think theres more to it than that a woman called nina hazlitt comes to your office one day and soon afterwards you decide to retire surprising everyone scru is your baby and suddenly you dont want it any more youre moving north moving near to your brother not that youre explaining it to anyone or mentioning his name when magrath said nothing rebus went on nina hazlitt came to see you because she thought shed found a thread connecting her daughters disappearance to that of brigid young that thread was the a itself she reckons you were kind to her in that you listened to her story but you yourself said it you didnt make any actual progress didnt manage to get anyone else interested in the case rebus paused im wondering if you even tried magrath flinched at this and began to trudge back up the beach rebus close behind your brother does some work at jim mellons farm he knows the area pretty well id guess the amount of driving he must do between jobs what are you getting at magraths pace had increased and he was breathing heavily we both know rebus said ive not the faintest bloody idea which house is kennys mr magrath id like to have a word with him just leave us alone mr magrath the man stopped and spun towards rebus can i see your warrant card i cant can i because youre not a bloody cop maybe i should phone and register a complaint go back home rebus just leave us be he stomped away again rebus at his heels what is it youre afraid of rebus enquired he received no answer fine if you want dempsey and her team here that can be arranged magrath had climbed the concrete steps connecting beach to roadway and was making for his cottage taking a bunch of keys from his pocket you brought peter bliss into scru rebus persisted so he could be your eyes and ears that way youd always know which cases were being reopened of course you could have achieved the selfsame result by staying put but you needed to be here somewhere near your brother rather than the hot countries you preferred bloods thicker than suntan oil eh gregor im not listening to you just think for a second rebus argued its a lot easier this way but the door was slammed shut in his face he watched through the glass as magrath opened a second door and disappeared into the body of the house there was a newspaper on the chair inside the porch folded open at the latest report on the edderton case the papers spilling across the floor seemed to be open at similar stories rebus thumped on the door with his fist then rattled the letter box after a few moments he took a step back and approached the living room window just in time to see gregor magrath drag the curtains closed he waited a full minute then walked to the next cottage along and rang the doorbell a woman who looked to be in her eighties answered drying her hands on a tea towel sorry rebus told her with a smile i was looking for mr magrath he lives next door i mean kenny the electrician she pointed along the street the garden with the swing she explained but the front doors round the far side rebus thanked her and began to stride along the seafront beyond the row of cottages stood a few modern detached houses with steeply sloping gardens the neighbour was right these homes backed on to the view someone had added an octagonal conservatory to one in front of which stood a metal frame for a swing but with its seat missing the frame itself rusting rebus headed up the lane at the end of the promenade and then took a left until he found the front door he was looking for he pressed the bell and heard it ringing somewhere inside a middleaged woman opened the door yes she said im looking for kenny magrath hes at work is it to do with a job when will he be back her face remained friendly but puzzled she had a rounded pleasing figure and curly auburn hair her eyes the same olive green as her brotherinlaws land rover is it something i can help you with she asked rebus took out his id and held it towards her im with the edderton team he explained your husband was out at jim mellons farm yesterday thats right it just occurred to us the job he does he might have noticed any suspicious activity or a stranger in the area well hed have said something wouldnt he her eyes had narrowed a little maybe he would rebus countered but sometimes you dont remember something until youre asked about it really she took a moment to consider this rebus decided to fill the silence with another question have you lived here long mrs magrath all my life been married a while dont remind me she said making a joke of it rebus managed a big friendly smile youve got a couple of kids her demeanour stiffened i saw photos at gregor magraths house he explained are they still at home theyre in their twenties she had relaxed a little ones in inverness the other glasgow so youve been talking to gregor not officially i work with one of his old colleagues the colleague told me to drop by and say hello she seemed to have made up her mind about him taking a step back into the hall she asked if he wanted to come in i dont want to be any trouble no trouble she said kenny said hed be home around one for a pit stop the kettles already on the house was bright and well furnished plenty of framed photos on the living room walls mostly of the offspring in every stage of development from cradle to graduation rebus tried not to look as though he was snooping does your husband work from a shop he asked more a sort of shed just somewhere he can store all his bits and pieces thats near here is it she nodded opposite the pub she paused sorry i didnt seem to catch your name rebus he said rebus its polish if you care to go back far enough lots of poles in scotland just now kennys noticed it in the building trade hes got enough work though oh yes no complaints there always local jobs she looked at him trying to fathom the reason for the question rebus tried out his smile again sorry just me being nosy he said kenny has built a name for himself she poured tea from a pot and handed him the mug there was a plate of shortbread too but he shook the offer away hes in demand always she took a sip of her own tea rebuss father would have called it a sergeant majors special the colour of mahogany and giving a tannic coating to the inside of the mouth he studied some of the photographs see much of your son and daughter when we can its easier with joanne shes in inverness rebus guessed mrs magrath nodded though actually kenny saw brendan a few weeks back and brendans in glasgow rebus checked i couldnt go had to visit a friend in raigmore quite a hike from here to the west isnt it rebus sympathised hed done that drive himself after all a then m sally hazlitt waiting for him at journeys end and if you needed petrol you might leave the road at pitlochry a few weeks back eh he added can you be more specific mrs magrath being nosy again her tone had grown cool hard to switch off sometimes it was a satur she heard the van before he did it was pulling up outside a saturday rebus prompted same day of the week annette was abducted just over three weeks ago would that be mrs magrath kenny has a system hell tell you so himself leaves here early lunch with brendan then he can start home and miss the football traffic the motor revved once before juddering to a stop thats good rebus was saying i must remember that leave glasgow just after three reach pitlochry between half past four and five an unoiled van door creaked open then slammed shut mrs magrath was on her feet when the front door rattled open ive only got ten minutes a male voice boomed out kenny magrath walked into the room doing a doubletake when he saw there was a stranger there this is detective rebus his wife began to explain i know who he is just had gregor nipping my ear about him a finger was pointed at rebus youre not welcome here his wife looked from one man to the other whats going on kenny magraths eyes were burning into rebuss he was taller and broader than his brother and maybe ten years younger a thick head of hair only now beginning to go silver at the temples chiselled face and deepset eyes beneath bushy eyebrows rebus stood his ground happy to continue the staring contest he had risen to his feet and was sliding his hands into his trouser pockets showing he was in no hurry to be anywhere else the fingers of his right hand grazed the guitar pick im asking you to leave magrath gestured towards the door then to his wife maggie call the police but he is the police not according to gregor maggie magrath looked at rebus feeling cheated and let down by the visitor im attached to the edderton inquiry rebus stated eyes never leaving magraths hes from edinburgh magrath told his wife got no business being here barging into peoples homes rebus was about to explain that hed been invited in but didnt want to get maggie magrath into any extra bother we need to talk he told magrath no we dont magrath took a step towards him i still dont know what this is about his wife was complaining its about all those dead women mrs magrath rebus obliged magrath bared his teeth and took another step forward you want me to throw you out rebus knew that a struggle would make a mess of maggie magraths impeccable room his eyes were fixed on magraths maybe we should talk outside were not talking anywhere magrath clamped his fingers around rebuss forearm let go of me rebus said quietly answer me first im going rebus assured him just as soon as you take your hand away and save me breaking it that sounds like a threat magrath released his grip on rebuss arm and stepped away from him best walk out of here while you still can now whos making threats not me magrath told him and ive got my wife as witness maggie magrath couldnt look rebus in the face and he realised suddenly that she knew knew or had had her suspicions just go she said her voice cracking one way or another well talk rebus told kenny magrath making for the doorway like hell we will the man responded outside sat the small white van with the name on the side magrath there were windows in the back but theyd been painted over nothing in the front but a few loose tools and an outofdate tabloid newspaper rebus tapped the details of the licence plate into his phones notebook before retracing his steps towards the seafront and his saab what are you doing here gillian dempsey asked trying to see you rebus said hed been waiting for her outside northern constabulary hq for over an hour i got the front desk to buzz up to you ive been rather busy she was walking towards her car her driver already had the rear door open for her dempsey was trying to control the sheaf of papers tucked under her arm while still hanging on to her shoulder bag and briefcase the few journalists waiting on the pavement seemed to know better than to expect any of their questions to be answered they were kept at a distance anyway courtesy of two uniformed officers who had somehow merited their thankless task they wouldnt let me in rebus went on walking beside dempsey my id wasnt good enough weve had our fair share of gawpers dempsey explained even a few reporters trying their luck including your nephew rebus couldnt help asking she stopped and gave him a hard stare what is it you want rebus i think im on to something so write it up and page can run it by me we need to cut a few corners here why because otherwise were giving him time to dispose of any evidence she thought for a moment in other words he knows you suspect him sorry about that dempsey sighed and rolled her eyes get in the car she said lets hear what youve got to say rebus didnt know the destination or how long he might have so he spoke quickly making a few mistakes which he then had to go back and correct dempsey sat next to him the armrest pulled down between them classical music was playing softly her choice rather than the drivers rebus reckoned she asked the occasional question and only met his eyes when hed finished talking thats it she said thats all youve got ive had worse hunches oh i can believe that she started checking messages on her phone but were up to our eyes people are screaming for a result and weve had every lunatic on the planet phoning us to assist either shopping themselves or some neighbour they dont like there are spiritualists who are in touch with the victims and ghosthunters who just need access to the site for a night every last shred has to be logged and added to the pile and now you come riding back into town with a hunch she shook her head slowly then gave a laugh that only came rebus suspected because the alternative would have been a bellow of frustration and rage its pretty straightforward rebus reasoned search his home garage and van check cctv at the pitlochry petrol station for the day annette mckie disappeared then interview him concerning his whereabouts on the days the other women were abducted well im glad one of us has it all figured out killers usually live in the vicinity of their disposal sites you got that from your friend clarke kenny magrath knows edderton she studied him as if for the very first time you look exhausted she said exhausted and hungover when was the last time you can truthfully say you were thinking straight head lucid no jumble or muddle are we talking about me or you were talking about you because i can see how a case like this would grind you down until you just wanted it all to go away ive got work to do rebus actual work not just jumping to conclusions dont forget we may still be one body short despite that previous hunch of yours about sally hazlitt sally hazlitts alive rebus stated i met up with her in glasgow what she was running away from her fathers attentions as of now shes still running why am i only hearing this now because it doesnt change the facts theres a killer out there and ive just given you a name i need more than a name ive got dozens of names how dare you not tell me about meeting that girl you should have asked for the files he couldnt help snapping back at her her face darkened further as she turned towards her driver alex stop the car at once then to rebus this is where you get out the car had screeched to a halt rebus made no effort to open the door im telling you he ploughed on the longer you leave this the more stupid youre going to look alex dempsey said her tone alerting her driver to what was needed he got out and came round to rebuss side of the car hauling open the door bring him in rebus was saying as dempseys man gripped him by his lapels he shared a final few seconds of eye contact with her before finding himself on the pavement the driver slamming the door closed rebus bent a little so he could peer in but dempsey was facing the other way cheers alex rebus called out giving the driver a little wave mind how you go the car signalled and moved off again easing into the stream of traffic leaving rebus standing by the side of a busy arterial road somewhere on the outskirts of inverness with no idea how to get back to his saab nicely played yet again john he muttered to himself reaching into his pocket for his cigarettes in the end it was a thirtyfiveminute walk with just the one fellow pedestrian issuing a set of erroneous directions the lockup was easy to find he just went to the pub and asked the pub was on a sharp bend in the road at the northern end of rosemarkie at the top of the lane leading down to the beach and the homes of both magrath brothers the lockup was directly across from it next to a modern bungalow a low brick wall separating the two there was a gravel parking area in front and that was where rebuss saab ended up the wooden doors to the garage were held fast by a padlock there was just the one window protected on the outside by chicken wire and with what looked like a polythene carrier bag pinned to the inside blocking prying eyes rebus returned to his car and switched the cd player back on nothing to do but wait he had purchased supplies at the pub two packets of cheese and onion crisps and two small bags of salted peanuts he still had a halffull bottle of water on the passenger seat there was very little traffic as far as he knew the road led only to cromarty he checked the map and saw that it was the a with his finger he traced the route back to the a and from there all the way south to perth then back up again this time staying on the a until the dornoch firth heading inland towards tongue his finger rested there as he remembered the view from samanthas house and the interior visible through the living room window giving him hints and clues to her life durness and laxford and colaboll and lairg then edderton rebus pressed the palm of his hand against the saabs steering wheel a lot of ground weve covered oldtimer he told the car when the cd ended he tried the radio but the signal came and went leaving the choice of ceilidh music or nothing so he swapped john martyn for some early wishbone ash and leaned back in his seat closing his eyes when he woke up it was to absolute silence his neck was stiff as he angled his head towards his watch he couldnt read the dial so he switched on his phone instead two in the morning the pub was in darkness he took a slug of water and got out walking over to the lockup and relieving himself against its side wall back in the saab he checked his phone for messages but there werent any he rubbed some feeling back into his arms and legs the temperature was not going to drop as far as zero tonight too much cloud cover he stared at the padlock on the door in front of him for a while then felt his vision blurring and closed his eyes again a fist on the nearside window woke him it was growing light outside and he turned his head to see kenny magraths face inches from him magrath was opening the door of the saab what the hell do you think youre up to the man snarled stopping you moving anything moving what evidence youre off your damned head seven in the morning what else would you be doing here picking up what i need magrath explained got a fortyminute drive ahead of me he stared at rebus for a moment longer then shook his head slowly and walked over to the padlock digging in his pocket for the key take a look he called out i wont even ask for a search warrant with you not being a cop and all the door was flung open magrath disappeared inside and switched on the light rebus got out of the car stretching his spine while checking to left and right nobody else about not a single living soul he walked to the doorway and stopped there one wall consisted of homemade shelves filled with plastic tubs containing electrical parts sockets switches fuses junction boxes a workbench stretched the length of the wall opposite the one with the window above it either side of this window tools hung from nails and hooks there were broken appliances spread out on the bench their components neatly arranged in what rebus guessed was the order of dismantling magrath was stuffing packets of screws washers and rawl plugs into his jacket getting a good butchers he asked open the drawers if you like and there are cardboard boxes and biscuit tins under the bench you wont want to miss those look at me rebus said quietly magrath turned his head towards him have you heard the story of dennis nilsen should i have they found human remains in the drains on his street moment he answered his door to cid the detective knew rebus paused that was in london but when i saw you yesterday the same thing happened i know kenny i saw it in your eyes bear that in mind he paused again so if youre going to use that screwdriver this might be your only chance magrath looked down at his hand and the tool clenched in it he placed it back on the surface of the bench taking his time i can see youre methodical rebus went on eyes sweeping the garage youre neat and youre careful explains why youve stayed off the radar all these years that and having a brother whos tried his damnedest to keep an eye on you but youre on the radar now kenny dead centre and with nothing else near you on the screen i havent done anything youre thinking about them right now especially annette mckie shes freshest in your mind youre feeling your fingers around her throat youre mad magrath looked around him as if wondering if hed forgotten anything he pressed a hand to each of his bulging pockets then moved towards rebus rebus stepped back so that magrath could switch the light off and lock the door again did you tell gregor or did he somehow work it out maybe back when you were kids he saw the warning signs what signs pulling the legs off frogs maybe tying fireworks to the tails of cats and dogs magrath shook his head thats not me go ask him maybe i will its about time he got this off his conscience same with your wife you leave maggie out of this bit late for that so help me ill magrath was just about keeping his rage in check when he took a deep breath and exhaled it sounded like a growl rebus stood his ground awaiting the mans next move magrath seemed to consider his options and ended up turning away striding towards his parked van where are you going kenny no answer you were in pitlochry werent you magrath was getting into the van avoiding eye contact rebus walked towards him slowly the key was turned in the ignition magrath commenced a threepoint turn a minibus coming around the corner from the direction of cromarty had to brake hard to avoid crashing into him there were a handful of schoolkids in the back the driver sounded his horn but magrath ignored him the van roaring off in the direction of fortrose rebus lit a breakfast cigarette and decided hed done what he could two minutes later he was parking outside gregor magraths cottage the wind had dropped and there were the usual dogwalkers on the beach rebus caught a glimpse of something out to sea that could have been a dolphin or a seal he thumped on magraths door and waited magrath came out to the porch and studied rebus through the window we need to talk about your brother rebus called out to him the man shook his head slowly did you move here to stop him if so you did a pisspoor job go away magrath said it was all right for the first year or so but after that go away magrath was shouting now its all ending gregor rebus persisted surely you can see that time to call a halt and save whats left of your reputation im not listening youve got to convince him easier for all concerned if he turns himself in tell him he should think of maggie if nobody else gregor magraths look was full of loathing but rebus saw a trace of resignation too the man turned away and went back indoors rebus bided his time and magrath reappeared in the porch this time brandishing the wooden truncheon that wont do it rebus told him with a shake of the head and the faintest of smiles not any longer i know its about protecting family and maybe protecting your own name while youre at it but moving up here hasnt stopped him time for the next step gregor go to hell magrath disappeared inside again and though rebus stood there for a further few minutes giving the door an occasional blow with his fist he knew the man wasnt coming back this time he returned to the saab and called siobhan clarke in edinburgh bit early for you she complained did i wake you not quite he thought he could hear her sit up in bed her mouth seemed to be dry and she cleared her throat so wheres the fire im in rosemarkie rebus admitted doing what exactly its magraths brother siobhan id swear to it what magrath moved north to try to keep a lid on it the brother travels all over he was in glasgow the day annette mckie was abducted and hed have driven up the a to get home rebus rubbed his free hand across the stubble on his cheeks and chin wait a second he listened as she walked into another room can you prove any of this i told dempsey we need forensics on magraths van plus searches of his home and garage you told dempsey shes not going to bite unless i can give her something thats why i thought of you are you off your head everybody seems to think so but i know its him thats not the way it works john she paused only now registering something hed said a moment back what do you need me for the phone number of that petrol station in pitlochry i want to take a look at their cctv if annette hitched a lift in the town kenny magrath must have been in the town he pulled off the a to fill up maybe she gave a lengthy sigh he imagined her seated on the edge of her sofa elbow on knee hand pressed to forehead not quite ready to face the day yet and already landed with this the longer he has the more chance were giving him to dump anything that could be incriminating hang on a minute then she said getting to her feet she found the number and gave it to him twice while he jotted it down and checked it thanks siobhan i suppose dempsey will have contacted james she commented i dare say im in for yet another bollocking except that youre not a cop any more she paused which means i shouldnt even be talking to you and you shouldnt be doing this arent i naughty rebus said with a tired smile then i thought i saw a dolphin earlier or maybe a selkie you implying i see things that arent there di clarke how many lies are you going to tell the petrol station as few as necessary ill talk to you later always supposing they allow you more than one phone call she said rebus managed another smile before punching in the number she had given him but the petrol stations footage for the day of annette mckies disappearance was not available youve already got it he was told its at inverness rebus nodded his comprehension ended the call and tried another number john gavin arnold answered what can i do for you this fine stressfree morning raise those stress levels maybe rebus suggested by doing what bending a few rules rebus answered going on to explain his request fox was usually first into the complaints office but not today tony kaye was standing behind foxs desk holding a cardboard beaker of coffee in one hand and using the other to sift through one of the stacks of paperwork relating to john rebus early bird fox said shrugging off his coat and hanging it up thought id maybe have a word before joe naysmith arrives lost your phone i thought this was best done face to face spit it out then kaye rested a hand on one of the piles of paper you know what im going to say youre going to tell me were wasting our time the guys oldschool malcolm its amazing any of them still survive so hes some kind of endangered species and we should be feeding him bamboo a good hunter knows when not to pull the trigger youve seen the phone logs tony is there any villain in the city hes not cosied up to di clarke said it if rebus is attached to the mckie case hes got plenty of reasons for talking to frank hammell and cafferty used to be hammells employer fox shook his head slowly the mans a liability and dangerous with it thats for the board to decide with our input are you saying i put a halo over rebuss head just stick to the facts dont let it get personal who says its personal it is though you worked cid at st leonards same time he did so i remember you once telling me not every good detective fits in at complaints are you saying i couldnt hack it in cid it was kayes turn to shake his head im saying rebus got results the old way without seeming to earn them he did that because he got close to some nasty people in a way you couldnt this is what youre good at malcolm he tapped the desk rebus specialises in something a bit different doesnt necessarily make him the enemy weve got to be accountable tony rebus and his ilk dont see that in point of fact i think he gets his jollies sticking two fingers up to the rest of us doesnt make him the enemy kaye repeated quietly foxs phone vibrated letting him know he had a message he looked at the screen then at his colleague have you mentioned any of this to the chief kaye shook his head why because he wants a word foxs eyes scanned the mass of paperwork there were boxes of it on the floor next to his desk thousands of pages detailing dozens of infractions but dozens of arrests too and no smoking gun same with the notes at foxs house all of it circumstantial easy to read into it anything you liked you think its about rebus tony kaye was asking what else fox said making for the door they could bounce me down the stairs for this arnold complained meeting rebus outside northern constabulary hq rebus held out a brown paper bag which arnold took and opened pulling out a croissant and biting into it then he gestured for rebus to follow him into the building where he was signed in as a visitor and handed a pass to be worn at all times arnold was still chewing as they reached the inquiry room he made another gesture letting rebus know he should wait there before disappearing through the door when he came out again he was holding a clear plastic envelope containing several cdsized silver disks laptop he asked rebus shook his head arnold gave a twitch of the mouth as if to indicate that hed expected this he led rebus along the corridor until he found a room with an unused desk he gave the mouse a nudge activating the monitor then entered his password caleythis rebus enquired short for caledonian thistle arnold pulled out the chair and nodded for rebus to sit down the disk drive was on the floor beneath the desk and he crouched in front of it sliding home the first of the disks eight hours worth he warned rebus wont take me nearly that long anybody asks you tell them whatever story you like keeping your name out of it rebus guessed then he held out his hand thanks gavin the two men shook and arnold left him to it rebus reckoned he could focus on a specific hour of comings and goings on the petrol stations forecourt thirty minutes either side of annette mckies arrival in pitlochry the first disk he tried was no help being too early in the day ditto the second and third when he got to the fourth he fastforwarded keeping an eye on the clock in the corner of the screen eventually when he was happy he leaned forwards and watched intently dempsey couldnt place him at first when she did her face tightened how the hell did you get in here rebus had hidden the visitors badge in his pocket not a crime is it he asked actually it probably is he had found her in one of the meeting rooms she had been seated but was now standing the other officer was wondering what was going on dempsey dismissed the man with a wave and an announcement that they would finish their discussion later once she was alone with rebus she folded her arms and waited ive got him was all rebus said she saw that he was holding a small silver object in one hand both magrath brothers along with kennys wife maggie were brought in for questioning that same afternoon search warrants had been applied for and dempsey seemed to think they wouldnt be long arriving meantime preliminary questions were being asked of neighbours in rosemarkie the media had reacted quickly to the news the ranks of reporters had swollen outside hq and a radio car was in position a satellite dish on its roof no tv as yet or none that rebus could see from the windows of the inquiry room he had asked to be present at the interviews but dempsey had put the kibosh on it he wasnt even a serving police officer a lawyer could make potentially devastating use of that in fact shed told him best thing would be if you went back to edinburgh and remind me how did you get in here in the first place shed said she would call him with news she didnt want him to think she was ungrateful but as yet it was all just supposition mixed with what might turn out to be coincidence and that was it rebus was dismissed he texted a brief thank you to gavin arnold not being able to track him down in the flesh and headed outdoors raymond dempseys nephew nodded a greeting and asked if he had any comment the other journalists frowned and twitched not knowing who rebus was they quickly gathered round raymond keen to be included rebus took his time getting a cigarette lit before he spoke persons of interest are currently being interviewed by dcs dempsey and her team he obliged any names rebus kept his eyes on raymond the young man was pointing his phone using it as a mic the persons of interest are local rebus went on i dont doubt tongues are wagging then he got into his car and started the engine was he heading home he wasnt sure first he drove to rosemarkie and cruised past the lockup kenny magraths van was parked in front and rebus stopped getting out to peer through its windows again it looked exactly the same as before except for a tupperware box and a thermos lunch prepared by maggie at a guess a leftover sandwich was visible through the plastic the lockup itself still boasted its padlock rebus walked around the vehicle it was small with thin tyres their tread reduced through use could a van like this have been driven into the woods at edderton without getting stuck rebus checked for damage but didnt find any just a bit of mud the van was only a year or so old judging by the number plate he was walking around it again checking more closely for nonexistent scrapes and scuffs when the forensics team arrived there were four of them two in a ford transit and two in a vauxhall astra one of them recognised rebus from the portakabin at edderton he jutted out his chin and gave a twitch of the head as much acknowledgement as rebus was going to get before anyone else could ask who he was or demand id rebus garnered all the authority he could muster and explained that they would find the lockup well organised and with few obvious hiding places you might want to check the perimeter he added if hes kept any trophies i doubt theyre going to be under your noses why do you say that he was asked i was here with him earlier he seemed perfectly relaxed about a search of the place the questioner nodded his understanding have all the warrants been signed rebus enquired receiving another nod for his efforts both brothers homes thats right i think you might want to add the green land rover sitting outside gregor magraths place not sure who it belongs to but strikes me it should be checked more of an allterrain vehicle than this rebus gestured towards the van why dont you arrange that then the team leader asked not my job rebus explained retreating to the saab he was back at whichers now that the initial fuss about the bodies had died down they had rooms available but rebus wasnt sure he would be staying instead he sat in the lounge plugged in his phone for a recharge and ordered a helping of steak pie and chips along with a pot of tea during a trip to the toilets he had a wash and studied himself in the mirror he looked like a man who had slept in his car at reception they handed him a pack containing toothbrush toothpaste razor and shaving cream and he returned to the toilets for a patchup job with his belly full and another pot of tea on its way he felt more human there were plenty of papers to help him bide his time plus the hotels copy of cracking the code hed asked for the tv to be tuned to a news channel but with the sound muted no trouble at all sir hed been told by the waiter in the tartan waistcoat a couple of hours passed with no word from dempsey rebus checked that his phone was still getting a healthy signal when it did eventually ring caller id told him it was siobhan clarke on the line rebus answered dempseys just been having a word with james page she told him shes wondering if youre back in edinburgh yet and and james spoke to ds cowan at scru but he hasnt seen you either funny that youre still in inverness of course i am he told her about the cctv kenny magrath stopping to refuel at the petrol station no more than five minutes after annette mckie had left it on foot then about kenny and gregor magrath being taken in for questioning did dempsey tell page whether the interviews had finished no idea clarke confessed you and him not best buddies leave it john pity i really liked the guy you dont take a telling do you rebus smiled to himself dempsey was supposed to be updating me he went on to explain thats why im still here you really think this is it dont you hope springs eternal well im not sure dempsey sounded like a woman on the verge of a breakthrough rebus had another caller number blocked he told clarke hed phone her back rebus gillian dempsey said any news theyve been questioned and released and and theres not much else to say kenny magraths work premises and van have been gone over stuffs been sent to the lab but the team didnt sound hopeful same goes for both houses what about the land rover dempsey paused that was your idea was it well our friendly sheriff signed an extra warrant but again it looks clean clean or cleaned somebody may have cleaned it in recent memory she admitted but not with the thoroughness youre implying besides we know it was the van in pitlochry rather than another vehicle dont we what does he say about the stop for petrol he was on his way back from visiting his son in glasgow and his tank was low you dont think thats quite a coincidence as it happens i do and so did he he told his wife as much when annette mckie became news asked her if he should maybe come forward she reasoned there wasnt much point if he hadnt seen anything funny she didnt mention that to me rebus closed his eyes and rubbed his hand across them you think shes covering for him sometimes thats what families do well dempsey went on unless the lab finds something were at a bit of a dead end arent we did you look at him in the interview room i mean really look him in the eye i did more than that i had a psychologist watching the camera feed they didnt see anything that rang alarm bells this is a family man rebus two grownup kids and a doting wife neighbours full of praise and not so much as a speeding ticket to his name will you at least do a bit more digging check where he was when the other victims were snatched ive asked him hes going to have to go back through his paperwork to find out shouldnt that be your job weve sent an officer to the house to fetch it all she said coldly but as of this moment were still at that same dead end she paused incidentally can i ask where you are doesnt sound like youre driving im not i stopped at house of bruar for a break youre heading back to edinburgh then just as you ordered rebus rattled the cup in its saucer so she could hear it but youll let me know if theres any news of course oh and by the way giving that impromptu statement to my nephew not your brightest move despite the manifest competition she hung up on him and he set the phone down on the table next to the teapot he was the only person in the lounge the papers had been gone through from cover to cover and the tv was still showing footage of some football managers fall from grace it seemed as if the story was on a fifteenminute loop same pictures each and every time and nothing about edderton not even on the ticker tape of breaking news along the bottom of the screen what the hell do i do now rebus asked himself the answer came to him cigarette he said rising to his feet forty minutes later he was seated in the lounge again staring into space his mind swirling with thoughts when he saw a face he knew gavin arnold in full uniform cap tucked beneath one arm what are you doing here rebus asked him looking for you at dcs dempseys behest this was second on my list after the lochinver want to sit down arnold shook his head looming over rebus i told her i was at house of bruar rebus went on seems she wasnt taken in my orders are to escort you to the a and stick with you as far as daviot im being run out of town by the sheriff that you are hopalong i didnt grass you up gavin i know that but if she set her mind to it it wouldnt take her five minutes to work out im the one who got you that visitors pass well wed better get you into her good books pronto then rebus rose to his feet and reached for his jacket but if you should happen to hear anything on the grapevine youd be grateful for a tipoff arnold guessed with a smile tell me is it possible for anyone to come to know you without them always feeling theyre slipping their neck into a noose youd have to ask my legion of friends do you need to settle up arnold nodded towards the teapot already done rebus assured him were ready for the off then rebus stopped in front of him their faces mere inches apart kenny magrath did it gavin ive never been so sure of anything in my life then well catch him arnold said will we though we dont always you know as they passed the reception desk rebus thought of sally hazlitt and the alternative identity shed created far from friends and family spending her life always in motion never quite able to trust or settle or drop her guard arnolds patrol car stayed on rebuss tail until the daviot signpost then dropped back flashing its headlights a couple of times as if to say a final defining farewell part six woke up this morning i had snow in my eyes and ive been sleeping under terrible skies nothing happened rebus went into work each day and watched as more and more boxes were decanted men in overalls came with trolleys to take them away and someone from the crown office cold case unit arrived to thank them for their work and offer assurances that none of the cases on lothian and borders books would be forgotten this man seemed already to know daniel cowan and the two of them disappeared for a long lunch afterwards cowans cheeks were rosy and he had a wide smile for everyone in the room you got the job didnt you elaine robison asked while rebus and peter bliss feigned a lack of interest nothings official yet you did though she went on and cowans smile grew broader scru was being wound up at the end of the week but by wednesday the shelves were empty an it technician went through their computers saving files on to a single portable hard drive before deleting everything means we can recycle the units he explained watching rebus was reminded of the scene in the voice of hal slowing down inexorably to think of all the blood sweat and tears bliss commented rebus had taken him out for a drink one evening laying out his theories about gregor and kenny magrath bliss had been reluctant to concede any of the possibilities proposed and had eventually walked out of the bar since when his attitude had been one of professional courtesy only rebus had left a note on his colleagues desk just have a think back does anything jar which bliss had crumpled into a ball and dropped into the wastepaper bin you two robison had chided them why cant you play nice he started it rebus had answered hoping to elicit a smile from bliss a forlorn hope as it turned out he spoke to siobhan clarke by phone keeping up to date with the inverness inquiry gavin arnold having been warned presumably by dempsey not to pass titbits to him clarke wasnt much help now that the inverness team had all the information on annette mckie from the edinburgh end james page and his officers were being frozen out dempsey had even come south reinterviewing gail mckie frank hammell and thomas redfern a further request had seen the bus stations cctv footage forwarded to northern constabulary hq none of which is going to help them rebus had told clarke theyre just scratching around for want of anything else to do nothing prejudicial had been found in either magraths van or the land rover after exhaustive tests nothing alien on or in annette mckies body could be linked to kenny magrath the pubic hair had belonged to frank hammell the funeral had eventually been allowed to go ahead as had services for the other four victims watching the footage on tv darryl leading the mourners his mother clinging to his arm hammell nowhere to be seen rebus realised he knew the cemetery it was the same one where jimmy wallace was buried he remembered that day the pallbearers called forward by number the wailing widow and tommy beamish sidling up to him too many like jimmy gold watch and soon after theyre on a slab is that why you keep working well of course it bloody was what the hell was he going to do next week take up fishing or buy a dog or more likely sit staring at a gantry of drinks like some of the oldtimers he knew treating a stint at the pub almost as if it were a job in itself hed met malcolm fox on the stairs one day and fox had stopped to tell him that the complaints had ceased to have an active interest in him oh for the moment that is so good luck with your application aye right i mean it fox had said eyes drilling into rebuss i want you back on the force youll screw up sooner rather than later and thats when well get to know one another better i just pray you dont take the likes of siobhan clarke down with you on the thursday elaine robison had tried to fix a time and place for farewell drinks the following night but peter bliss had grown cool on the idea ive got plans hed said the weekend then bliss had shaken his head lets just call it a day eh its not like weve anything to celebrate peter but bliss had made up his mind he couldnt even find it in himself to meet rebuss eyes not until the friday afternoon when they were emptying the contents of their desk drawers into carrier bags readying to walk out of the office for the last time daniel cowan had already said his goodbyes hed gone to a meeting of the new unit a spring in his step robison was in the loo bliss had picked his moment and confronted rebus gregor magrath was one of the good guys he stated in my books he still is and always will be what youre trying to do is take a dump all over his legacy i wont have any part of that and ill never forgive you for it have you talked to him rebus asked hes in agonies about this taken in for questioning on your sayso colour was rising to blisss cheeks his voice beginning to shake with emotion hes been covering his brothers arse for years youre like a stuck record rebus maybe so but the songs still a smash magrath played you peter is that what sticks in your craw the man deserves some dignity and what do the victims deserve eh bliss made a guttural sound and snatched the carrier bag from his desk shoving his way past rebus and stalking down the corridor robison came back to find rebus waiting for her guess this is it she said then she noted blisss absence he was in a hurry rebus apologised she tried giving him a hard look but her heart wasnt in it they embraced and she pecked his cheek heres to fresh pastures she said squeezing his arm rebus closed the door after them that evening after one too many drinks he made the usual call the phone rang at the other end and kept ringing until the automated voice told him to leave a message we have to talk gregor you know we do this has to end then he repeated his phone number before hanging up the first halfdozen times magrath had actually answered ending the call only when rebus identified himself since then however he had let the machine pick up for him rebus studied his reflection in the living room window friday night in the big city eh he told it as rain dribbled down the panes the copies of the missing persons files were still sitting on his dining table and he pulled out a chair and seated himself in front of them one day soon he would feel able to bin them but not just yet so far nothing had been found that could place kenny magrath near the other women on the days theyd been abducted his paperwork had proved incomplete but then whose wasnt he didnt keep a diary or hang on to calendars and notebooks and neither did his wife rebus reached across to the bottle of beer and took a slug from it his hand rested against a letter that had been sitting there a couple of days the one inviting him to interview by lothian and borders police applications board there was a date for his medical plus a sheet to be signed and returned once its boxes had been ticked rebus read through it for the umpteenth time as he rubbed the guitar pick between his fingers maybe if id bought the actual bloody guitar he muttered to himself before rising to his feet in search of a pen caffertys house was a detached victorian mansion on a leafy street off colinton road it sat in half an acre of grounds with its own coach house there were plenty of public rooms but cafferty usually retreated to his study with its view of the back garden there was a big old chair there that hed owned since he was in his twenties he sat in it to read books and to think tonight he was thinking about darryl christie christie had invited him to annettes funeral cafferty had duly turned up at the chapel noting that the young man had brought some muscle with him half a dozen faces cafferty didnt know young but toughened maybe army vets whod bailed from iraq or afghanistan they stood apart from the main phalanx of mourners and followed at a distance when the procession headed for the graveside darryl and his two younger brothers acting as pallbearers with three other men no frank hammell no derek christie the cop from up north was there cafferty didnt know her name but hed seen her on tv hed thought he might see rebus but that was another noshow one of the thickset young men had made his way through the mourners towards cafferty leaning in to mutter in his ear that mr christie would like a word before you go cafferty had hung back watching people as they readied to go to the reception darryl had helped his mother into the limo pecking her on the cheek and closing the door then hed straightened his jacket and tie and headed for cafferty cafferty held out a hand but christie ignored it you holding up cafferty had felt it polite to ask thats not the question you really want an answer to all right then wheres frank hammell hes out of the game signed all his businesses over to me christies eyes had come to rest on caffertys is that okay with you why shouldnt it be because you still want to feel like a player but we both know thats not going to happen now ive seen the way you operate and that means im armed for any fight you want to start im past all that those are the right words but your brain needs to start believing them ive studied hard cafferty and i know which bits of this city hammell controlled as things stand im not looking for a war whats yours is still yours only thing thatll change that is if you decide this is a good time to try a bit of poaching or bordercrossing do we understand one another and only then had christie reached out his hand towards cafferty the kid was eighteen eighteen at eighteen cafferty had been no more than a foot soldier and now he was being told what was what by a skinny waif with a napoleon complex and a handful of paid minders to stop him coming to harm but he had shaken the hand nonetheless now as he sat in his study he knew darryl christie had made the right move at the right time the changeover had been smooth hammell was keeping his head down but as yet no one was saying he wouldnt be seen alive whats yours is still yours as things stand the cheek of the little bastard a clever sod though not to be underestimated or misjudged cafferty was embarrassed at the way he himself had played the whole thing trying to be avuncular an arm around a shoulder when darryl already had his plans in place as cool and calculating as you liked it was to be admired at least in the short term but when all was said and done the lad was still in his teens there were hard lessons he had not yet learned mistakes would be made along with enemies no one was untouchable no one which was why cafferty rose from his chair and checked that both front and back doors were bolted on saturday morning rebus called magrath again this time the phone did not ring instead a different automated voice told him the number he had dialled had not been recognised and he should try again he took more care the second time but got the selfsame message changed your number gregor he asked quietly then he nodded to himself and went to take a shower by late lunchtime he was parked on the seafront at rosemarkie directly opposite the cottage he sounded his horn a few times keeping watch on the windows for signs of life all the curtains were closed when he eventually went to check brushing past the land rover there was mail lying on the mat inside the porch he went next door and the neighbour answered remember me rebus asked i was here before the elderly woman agreed that yes rebus was not a stranger just wondering if youve seen hide or hair of gregor he was at the shop yesterday collecting his paper hes all right then its just that hes not answering his door and the place looks deserted hes had reporters turning up at all hours the woman explained and the phone too i can hear it ringing and ringing she paused leaning in towards rebus and lowering her voice you heard what happened rebus nodded as he felt was expected awful business just awful you never think these things will well you know what i mean plenty of talk in the village i suppose the woman tilted her head back you wouldnt credit it is everybody agreed its beyond belief rebus was doing his best to sound like a local himself he had relaxed his stance and was resting his weight against the door frame arms folded just two old cronies having a chinwag beyond belief the woman echoed no doubters rebus raised an eyebrow its just that there usually are theres hardly a family around here kenny magrath hasnt helped out at one time or another im sure thats true but all the same but the woman was shaking her head in a resolute fashion so youre all sticking together looking after your own rebuss tone had hardened she frowned took a step back and started to close the door on him has gregor given you his new number by any chance the click of the door as it locked was his only reply nice speaking to you he muttered returning to magraths cottage and hammering on the door the rain was falling again huge sleety gobbets of the stuff making slapping sounds as they hit his shoulders and back he retreated to the saab and sat there waiting for the storm to pass the sky was almost black and he switched the wipers on hailstones now bouncing off the surface of the road coating it white rebus turned the engine on and put the car into reverse backing seventy feet along the road until he was outside kenny magraths garden again the house looked deserted the upstairs blinds were closed and the octagonal conservatory had no lights on the windscreen was steaming up so he turned the fan to high and opened his window an inch after a few minutes the hail stopped the sky remained leaden but there wasnt even rain just a suffocating sense that a weight was being pressed down on the locality rebus sucked in lungfuls of air and wiped sweat from his forehead and neck he took a cigarette from the packet and realised his hands were trembling he pressed them together as if that might help his heart was pounding too not yet he said to his chest and the organs within not just yet eh he drove up the lane and took a left towards kenny magraths front door no van the place definitely felt empty another short drive to the lockup still no van maybe he worked saturdays or hed persuaded his wife they needed some time away with brother gregor in tow a chance to check and recheck their stories hell maybe they were just out shopping a regular jaunt to inverness or dingwall photographs of both brothers had appeared in the media but only for a day they probably had little fear of being recognised outside their immediate community rebus sat there drumming his fingers he wondered what kind of weekend others were enjoying was siobhan buying food or off to watch hibs was daniel cowan being measured for a suit for his new job did gillian dempsey have a family dinner planned maybe with nephew raymond on the guest list supermarkets would be thronged cinemas preparing to entertain the masses lunchtime trade picking up in bars and restaurants crosswords tackled walking boots thrown into the backs of estate cars skiing and boating and golf swimming and indoor games kids with homework adults with chores queues at the car wash and petrol station everyone going about their business maybe the edderton team had been granted enough of a budget to keep covering weekend shifts but shifts comprising what exactly more interviews paperwork and briefings to no end other than a slightly swollen pay packet what the hell are you doing john he asked himself returning to gregor magraths cottage he wrote out a note and pinned it under one of the land rovers windscreen wipers all it said was this has to end as he headed home he noticed that the roadworks to the north of pitlochry seemed to have finished it wasnt just that no one was working one of the portakabins was being loaded on to a flatbed truck and the portaloos had already gone he wondered what would happen to the men did they have new projects waiting for them a neverending process of digging up and resurfacing join the club he said aloud and what of thomas robertson rebus had phoned aberdeen royal infirmary a few days back but of course robertson was no longer a patient maybe he was back at the tummel arms explaining to gina andrews why hed lied to her about his conviction or maybe he was on the road to somewhere else no real end point in mind rebus saw that he was down to a quartertank of fuel so he pulled into pitlochry itself and crawled through the bustling centre until he reached the petrol station as he started filling up a voice called to him what happened to the audi rebus looked to the next pump along and recognised the rep hed talked to when hed been waiting for clarke to ask her questions in the kiosk small world the man said with a smile cigarette break after rebus suggested the man looked keen they filled their tanks in silence went into the kiosk to pay and then met up on the pavement next to the main road a coach party had arrived at the bells distillery and was being led into the visitors centre rebus nodded towards the saab in answer to your question im more the classiccar type the man exhaled a long stream of smoke didnt catch your line of work last time we met im an excop so what do you do now at the moment im still getting used to it rebus flicked ash on to the ground you said you were in solutions posh term for sales the man admitted youre working today tomorrow as well if anyone wants to see me its tough out there if you hadnt noticed id noticed what does your wife say the man shrugged well open a bottle of wine tonight try to make the most of it got kids one daughter same as me then lauries in her first year at high school mine fled the nest long back rebus paused studying the tip of his cigarette i dont see her much they watched the flow of traffic in and out of town i think you told me you drive hundreds of miles a week enough so i recognise faces and firms he nodded towards a lorry flowers from holland hell drop off as far north as aberdeen before heading back to the ferry i think ive seen him before too rebus said remembering the layby and the van driver with the busted cigarette lighter first year or two in the job the salesman was saying i paid scant attention in fact probably no attention at all far as i was concerned it was all about me he sucked on his cigarette and exhaled but then id find myself in the same cafes and petrol stops as people id seen before and youd strike up conversations the salesman nodded lonely old life otherwise isnt it i suppose and you get to know spots like the snack van parked next to the sign saying welcome to the highlands the slochd summit rebus chipped in one thousand three hundred and twentyeight feet above sea level the rep recited dewars world of whisky ten miles off the a the two men shared a smile i have to admit though i do like it not that id tell my wife that never feel quite at home when im stuck in an office or even with my feet up in front of the telly he looked at rebus that probably sounds crazy not really when youre on the road theres always a destination and you know youre going to reach it one way or another the salesman nodded thats exactly right they smoked in silence for a few moments until the man coughed and cleared his throat that girl who got murdered near here annette mckie he nodded again more solemnly is that why you were here last time i seem to remember your colleague asking questions in the kiosk he watched as rebus gave a twitch of agreement ive picked up hitchhikers in the past always warned them about the dangers of travelling on their own you used to see more of them but theyre still out there ive made laurie promise she wont ever do it he glanced up at rebus i know what youre thinking we wrap them in cotton wool these days i used to hitch lifts myself back in the day so did the missus but its all different now i suppose it is you reckon youll ever catch the bastard hard to say even if you do its kid gloves in jails these days isnt it he had finished his cigarette and began to stub it out under the toe of his shoe rebus had been considering possible answers to the question but the salesman didnt seem to need one better hit the trail he was explaining job like mine if youre not moving youre not earning he gave a grin full of professionally whitened teeth and those solutions wont sell themselves the two men shook hands and returned to their vehicles rebus watched as the salesman drove off with a wave from his open window he was heading north six and sevenday weeks spent in a world that for him was permanent for others fleeting a place of layby sandwiches and pit stops for fuel getting to know each road intimately memorising short cuts computing routes around snarlups bumping into others whose routine was similar to his own trading tips with them about the best fast food the cheapest petrol the cleanest facilities rebus had always thought of roads as simple mute entities but he knew differently now they had individual identities and foibles they pulsed with life he stayed on the forecourt and pulled out his phone punching in samanthas number its me he said when she answered hey dad you okay to talk nothing planned except a lazy weekend lucky you i just thought id call and see how youre doing he leaned back against the headrest holding the phone close to his ear content just to listen to her voice is everything all right she asked its just what not like you to pick up the phone that doesnt mean im not thinking of you samantha i think about you a lot im doing okay i know you are how about you any closer to catching that madman people keep asking me that he was remembering his words to the salesman theres always a destination and you know youre going to reach it one way or another what do you tell them you really think hes a madman has to be sometimes its hard to tell gives me the creeps to think of him still out there ive an appointment in inverness in a few days with the ivf team ive told keith im not going without him youll be fine easy for you to say i suppose it is will you let me know how it goes at raigmore of course and maybe you and keith should think about a weekend in edinburgh i could find you a hotel my treat are you sure youre feeling all right enough of your cheek young lady he heard her laughter ringing in his ears that evening he met cafferty at the tannery thanks for coming he said buying the drinks before heading for a table is this where you offer an apology cafferty asked what sort of apology last time we were in here you were less than gracious i suppose thats one way of putting it so youre not going to tell me i hurt your feelings cafferty managed the thinnest of smiles maybe not he conceded so why did you bring me here rebus reached into his pocket and unfolded a page torn from the scotsman flattening it out on the table it was a report of annette mckies funeral accompanied by a photograph of some of the mourners as they left the chapel cafferty among them i was invited by the family cafferty explained i wasnt aware you knew them i know darryl since when not so long back you didnt even know he worked for frank hammell it was you who tipped me off cafferty raised his glass as if in a toast and between then and now youve managed to worm your way into the family darryl wanted me there why though bit of business cafferty took a sip of whisky savouring it before swallowing i didnt see hammell among the guests well you wouldnt because hes been pushed out rebus guessed you turned darryl against him you dont give the lad enough credit what does that mean just that my help wasnt really needed young darryls had frank hammell in his sights from the word go rebus took a moment to digest this id say hes going to give your lot a few headaches in the coming years too cafferty went on just as long as he stays smart and stays lucky so wheres hammell now keeping his head down i dont buy it hammells too big the kids been chipping away at him from the ground up kicked out hammells men and brought in his own and he did all of that without hammell noticing meaning hes been very clever if hammell had suspected the kid would be lying in a forest somewhere somewhere off the a as good a place as any rebus shook his head slowly darryl had to have your backing do you think i wouldnt be taking the credit if i could hes too young but sharp as a craft knife what was your plan turn him against hammell maybe stir things up a bit youre pretty good at that yourself no wonder the complaints are interested doesnt seem to have stopped our little gettogethers though does it i reckon thats because youd get bored otherwise oh aye cafferty was nodding tell me something he said leaning his elbows against the table the argument hammell had with the girl any idea what it was about i know exactly what it was about but youre not going to tell me no im not and theres no point asking ormiston because i can tell you for a fact he doesnt know the two men sized one another up if there had been a chessboard between them they might have been readying to call a draw another draw in an everlengthening line of them cafferty finished his drink and got to his feet one more he asked heading for the bar without waiting for a reply having ordered for both of them he listened as the door behind him rattled open and then closed again when he turned rebus was gone leaving behind a halffull glass and the photo from the funeral a forest somewhere as good a place as any a forest back at his flat rebus tapped the number he had for frank hammell into his phone it rang and rang without anyone answering he tipped the dregs of the whisky bottle into his mouth and swallowed them down he was standing by the living room window its view unchanged the two kids in the flat opposite were crosslegged on the carpet watching tv he wondered what life held in store for them an absent parent perhaps college or straight into work maybe unemployment meeting someone they really loved and the lastchance saloon of ivf then they might become parents themselves worrying about the future and wishing they could see what it held his phone buzzed hammells name appearing on the screen rebus hesitated then decided to answer i think we should meet he said why the voice sounded dry and hollow because ive heard about you and darryl i never want to hear that little pricks name again you might have to rebus stated calmly whats more i think itll be worth it im not a grass rebus im not asking you to be one i just need you to answer a question its not even a question about darryl and and a spot of payback might well be forthcoming there was silence on the line as hammell considered this rebus listened to him exhale whats the question there may be a followup depending on how you answer just ask me the damned question okay then one of the kids opposite had come to the window they waved at rebus he waved back where would you bury a body he asked hammell as the kid waved again this time with a huge gaptoothed grin a forest rebus was leaving his tenement building pulling the door shut behind him when he saw siobhan clarke standing on the pavement got page with you he asked looking to left and right no so what can i do for you i was a bit worried thats all worried youve fallen off the radar maybe it escaped your attention but im not on the books any more all the same what she studied him closely i was right youve got that look in your eyes somethings brewing nothings brewing and suddenly he gets all defensive he opened his arms in a show of innocence but he wasnt fooling her where are you off to she asked just out mind if i tag along yes not heading to the pub then christs sake siobhan rebus made an exasperated sound theres just something i have to do does it happen to involve kenny magrath it might he conceded and naturally youll be sticking to the letter of the law im not the police im not even a civvy working for the police and having a reallife detective along for the ride wouldnt help at all he stared at her then shook his head slowly you should listen to fox siobhan to keep rising through the ranks you need to steer well clear of the likes of me he prodded his chest with his thumb to drive the point home a rise through the ranks that turns me into the likes of james page or malcolm fox she made show of considering this somehow your way of doing things is just that bit more fun no he said shaking his head again yes clarke countered tell me what youve got in mind rebus rubbed at his jaw if i do will you bugger off home and leave me to it it was her turn to shake her head thought not he said frank hammell was waiting for them in a fastfood restaurant next to a petrol station the place was brightly lit showing how much colour hammell had lost from his face his hair needed combing and grey stubble showed on his cheeks he was nursing a coffee the burger in front of him not even half eaten and his eyes darted everywhere his whole body seeming to tense with each new customer through the door you reckon hell come after you rebus asked sliding into the cubicle clarke was fetching drinks from the counter orange juice for her and tea for him you didnt say youd be bringing anyone hammell snapped back shes not here not officially rebus slid further over to make room for clarke who offered a nod of greeting to hammell a greeting he ignored focusing on a couple of newcomers to the restaurant i reckon the little turds capable of anything he muttered eventually in answer to rebuss original question wouldnt he have made his move at the club hammell shook his head too many witnesses youve obviously given it some thought what else am i going to do if i so much as pick up the phone to gail he says hell tell her about annette and me hes even got keys to my house hammells eyes were filling with anger if i can just get him on his own ill throttle the bastard duly noted but how about if we take him instead hammell looked at rebus as if seeing him for the first time is this a setup definitely not what then theres a result im after and darryl christies part of it i dont understand best keep it that way hammell studied rebus intently then switched to clarke and back to rebus again what do you need me to do remember that question i asked yes rebus reached into his pocket and took out the road map of scotland just show me he said afterwards they walked hammell back to the car park he had yet to get rid of the range rover bit conspicuous rebus warned him garage that sold me it offered fifteen to take it back hammell complained its worth three times that all the same hammell gestured towards rebuss saab want to swap fifteen plus yours i cant do that frank hammell got into his own car started the engine and headed at speed towards the main road rebus unlocked the saab clarke sliding into the passenger seat that would have been a good trade she said the things me and this old beast have been through rebus patted the steering wheel money doesnt come into it so what now she asked as she did up her seat belt now rebus answered we start planning planning what exactly how to give kenny magrath the fright of his life he made the call sunday lunchtime using the number on the card darryl christie had given him whoever it was who answered rebus didnt recognise the voice i need to speak to your boss he explained what boss might that be dont be daft son give darryl the name john rebus and tell him to phone me back then he hung up and waited not quite three minutes had passed when his mobile trilled im listening darryl christie said no niceties no small talk everything changed well that was fine with rebus the guy youre looking for is kenny magrath he lives with his wife in a house in rosemarkie i can give you the address i know about him christie interrupted it was all over the net hes been checked out by dempseys lot and let go thats as may be rebus said but hear what ive got to say then decide for yourself youve got two minutes it took rebus a bit longer than that to lay out his reasoning the van at the petrol station the retirement of gregor magrath the way kenny magrath had acted when confronted there was silence on the line when he finished then darryl christies voice why are you telling me because i cant get to him hes made too good a job of covering his tracks are you taping this if i am im about to sign my own arrest warrant he has to disappear darryl and it has to look like hes done a runner otherwise the pair of us might come under the magnifying glass cant have his body being found bodies have a habit of turning up though dont they depends where theyre left are you inviting yourself to the party no rebus assured him the less you tell me the better magrath has a workshop he uses a garage across from the pub at the far end of the village goes there first thing in the morning and when he knocks off in the evening id say evening would be best its nice and dark by five oclock his van cant be left behind not if hes supposed to have scarpered in it youve given this some thought ive not had much else to do you said it yourself dempsey proved less than useless when i went to her you know what ill do to you if this is a stitchup yes this isnt some trick caffertys come up with no and whats stopping me from going straight to this bastards house and kicking his door down for one thing he has neighbours for another youd have to do something about his wife my ways better you take him to woods somewhere plenty of forests up north i can suggest a few if you like rebuss voice trailed off as he waited to see what christie would say not necessary was the answer which was good news it meant he already had a spot in mind i reckon hes a creature of habit rebus went on trying to keep the emotion out of his voice likes his dinner ready when he comes home that means his wife will start to worry sooner rather than later if hes half an hour behind schedule and not answering his phone shes going to go out looking and it wont be long after that before she calls it in not a problem theres a place you can take the van want me to tell you i just want to make sure this is done right for both our sakes no qualms not a one were not going to speak again you and me as long as i can close the file im happy call it a little retirement present im giving myself if this works out i might chip in a clock for your mantelpiece on the other hand if it doesnt darryl christie ended the call without bothering to finish the threat rebus stared at his phone until the screen went blank well siobhan clarke said she was standing in the living room hands cupped around a mug of coffee rebus rose from his chair and poured himself a drink then thought better of it and pushed it aside instead he lit a cigarette heading to the sash window and pulling it open so clarke couldnt complain promising he decided blowing smoke through the gap no more than that did he mention which forest rebus shook his head but he knows about the one his old boss used from time to time and its perfect not much more than fortyfive minutes from the black isle he wont want to be riding around roads he doesnt know with someone hes just abducted not when theres a wife at home readying to call the police and the van im guessing dumped in a loch or sent for scrap why not make it look like an accident van goes off the road with magrath at the wheel too much can go wrong any halfdecent sceneofcrime unit would smell something clarke lowered herself on to the sofa rebuss map was there a circle drawn around a wooded area just outside aviemore he wont go rushing up there tonight darryls the careful sort hes going to spend time mulling it over meaning he might still get cold feet always a possibility but you dont think so no and you dont think hell touch mrs magrath hes not the type hell look for the flaws in the plan maybe try to work out if theres any other way how many men will he take two or three one of them to drive away the van do we need reinforcements i could ask christine or ronnie rebus was shaking his head i feel bad enough letting you get involved as if you had a choice she was smiling at him above the rim of the coffee mug remember youre the only cop here if fox and his crew ever get wind of this id be scuppering my chances of joining the complaints you want to work for fox he told me id be good at it i think he meant it in a kind way and and what do you fancy it id have to take a vow of silence wouldnt i about me you mean rebus blew another stream of smoke out of the window the stuff i could tell them true enough he said stubbing out the cigarette on the ledge before flicking it into the void on monday they were in position by three thirty parked on rosemarkies narrow main street clarkes audi tucked in between two other vehicles pointing south rebuss reasoning after grabbing magrath this was the way they would come unless they wanted to end up in cromarty lets hope youre right clarke had replied the shop windows were illuminated and locals walked past carrying bags of groceries rebus and clarke had checked out magraths workshop but there was nowhere to park that wasnt conspicuous rebus was passing the time explaining to clarke that it was darryl christie who had abducted thomas robertson darryls the one whos always surfing the web thats how hed have learned wed lifted someone from the road crew at pitlochry easy enough to find him have him followed to the tummel arms and then snatch him and smack him about to get him to talk but then comes news that it cant have been him after all so they dump him in aberdeen why aberdeen rebus watched as a car drove past no one he knew inside maybe because frank hammell has friends there meaning wed go on thinking it was him behind it and not his spotty wee lieutenant clarke nodded her understanding something i wanted to ask you rebus went on what fox told me he was easing off for the time being you didnt have a word with him did you no says he wants me back in cid so he can nab me good and proper do you believe him im not sure have you signed the forms theres still a good chance ill fail the physical hard to disagree thanks a bunch another car driven by a young woman will magrath pass by here clarke asked depends where hes been working assuming hes started back to work in the first place i didnt say the plan was perfect rebus checked the time daylight was fading fast when he looked up again he saw the black mercedes mclass clicketyclick he told clarke turning away so his face wouldnt be visible to anyone in the approaching vehicle clarke had her own head angled forward as if fussing with the audis stereo four of them i think she said as she straightened up again peering into the rearview mirror darryl in the passenger seat rebus confirmed not a bad start she exhaled releasing some of the tension theyre even a bit early they need time to scope the place out if christies the cautious sort hell be looking for traps she was starting the ignition whats your thinking move the car a bit further along maybe tuck ourselves down a side road we know what were on the lookout for a huge black merc heading south youre worried theyll come back and spot us yes rebus nodded his agreement it didnt take long to find what they needed they parked again facing the main drag and clarke switched the engine off before changing her mind and switching it on again a bit of warmth she explained turning the heater up good idea the dashboard gave the outside temperature as five degrees there would be a frost later the skies were clear a couple of stars already visible rebus held his hands in front of the air vent rubbing them together twenty minutes later they both spotted magraths van the name prominent on its side headed for the lockup rebus stated theres still time for a change of strategy clarke argued confront them then and there rebus was shaking his head we need him scared remember my ways less risky just dont lose them are you saying my drivings not up to it rebus gave her a look then focused on the road a couple of minutes for kenny magrath to reach the lockup bundled into the car theyd want to be quick but what if someone from the pub had stepped out for a cigarette or a bus full of inquisitive locals was passing rebus had seldom known time to creep so slowly and just as he was about to open his mouth and say something to that effect van clarke called out heading back the way it had come magrath on its side the shape behind the steering wheel was not kenny magrath too short too wiry the black merc was only a few seconds behind its occupants hard to discern clarke began to follow keeping her distance when a delivery lorry came up behind her she slowed to let it overtake shed studied the road map knew there were few options for the merc there were manoeuvres the driver could make to check he wasnt being followed slowing to a near stop pulling over and biding his time doubling back and finding a different route but right now the audi was hidden from view by the delivery lorry the first real decision came at munlochy the merc stayed on the a next itll be the tore roundabout rebus said then the a south if your hunch is right clarke cautioned so little faith rebus managed the beginnings of a smile but clarke knew he was nervous it wasnt her driving that was making him grip the passengerside door handle when they reached the dual carriageway the convoy followed the signs to inverness rebus craned his neck to see what was happening past the lorry theyre leaving it for dead he informed clarke so she signalled and moved out to overtake the mercedes had passed the van but seemed to want to stay close to it they could be strangling magrath right now you know clarke commented they could rebus agreed might have nothing but a corpse on our hands at the other end we might at that i dont suppose youd lose much sleep im not a monster siobhan but i suppose id cope somehow over the kessock bridge and into inverness staying on the a and heading south out of the city so far so good clarke said under her breath you planning to stay on their tail all the way give it another mile or two after which she put her foot down guiding the audi into the outside lane and eventually overtaking the van pulling in between it and the merc before flooring the accelerator and passing that car too the clock said ninetyfive as she watched the headlights behind her recede theyre keeping to a steady sixtyfive dont want to get pulled over do they rebus suggested a further few miles on a sign indicated a layby clarke slowed the audi to a stop behind an articulated lorry which was parked up for the night she switched off the headlights and slouched down in her seat rebus doing the same as far as he was able he could feel the sweat on his back his shirt clinging to him here they come clarke said eyes on the wing mirror not just the merc and the van but a few other vehicles in their wake it was completely dark now no chance the audi could have been clocked not the speed the convoy was going clarke switched her lights on again and got back on the road no shortage of disposal sites between here and there she offered hes not got the experience siobhan something tells me hell stick to what he knows places hes been shown or told about twenty minutes later they passed a sign telling them the aviemore spur was just ahead where it all started siobhan clarke said i suppose rebus replied watching as a few flakes of snow began to fall a couple of cars were signalling to turn left the merc clarke guessed id put money on it just not necessarily my money but yes the merc was turning off while the van stayed on the a and its appointment with a scrapyard or similar were sure magraths not trussed up in the back of his own van clarke asked as sure as we can be the audi followed the merc still a couple of other vehicles separating them i think this is working clarke offered insofar as they havent spotted us all too soon though the covering vehicles were peeling off into newbuild housing developments leaving only the merc and the audi fifty yards between them should i stop and let him get ahead i dont know rebus admitted we could overtake and block the route dont tell me magrath wont be scared rigid by now not yet she looked at him again his eyes were fixed on the merc his left hand still gripping the door handle they were in deepening countryside heading away from aviemore into a wilderness of mountain and forest i could overtake again clarke suggested breaking off as she saw that without signalling the car in front was turning off the road on to a dirt track there was a gate but it had been left open clarke drove past and kept driving while rebus watched the xs tail lights until they were swallowed up by trees were safe he said clarke stopped the car and did a threepoint turn switching off her lights and crawling towards the open gate just like hammell said she muttered the merc had disappeared from view clarke slid down her window and listened for its engine still on the move then we move too the audi began to head cautiously up the track both front windows lowered despite the flurries and the sharp night air rebus stuck his head out watching and listening the route wound uphill into a pinescented forest reminding him of edderton when they reached a fork clarke stopped the car turning off the engine as a precaution hear anything no rebus told her no lights either you think theyve stopped he had lowered his voice maybe do we go left or right you tell me grounds pretty well frozen hard to tell if there are tracks there or not and you an exboy scout rebus considered for a moment right he said then no left sure fairly you mean youre guessing fiftyfifty chance siobhan i dont think magrath would be thrilled by those odds how about we stick the lights on full beam and drive like hell or go the rest of the way on foot on foot her eyes had widened a little her brow furrowing on foot together or separately bloody hell siobhan do i have to make all the decisions the bag was removed from kenny magraths head hed been thumped a few times and his eyes stung he blinked the world back into focus there was a nearfull moon in a hazy sky and the smell of moss magrath was breathing through his nose his mouth taped shut hands bound behind him three men made a sort of triangle around him they seemed very tall until he worked out he was upright in a shallow grave he tried to scream a bubble of blood popping from one nostril when he started scrabbling out of the pit one of the men took a step forward and raised a shovel magrath knew what that meant and stayed put the car theyd brought him in stood a dozen or so yards away lights dipped illuminating the scene picking out occasional slowmotion snowflakes you killed my sister someone said magrath looked around unable to pick out the speaker until darryl christie bent a little at the waist establishing eye contact he was dressed in a dark poloneck denims and trainers magrath shook his head feeling a fresh wave of nausea as his brain throbbed with pain this grave was dug for someone else christie went on wrong guy that time youre the one ive been looking for so dont try to deny it but magrath couldnt help himself his muffled voice rising in pitch christie turned away as if bored by the performance he stretched a hand out towards the man next to him the shovel was placed in it christie felt it for heft and balance raised it over his shoulder and swung it a few times for practice magrath was reduced to weeping now eyes screwed shut his knees gave way and he landed heavily on the dirt chin resting against the edge of the grave ssshhh christie told him like a parent to a child then he arched his body back lifting the shovel high and bringing it down so that it connected with the ground directly in front of magrath magraths eyes flew open focused on the implements gleaming edge christie twisted it free and held the shovel in front of him as he crouched down directly in front of the tearful snotnosed magrath you didnt think it was going to be quick did you he asked plenty of damage to be done before then all those lives you took just for kicks eh no real reason nothing that can be explained its not a prison theyll put you in its a nuthouse board games and daytime tv walks in the garden and a friendly psychiatrist reckon thats fair do you all those lives you wrecked the living as well as the dead time for some proper payback time for you to feel pain he rose again and lifted the shovel but only to waist height this time preparing to swing it at kenny magraths head thats enough christie swivelled towards the voice rebus had his hands bunched by his sides as if spoiling for a fight what are you doing here christie called out arresting you siobhan clarke said stepping into the clearing and holding open her id christies men looked to their boss for instructions christie pointed at rebus youre the one who wanted this in the first place he complained clarke ignored him telling him he was under arrest christie had eyes only for rebus and those eyes were burning two of you against three of us he announced look around plenty of room for a few more graves he might be stupid clarke interrupted gesturing towards rebus but im not backups about five minutes away what do we do one of christies men was asking his boss rebus recognised him marcus doorman and driver christie took a moment to weigh up the options were going he said then turning towards magrath this isnt over youll be seeing my face again he swung a kick connecting with the side of magraths head before starting to march towards the mercedes clarke looked to rebus but rebus wasnt moving the two men began to follow their boss marcus forging ahead so he could hold open the cars passenger door christie gave rebus a final baleful look tossed the shovel on to the ground and got in after the doors had closed clarke took a step forward were letting them go did you fancy our chances rebus asked he walked over to magrath peeling away the tape theyre getting away magrath spluttered flecks of pink saliva flying from his mouth the engine of the mercedes had roared into life the car reversing back the way it had come yes rebus said starting to loosen the ties around magraths wrists they were going to kill me we noticed magrath seemed confused he looked from rebus to clarke and back again youll catch them though the backup no backup rebus informed him that was just di clarke saving our skins they were going to kill me magrath repeated more to himself than anyone else a word of thanks wouldnt go amiss what never mind rebus grabbed magrath by the arm coaxing him out of the shallow grave they took my van you wont be seeing it again they were going to so you keep saying probably in shock clarke explained magrath realised he was being led from the clearing where are we going were giving you a lift home cars this way but theyre this way too best if we get a move on then before it dawns on them theres no cavalry in the vicinity wait a minute magrath said did you say a lift home where else magrath stopped moving i cant go home they know where i live where maggie lives they might leave her alone its you theyre after then why did you let them go know what theyll say if questioned theyll say they were just giving you a fright thats if they say anything at all but you saw them rebus gave a shrug and fixed his eyes on clarke seems that saving his hide isnt quite enough weve done what we can clarke replied you could always make a run for it rebus suggested to the man in front of him get yourself a new identity it would have to be a long way from here though darryl christies got a lot of friends what about maggie and gregor theyve done what they can time for you to make a few decisions magrath looked around him his mind reeling he was trembling and not just from the cold i cant i dont your decision rebus repeated sliding his hands into his pockets magraths eyes seemed to clear he met rebuss gaze what do i do he asked tell me youre asking my advice magrath nodded and another tremor ran through him rebus gave a glance in clarkes direction before seeming to think for a moment ill give it then he said but on one condition magrath blinked a couple of times yes you leave us out of it magraths eyelids fluttered again out of what your confession rebus told him they dropped him outside the police station on burnett road rebus had called ahead and gavin arnold was waiting rebus and clarke stayed in the car and watched as arnold led kenny magrath inside rebus had his window down so he could smoke a cigarette his hand was shaking but only a little he might change his mind you know clarke said quietly he might rebus agreed on the other hand a secure units about as safe from darryl christie as hes likely to get you definitely got that across to him she paused speaking of which rebus turned to face her christie he watched as she nodded depends what kenny magrath says in his statement if he leaves out the forest christie was going to kill him entrapment theyd call it in court rebus peered out through the windscreen towards the darkness i led him into it after all then we should get going before dempsey arrives youre really planning to let darryl christie off the hook im not the cop here siobhan he turned in her direction again your call rather than mine clarke focused her attention on the door to the police station and the illuminated police sign above it theyll know someone got to him pretty good chance your name will crop up just so long as yours doesnt besides im a civilian remember i was watching his workshop for want of anything better to do saw him being abducted and decided to follow then ended up saving his skin thats if he opts to throw my name into the pot there was silence in the car for a moment until clarke broke it we didnt ask him why he did it the killings or the photos both i suppose i doubt he knows the answer to that himself more silence clarke was still facing away from rebus when she spoke for a moment there when christie raised that shovel it flashed through my mind that you were going to let it happen really yes really magrath dead and christie on a murder charge yes well that would have been a result too i suppose and its results that matter rather than how you get them used to be the way not now though maybe not so much he leaned back in his seat that grave wasnt meant for magrath you know no rebus shook his head it was thomas robertsons when i saw him in the hospital i happened to mention a shallow grave it spooked him and now we know why hed been taken there and shown it scared him stupid but christie let him go rebus nodded darryls not a killer siobhan maybe one of his boys would have taken care of magrath but whacking the ground with that shovel was as close as darryl was going to get he seemed lost in thought for a moment you know what this means though im not sure it means i was right all along about that bloody song he flicked the cigarette away as clarke turned the key in the ignition what song she was asking as rebus began to wind the window up
