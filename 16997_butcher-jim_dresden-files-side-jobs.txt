jim butcher dresden filesside jobs table of contents something borrowed its my birthday too heorot day off backup the warrior last call love hurts aftermath a restoration of faith takes place before storm front this is the first of the dresden files stories chronologically and it was the first time i tried to write short fiction for the professional market i originally put it together as a class assignment at the university of oklahomas professional writing program more than two years before storm front found a home at roc this one wont win any awards because it is quite frankly a novice effort it was perhaps the third or fourth short story id ever written if you include projects in grade school i had barely learned to keep my feet under me as a writer and to some degree that shows in this piece certainly the editors to whom i submitted this story seemed to think it wasnt up to par for professional publication and i think that was a perfectly fair assessment read this story for what it isan anxious beginners first effort meant to be simple straightforward fun istruggled to hold on to the yowling child while fumbling a quarter into the pay phone and jamming down the buttons to dial nicks mobile ragged angel investigations nick answered his voice was tense i thought anxious its harry i said you can relax man i found her you did nick asked he let out a long exhalation oh jesus harry the kid lifted up one of her oxford shoes and mulekicked her leg back at my shin she connected hard enough to make me jump she looked like a parents dream at eight or nine years old with her dimples and dark pigtailseven in her streetstained schoolgirls uniform and she had strong legs i got a better hold on the girl and lifted her up off the ground again while she twisted and wriggled ow hold still let me go beanpole she responded turning to glower back at me before starting to kick again listen to me harry nick said youve got to let the kid go right this minute and walk away what i said nick the astors are going to give us twentyfive grand to return her before nine pm i got some bad news harry they arent going to pay us the money i winced ouch maybe i should just drop her off at the nearest precinct house then the news gets worse the parents reported the girl kidnapped the police band is sending two descriptions around town to chicago pd and they match guess who mickey and donald heh nick said i heard him flick his bic and take a drag we should be so lucky i guess its more embarrassing for mr and mrs highandmighty to have their kid run away than it is to have her kidnapped hell kidnapped girl gives them something to talk about at their parties for months makes them look richer and more famous than their friends too of course well be in jail but what the hell they came to us i protested that wont be the way they tell it dammit i said if you get caught with her it could be trouble for both of us the astors got connections ditch the girl and get back home you were there all night no nick i said i cant do that let the boys in blue bring her in thatll clear you and me both im up on north avenue and its after dark im not leaving a nineyearold girl out here by herself ten shouted the girl furious im ten you insensitive jerk she started kicking again and i kept myself more or less out of the way of her feet she sounds so cute just let her run harry and let the criminal types beware nick aw hell harry youre getting moral on me again i smiled but it felt tight on my mouth and my stomach churned with anger look well think of something just get down here and pick us up what happened to your car broke down this afternoon again what about the el im broke nick i need a ride i cant walk back to the office with her and i dont want to stand here in a public booth fighting her either so get down here and get us i dont want to spend time in jail because you cant salve your conscience harry what about your conscience i shot back nick was all bluster when it came down to the wire he couldnt have left the girl alone in that part of town either nick growled out something that sounded vaguely obscene then said fine whatever but i cant get across the river very easy so ill be on the far side of the bridge all you have to do is cross the bridge with her and stay out of sight police patrols in the area will be looking for you half an hour if youre not there im not waiting bad neighborhood have faith man ill be there we hung up without saying goodbye all right kid i said stop kicking me and lets talk to hell with you mister she shouted let me go before i break your leg i winced at the shrill note her voice hit and stepped away from the phone half dragging and half carrying her with me while i looked around nervously the last thing i needed was a bunch of good citizens running to the kids aid the streets were empty the gathering dark rushing in quickly to fill the spaces left by the broken streetlights there were lights in the windows but no one came out in response to the girls shouting it was the sort of neighborhood where people looked the other way and let live ah chicago you just gotta love big sprawling american cities aint modern living grand i could have been a real sicko rather than just looking like one and no one would have done anything it made me feel a little nauseated look i know youre angry right now but believe me im doing whats best for you she stopped kicking and glared up at me how should you know whats best for me im older than you wiser then why are you wearing that coat i looked down at my big black duster with its heavy mantle and long canvas folds flapping around my rather spare frame whats wrong with it it belongs on the set of el dorado she snapped who are you supposed to be ichabod crane or the marlboro man i snorted im a wizard she gave me a look of skepticism you can really only get from children who have recently gone through the sobering trauma of discovering there is no santa claus ironically there is but he cant operate on the sort of scale that used to make everyone believe in him youve got to be kidding me she said i found you didnt i she frowned at me how did you find me i thought that spot was perfect i continued walking toward the bridge it would have been for another ten minutes or so then that dumpster would have been full of rats looking for something to eat the girls expression turned faintly green rats i nodded with luck maybe i could win the kid over good thing your mother had your brush in her purse i was able to get a couple of hairs from it so i sighed so i used a little thaumaturgy and it led me straight to you i had to walk most of the way but straight to you thaumawhat questions were better than kicks any day i kept answering them heck i like to answer questions about magic professional pride maybe thaumaturgy its ritual magic you draw symbolic links between actual persons places or events and representative models then you invest a little energy to make something happen on the small scale and something happens on the large scale as well the second i was distracted with answering her question the kid bent her head and bit my hand i yelled something i probably shouldnt have around a kid and jerked my hand away the kid dropped to the ground agile as a monkey and took off toward the bridge i shook my hand growled at myself and took off after her she was fast her pigtails flying out behind her her shoes and stained kneesocks flashing she got to the bridge first it was an ancient twolane affair that arched over the chicago river she hurled herself out onto it wait i shouted after her dont she didnt know this town like i did sucker she called back her voice merry she kept on running that is until a great rubbery hairy arm slithered out from beneath a manhole cover at the apex of the bridge and wrapped its greasy fingers around one of her ankles the kid screamed in sudden terror pitching forward onto the asphalt and raking the skin from both knees she turned and twisted kicking at her attacker blood was a dark stain on her socks in the glow of the few functioning streetlights i cursed beneath my breath and raced toward her along the bridge my lungs laboring the hand tightened its grip and started dragging her toward the manhole i could hear deep growling laughter coming from the darkness in the hole that led down to the understructure of the bridge she screamed what is it what is it make it let go kid i shouted i ran toward the manhole jumped and came down as hard as i could on the hairy arm right at the wrist the heels of both hiking boots thumping down onto the grimy flesh a bellow erupted from the manhole and the fingers loosened the girl twisted her leg and though it cost her one of her expensive oxfords and one kneesock she dragged herself free of its grasp sobbing i gathered her up and backpedaled away turning so that i wasnt leaving my back to the manhole the troll shouldnt have been able to squeeze his way out of a hole that small but he did first came that grimy arm followed by a lumpy shoulder and then his malformed head and hideous face he looked at me and growled jerking his way out of the hole with rubbery ease until he stood in the middle of the bridge between me and the far side of the river like some professional wrestler who had fallen victim to a correspondence course for plastic surgeons in one hand he held a meat cleaver approximately two feet long with a bone handle and suspiciouslooking stains of dark brown on it harry dresden the troll rumbled wizard deprive gogoth of his lawful prey he whipped the cleaver left and right it made a little whistling sound i lifted my chin and set my jaw its never smart to let a troll see that youre afraid of him what are you talking about gogoth you know as well as i do that mortals arent all fair game anymore the unseelie accords settled that the trolls face split into a truly disgusting leer naughty children he rumbled naughty children still mine he narrowed his eyes and they started burning with malicious hunger give now the troll rolled toward me a few paces gathering momentum i lifted my right hand forced out a little will and the silver ring upon my third finger abruptly shone with a clear cool light brighter than the illumination around us law of the jungle gogoth i said keeping my voice calm survival of the fittest you take another step and youre going to land smack in the too stupid to live category the troll growled not slowing and raised one meaty fist think about it darkspawn i snarled the light pouring from my ring took on a hellish almost nuclear tone one more step and youre vapor the troll came to a lumbering halt and his rubberslime lips drew back from fetid fangs no he snarled drool slithered down his fangs and spattered on the asphalt as he stared at the girl she is mine wizard cannot interfere in this oh yeah i said watch me and with that i lowered my hand and with it the fierce silver light gave the troll my best sneer and turned in a flare of my dark duster to walk back to north avenue with long confident strides the girl stared over my shoulder her eyes wide is he coming after us i asked quietly she blinked back at the troll and then at me uh no hes just staring at you okay if he starts this way let me know so you can vapor him she asked her voice unsteady hell no so we can run but what about she touched the ring on my hand i lied kid what i lied i repeated im not a good liar but trolls arent too bright it was just a light show but he fell for it and thats all that counts i thought you said you were a wizard she accused me i am i replied annoyed a wizard who was at a seanceslashexorcism before breakfast then i had to find two wedding rings and a set of car keys and then i spent the rest of my day running after you im pooped you couldnt blow that that thing up its a troll sure i could i said cheerfully if i werent so wornout and if i were able to focus enough to keep from blowing myself up along with him my aims bad when im this tired we reached the edge of the bridge and i hoped gogoths territory i started to swing the girl down she was too big to be carrying then i saw her one bare foot dangling and the blood forming into dark scabs on her knees i sighed and started walking along north avenue if i could go down the long city block to the next bridge cross it and make my way back down the other block within half an hour i could still meet nick on the other side hows your leg i asked she shrugged though her face was pained okay i guess was that thing for real you bet i said but it was it wasnt human i said no but hell kid a lot of people i know arent really human look around us bundy manson those other animals right here in chicago youve got the vargassis working out of little italy the jamaican posses others animals worlds full of them the girl sniffed i glanced at her face she looked sad and too wise for her years my heart softened i know she said my parents are like that a little they dont think about anyone else really just themselves not even each otherexcept what they can do for each other and im just some toy that should get stuck in the closet and dragged out when people come over so i can be prettier and more perfect than their toys the rest of the time im in their way hey come on i said its not that bad is it she glanced at me and then away im not going back to them she said i dont care who you are or what you can do you cant make me go back to them theres where youre wrong i said im not going to leave you down here i heard you talking to your friend she said my parents are trying to screw you over why are you still doing this i have another six months to work for a licensed investigator before i can get a license of my own and i got this stupid thing about leaving kids in the middle of big mean cities after dark at least down here no one tries to lie and tell me that they care mister i see all these disney shows about how much parents love their kids how theres some sort of magical bond of love but its a lie like you and that troll she laid her head against my shoulder and i could feel the exhaustion in her body as she sagged against me theres no magic i fell silent for several paces as i carried her it was hard to hear that from a kid a tenyearold girls world should be full of music and giggling and notes and dolls and dreamsnot harsh barren jaded reality if there was no light in the heart of a child a little girl like this then what hope did any of us have a few paces later i realized something i hadnt been admitting to myself a quiet cool little voice had been trying to tell me something i hadnt been willing to listen to i was in the business of wizardry to try to help people to try to make things better but no matter how many evil spirits i confronted no matter how many wouldbe black magicians i tracked down there was always something elsesomething worsewaiting for me in the dark no matter how many lost children i found there would always be ten times as many who disappeared for good no matter how much i did how much trash i cleaned up it was only a drop in the ocean pretty heavy thoughts for a tired and beaten guy like me my arms burdened with the girls weight flashing lights made me look up the mouth to one of the alleys between the buildings had been sealed off with police tape and four cars blue bulbs awhirl were parked on the street around the alley a couple of emts were toting a covered shape out of the alley on a stretcher the flashing strobes of cameras lit the alleyway in bursts of white i came to a stop hesitant what the girl murmured police maybe i should hand you over i felt her weary shrug theyre only going to take me home i dont care she sagged against me again i swallowed the astors were chicagos elite crowd they carried enough clout around the old town to get a bum wouldbe private investigator put away for a good long time and they could afford the best of lawyers its a lousy world dresden the cool little voice told me and the good guys dont win unless they have an expensive attorney too youd be in jail before you could blink my mouth twisted into a bitter smile as one of the uniform cops a woman noticed me and cast a long frown in my direction i turned around and started walking the other way hey the cop said i kept walking hey she said again and i heard brisk footsteps on the sidewalk i hurried along into the dark and stepped into the first alley the shadows behind a pile of crates created an ideal refuge and i carried the girl into it with me i crouched there in the darkness and waited while the cops footsteps came near and then passed on by i waited in the dark feeling all the heaviness and darkness settle into my skin into my flesh the girl just shivered and lay against me unmoving just leave me she said finally go over the bridge the troll will let you cross the bridge if im not with you yes i said so go on ill walk up to the police after youre gone or something she was lying im not sure how i could tell but i could she would go to the bridge im told that bravery is doing what you need to do even when youre afraid but sometimes i wonder if courage isnt a lot more complicated than that sometimes i think courage is pulling yourself up off the ground one more time doing one more set of paperwork even when you dont want to maybe thats just plain stubbornness i dont know it didnt matter not to me im a wizard i dont really belong here our world sucks it might suit the trolls and the vampires and all those nasty leering things that haunt our nightmares while we clutch our physics books to our chests and reassure ourselves that they cannot exist but im not a part of it i wont be a part of it i took a breath in the dark and asked whats your name she was silent for a moment and then said in a very uncertain voice faith faith i said i smiled so that she could hear it my names harry dresden hi she said her voice a whisper hi have you ever seen something like this i cupped my hand summoned some of the last dregs of my power and cast a warm glowing light into the ring on my right hand it lit faiths face and i could see on her smooth cheeks the streaks of the tears i had not heard she shook her head here i said and took the ring from my finger i slipped it onto hers over her right thumb where it hung a bit loose the light died away as i did it leaving us in the dark again let me show you something battery went out she mumbled i dont have money for another one faith do you remember the very best day of your life she was quiet for a minute then she said her voice a bare whisper yes a christmas when gremma was still alive gremma was nice to me tell me about it i urged quietly covering her hand with my own i felt her shrug gremma came over christmas eve we played games she would play with me and we stayed up on the floor by the christmas tree waiting for santa claus she let me open just one present for christmas eve it was one shed gotten me faith took a shuddering breath it was a dolly a real baby dolly mother and father had gotten me barbie stuff the whole line for that year they said that if i left them all in the original boxes they would be worth a lot of money later but gremma listened to what i really wanted then i heard it the tiny smile in her voice gremma cared about me i moved my hand and a soft pinkish light flowed up out of the ring around her thumb a loving gentle warmth i heard faith draw in a little gasp of surprise and then a delighted smile spread over her mouth but how she whispered i gave her a smile magic i said the best kind a little light in the dark she looked up at me studying my face my eyes i shied away from the perception of that gaze i need to go back dont i she asked i brushed a stray bit of hair from her forehead there are people who love you faith or who one day will even if you cant see them beside you right here right now theyre out there but if you let the dark get into your eyes you might never find them so its best to keep a little light with you along the way do you think you can remember that she nodded up at me her face lit by the light from the ring whenever it gets too dark think of the good things you have the good times youve had it will help i promise she leaned against me and gave me a simple trusting hug i felt my cheeks warm up as she did aw shucks we need to go i told her weve got to get across the bridge and meet my friend nick she chewed on her lip her expression immediately worried but the troll i winked leave him to me the girl didnt feel anywhere near so heavy as when i carried her back i studied the bridge as we approached maybe if i was lucky id be able to sprint across without the troll being able to stop me yeah and maybe one day id go to an art museum and become wellrounded bridges are a trolls specialty either because of some magic or just because of aptitude you never get across the bridge without facing the troll thats life i guess i set the girl down on the ground next to me and stepped out onto the bridge all right faith i said whatever happens you run across that bridge my friend nick is going to pull up on the far side any minute now what about you i gave her a casual roll of my neck im a wizard i said i can handle him faith gave me another look of supreme skepticism and fumbled to hold my hand her fingers felt very small and very warm inside of mine and a fierce surge of determination coursed through me no matter what happened i would let no harm come to this child we walked out onto the bridge the few lights that had been burning brightly earlier were gonegogoths work doubtless night reigned over the bridge and the chicago river gurgled by smooth and cold and black below us im scared faith whispered hes just a big bully i told her face him down and hell back off i hoped very much that was true we kept walking and skirted wide around the manhole at the apex of the bridge i kept my body between faith and the entrance to the trolls lair gogoth must have been counting on that i heard faith scream again and whirled my head to see the trolls thick hairy arm stretched up over the edge of the bridge while the troll clung to the side of the bridge like some huge overweight spider i snarled and stomped his fingers once more and the troll bellowed in rage faith slipped free and i half hurled her toward the far side of the bridge run faith the trolls arm swept my legs out from beneath me and he came surging up over the railing at the side of the bridge too supple and swift for his bulk his burning eyes focused on the fleeing faith and more of his slimy drool spattered out of his mouth he scythed his cleaver through the air and crouched to leap after the child i got my feet under me screamed and threw myself at the trolls leg swinging my long legs around to tangle with the creatures he roared in fury and went down in a tumble with me i heard myself cackling and decided without a doubt that i had at least one screw loose the troll caught me by the corner of my jacket and threw me against the railing hard enough to make me see stars wizard gogoth snarled spitting drool and foam the cleaver swept the air again and the troll stalked toward me now you die and gogoth chew your bones i gathered myself to my feet but it was too late there was no way i could run or throw myself over the railing in time faith screamed harry and a brilliant flash of pink light flooded the bridge making the troll whip his ugly head toward the far side of the river i ducked to my left and ran toward faith and away from the troll looking up i saw nicks car roaring toward the bridge with enough speed to tell me my partner had seen that something was going on the troll followed me and though i had gained a few paces on him i had the sinking realization that the beast was lighter on his feet than i was there was a whistling sound of the cleaver cutting the air and i felt something skim past my scalp i bobbed to my right ducking and the second swipe missed by an even narrower margin i stumbled and fell and the troll was on top of me in a heartbeat i rolled in time to see him lift his bloodstained cleaver high above him and i felt his drool splatter onto my chest wizard the troll bellowed there was a yell and then the cop the one who had followed us before hurled herself onto the trolls back and locked her nightstick across his throat she gave the stick a practiced twist and the trolls eyes bulged the huge cleaver clanged as it tumbled from gogoths grip and hit the pavement the cop leaned back making the trolls spine arch into a bowbut this wasnt a man she was dealing with the thing twisted his head squirmed and popped out of her grip then opened his jaws in a frenzied roar that literally blew the patrolwomans cap off her head and sent her stumbling back with a wideeyed stare the troll maddened slammed one fist into the pavement cracking it and drew the other back to drive toward her skull hey ugly i shouted the troll turned in time to see me grunt and swing the massive cleaver at his side the rotten grimy flesh just beneath his ribs split open with a howl of sound and a burst of motion gogoth leaned his head back and let out a highpitched wailing yowl i backed off knowing what came next the poor cop stared in whitefaced horror as the trolls wound split and dozens hundreds thousands of tiny wriggling figures squalling and squealing poured out of the split in his flesh the massive thews of the beast deflated like old basketballs slowly sinking in upon themselves as the bridge became littered with a myriad of tiny trolls their ugly little heads no bigger than the head of a president on a coin they poured out of gogoth in a flood spilling onto the bridge in a writhing wriggling horde the trolls cheeks hollowed and his eyes vanished his mouth opened in a slackjawed yawn and as the leathery grimy sack of tiny trolls emptied he sank to the ground until he lay there like a discarded disgusting raincoat the cop stared mouth wide attempting to form words of a prayer or a curse nicks headlights whirled and spilled across the bridge and with twice ten thousand screams of protest the tiny trolls dispersed before the light in all directions a few seconds later there were only myself faith the cop and nick who was approaching us across the bridge faith threw herself at me and gave me a quick hug around the waist her eyes were bright with excitement that was the most disgusting thing i have ever seen i want to be a wizard when i grow up that was was the cop said stunned she was short stocky and the loss of her cap revealed tightly braided pale hair i winked down at faith and nodded to the cop a troll i know i walked over to the cap and dusted it off a few trolls squealing in protest fell to the street and scampered away the cop watched with stunned eyes hey thanks a lot for the help officeri squinted down at her badgemurphy i smiled and offered her the hat she took it with numb fingers oh jesus i really have lost it she blinked a few times and then scowled up at my face you youre the perp on the astor kidnapping i opened my mouth to defend myself but i neednt have bothered are you kidding faith astor sneered this buffoon kidnap me he couldnt bum a cigarette off the marlboro man she turned toward me and gave me a wink then she offered both her wrists to murphy i admit it officer i ran away take me to the pokey and throw away the key murphy to her credit seemed to be handling things fairly well for someone who had just confronted the monster under the bed she recovered her nightstick and went to faith examining her for injuries before directing a suspicious gaze at nick and me hoo boy nick said planting his stocky bulk squarely beside mine here it comes you get the top bunk stilts but im not going to pick up your soap in the shower the cop looked at me and nick then she looked at the girl then more thoughtfully she looked at the leathery lump that had been gogoth the troll her eyes flashed back to nick and me and she said arent you two the ones who run ragged angel the agency that looks for lost kids i run it nick said his voice resigned he works for me yeah what he said i threw in just to let nick know he wasnt going to the big house alone murphy nodded and eyed the girl are you all right honey faith sniffed and smiled up at murphy a little hungry and i could use something to clean up these scrapes but other than that im quite well and these two didnt kidnap you faith snorted please murphy nodded and then jabbed her nightstick at nick and me ive got to call this in you two vanish before my partner gets here she glanced down at faith and winked faith grinned up at her in return murphy took the girl back toward the far side of the bridge and the other police units nick and i ambled back toward his car nicks broad honest face was set in an expression of nervous glee i cant believe it he said i cant believe that happened was that the troll whatshisname that was gogoth i said cheerfully nothing bigger than a breadcrumb is going to be bothered by trolls on this bridge for a long long time i cant believe it nick said again i thought we were so dead i cant believe it i glanced back over the bridge on the far side the girl was standing up on her tiptoes waving soft pink light flowed from the ring on her right thumb i could see the smile on her face the cop was watching me too her expression thoughtful it turned into a smile modern living might suck and the world weve made can be a dark place but at least i dont have to be there alone i put an arm around nicks shoulders and grinned at him its like i keep telling you man youve got to have faith vignette takes place between death masks and blood rites this was a very short piece i wrote at the request of my editor jennifer heddle who needed it for some kind of promotional thingone of those free sampler booklets they sometimes hand out at conventions i believe i lost track of it in the clutter of life then realized the deadline was the following morning it probably would have been helpful to have remembered at seven or eight instead of at two am im not even sure i can claim to be the author of this piece since it was almost entirely written by a coalition of caffeine molecules and exhausted twitches isat on a stool in the cluttered laboratory beneath my basement apartment it was chilly enough to make me wear a robe but the dozen or so candles burning around the room made it look warm the phone book lay on the table in front of me i stared at my ad in the yellow pages harry dresdenwizard lost items found paranormal investigations consulting advice reasonable rates no love potions endless purses parties or other entertainment i looked up at the skull on the shelf above my lab table and said i dont get it flat harry said bob the skull flickering orange lights danced in the skulls eye sockets its flat i flipped through several pages yeah well most of them are i dont think they offer raised lettering bob rolled his eyelights not literally flat dimwit flat in the aesthetic sense it has no panache no moxy no chutzpah no what bobs skull turned to one side and banged what would have been its forehead against a heavy bronze candleholder after several thumps it turned back toward me and said its boring oh i said i rubbed at my jaw you think i should have gone fourcolor bob stared at me for a second and said i have nightmares about hell where all i do is add up numbers and try to have conversations with people like you i glowered up at the skull and nodded okay fine you think it needs more drama more anything drama would do or breasts i sighed and saw where that line of thought was going i am not going to hire a leggy secretary bob get over it i didnt say anything about legs but as long as were on the subject i set the yellow pages aside and picked up my pencil again im doing formulas here bob its formulae o maestro of latin and if you dont drum up some business you arent going to need those new spells for much of anything unless youre working on a spell to help you shoplift groceries i set the pencil down hard enough that the tip broke and i stared at bob in annoyance so what do you think it should say bobs eyelights brightened talk about monsters monsters are good give me a break im serious harry instead of that line about consulting and finding things put fiends foiled monsters mangled vampires vanquished demons demolished oh yeah i said that kind of alliteration will bring in the business it will it will bring in the nutso business i said bob i dont know if anyones told you this but most people dont believe that monsters and fiends and whatnot even exist most people dont believe in love potions either but youve got that in there i held on to a flash of bad temper the point i told bob is to have an advertisement that looks solid professional and reliable yeah advertising is all about lying bob said hey you suck at lying harry you really do you should trust me on this one no monsters i insisted fine fine bob said how about we do a positiveside spin then something like maidens rescued enchantments broken villains unmasked unicorns protected unicorns chicks are into unicorns i rolled my eyes its an ad for my investigative business not a dating service besides the only unicorn i ever saw tried to skewer me youre sort of missing the entire advertising is lying concept harry no unicorns i said firmly its fine the way it is no style at all bob complained i put on a mentally challenged accent style is as style does okay fine suppose we throw intelligence to the winds and print only the truth vampire slayer ghost remover faerie fighter werewolf exterminator police consultant foe of the foot soldiers of hell i thought about it for a minute then got a fresh piece of paper and wrote it down i stared at the words see bob said that would look really hot attract notice and it would be the truth what have you got to lose this weeks gas money i said finally too many letters besides lieutenant murphy would kill me if i went around blowing trumpets about how i help the cops youre hopeless bob said i shook my head no im not in this for the money then what are you in it for harry hell in the past few years youve been all but killed about a million times why do you do it i squinted up at the skull because someone has to hopeless bob repeated i smiled picked up a fresh pencil and went back to my formulasformulae pretty much bob sighed and fell quiet my pencil scratched over clean white paper while the candles burned warm and steady something borrowed from my big fat supernatural wedding edited by p n elrod takes place between dead beat and proven guilty i wrote this for the very first anthology in which id ever been invited to participate id met pat elrod at a convention and thought she was quite a cool person and when she asked me to take part in her anthology i was more than happy to do so when i wrote this story i was thinking that the alphas hadnt gotten nearly enough stage time in the series thus far and it seemed like a good opportunity to give them some more attention while at the same time showing the progression of their lives since their college days which i felt was best demonstrated by billy and georgias wedding inane trivia while i was in school writing the first three books of the dresden files my wife shannon watched ally mcbeal in the evenings often while i was plunking away at a keyboard i didnt pay too much attention to the show and it took me years to realize i had unconsciously named billy and georgia after those characters in ally mcbeal who knew tv really does rot your brain steel pierced my leg and my body went rigid with pain but i could not allow myself to move billy i growled through my teeth kill him billy the werewolf squinted up at me from his seat and said that might be a little extreme this is torture i said oh for crying out loud dresden billy said his tone amused hes just fitting the tux yanof the tailor a squat sturdy little guy who had recently immigrated to chicago from outer sloboviakastan or somewhere glared up at me with another dozen pins clutched between his lips and resentment in his eyes im better than six and a half feet tall it cant be fun to be told youve got to fit a tux to someone my height only a few hours before the wedding it ought to be kirby standing here i said yeah but it would be harder to fit the tux around the body cast and all those traction cables i keep telling you guys i said werewolves or not youve got to be more careful ordinarily i would not have mentioned billys talent for shapeshifting into a wolf in front of a stranger but yanof didnt speak a word of english evidently his skills with needle and thread were such that he had no pressing need to learn as chicagos resident wizard id worked with billy on several occasions and we were friends his bachelor party the night before had gotten interesting on the walk back to billys place when we happened across a ghoul terrorizing an old woman in a parking lot it hadnt been a pretty fight mostly because wed all had too many stripperinduced jello shots billys injuries had all been bruises and all to the body they wouldnt spoil the wedding alex had a nasty set of gashes on his throat from the ghouls clawlike nails but he could probably pass them off as particularly enthusiastic hickeys mitchell had broken two teeth when hed charged the ghoul but hit a wall instead he was going to be a dedicated disciple of anbesol until he got to the dentist all i had to remember the evening by was a splitting headache and not from the fight jello shots are far more dangerous if you ask me billys best man kirby had gotten unlucky the ghoul slammed him into a brick wall so hard that it broke both his legs and cracked a vertebra we handled him didnt we billy asked lets ask kirby i said look there isnt always going to be a broken metal fence post sticking up out of the ground like that billy we got lucky billys eyes went flat and he abruptly stood up all right he said his voice hard ive had just about enough of you telling me what i should and should not do harry you arent my father no i said but in fact he continued if i remember correctly the other alphas and i have saved your life twice now yes i said but his face turned red with anger billy wasnt tall but he was built like an armored truck but what you dont want to share the spotlight with any of us mere onetrick wonders dont you dare belittle what kirby did what the others have done and sacrificed i am a trained investigator instincts honed by years of observation warned me that billy might be angry great hostility i sense in you i said in a muppety voice billys steady glower continued for a few more seconds and then it broke he shook his head and looked away im sorry for my tone yanof jabbed me again but i ignored it you didnt sleep last night he shook his head again no excuse but between the fight and kirby andhe waved a vague handtoday i mean today ah i said cold feet billy took a deep breath well its a big step isnt it he shook his head and after next year most of the alphas are going to be done with school getting jobs he paused splitting up and thats where you met georgia i said yeah he shook his head again what if we dont have anything else in common i mean good grief have you seen her familys place and im going to be in debt for seven or eight years just paying off the student loans how do you know if youre ready to get married yanof stood up gestured at my pants and said something that sounded like hahklha ah lafala krepata khem im not seeing people right now i told him as i took off the pants and passed them over or else youd have a shot you charmer yanof sniffed muttered something else and toddled back into the shop billy i said you think georgia would have fought that thing last night yes he said without a seconds hesitation she going to be upset that you did it no even though some folks got hurt he blinked at me no how do you know i asked becausehe shook his headbecause she wont i know her upset by the injuries yes but not by the fight he shifted to a tone he probably didnt realize was an imitation of georgias voice people get hurt in fights thats why theyre called fights you know her well enough to answer serious questions for her when she isnt even in the room man i said quietly youre ready keep the big picture in mind you and her he looked at me for a second and then said i thought youd say something about love i sighed billy you knob if you didnt love her you wouldnt be stressed about losing what you have with her would you good point he said remember the important thing you and her he took a deep breath and let it out yeah he said georgia and me the rest doesnt matter i was going to mumble something vaguely supportive when the door to the fitting room opened and an absolutely ravishing ravenhaired woman in an expensive lavender silk skirtsuit came in she might have been my age and she had a lot of gold and diamonds a lot of perfect white teeth and the kind of curves that come only from surgery her shoes and purse together probably cost more than my car well she snapped and put a fist on her hip glaring first at billy and then at me i see you are already doing your best to disrupt the ceremony eve billy said in a kind of stilted formally polite voice um what are you talking about for one thing this she said flicking a hand at me then she gave me a second more evaluative look i tried to look casual and confident there in my spiderman tshirt and black briefs i managed to keep myself from diving toward my jeans i turned aside to put them on maintaining my dignity your underwear has a hole eve said sweetly i jerked my jeans on blushing stupid dignity bad enough that you insist on this petty criminal taking part in a ceremony before polite society yanof is beside himself eve continued speaking to billy he threatened to quit wow i said you speak sloboviakstanese she blinked at me what because yanof doesnt speak any english so how did you know he threatened to quit i smiled sweetly at her eve gave me a glare of haughty anger and defended herself by pretending i hadnt said anything and now were going to have to leave out one of the bridesmaids to say nothing of the fact that with him standing up there on one side of you and georgia on the other youre going to look like a midget the photographer will have to be notified and i have no idea how well manage to rearrange everything at the last moment i swore i could hear billys teeth grind harry he said in that same polite strained voice this is eve mcalister my stepmotherinlaw i do not care for that term as i have told you often i am your motherinlaw she said or will be whenever this ongoing disaster youve created from a respectable wedding breathes its last im sure we can work something out billy assured her his tone hopeless georgia is late and is letting the voice mail answer her phoneas though i needed something else to occupy my thoughts she shook her head i assume the lowlifes you introduced her to kept her out too late last night just like this one did to you hey come on i said careful to keep my tone as reasonable and friendly as i could billys had a rough night im sure he can help you out if you just give him a chance to she made a disgusted sound and interrupted me did i say or do something to imply that i cared to hear your opinion charlatan lowlifes i warned her about folk like you you dont even know me lady i said yes i do she informed me i know all about you i saw you on larry fowler i narrowed my eyes at eve billys expression came close to panic and he held up both hands palms out giving me a pleading look but my hangover ached and life is too short to waste it taking verbal abuse from petty tyrants who watch bad talk shows okay billys stepmom i began her eyes flashed do not call me that you dont care to be called a stepmother i asked not at all though you obviously arent georgias mother howsabout i call you trophy wife i suggested she blinked at me once her eyes widening billy put his face in his hands bed warmer i mused mistress made good midlife crisis byproduct i shook my head when in doubt go with the classics i leaned a little closer and gave her a crocodilian smile gold digger the blood drained out of eves face leaving ugly pinkish blotches high on her cheeks why you you i waved my hand no its all right i dont mind finding alternate terms i understand that youre under pressure must be hard trying to look good in front of the old money when they all know that you were really just a receptionist or an actress or a model or something her mouth dropped completely open were all having a tough day dear i flipped my hand at her shoo she stared at me for a second then let out a snarled curse youd hardly expect from a lady of her station spun on the heel of one italianleather pump and stalked from the room i heard a couple of beeps as she crossed to the shops door and then she started screeching into a cell phone i could hear her for about ten seconds after she went outside mission accomplished spleen vented dragon lady routed i felt pleased with myself billy heaved a sigh you had to talk to her like that yeah i glowered out after the departed eve once my mouth was open and my lips started moving it was pretty much inevitable dammit harry billy sighed oh come on man sticks and stones may break her bones but one wiseass will never hurt her its not a big deal not for you you dont have to live with it i do so does georgia i chewed on my lower lip for a second i hadnt thought about it in those terms i suddenly felt less than mature ah i said oh um maybe i should apologize he bent his head and pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers oh god no things are bad enough already i frowned at him is it really that important to you the ceremony its important to georgia i winced oh i said ah look weve got a few hours ill stay here and try to sort things out with eve billy said do me a favor hey whats a best man for other than tackling a panicked groom if he tries to run he gave me a quick grin see if you can contact georgia first maybe shes had car trouble or overslept or something or maybe she just left her phone on all night and it went dead sure i said ill take care of it i called billy and georgias apartment and got no answer knowing georgia i expected her to be at the hospital visiting kirby billy might have been the combat leader of the merry band of college kids who had learned shapeshifting from an actual wolf but georgia was the manager surrogate mom and brains when there wasnt any violence on kirby was on painkillers and groggy but he told me georgia hadnt been there i talked to the duty nurse and confirmed that though his family was flying in from texas to see him hed had no visitors since billy and i had left odd i thought about mentioning it to billy but i didnt really know anything yet and it wasnt as though he needed more pressure dont get paranoid harry i told myself maybe shes got a hangover too maybe she ran off with a male stripper i waited to see if i was buying it then shook my head and maybe elvis and jfk are shacked up in a retirement home somewhere i went to billy and georgias apartment they live in a place near the university of chicagos campus in a neighborhood that missed being an ugly one by maybe a hundred yards it still wasnt the kind of place youd want to hang around outside after dark i didnt have a key to get into the building so i pressed buttons one at a time until someone buzzed me in and i took the stairs up as i neared the apartment door i knew something was wrong it wasnt that i saw or heard anything magical or otherwise but when i stopped before the door i had a nebulous but strong conviction that something bad had gone down i knocked the door rattled and fell off the lower hinge it swung open a few inches drunkenly upper hinges squealing splits and cracks invisible until the door moved appeared in the wood and the dead bolt rattled dully against the inside of the door loose in its setting i stopped there for a long second waiting and listening other than the whirring of a window fan at the end of the hall and someone playing an easylistening station on the floor above me there was nothing i closed my eyes for a moment and extended my wizards senses testing the air nearby for any touch of magic upon it i felt nothing but the subtle energy that surrounded any home a form of naturally occurring protective magic called the threshold billy and georgias apartment was the nominal headquarters of the werewolves and members came and went at all hours it was never intended to be a permanent homebut there had been a lot of living in the little apartment and its threshold was stronger than most i slowly pushed the door open with my right hand the apartment had been torn to pieces a futon lay on its side its metal frame twisted like a pretzel the entertainment center had been pulled down from the wall shattering equipment scattering cds and dvds and vintage star wars action figures everywhere the wooden table had been broken in two precisely at its center one of the halfdozen chairs survived the others were kindling the microwave protruded from the drywall of an interior wall the door of the fridge had taken out the bookcase across the room everything in the kitchen had been pulled down and scattered i moved in as quietly as i couldwhich was pretty damn quiet i had done a lot of sneaking around the bathroom looked like someone had taken a chain saw to it and followed up with explosives the bedroom used to house computers and electronic stuff looked like the site of an airplane crash billy and georgias bedroom was the worst of all of them there was blood on the floor and one wall whatever had happened i had missed it dammit i wanted to kill something i wanted to scream in frustration and i wanted to throw up in fear for georgia but in my business that kind of thing doesnt help much i went back into the living room the phone near the door had survived i dialed lieutenant murphy special investigations answered a professional bland voice its me murph i told her murphy knows me her tone changed at once my god harry whats wrong im at billy and georgias apartment i said the place has been torn apart theres blood are you all right im fine i said georgias missing i paused and said its her wedding day murph five minutes she said at once i need you to pick something up for me on the way murphy came through the door eight minutes later she was the head of chicago pds special investigations department they were the cops who got to handle all the crimes that didnt fall into anyone elses purviewstuff like vampire attacks and mystical assaults as well as more mundane crimes like grave robbing plus all the really messy cases the other cops didnt want to bother with si is supposed to make everything fit neatly into the official reports explaining away anything weird with logical rational investigation si spends a lot of time struggling with that last one murphy writes more fiction than most novelists murphy doesnt look like a cop much less a monster cop shes five nothing shes got blond hair blue eyes and a cute nose shes also got about a zillion gunnery awards and a shelfful of opentournament martial arts trophies and i once saw her kill a giant plant monster with a chain saw she wore jeans a white tee sneakers a baseball cap and her hair was pulled back into a tail she wore her gun in a shoulder rig her badge around her neck and she had a backpack slung over one shoulder she came through the door and stopped in her tracks she surveyed the room for a minute and then said what did this i nodded at the twisted futon frame something strong i wish i were a bigtime private investigator like you then i could figure these things out for myself you bring it i asked she tossed me the backpack the rest is in the car whats it for i opened the pack took out a bleachedwhite human skull and put it down on the kitchen counter bob wake up orange lights appeared in the skulls shadowed eye sockets and then slowly grew brighter the skulls jaws twitched and then opened into a pantomime of a wide yawn a voice issued out the sound odd like when you talk while on a racquetball court whats up boss jesus mary and joseph murphy swore she took a step back and almost fell over the remains of the entertainment center bob the skulls eyelights brightened hey the cute blonde did you do her harry the skull spun in place on the counter and surveyed the damage wow you did way to go stud my face felt hot no bob i growled oh the skull said crestfallen murphy closed her mouth blinking at the skull uh harry this is bob the skull i told her its a skull she said that talks bob is actually the spirit inside the skull is just the container its in she looked blankly at me and then said its a skull that talks hey bob protested i am not an it i am definitely a he bob is my lab assistant i explained murphy looked back at bob and shook her head just when i start thinking this magic stuff couldnt get weirder bob i said take a look around tell me what did this the skull spun obediently and promptly said something strong murphy gave me an oblique look oh bite me i told her bob i need to know if you can sense any residual magic ungawa bwana bob said he did another turnaround this one slower and the orange eyelights narrowed residual magic murphy asked anytime you use magic it can leave a kind of mark on the area around you mostly its so faint that sunrise wipes it away every morning i cant always sense it but be can murphy asked but he can bob agreed though not with all this chatter im working over here i shook my head and picked up the phone again yes said billy he sounded harried and there was an enormous amount of background noise im at your apartment i said i came here looking for georgia what he said your apartment i said louder oh harry billy said sorrythis phone is giving me fits eve just talked to georgia shes here at the resort i frowned what is she all right why wouldnt she be billy said someone started shrieking in the background crap this batterys dying problem solved come on up i brought your tux billy wait he hung up i called him back and got nothing but voice mail aha bob said someone used that wolf spell the naked chick taught to billy and the werewolves back over there by the bedroom he reported and there were faeries here i frowned faeries you sure one hundred percent boss they tried to cover their tracks but the threshold must have taken the zing out of their illusion i nodded and exhaled dammit then i strode into the bathroom and hunkered down pawing through the rubble what are you doing murphy asked looking for georgia i said i found a plastic brush full of long strands the color of georgias hair and took several of them in hand ive gotten a lot of mileage out of my tracking spell refining it over the years i stepped out into the hall and drew a circle on the floor around me with a piece of chalk then i took georgias hairs and pressed them against my forehead summoning up my focus and will i shaped the magic i wanted to create focused on the hairs and released my will as i murmured interessari interressarium magic surged out of me into the hairs and back i broke the circle with my foot and the spell flowed into action creating a faint sense of pressure against the back of my head i turned and the sensation flowed over my skull in response over my ear then over my cheekbone and finally came to rest directly between my eyes shes this way i said uhoh uhoh im facing south i said which is a problem billy says shes at the wedding twenty miles north of here murphys eyes widened in comprehension a faerie has taken her place yeah why are they trying to place a spy no i said quietly this is malicious probably because billy and company backed me up during the battle when the last summer knight was murdered that was years ago faeries are patient i said and they dont forget billys in danger id say georgia was the one in danger murphy said i mean that billys in danger too i said how so this isnt happening on their wedding day by chance the faeries want to use it against them murphy frowned what a wedding isnt just a ceremony i said theres power in it a pledging of one to another a blending of energies theres magic all through it if you say so she said her tone wry what happens to him if he marries a faerie conservatives get real upset i said absently but im not sure magically speaking bob oh bob said um well if we assume this is one of the winter sidhe then hes going to be lucky to survive the honeymoon if he does well shell be able to influence him long term hell be bound to her the way the winter knights are bound to the winter queens shell be able to impose her will over his change the way he thinks and feels about things i ground my teeth and if she changes him enough it will drive him insane usually yup bob said his voice brightened but dont worry boss odds are hell be dead before sunrise tomorrow he might even die happy that isnt going to happen i said i checked my watch the wedding is in three hours georgia might need help now i looked back at murphy you carrying two on me more in the car now theres a girl who knows how to party bob said i popped the skull back into my backpack harder than i strictly had to and zipped it shut feel like saving the day her eyes sparkled but she kept her tone bored on the weekend sounds too much like work we started from the apartment together ill pay you in doughnuts dresden you pig that copdoughnut thing is a vicious stereotype doughnuts with little pink sprinkles i said professional profiling is just as bad as racial profiling i nodded yeah but i know you want the little pink sprinkles that isnt the point she said loftily and we got into her car we buckled in and i said more quietly you dont have to come with me karrin yes she said i do i nodded and focused on the tracking spell turning my head south thataway the worst thing about being a wizard is all the presumption peoples expectations pretty much everyone expects me to be some kind of con artist since it is a wellknown fact that there is no such thing as magic of those who know better most of them think i can just snap my fingers poof and have whatever i want dirty dishes snap my fingers and they wash themselves like in the sorcerers apprentice need to talk to a friend poof teleport them in from wherever they are because the magic knows where to find them all by itself magic aint like that or i sure as hell wouldnt drive a beatup old volkswagen its powerful true and useful and enormously advantageous but ultimately it is an art a science a craft a tool it doesnt go out and do things by itself it doesnt create something from nothing using it takes talent and discipline and practice and a lot of work and none of it comes free which was why my spell led us to downtown chicago and suddenly became less useful weve circled this block three times murphy told me cant you get a more precise fix on it do i look like one of those gps thingies i sighed define thingie murphy said its my spell i said its oriented to the points of the compass i didnt really have the zaxis in mind when i designed it and it only works for that when im right on top of the target i keep meaning to go back and fix that but theres never time i had a marriage like that murphy said she stopped at a light and stared up the block held six buildingsthree apartments two office buildings and an old church in there somewhere it could take a lot of time to search that so call in all the kings horses and all the kings men i said she shook her head i might be able to get a couple but since rudolph moved to internal affairs ive been flagged if i start calling in people left and right without a damn good logical rational wholly normal reason i grunted i get it we need to get closer the closer i get to georgia the more precise the tracking spell will be murphy nodded once and pulled over in front of a fire hydrant parking the car lets be smart about this six buildings where would a faerie take her not the church holy ground is uncomfortable for them i shook my head not the apartments too many people there too easy for someone to hear or see something office buildings on a weekend murphy said empty as you can find in chicago which one lets take a look maybe the spell can give me an idea it took ten minutes to walk around the outsides of both buildings the spell remained wonderfully nonspecific though i knew georgia was within a hundred yards or so i sat down at the curb in disgust dammit i said pushing at my hair there has to be something would a faerie be able to magick herself in and out of there yes and no i said she couldnt just wander in through the wall or poof herself inside but she could walk in under a veil so that no one saw heror else saw an illusion of what she wanted them to see cant you look for residual whatsit again it was a good idea i got bob and tried it while murphy found a phone and tried to reach billy or anyone who could reach billy after an hours effort we had accomplished enormous amounts of nothing in case i havent mentioned it before i said dealing with faeries is a pain in the ass someone in a passing car flicked a stillsmoldering cigarette butt onto the concrete near me i kicked it through a sewer grate in disgust she covered her tracks again yeah how i shrugged lot of ways scatter little glamours around to misdirect us only used her magic very lightly to keep from leaving a big footprint if she did her thing in a crowded area enough peoples life force passing by would cover it or she could have used running water to i stopped talking and my gaze snapped back to the sewer grate i could hear water running through it in a low steady stream down there i said shes taken georgia to undertown murphy stared at the stairs leading down to a tunnel with brick walls and shook her head i wouldnt have believed this was here we stood at the end of an uncompleted wing of chicagos underground commuter tunnels at a broken section of wall hidden behind a few old tarps that led down into the darkness of undertown murphy had thrown on an old cubs jacket over her shirt she switched guns putting her favorite sig away in exchange for the glock she wore holstered on one hip the gun had a little flashlight built onto the underside of its barrel and she flicked it on i mean i knew there were some old tunnels murphy said but not this i grunted and took off the silver pentacle amulet i wore around my neck i held it in my right hand my fingers clutching the chain against the solid round length of oak in my right hand about two feet long and covered with carved runes and sigilsmy blasting rod i sent an effort of will into the amulet and the silver pentacle began to glow with a gentle bluewhite light yeah the manhattan project was run out of the tunnels here until they moved it to the southwest plus the town kept sinking into the swamp for a hundred and fifty years there are whole buildings sunk right into the ground the mob dug places during prohibition people built bomb shelters during the fifties and sixties and other things have added more plus gateways back and forth to the spirit world other things murphy asked gun steady on the darkness below like what things i said staring down at the patient lightless murk of undertown anything that doesnt like sunlight or company vampires ghouls some of the nastier faeries obviously once i fought this wacko who kept summoning up fungus demons are you stalling murphy asked maybe i am i sighed ive been down there a few times never been good how you wanna do this like we did the vampire lair let me go first with the shield something jumps out at us ill drop and hold it off until you kill it murphy nodded soberly i swallowed a lump of fear out of my throat it settled into my stomach like a nugget of ice i prepared my shield and the same color light as emanated from my pentacle surrounded it drizzling heatless bluewhite sparks in an irregular stream i prepared myself to use my blasting rod if i had to and started down the stairs following the tracking spell toward georgia the old brick stairs ended at a rough stone slope into the earth water ran down the walls and in rivulets down the sides of the tunnel we went forward through an old building that might have been a schoolhouse judging by the rotted piles of wood and a single old slate chalkboard fallen from one wall the floor was tilted to one side the next section of tunnel was full of freezing dirty kneedeep water until it sloped up out of the water went round a corner where the walls had been cut by rough tools and then opened into a wider chamber it was a lowceilinged cavelow for me any way most folks wouldnt have been troubled three feet from the doorway the floor dropped away into silent black water that stretched out beyond the reach of my blue wizard light murphy stepped up next to me and the light on her gun sent a silver spear of white light out over the water there on a slab of stone that rose up no more than an inch or two from the waters surface lay georgia murphys light played over her georgia was a tall womanin highenough heels she could have looked me in the eye shed been storkskinny and frizzy haired when i met her the years in between had softened her lines and brought out a natural confidence and intelligence that made her an extraordinarily attractive if not precisely beautiful woman she was naked laid on her back with her arms crossed over her chest in repose funeralstyle she took slow breaths her skin was discolored from the cold her lips tinged blue georgia i called feeling like a dummy but i didnt know of any other way to see if she was awake she didnt stir what now murphy asked you go get her while i cover you i shook my head cant be as easy as it looks why not because it never is i bowed my head for a moment pressed my fingertips lightly to my forehead between my eyebrows and concentrated on bringing up my sight one of the things common to all wizards is the sight call it a sixth sense a third eye whatever you please around the world everyone with enough magic has the sight it lets you actually see the forces of energy at work in the world around youlife death magic what have you it isnt always easy to understand what i see and sometimes it isnt prettyand anything a wizard views with his sight is there in technicolor never fadingforever thats why you have to be careful what you choose to look at i dont like doing it ever you never know what it is youll see but when it came to finding out what kinds of magic might be between georgia and me i didnt have many options i opened my sight and looked out over the water to georgia the water was shot through with slithery tendrils of greenish lighta spell of some kind just under its placid surface if the water moved the spell would react i couldnt tell how the stone georgia lay upon held a dull pulsing energy a sullen violet radiance that wound in slow hypnotic spirals through the rock a binding was in effect i was sure something to keep her from moving another spell played over and through georgia herselfa cloud of deep blue sparkles that lay against her skin especially around her head a sleeping spell i couldnt make out any details from here well murphy said i closed my eyes and released my sight always a mildly disorienting experience the remnants of my hangover made it worse than usual i reported my findings to murphy well she said i sure am glad we have a wizard on the case otherwise we might be standing here without any idea what to do next i grimaced and stepped to the waters edge this is water magic its tricky stuff ill try to take down the alarm spell on the surface of the pool then swim out and get geo without warning the water erupted into a boiling froth at my feet and a claw a freaking pincer as big as a couple of basketballs shot out of the water and clamped down on my ankle i let out a battle cry sure a lot of people might have mistaken it for a sudden yelp of unmanly fear but trust me it was a battle cry the thing whatever it was pulled my leg out from under me trying to drag me in i could see slick wet black shell i whipped my blasting rod around to point at the thing and snarled fuego a lance of fire as thick as my thumb lashed from the tip of my blasting rod which was pointed at the things main body it hit the water and boiled into steam it smashed into the shell of the creature with such force that it simply ripped the things body from its clawed limb i brought my shield up a pale fragilelooking quarter dome of blue light that coalesced into place before the steam boiled back into my eyes i squirmed away from the water on my butt shaking wildly at the severed limb that still clutched me the waters surged again and another slickshelled thing grabbed at me and another and another dozens of the creatures were rushing toward our side of the pool and the pressure wave rushing before them rose a foot off the pools surface shellycobbs i shouted and flicked another burst of flame at the nearest driving it back theyre shellycobbs whatever murphy said stepped up beside me and started shooting the third shellycobb took three hits in the same center area of its shell and cracked like a restaurant lobster it bought me a second to act and i raised the blasting rod and tried something new on the fly a blending of a blast of fire with my shield magic i pointed the rod at one side of the shore gathered my will and thundered ignus defendarius a bar of flame bright enough to hurt my eyes shot out to one side of the room i drew a line across the stone with the tip of the blasting rod and as the flame touched the stone it adhered spooling out from my blasting rod until it had formed a solid line between us and the water and an opaque curtain of flame three feet high separated us from the shellycobbs angry rattles and splashes came from the far side of the curtain if the fire dropped the faerie water monsters would swarm us the fire took a lot of energy to keep up and if i tried to hold it too long id probably black out worse it was still fireit needed oxygen to keep burning and in those cramped tunnels there wasnt going to be much of it around for breathing if the fire stayed lit too long all of this meant we had only seconds and had to do somethingfast murph i snapped could you carry her she turned wide blue eyes to me her gun still held ready and pointing at the shellycobbs what can you carry her she gritted her teeth and nodded once i met her eyes for a dangerous second and asked do you trust me fire crackled water boiled steam hissed yes harry she whispered i flashed her a grin jump the fire run to her run to her and hurry i said lifting my left arm focusing as my shield bracelet began to glow bluewhite energy swiftly becoming incandescent now murphy broke into a run and hurtled over the wall of fire forzare i shouted and extended my left arm and my will i reshaped the shield this time forming it in a straight flat plane about three feet wide it shot through the wall of flame over the water to the stone upon which georgia lay murphy landed on the bridge of pure force kept her balance and poured on the speed sprinting over the water to the unconscious young woman murphy slapped her gun back into its holster grabbed georgia and with a shout and a grunt of effort managed to get the tall girl into a firemans carry she started back much more slowly than shed gone forward the shellycobbs thrashed even more furiously and the strain of holding both spells started to become a physical sensation a spidery trembling weakness in my arms and legs i clenched my teeth and my will focusing on holding the wall and the bridge until murphy could return my vision distorted shrinking down to a tunnel and then murphy shouted again and plunged through the fire this time more slowly she let out a gasp of pain as she got singed then stumbled past me i released the bridge with a gasp of relief go i said come on lets go together we were barely able to get georgia lifted i was only able to hold the wall of flame against the shellycobbs for about fifty feet when i had to release the spell or risk passing out i guess the shellycobbs werent sprinters because murphy and i outran them dragging the naked girl out of her undertown prison and back to murphys car in all that time georgia never stirred murphy had a blanket in her trunk i wrapped georgia in it and got in the backseat with her murphy gunned the car and headed for the lincolnshire marriott resort hotel twenty miles north of town and one of the most ostentatious places in the area to hold a wedding traffic wasnt good and according to the clock in murphys car we had less than ten minutes before the wedding was supposed to begin i struggled in the backseat fumbling to keep georgia from bouncing off the ceiling to get my backpack open and to ignore the cuts the shellycobbs pincer left on my leg is that blood on her face murphy asked yeah i said dried but i figure it wasnt hers bob said she wolfed out in the apartment i think georgia got her fangs into jenny greenteeth before she got grabbed jenny who jenny greenteeth i said shes one of the sidhe faerie nobility sidekick to the winter lady are her teeth green like steamed spinach i saw her leading a big old bunch of shellycobbs just like those guys back at the faerie war if maeve wanted to lay out some payback for billy and company jennys the one shed send shes dangerous you know the stories about things that tempt you down to the waters edge and then drown you sirens that lure sailors to their deaths mermaids who carry men off to their homes under the sea yeah thats jenny only shes not so cuddly i dug bob out of my backpack the skull took one look at the sleeping naked georgia and leered first you get demolitionlevel sex with the cop chick and now a threesome all in the same day he cried harry you have to write penthouse about this not now bob i need you to identify the spell thats been laid on georgia the skull made a disgusted sound but focused on the girl oh he said after a second wow thats a good one definitely sidhe work i figure its jenny greenteeth give me details jenny got game its a sleep spell he said a seriously good one too malicious as hell how do i lift it you cant bob said fine how do i break it you dont understand its been tied into the victim its being fueled by the victims life force if you shatter the spell i nodded getting it ill do the same to her is it impossible to get rid of it no not at all im saying that you couldnt lift it whoever threw it could do that of course but theres another key i grew wroth and scowled what key bob uh he said somehow giving the impression that hed shrugged a kiss ought to do it you know true love prince charming that kind of thing that wont be hard i said relaxing a little well definitely get to the wedding before he goes off alone with jenny and gets drowned oh good bob said of course the girl still kicks off but you cant save all the people all the time what i demanded why does georgia die oh if the werewolf kid goes through the ceremony with jenny and plights his troth and so on its going to contaminate him i mean if hes married to another it cant really be pure love jennys claim on him would prevent the kiss from lifting the spell which means georgia wont wake up i said chewing on my lip at what point in the wedding does it happen exactly you mean when will it be too late bob asked yeah i mean when they say i do when they swap rings or what rings and vows bob said mild scorn in his voice way overrated murphy glanced up at me in the rearview mirror and said its the kiss harry its the kiss buffys right bob agreed cheerily i met murphys eyes in the mirror for just a second and then said yeah i guess i should have figured murphy smiled a little the kiss seals the deal bob prattled if billy kisses jenny greenteeth the girl with the long legs aint waking up and he aint long for the world either murph i said tense she rolled down the cars window slapped a magnetic cop light on the roof and started up the siren then she stomped on the gas and all but gave me whiplash under normal circumstances the trip to the resort would have taken half an hour im not saying murphys driving was suicidal not quite but after the third near collision i closed my eyes and fought off the urge to chant theres no place like home murphy got us there in twenty minutes tires screeched as she swung into the resorts parking lot drop me there i said pointing park behind the reception tent so folks wont see georgia ill go get billy clutching my blasting rod i bailed out of the car which never actually came to a full stop and ran into the hotel the concierge blinked at me from behind her desk wedding i barked at her where she blinked and pointed a finger down the hall um the ballroom right i said and sprinted that way i could see the open double doors and heard a mans voice over a loudspeaker saying until death do you part eve mcalister stood at the doorway in her lavender silk outfit and when she saw me her eyes narrowed into sharp little chips of ice there thats him thats the man two big beefy guys in matching badly fitted maroon dress coats appearedhotel security goons they stepped directly into my path and the larger one said sir im sorry but this is a private function ill have to ask you to leave i ground my teeth you have got to be kidding me private im the bestfuckingman the loudspeaker voice in the ballroom said then by the power vested in me i will not allow you to further disrupt this wedding or tarnish my good name eve said in a triumphant tone gentlemen please escort him from the premises before he causes a scene yes maam the bigger goon said he stepped toward me glancing down at the blasting rod sir lets walk to the doors now instead i darted forward toward the doors taking the goons by surprise with the abrupt action billy i shouted the goons recovered in an eyeblink and tackled me they were professional goons i went down under them and it drove the breath out of me the loudspeaker voice said man and wife you may now kiss the bride i lay there on my back under maybe five hundred pounds of security goon struggling to breathe and staring at nothing but ceiling a ceiling lined with a whole bunch of automated fire extinguishers i slammed my head into the boss goons nose and bit backup goon on the arm until he screamed and jerked it away freeing my right arm i pointed the blasting rod up reached for my power and wheezed fuego flame billowed up to the ceiling a fire alarm howled the sprinklers flicked on and turned the inside of the hotel into a miniature monsoon chaos erupted the ballroom was filled with screams the floor shook a little as hundreds of guests leapt to their feet and started looking for an exit the security goons smart enough to realize they suddenly had an enormous problem on their hands scrambled away from the doorway before they could be trampled i got to my feet in time to see a minister fleeing a raised platform where a figure in georgias wedding dress had hunched over while billy spiffy in his tux stared at her in pure shock that much running water grounded out whatever glamour the bride might have been using and her features melted back into those id seen beforeshe lost an inch or two of height and her proportions changed georgias rather sharp features flowed into a visage of haunting unearthly beauty georgias brown hair became the same green as emeralds and seaweed jenny greenteeth turned toward billy her trademark choppers bared in a viridian snarl and her hand swept at his throat inhuman nails gleaming billy may have been shocked but not so much that he didnt recognize the threat his arm intercepted jennys and he drove into her pushing both hands forward with the power of his arms shoulders and legs billy had a low center of gravity and was no skinny weakling the push sent jenny back several steps and off the edge of the platform she fell in a tangle of white fabric and lace billy i shouted again almost managing to make it loud my voice was lost in the sounds of panic and the wailing fire alarms so i gritted my teeth brought my shield bracelet up to its flashiest sparkliest shiniest charge and thrust into the press of the crowd to them it must have looked like someone waving a road flare around and there was a steady stream of interjections that averaged out to eek i forged ahead through them by the time i was past the crowd jenny greenteeth had risen to her feet tearing the bridal gown off as if it were made of tissue paper she stretched one hand into a grasping claw and clenched at the air ripples of angry power fluttered between her fingers and an ugly green sphere of light appeared in her hand she leapt nimbly back up to the platform unencumbered by the dress and flung the green sphere at billy he ducked it flew over his head leaving a hole with blackened crumbling edges in the wall behind him jenny howled and summoned another sphere but by that time i was within reach standing on the floor by the platform gave me a perfect shot at her knees and i swung my blasting rod with both hands the blow elicited a shriek of pain from the sidhe woman and she flung the second sphere at me i caught it on my shield bracelet and it rebounded upon her searing a black line across the outside of one thigh the sidhe screamed and threw herself back her weight mostly on one leg and snarled to me thou wouldst have saved this one wizard but i will yet exact my ladys vengeance twofold and with a graceful leap she flew over our heads forty feet to the door and vanished from sight as swiftly and nimbly as a deer harry billy said staring in shock at the soakingwet room what the hell is happening here what the hell was that thing i grabbed his tux no time come with me he did but asked why i need you to kiss georgia uh he said what i found georgia shes outside the watery tart knows it shes going to kill her you gotta kiss her now oh he said we both ran and suddenly the bottom fell out of my stomach vengeance twofold oh god jenny greenteeth would kill murphy too the area outside the hotel was a mess people were wandering around in herds emergency sirens were already on the way a couple of cars had smashed into each other in the parking lot probably as they both gunned it for the road everyone out there seemed to be determined to get in our way slowing our pursuit we ran to where murphy had parked her car it was lying on its side windows were broken one of the doors had been torn off i didnt see anyone around but billy suddenly cocked his head to one side and then pointed at the reception tent we ran for it as quietly as we could and billy threw himself inside i heard him let out a short cry i followed georgia lay on the ground hardly covered by the blanket at all limbs sprawled bonelessly billy rushed over to her just past them i saw murphy jenny greenteeth stood over her at the refreshments table pushing her face down into a full punch bowl hands locked in murphys hair the wicked faeries eyes were alight with rage and madness and an almost sexual arousal murphys arms twitched a little and jenny gasped lips parting and pushed down harder murphys hand fluttered one more time and went still the next thing i knew i was smashing my blasting rod down onto jenny greenteeth screaming incoherently and pounding as hard as i possibly could i drove the faerie back from murphy who slid limply to the ground then jenny recovered her balance struck out at me with one arm and i found out a fact i hadnt known before jenny greenteeth was something strong i landed several feet away not far from billy and georgia watching birdies and little lights fly around on another table next to me was another punch bowl jenny greenteeth flew at me lust in her inhumanly lovely features her feline eyes smoldering billy i slurred dammit kiss her now billy blinked at me then he turned to georgia lifting the upper half of her body in his arms and kissed her with a desperation and passion that no one could fake i didnt get to see what happened because faster than you could say oxygen deprivation jenny greenteeth had seized my hair and smashed my face against the bottom of the punch bowl i fought her but she was stronger than anything human and she had all kinds of leverage i could feel her pressed against me body tensing and shifting rubbing against me she was getting off as she murdered me the lights started to go out this was what she did she knew what she was doing lucky for me she wasnt the only one i suddenly fell getting the whole huge punch bowl to turn over on me as i did drenching me in bright red punch i gasped and wiped stinging liquid from my eyes and looked up in time to see a pair of wolves one tall and lean one smaller and heavier leap at jenny greenteeth and bring her to the ground screams and snarls blended and none of them sounded human jenny tried to run but the lean wolf ripped across the back of her unwounded leg with its fangs severing the hamstring the faerie went down the wolves were on her before she could scream again the wheel turns and jenny greenteeth never had a chance the wolves knew what they were doing this was what they did i crawled over to murphy her eyes were open and staring her body and features slack some part of my brain remembered the steps for cpr i started doing it i adjusted her position sealed my lips to murphys and breathed for her then compressions breathe compressions come on murph i whispered come on i covered her mouth with mine and breathed again for one second for one teeny tiny instant i felt her mouth move i felt her head tilt her lips soften and my ohsoprofessional cprjust for a second mind youfelt almost almost like a kiss then she started coughing and sputtering and i sank back from her in relief she turned on her side breathing hard for a moment and then looked up at me with dazed blue eyes harry i leaned down causing runnels of punch to slide into one of my eyes and asked quietly yeah you have fruitpunch mouth she whispered her hand found mine weak but warm i held it we sat together billy and georgia got married that night in father forthills study at st mary of the angels an enormous old church no one was there but them the padre murphy and me after all as far as most anyone else knew theyd been married at that disastrous travesty of a farce in lincolnshire the ceremony was simple and heartfelt i stood with billy murphy stood with georgia they both looked radiantly happy they held hands the whole time except when exchanging rings murphy and i stepped back when they got to the vows not exactly a fairytale wedding she whispered sure it was i said had a kiss and an evil stepmother and everything murphy smiled at me then by the power vested in me the padre said beaming at the pair from behind his spectacles i now pronounce you man and wife you may kiss th they beat him to it its my birthday too from many bloody returns edited by charlaine harris takes place between white night and small favor ive met people who are sweeter and nicer and more likeable than charlaine harrisbut i really cant remember when every author ive ever talked with who knows charlaine just couldnt be happier about the success of her books and the hbo series true blood shes that nice i cant even bring myself to be jealous shes that nice so when she invited me to contribute i said heck yeah using a birthday theme since the book originally was supposed to be published on vlad draculas somethinghundredth birthday was sort of a challenge birthdays are about families whether theyre a biological family or one thats come together by choice its your family who gathers to celebrate the anniversary of you its kind of a profound thing when you think about it but dresden hadnt ever really associated his birthday with that kind of joyonly with the knowledge that hed never really had a family so i decided to do a story about harry coping with the unfamiliar role of being the guy celebrating the life of his half brother i found a very good mall in chicago that i could demolish with the usual dresdenesque shenanigans set the story against the backdrop of a vampireish larp and knocked this one out over the course of about three weeks hey miyagisan my apprentice said her jeans still dripped with purplebrown mucus you think the dry cleaner can get this out i threw my car keys down on my kitchen counter leaned my slimed runecarved wooden staff next to them and said the last time i took something stained by a slime golem to a cleaner the owner burned his place down the next day and tried to collect on the insurance molly my apprentice was just barely out of her teens and it was impossible not to notice what great legs she had when she stripped out of her trendily mangled jeans she wrinkled her nose as she tossed them into the kitchen trash can have i told you how much i love the wizard business harry neither of us is in the hospital kid this was a good day at work i took my mantled leather duster off it was generously covered in splatters of the sticky smelly mucus as well i toted it over to the fireplace in my basement apartment which i keep going during the winter given that i have to live without the benefits of electricity its necessary i made sure the fire was burning strongly and tossed the coat in hey molly said not the coat relax i told her the spells on it should protect it theyll bake the slime hard and ill chisel it off tomorrow oh good i like the coat the girl subsided as she tossed her secondhand combat boots and socks into my trash after her ruined jeans she was tall for a woman and built like a schoolboys fantasy of the scandinavian exchange student her hair was shoulder length and the color of white gold except for the tips which had been dyed in a blend of blue red and purple shed lost a couple of the piercings shed previously worn on her face and was now down to only one eyebrow one nostril her tongue and her lower lip she went over to the throw rug in the middle of my living room floor hauled it to one side and opened the trapdoor leading down to my lab in the subbasement she lit a candle in the fire wrinkling her nose at the stink from the greasy smoke coming up from my coat and padded down the stepladder stairs into the lab mouse my pet sabertoothed retriever trotted out of my bedroom and spread his doggy jaws in a big yawn wagging his shaggy grey tail he took one step toward me then froze as the smell of the mucus hit his nose the big grey dog turned around at once and padded back into the bedroom coward i called after him i glanced up at mister my tomcat who drowsed upon the top of my heaviest bookshelf catching the updraft from the fireplace at least you havent deserted me mister glanced at me then gave his head a little shake as the pungent smoke from the fireplace rose to him he flicked his ears at me obviously annoyed and descended from the bookshelf with gracefully offended dignity to follow mouse into the relative aromatic safety of my bedroom wimp i muttered i eyed my staff it was crusty with the ichor id have to take it off with sandpaper and repair the carvings id probably have to do the blasting rod too stupid freaking amateurs playing with things they didnt understand slime golems are just disgusting molly thumped back up the stairs now dressed in her backup clothes her experiences in training with me had taught her that lesson in about six months and she had a second set of clothing stored in a gym bag underneath the little desk i let her keep in the lab she came up in a black broomstick skirtthose skirts that are supposed to look wrinkledand birkenstocks inappropriate for the winter weather but way less inappropriate than black athletic panties harry are you going to be able to drive me home i frowned and checked the clock it was after ninetoo late for a young woman to trust herself to chicagos public transportation given mollys skills she probably wouldnt be in any real danger but it was best not to tempt fate could you call your folks she shook her head on valentines day are you kidding theyll have barricaded themselves upstairs and forced the older kids to wear the little ones out so theyll sleep through the noise molly shuddered im not interrupting them way too disturbing valentines day i groaned dammit what oh i forgot what with the excitement its uh someones birthday i got them a present and wanted to get it to them today oh molly chirped who i hesitated for a minute but molly had earned a certain amount of candorand trust thomas i said the vampire molly asked yeah i said wow harry she said her blue eyes sparkling thats odd i mean why would you get him a birthday present she frowned prettily i mean you didnt get my dad one and youre friends with him and hes a knight of the sword and one of the good guys and hes saved your life about twenty times and all more like four times i said testily and i do christmas for hi molly was looking at me a smug smile on her face you figured it out i said that thomas was your brother molly asked innocently yep i blinked at her how ive seen you two fight she lifted both pale eyebrows what have you seen how many brothers and sisters i have i know my sibling conflicts hells bells i sighed molly she lifted a hand i know boss i know big secret safe with me her expression turned serious and she gave me a look that was very knowing for someone so young family is important id grown up in a succession of orphanages and foster homes yeah i said it is she nodded so you havent given family presents much and your brother doesnt exactly have a ton of people bringing him presents on his birthday does he i just looked at her for a second molly was growing up into a person i thought i was going to like no i said quietly i havent and he doesnt well then she said smiling lets go give him one i frowned at the intercom outside thomass apartment building and said i dont get it hes always home this time of night maybe hes out to dinner molly said shivering in the coldafter all her backup clothing had been summer wear i shook my head he limits himself pretty drastically when it comes to exposing himself to the public why hes a white court vampire an incubus i said pretty much every woman who looks at him gets ideas molly coughed delicately oh its not just me then no i followed him around town once it was like watching one of those campy cologne commercials but he does go out right sure she nodded and immediately started digging into her backpack then maybe we could use a tracking spell and run him down i think ive got some materials we can use me too i said and produced two quarters from my pocket holding them up between my fingers with slow ominous flair like david blaine then i took two steps to the pay phone next to the apartment buildings entrance plugged the coins in and called thomass cell phone molly gave me a level look and folded her arms hey i told her as it rang were wizards kid we have trouble using technology doesnt mean we cant be smart about it molly rolled her eyes and muttered to herself and i paid attention to the phone call allo thomas answered the word thick with the french accent he used in his public persona hello france i responded i found a dead mouse in my can of french roast coffee and ive called to complain im an american and i refuse to stand for that kind of thing from you people my half brother sighed a moment please he said in his accent i could hear music playing and people talking behind him a party a door clicked shut and he said without any accent hey harry im standing outside your apartment in the freaking snow with your birthday present that wont do you much good he said im not there being a professional detective i had deduced that much i said a birthday present huh he said i get much colder and im going to burn it for warmth he laughed im at the woodfield mall in schaumburg i glanced at my watch this late uhhuh im doing a favor for one of my employees ill be here until midnight or so look just come back tomorrow evening no i said stubbornly your birthday is today ill drive there uh thomas said yeah i guess uh okay i frowned what are you doing out there gotta go he hung up on me i traded a look with molly huh she tilted her head whats going on i turned and headed back for the car lets find out woodfield mall is the largest such establishment in the state but its parking lots were all but entirely empty the mall had been closed for more than an hour how are we supposed to find him molly asked i drove my car the beatup old volkswagen bug i had dubbed the blue beetle around for a few minutes there i said nodding at a white sedan parked among a dozen other vehicles the largest concentration of such transport left at the mall thats his car i started to say something else but stopped myself before i wasted an opportunity to yoda the trainee molly tell me what you see she scrunched up her nose frowning as i drove through the lot to park next to thomass car the tires crunched over the thin dusting of snow that had frosted itself over scraped asphalt streaks of salt and ice melt and stubborn patches of ice i killed the engine it ticked for a few seconds and then the car filled with the kind of soft heavy silence you get only on a winter night with snow on the ground the mall is closed molly said but there are cars at this entrance there is a single section of lights on inside when the rest of them are out i think one of the shops is lit inside theres no curtain down over it even though the rest of the shops have them so what should we be asking i prompted what is thomas doing in a group in a closed mall on valentines day night her tone rose at the end questioning good the date might have some significance i said but the real question is this is it a coincidence that the exterior security camera facing that door is broken molly blinked at me then frowned looking around i pointed a finger up remember to look in all three dimensions human instincts dont tend toward checking above us or directly at our feet in general you have to make yourself pick up the habit molly frowned and then leaned over peering up through the beetles window to the tall streetlamp pole above us maybe ten feet up there was the square black metal housing of a security camera several bare wires dangled beneath it their ends connected to nothing id seen it as i pulled the car in my apprentice drew in a nervous breath you think something is happening i think we dont have enough information to make any assumptions i said its probably nothing but lets keep our eyes open no sooner had the words left my mouth than two figures stepped out of the night walking briskly down the sidewalk outside the mall toward the lighted entrance they both wore long black capes with hoods not your standard wear for chicago shoppers molly opened her mouth to stammer something quiet i hissed do not move the two figures went by only thirty or forty feet away i caught a glimpse of a very very pale face within one of the figures hoods eyes sunken into the skulllike pits they both turned to the door without so much as glancing at us opened it as though they expected it to be unlocked and proceeded inside all right i said quietly it might be something um molly said wwere those vvampires deep breaths kid i told her fear isnt stupid but dont let it control you i have no idea what they were i made sure my old fleecelined heavy denim coat was buttoned up and i got out of the car uh then where are you going she asked inside i said walking around to the beetles trunk i unwrapped the wire that had held it closed ever since a dozen vehicular mishaps ago whatever they are thomas doesnt know about them hed have said something i couldnt see her through the lifted hood but molly rolled down the window enough to talk to me bbut you dont have your staff or blasting rod or coat or anything theyre all back at your apartment i opened the case that held my revolver and the box that held my ammunition slipped shells into the weapon and put it in my coat pocket i dropped some extra rounds into the front pocket of my jeans and shut the hood theyre only toys padawan familiar capable proven toys that i felt naked without but a true wizard shouldnt absolutely rely on themor teach his apprentice to do so stay here start up the car and be ready to roll if we need to leave in a hurry right she said and wriggled over into the drivers seat to give molly credit she might have been nervous but she had learned the job of wheelmansorry political correctioners wheelpersonfairly well i kept my right hand in my coat pocket on the handle of my gun hunched my shoulders against a small breath of frozen wind and hurried to the mall entrance my shoes crunching and squeaking on the little coating of snow i walked toward the doors as if i owned them shoved them open like any shopper and got a quick look around the mall was dark except for the entrance and that single open shopa little bistro with tinted windows that would have been dimly lit even when all the lights were on i could see figures seated at tables inside and at a long dining counter and bar they wore lots of black and none of them looked much older than molly though the dim lights revealed few details i narrowed my eyes a bit debating vampires gave off a certain amount of energy that someone like me could sense but depending on which breed you were talking about that energy could vary sometimes my sense of an approaching vampire was as overtly creepy as a childs giggle coming from an open grave other times there was barely anything at all and it registered on my senses as something as subtle as simple instinctive dislike for the creature in question for white court vamps like my half brother there was nothing at all unless they were doing something overtly vampiric from outside the shop i couldnt tell anything this was assuming they were vampires at allwhich was a fairly large assumption they didnt meet up in the open like this vampires didnt apologize to the normal world for existing but they didnt exactly run around auditioning for the latest reality tv shows either there was one way to find out i opened the door to the bistro hand on my gun took a step inside holding the door open in case i needed to flee and peered around warily at the occupants the nearest was a pair of young men speaking earnestly at a table over two cups of what looked like coffee and and they had acnenot like disfiguring acne or anything just a few zits in case no ones told you heres a monsterhunting tip for free vampires have little to no need for clearasil seen in that light the two young mens costumes looked like exactly thatcostumes they had two big cloaks dripping a little meltwater hung over the backs of their chairs and i caught the distinctive aroma of weed coming from their general direction two kids slipping out from the gathering to toke up and then come back inside one of them produced a candy bar from a pocket and tore into it to the reassurance of the people who make clearasil im sure i looked around the room there were more people mostly young mostly with the thinness that goes with youth as opposed to the leanly cadaverous kind that goes with being a bloodsucking fiend they were mostly dressed in similar costumestyle clothing unless there had been a big sale at gothsrus i felt my shoulders sag in relief and i slipped my hand out of my pocket anytime one of my bouts of constructive paranoia didnt pan out was a good time sir said a gruff voice from behind me the mall is closed you want to tell me what youre doing here i turned to face a squat blocky man with watery blue eyes and no chin hed grown a thick browngold walrus mustache that emphasized rather than distracted from the lack he had a high hairline a brown uniform and what looked like a cops weapon belt until you saw that he had a walkietalkie where the sidearm would be next to a tiny can of mace his name tag read raymond observing suspicious activity raymond i said and hooked my chin vaguely back at the bistro see that people hanging around in the mall after hours weird he narrowed his eyes wait dont i know you i pursed my lips and thought oh right six seven years ago at shoegasm he grunted in recognition the phony psychic consultant i responded and from what i hear their inventory stopped shrinking which hadnt happened before i showed up raymond gave me a look that would have cowed lesser men much much lesser men like maybe fourth graders if you arent with the group youre gone you want to leave or would you rather i took care of it for you stop i said youre scaring me raymonds mustache quivered he apparently wasnt used to people who didnt take him seriously plus i was much much bigger than he was allo ahree came my brothers voice from behind me i turned to find thomas there dressed in tight black pants and a blousy red silk shirt his shoulderlength hair was tied back in a tail with a matching red ribbon his face didnt look much like mine except around the eyes and maybe the chin thomas was goodlooking the way mozart was talented there were people on the covers of magazines and on television and on movie screens who despaired of ever looking as good as thomas on his arm was a slim young girl quite pretty and wholesomelooking wearing leather pants that rode low on her hips and a red bikini top her silky brown hair artfully mussed i recognized her from thomass shop a young woman named sarah harry she said oh its nice to see you again she nudged thomas with her hip isnt it always thomas smiling said in his french accent hello mr raymond sarah said brightly raymond scowled at me and asked sarah he with you but of course thomas said in that annoying french way giving raymond his most brilliant smile raymond grunted and took his hand away from the radio lucky me i had evidently been dismissed from raymonds world i was going to tell you im going to be in the parking lot replacing a camera weve got down if you need me merci thomas said still smiling raymond grunted he gave me a sour look picked up a toolbox from where hed set it aside along with his coat and a stepladder and headed out to the parking lot ahree you know sayrah thomas said never had the pleasure of an introduction i said and offered sarah my hand she took it smiling i take it you arent here to play evernight i looked from her to the costumed people oh i said oh its a game of some kind i take it a larp she said i looked blank for a second is that like a lark she grinned larp she repeated live action roleplaying live action vampire roleplaying i guess i said i looked at thomas and this is why you are here thomas gave me a sunny smile and nodded she asked me to pretend to be a vampire just for tonight he said and straight no wonder he was having a good time sarah beamed at me thomas never talks about his ah personal life so youre quite the man of mystery at the shop we all speculate about you all the time ill just bet they did there were times when my brothers cover as a flamingly gay hairdresser really grated and it wasnt as though i could go around telling people we were relatednot with the white council of wizards at war with the vampire courts how nice i told sarah i was never getting out of the role people had assumed for me around thomas thomas can we talk for a moment mais oui he said he smiled at sarah took her hand and gave her a little bow over it she beamed fondly at him and then hurried back inside i watched her go in her tight pants and skimpy top and sighed she had an awfully appealing curve of back and hip and just enough bounce to make the motion pleasant and there was no way i could ever even think about flirting with her roll your tongue back up into your mouth before someone notices thomas said sotto voce ive got a cover to keep tell them im larping like im straight i said and we turned to walk down the entry hall a little away from the bistro pretending to be a vampire huh its fun thomas said im like a guest star on the season finale i eyed him vampires arent fun and games i know that thomas said you know that but they dont know that you arent doing them any favors i said lighten up thomas said the words were teasing but there were serious undertones to his voice theyre having fun and im helping i dont get a chance to do that very often by making light of something that is a very real danger he stopped and faced me theyre innocent harry they dont know any better theyve never been hurt by a vampire or lost loved ones to a vampire he lifted his eyebrows i thought that was what your people were fighting for in the first place i gave him a sour look if you werent my brother id probably tell you that you have some awfully nerdy hobbies we reached the front doors thomas studied himself in the glass and struck a pose true but i look gorgeous doing them besides sarah worked eleven fridays to mondays in a row without a complaint she earned a favor outside the snow was thickening raymond was atop his ladder fiddling with the camera molly was watching him i waved until i got her attention then made a little outline figure of a box with my fingers and beckoned her she nodded and killed the engine i came in here expecting trouble were lucky i didnt bounce a few of these kids off the ceiling before i realized they werent something from the dark side bah thomas said never happen youre careful i snorted i hope you wont mind if i just give you your present and run wow thomas said gracious much up yours i said as molly grabbed the present and hurried in through the cold shivering all the way and happy birthday he turned to me and gave me a small genuinely pleased smile thank you there was a click of high heels in the hall behind us and a young woman appeared she was pretty enough i suspected but in the tight black dress black hose and with her hair slicked back like that she came off sort of threatening she gave me a slow cold look and said so i see youre keeping low company after all ravenius ever suave i replied uh what ahree thomas said i glanced at him he put his hand flat on the top of his head and said do this i peered at him he gave me a look i sighed and put my hand on the top of my head the girl in the black dress promptly did the same thing and gave me a smile oh right sorry i didnt realize i will be back in one moment thomas said his accent back personal business right she said sorry i figured ennui had stumbled onto a subplot she smiled again then took her hand off the top of her head reassumed that cold haughty expression and stalked clicketyclack back to the bistro i watched her go turned to my brother while we both stood there with our hands flat on top of our heads elbows sticking out like chicken wings and said what does this mean were out of character thomas said oh i said and not a subplot if we had our hands crossed over our chests thomas said wed be invisible i missed dinner i said i put my other hand on my stomach then just to prove that i could i patted my head and rubbed my stomach now im out of characterand hungry youre always hungry how is that out of character true i said i frowned then looked back whats taking molly my apprentice stood facing away from me her back pressed to the glass doors she stood rigid one hand pressed to her mouth thomass birthday present in its pink and red valentines day wrapping paper lay on its side among grains of snowmelt on the sidewalk molly trembled violently thomas was a beat slow to catch on to what was happening isnt that skirt a little light for the weather look shes freezing before he got to skirt i was out the door i seized molly and dragged her inside eyes on the parking lot i noticed two things first that raymonds ladder was tipped over and lay on its side in the parking lot flakes of snow were already gathering upon it in fact the snow was coming down more and more heavily despite the weather forecast that had called for clearing skies second there were droplets of blood on my car and the cars immediately around it the ones closest to raymonds ladder they were rapidly freezing and they glittered under the parking lots lamps like tiny brilliant rubies what thomas asked as i brought molly back in what is he stared out the windows for a second and answered the question for himself crap yeah i said molly she gave me a wildeyed glance shook her head once then bowed it and closed her eyes speaking in a low repetitive whisper what the hell thomas said shes in psychic shock i said quietly never seen you in psychic shock my brother said different talents i blow things up mollys a sensitive and getting more so i told him shell snap herself out of it but she needs a minute uhhuh thomas said quietly he stared intently at the shuddering young woman his eyes shifting colors slightly from deep grey to something paler hey i said to him focus he gave his head a little shake his eyes gradually darkening again right come on lets get her a chair and some coffee and stop standing around in front of big glass windows making targets of ourselves we did dragging her into the bistro and to the table nearest the door where thomas could stand watching the darkness while i grabbed the girl some coffee from a dispenser holding my hand on top of my silly head the whole while molly got her act together within a couple of minutes after i sat down it surprised me despite my casual words to thomas i hadnt seen her that badly shaken up before she grabbed at the coffee shaking and slurped some okay grasshopper i said what happened i was on the way in she replied her voice distant and oddly flat the security man ssomething killed him a hint of something desperate crept into her voice i ffelt him die it was horrible what i asked her give me some details to work with molly shook her head rapidly ddidnt see it was too fast i sensed something moving behind memmaybe a footstep then there was a quiet sound and hhe died her breaths started coming rapidly again easy i told her keeping my voice in the steady cadence id used when teaching her how to maintain selfcontrol under stress breathe focus remember who you are okay she said several breaths later okay this sound what was it she stared down at the steam coming up off her coffee i a thump maybe lighter a snap i asked she grimaced but nodded and i turned around fast as i could but he was gone i didnt see anything there harry thomas ten feet away could hear our quiet conversation as clearly as if hed been sitting with us something grabbed raymond he said something moving fast enough to cross her whole field of vision in a second or two it didnt stop moving when it took him she probably heard his neck breaking from the whiplash there wasnt much to say to that the whole concept was disturbing as hell thomas glanced back at me and said its a great way to do a grab and snatch if youre fast enough my father showed me how it was done once his head whipped around toward the parking lot i felt myself tense what the streetlights just went out i sat back in my chair thinking furiously only one reason to do that to blind us thomas said prevent anyone from reaching the vehicles also keeps anyone outside from seeing what is happening here i said how are you guys using this place after hours sarahs uncle owns it thomas said get her i said rising to take up watching the door hurry thomas brought her over to me a moment later by the time he did the larpers had become aware that something was wrong and their awkwardly sinister roleplaying dwindled into an uncertain silence as sarah hurried over before i had watched her and her scarlet bikini top in appraisal now i couldnt help but think how slender and vulnerable it made her neck look what is it sarah asked me trouble i said we may be in danger and i need you to answer a few questions for me right now she opened her mouth and started to ask me something first i said interrupting her do you know how many security men are present at night she blinked at me for a second then she said uh four before closing two after but the two who leave are usually here until midnight doing maintenance and some of the cleaning where she shook her head the security office in administration right i said this place have a phone of course take me to it she did back in the little places tiny kitchen i picked it up got a dial tone and slammed murphys phone number across the keypad if the bad guys whoever or whatever they were were afraid of attracting attention from the outside world i might be able to avoid the entire situation by calling in lots of police cars and flashy lights the phone rang once twice and then it went dead along with the lights the music playing on the speakers and the constant blowing sigh of the heating system several short breathy screams came from the front of the bistro and i heard thomas shout for silence and call harry the security office i said to sarah where is it um its at the far end of the mall from here easy to find no she said shaking her head you have to go through the administrative hall and i shook my head you can show me come on i stalked out to the front room of the bistro thomas anything all the larpers had gathered in close herd instinct kicking in under the tension thomas stepped closer to me so that he could answer me under his breath nothing yet thomas said but i saw something moving out there i grunted heres the plan molly sarah and i are going to go down to the security office and try to reach someone bad idea thomas said we need to get out of here were too vulnerable theyre between us and the cars i said whatever they are well never make it out all the way across the parking lot without getting caught fine he said you fort up here and ill go no once were gone youll try to get through to the cops on a cell phone theres not a prayer of getting one to work if molly and i are anywhere nearbynot with both of us this nervous he didnt like that answer but he couldnt refute it all right he said grimacing watch your back i nodded to him and raised my voice all right everyone im not sure exactly what is going on here but im going to go find security i want everyone to stay here until i get back and were sure its safe there was a round of halfhearted protests at that but thomas quelled them with a look it wasnt an angry or threatening look it was simply a steady gaze everyone shut up i headed out with molly and sarah in tow and as we stepped out of the bistro there was an enormous crashing sound and a car came flying sideways through the glass wall of the entranceway about eight feet off the ground it hit the ground broken glass and steel foaming around it like crashing surf bounced with a shockingly loud crunch and tumbled ponderously toward us heralded by a rush of freezing air molly was already moving but sarah only stood there staring incredulously as the car came toward us i grabbed her around the waist and all but hauled her off her feet dragging her away i ran straight away from the oncoming missile which was not the smartest way to gobut since a little perfume kiosk was blocking my path it was the only way i was fast and we got a little bit lucky i pulled sarah past the kiosk just as the car hit it the vehicles momentum was almost gone by the time it hit and the car crashed to a halt a small wave of safety glass washing past our shoes sarah wobbled and nearly fell i caught her and kept going she started to scream or shout or ask a questionbut i clapped my hand over her mouth and hissed quiet i didnt stop until we were around the corner and the crashing racket was coming to a halt then i stopped with my back against the wall and got sarahs attention i didnt speak i raised one finger to my lips with as much physical emphasis as i could manage sarah trembling violently nodded at me i turned to give the same signal to molly who looked pale but in control of herself she nodded as well and we turned and slipped away from that arm of the mall i listened as hard as i could which was actually quite hard its a talent i seem to have developed maybe because im a wizard and maybe just because some people can hear really well it was difficult to make out anything at all much less any kind of detail but i was sure i heard one thingfootsteps coming in the crushed door of the mall crunching on broken glass and debris something fast enough to snap a mans neck with the whiplash of its passage and strong enough to throw that car through a wall of glass had just walked into the mall behind us i figured it was a very very good idea not to let it know we were there and sneaking away we got away with it walking slowly and silently out through the mall which yawned all around us three levels of darkened stores deserted shops and closed metal grates and doors i stopped a dozen shops later after wed gone past the central plaza of the mall and were far enough away for the space to swallow up quiet conversation oh my god sarah whimpered her voice a strangled little whisper oh my god what is happening is it terrorists i probably would have had a more suave answer if she hadnt been pressed up against my side mostly naked from the hips up warm and lithe and trembling the adrenaline rush that had hit me when the car nearly smashed us caught up to me and i suddenly found it difficult to keep from shivering myself i had a sudden insanely intense need to rip off the strings on that red bikini top and kiss her purely for the sake of how good it would feel all things considered though it would have been less than appropriate uh i mumbled forcing myself to look back the way wed come theyre bad guys of some kind yeah are you hurt no sarah said molly i asked im fine my apprentice answered the security office i said sarah stared at me for a second her eyes intense but but i dont understand why i put my hand firmly over her mouth sarah i said meeting her eyes for as long as i dared ive been in trouble before and i know what im doing i need you to trust me all right her eyes widened for a second she reached up to lightly touch my wrist and i let her push my hand gently away from her mouth she swallowed and nodded once theres no time we have to find the security office now aall right she said this way she led us off and we followed her creeping through the cavernous dimness of the unlit mall molly leaned in close to me to whisper even if we get the security guards what are they going to do against something that can do that theyll have radios i whispered back cell phones theyll know all the ways out if we cant call in help theyll give us the best shot of getting these people out of here in one lights began flickering on and offnot blinking not starting up and shutting down in rhythm but irregularly first they came on over a section of the third floor for a few seconds then they went out a few seconds later it was a far section of the second floor then they went out then light shone from one of the distant wings for a moment and vanished again it was like watching a child experiment with the switches then the pa system let out a crackle and a little squeal of feedback it shut off again and came back on testing said a dry rasping voice over the speakers testing one two three sarah froze in place and then backed up warily looking at me i stepped up next to her and she pressed in close to me shivering there said the voice it was a horrible thing to listen tolike linda blairs impression of a demonpossessed victim only less melodious im sure you all can hear me now and id heard such a voice before oh hell i breathed this is constance continued the voice constance bushnell im sure you all remember me i glanced at molly who shook her head sarah looked frightened and confused but when she caught my look she shook her head too you might also remember me she continued as drulinda and then the voice started singing happy birthday the tune wasnt even vaguely close to the actual song but the happy birthday to me lyrics were unmistakable sarahs eyes had widened drulinda who the hell is drulinda i asked sarah shook her head one of our characters but her player ran away from home or something and you didnt recognize her actual name sarah gave me a slightly guilty glance well i never played with her much she wasnt really very you knowpopular uhhuh i said tell me whatever you can about her she shook her head um about five four sort of plain you know not ugly or anything but not really pretty maybe a little heavy not that i sighed tell me something important about her people make fun of her some did she said i never liked it but crap i looked at molly and said code carrie were in trouble the horrible dusty song came to an end its been a year since i left you drulindas voice said a year since i found what all you whining losers were looking for and i decided to give myself a present there was a horrible pause and then the voice said you all of you code what molly asked me i shook my head sarah do you know where the announcement system is yes sarah said administration right by the security office i sighed drulindas voice continued the entrances are closed and watched but you should feel free to run for them you all taste so much better when youve had time to be properly terrified ive so been looking forward to seeing your reaction to the new me with that the pa system shut off but a second later it started playing musiconly you by the platters molly i hissed suddenly realizing the danger veil us now she blinked at me then nodded bowing her head with a frown of concentration and folding her arms across her chest i felt her gather up her will and release it with a word and a surge of energy that made the air sparkle like diamond dust for a half second inside the veil the air suddenly turned a few degrees cooler and the area outside it seemed to become even dimmer than it had been a second before i could sense the delicate tracery of the veils magic in the air around us though i knew that from the other side none of that would be detectableassuming molly had done it correctly of course veils were one of her strongest areas and i was gambling our lives that she had gotten it right not more than a breath or two later there was a swift pattering sound and a dim blur in the shadows which ceased moving abruptly maybe twenty feet away and revealed the presence of a vampire of the black court drulinda or so i presumed her to be was dressed in dark jeans a red knit sweater and a long black leather coat if shed been heavy in life death had taken care of that problem for her she was sunken and shriveled as bony and dried up as the yearold corpse she now was unlike the older vamps of her breed she still had most of her hair though it had clearly not been washed or styled most of the black court id run into had never been terribly body conscious i suppose once youd seen it rot there just wasnt much more that could happen to sway your opinion of it either way unlike the older vampires id faced she stank i dont mean that she carried a little whiff of the grave along with her i mean she smelled like a yearold corpse that still had a few juicy corners left and wasnt entirely done returning to the earth it was noxious enough to make me gagand id spent my day tracking down and dismantling a freaking slime golem she stood there for a moment while the platters went through the first verse looking all around her shed sensed something but she wasnt sure what the vampire turned a slow circle her shriveled lips moving in time with the music coming over the pa system and as she did two more of the creatures slower than drulinda appeared out of the darkness they were freshly made vampiresso much so that for a second i thought them human both men wore brown uniforms identical to raymonds both were stained with blood and both had narrow scoops of flesh missing from the sides of their throatsat the jugular and carotid specifically they moved stiffly making many little twitching motions of their arms and legs as if struggling against the onset of rigor mortis what is it slurred one of them his voice was ragged but not the horrible parody drulindas was her hand blurred its movement too fast to see the newborn vampire reacted with inhuman speed but not nearly enough of it and the blow threw him from his feet to land on the floor shattered teeth scattering out from him like coins from a dropped purse you can talk drulinda rasped when i say you can talk speak again and i will rip you apart and throw you into lake michigan you can spend eternity down there with no arms no legs no light and no blood the vampire his nose smashed into shapelessness rose as if hed just slipped and fallen on his ass he nodded his body language twitchy and cringing drulindas leathery lips peeled back from yellow teeth stained with drying brownish blood then she turned and darted ahead her footsteps making that light swift patter on the tiles of the floor she was gone and around the corner heading for the bistro in maybe two or three seconds the two newbie vampires went after her if far more slowly crap i whispered as they vanished dammit dammit dammit what was that harry molly whispered black court vampires i replied trying not to inhale too deeply the stench was fading but it wasnt gone some of the fastest strongest meanest things out there vampires sarah hissed incredulous she didnt look so good her face was turning green no this is no no no she broke off and was violently sick i avoided joining in by the narrowest of margins molly had an easier time of it than i focused as she was on maintaining the veil over us but i saw her swallow very carefully okay molly i said quietly listen to me she nodded turning abstracted eyes to me black court vampires i told her the ones stokers book outed all their weaknessessunlight garlic holy water symbols of faith remember she nodded yes most of the strengths too strong fast dont look them in the eyes i swallowed dont let them take you alive my apprentices eyes flickered with both apprehension and a sudden fierce fire i understand what do you want me to do keep the veil up take sarah here find a shady spot and lie low this should be over in half an hour maybe less by then theres going to be a ruckus getting peoples attention one way or another but i can get me killed trying to cover you i said firmly you arent in this league grasshopper not yet i have to move fast and i have friends here i wont be alone molly stared at me for a moment her eyes shining with brief frustrated tears then she nodded once and said isnt there anything i can do i peered at her then down at her birkenstocks yeah give me your shoes molly hadnt been my apprentice in the bizarre for a year and a half for nothing she didnt even blink much less ask questions she just took off her shoes and handed them to me i put a gentle hand on her shoulder then touched sarahs face until she lifted her eyes to me i dont understand whats happening she whispered stay with molly i told sarah shes going to take care of you do whatever she says all right i frowned down at her expensive black heels gucci prada she said in a numb voice being all manly i know dick about shoes but hopefully it wouldnt blow my cover as thomass mystery man give them to me all right she said and did too shocked to argue thomas had been right about the larpers the corpse of sarahs innocence lay on the floor along with her last meal and she was taking it pretty hard i fought down a surge of anger and rose without another word padding out from the protection of mollys veil shoes gripped in one hand my gun in the other the might as well have been linuss security blanket it wouldnt do a thing to help me against a vampire of the black courtit just made me feel better i went as fast as i could without making an enormous racket and stalked up the nearest stairsa deactivated escalator once id reached the second level i took a right and hurried toward shoegasm it was a fairly spacious shop that had originally occupied only a tiny spot but after ironing out some early troubles the prosperous little store had expanded into the space beside it now behind a steel mesh security curtain the store was arranged in an ohsotrendy fashion and sported several huge signs that went on with a thematically appropriate orgasmic enthusiasm about the stores quality moneyback guarantee i am totally underappreciated i muttered then i raised my voice a little forcing a very slight effort of will of magic into the words as i spoke keef hey keef its harry dresden i waited for a long moment peering through the grating but i couldnt see anything in the dim shadows of the store i took a chance slipping the silver pentacle amulet from its chain around my neck and with a murmur willed a whisper of magic through the piece of jewelry a soft blue radiance began to emanate from the silver though i tried to keep the light it let out to a minimum if drulinda or her vampire buddies were looking even vaguely in my direction i was going to stand out like a freaking moron holding the only light in an entire darkened shopping mall keef i called again the cobb appeared from an expensive handbag hung over the arm of a dressing dummy wearing a pair of sixhundreddollar italian boots he was a tiny thing maybe ten inches tall with a big puff of fine white hair like albert einstein he was dressed in something vaguely approximating nineteenthcentury urbaneuropean weardark trousers boots a white shirt and suspenders he also wore a leather work belt thick with tiny tools and he had a pair of oddlooking goggles pushed up over his forehead keef hopped down from the dressing dummy and hurried across the floor to the security grate he put on a pair of gloves and pulled out a couple of straps from his work belt then nearly as nimble as a squirrel and very careful not to touch the metal with his bare skin he climbed up the metal grate using a pair of carabiners keef was a faerie one of the little folk who dwelled within the shadows and hidden places of our own world and the touch of steel was painful to him wizard dresden he greeted me in a germanic accent as he came level with my head the cobbs voice was pitched low even for someone as tiny as he the market this night danger roams here you should not be dont i know it i replied but there are people in danger ah keef said the mortals you insist to defend unwise that battle is i need your help i said keef eyed me and gave me a firm shake of his head the walking dead very dangerous are my peoples blood it could cost that i will risk not you owe me keef i growled our living not our lives have it your way i said then i lifted up one of sarahs shoes and without looking away from the little cobb snapped the heel off ach keef cried in horror his little feet slipping off the metal grate nein there was a chorus of similar gasps and cries from inside shoegasm i held up the other shoe and did it again keef wailed in protest all of a sudden thirty of the little cobbs male and female pressed up to the security grate all of them had the same frizzy white hair all of them dressed like something from oktoberfest and all of them were horrified nein keef wailed again those are italian leather handmade what are you doing i took a step to my left and held the broken shoes over a trash can the cobbler elves gasped all together and froze in place do not do this keef begged me lost all is not repaired they can be good as new we can fix them good as new do not throw them away i didnt waver i know things have been hard for your people since cobblers have gone out of business i said i got you permission for your clan to work here fixing shoes in exchange for taking what you need from the vending machine true true keef said his eyes on the broken shoes in my hand wizard over the trash you need not hold them if dropped they are trash they become and touch them we may not lost to all will they be anything we both will regret let us not do anxious murmurs of agreement rose from the other cobbs enough of the stickit was time to show them the carrot i held up mollys battered old birkenstocks the sight made several of the more matronly cobbs cluck their tongues in disapproval i helped set you up with a good deal here at shoegasm i said but i can see youre getting a little crowded i can get you another good setupa family seven kids mom and dad all of them active the cobbs murmured in sudden excitement keef coughed delicately and said staring anxiously at the broken heels in my hand and the shoes ill turn them over to you i said if you help me keef narrowed his eyes slaves to you we are he snapped threatened and bribed you know the cause i fight for i said i protect mortals ive never tried to hide that and ive never lied to you i need your help keef ill do what it takes to get itbut you know my reputation by now i deal fairly with the little folk and i always show gratitude for their help the leader of the cobbs regarded me steadily for a moment nobody likes being strongarmed not even the little folk who are used to getting walked on but i didnt have time for diplomacy keefs gaze kept getting distracted by the shoes dangling over the trash can and he made no answer the other cobbs all waited clearly taking their cue from keef show of good faith keef i said quietly i took the broken shoes and set them gently on the ground in front of the shop ill trust you and your people to repair them and return them and ill pay in pizza the cobbs gasped staring at me as if id just offered them a map to el dorado i heard one of the younger cobbs exclaim true it is fleeting pizza is keef said sternly eternal are shoes and leather goods shoes and leather goods the rest of the cobbs intoned their tiny voices solemn few mortals to the little folk show respect these days keef said quietly or trust true it is that beneath this roof we are crowded and unto the wizard debt is owed he gave the shoes a professional glance and nodded once under your terms and within our means our aid is given your need unto us speak scouts i said at once i know there are black court vampires in the mall i need to know exactly how many and exactly where they are done it will be keef barked cobbs there was a little gust of wind and i was suddenly alone oh and both sarahs expensive heels and mollys clunky sandals were gone the latter right out of my hands and so smoothly that i hadnt even noticed them being taken i checked just to be careful but my own shoes remained safely on my feet which was a relief you cant ever be certain with cobbs the little faeries at times could get awfully fixated upon whatever their particular area of concern might be and messing around with it was more dangerous than most realized despite the metal screen between the cobbs and me id been playing with fire when i held those pradas over the trash can another thing that most people dont realize is just how much the little folk can learn and how fast they can do itespecially when things are happening on their own turf it took keef and his people about thirty seconds to go and return four there are keef reported three lesser who of late this place did guard one greater who gave them notlife four i breathed where one outside near the group of cars waits and watches keef said one outside the bistro where the mortals hide stands watch one beside his mistress stands within i got a sick little feeling in my stomach has anyone been hurt keef shook his head taunt them she does frighten them he shrugged it is not as their kind often is no shes there for vengeance not food i frowned i need you to get me something can you i told him what i needed and keef gave me a mildly offended look of course good now the one outside i said can you show me a way i could get close to him without being seen keefs eyes glittered with a sudden ferocity that was wholly at odds with his size and appearance this way wizard i went at what was practically a run but the tiny cobb had no trouble staying ahead of me he led me through a service access door that required a key to openuntil it suddenly swung open from the other side a dozen young male cobbs dangling from the security bar and cheering my amulet cast the only light as keef led me down a flight of stairs and through a long low tunnel access to the drains and watering system this passage is keef called to me we stopped at a ladder leading up a small paper sack sat on the floor by the ladder your weapons he said nodding at the bag he pointed at the ladder behind the vampire this opens i opened the bag and found two plastic cylinders i didnt want the crinkling paper so i put one of them in my jacket pocket kept the other in hand and crept up the ladder at the top was a hatch made of some kind of heavy synthetic rather than wood or steel and it opened without a sound i poked my head up and looked cautiously around the parking lot the lights were out but there was enough snow on the ground to bounce around plenty of light giving the outdoors an oddly close quiet quality almost as if someone had put a roof overhead just barely out of sight over by the last group of cars in the mall parking lot next to the blue beetle in fact stood the vampire he was little more than a black form and though human in shape he was inhumanly still every bit as motionless as the other inanimate objects in the parking lot snow had begun to gather on his head and shoulders just as it had on the roofs and hoods of the parked cars he stood facing the darkened mall where snow blew into the hole left by the thrown car he was watching i supposed for anyone who might come running out screaming a newborn vampire might not be anywhere near as dangerous as an older one but that was like saying a mack truck was nowhere near as dangerous as a main battle tank if you happened to be the guy standing in the road in front of one it wouldnt much matter to you which of them crushed you to pulp if id had my staff and rod with me i might have chanced a standup fight but i didnt have my gear and even if i had my usual magic would have made plenty of noise and warned the vampires companions vampires are tough they take a lot of killing i had to take this one out suddenly and with tremendous violence without making any noise if i had to face it openly id have no chance which is why i had used the cobbs intelligence to get sneaky i drew in my will the magic i had been born with and that i had spent a lifetime exercising practicing and focusing as the power came into me it made the skin of my arms ripple with goose bumps and i could feel a strange pressure at the back of my head and pressing against the inside of my forehead once i had the power ready i started shaping it with my thoughts focusing my will and intent on the desired outcome the spell i worked up wasnt one of my better evocations it took me more than twenty seconds to get it together for fast and dirty combat magic thats the nextbest thing to forever for treacherous backstabbing suckerpunch magic though its just fine at the very last second the vampire seemed to sense something it turned its head toward me i clenched my fist as i released my will and snarled gravitus the magic lashed out into the ground beneath the vampires feet and the steady slow immovable power of the earth suddenly stirred concentrating reaching up for the vampire standing upon it in technical terms i didnt actually increase the gravity of the earth beneath it i only concentrated it a little in a circle fifty yards across for just a fraction of a second gravity vanished the cars all surged up against their shock absorbers and settled again the thin coat of snow leapt several inches off the parking lot and fell back in that same fraction of a second all of that gravity from all of that area concentrated itself into a circle maybe eighteen inches across directly at the vampires feet there was no explosion no flash of lightand no scream the vampire just went down slammed to the earth as suddenly and violently as if id dropped an anvil on it there was a rippling crackling sound as hundreds of bones shattered all together and a splatter of sludgy liquid that splashed all over the cars around the vampiremostly upon the beetle really the effort of gathering and releasing so much energy left me gasping i was out of shape when it came to earth magic it had never been my strongest suittoo slow most of the time to seem like it would have been worth the bother as i hauled myself out of the ground though i had to admit that when there was enough time to actually use it it sure as hell was impressive i padded to the car watching the mall entrance but there was no outcry and no sudden appearance of drulinda or the other vampires of her scourge the vampire was still alive unalive whatever the thing was still trying to move it was mostly just a mass of pulped squishy meat in the cold at least it hadnt begun to rot so that cut down on the smell one eye rolled around in its mashed skull muscles twitched but without a solid framework of bone to work with they didnt accomplish much beyond an odd pulsing motion it could probably put itself back together given blood and time but i didnt feel like letting it have either i held the plastic cylinder over it nothing personal i told the vampire then i dumped powdered garlic from the pizzeria in the malls food court all over it i cant say the vampire screamed really it died the way a salted slug does in silent pulsing agony i had to fight to keep my stomach from emptying itself but only for a second absolutely disgusting demises are par for the course when fighting vampires a few wisps of smoke rose up and after a few seconds the mass of undead flesh became simple dead flesh again one down three to go i stalked toward the mall moving with all the silence i could manage after years working as a private investigator and more years fighting a magical war against the vampires in the shadows i knew how to be quiet i slipped up to within thirty feet of the entrance and spotted the second vampire before he noticed me right where keefs people said he was he stood facing the door of the bistro apparently intent on what was happening within i could hear voices inside though i could make out no details over the continued repeated playing of only you beyond that one of the voices was drulindas leathery rasp there were no sounds of fighting which wasnt good thomas certainly wouldnt have allowed them to hurt anyone without putting up a struggle and given the mutual capabilities of everyone involved it would have been noticeable a seconds thought told me that it might also be a good sign if theyd killed him they would have made a big mess doing it assuming he hadnt gone down without getting to put up much of a fightand i refused to assume anything else i knew my brother too wellsomething else had to be happening my brother could go toetotoe with a vampire of the black court if he had to but the last time hed done it the effort had nearly killed both him and the woman hed had to feed from in order to recover there were two of them inside and though thomas was as combat capable as any of the white courts best he wasnt going to start a slugfest if he thought he could get a better fight by biding his time doing what the white court didlooking human and using guile my instincts told me that thomas was stalling choosing his moment hell he was probably waiting for me to show up and help i looked down and found his birthday present untouched by the flying debris lying in its bright red and pink paper where molly had dropped it on the sidewalk outside the doors i found myself smiling twenty seconds or so later i tossed the present underhand it tumbled through the air and landed on the floor directly outside the bistros entrance the head of the vampire on guard jerked around focusing on the present it tilted its head to one side then it whipped around toward me baring its teeth in a snarl gravitus i thundered releasing a second earthcrafting once again everything jumped upbut this time it wasnt quiet the circle of nullified gravity embraced every shop nearby in the mall sending merchandise and shelves and dishes and furniture and cash registers and dressing dummies and god knew what other sundry objects flying up to come crashing back down to the floor again a great uproar of hundreds of impacts came down from the floors above us as well once again the circle of supergravity crushed a brownshirted vampire flat to the flooronly id forgotten about the levels above there was a shriek of tortured metal and a great crashing rain of debris came down in a nearly solid column as floors and ceilings gave way under the sudden enormous stress it all thundered down on the pulped vampire there was a second of shocked silence while objects continued falling from their shelves and bins and who knew what else evidently the damage to the ceiling had torn through some plumbing a steady stream of water began to patter down from overhead onto the mound of rubble along with occasional bits of stillfalling material then two things happened almost at the same time first my brother chose his moment the front wall of the bistro exploded outward i saw the flying form of another vampire security guard hurtle across the hallway into the opposite wall with no detectable loss of altitude and it smashed against a metal security grate with terrifying force second drulinda let out an eerie howl of fury it was a horrible sound nasty and rasping and somehow spidery for all that it was of inhuman volume there was a crash from inside the bistro young men and women started screaming there wasnt any time to waste i ran for the vampire my brother had thrown from the bistro it had bounced off and fallen on the ground and was still gathering itself up i had hoped it would take it a moment to recover from the blow to give me time to get close enough to act it didnt work out that way the vampire was on its feet again before i could get halfway there one of its shoulders twisted and deformed by the impact one arm hanging loosely it spun toward me with no sense of discomfort evident in its expression or posture and it let out a very humansounding scream of fury and flung itself at me i reacted with instant instinct raising my right hand with my will and calling fuego fire kindled from my open palm and rushed out in a furious torrent spewing raggedly across the tile floor in a great slewing cone it splashed against the floor up onto the metal grate and all over the vampire in question a sudden if clumsy immolation but without my blasting rod to help me focus the attack it was diffused the heat was spread out over a broad area instead of focused into a single searing beam though im sure it hurt like hell and though it set the security guard vampires uniform on fire it didnt cripple him it might have sent up an older more withered vampire like a torch but the newbie was still too juicy it didnt burn him up so much as broil him a bit pretty much it just pissed him off the vampire came at me with another higherpitched scream and swung a flaming arm at me maybe the fire had disoriented him a little because i was able to get out of the way of the blowsort of it missed my head and neck and instead slammed into my left shoulder like a train wreck pain flooded through me and the canister of garlic went flying the force of the blow spun me around and i fell to the floor the vampire came down on top of me teeth bared still on freaking fire as he leaned in with his nonpointy stillwhite teeth which were plenty strong enough to rip my throat open harry thomas screamed there was a rushing sound and a tremendous force pulled the vampire off me i sat up in time to see my brother drive his shoulder into the vampires chest slamming the undead thing back against the concrete wall between two stalls then thomas whipped out what looked like a broken chair leg and drove the shattered end of the wood directly into the vampires chest a couple of inches below the gold metallic security badge on his left breast slightly off center the vampires mouth opened toodark blood exploding from it in a gasp the creature reached for the chair leg with its remaining arm thomas solved that problem in the most brutal way imaginable his face set in fury my brother ignored the flames of the vampires burning clothing seized the remaining arm with both of his hands and with a twist of his hips and shoulders ripped it out of the socket more blood splashed out if only for a secondwithout a heartbeat to keep pumping it blood loss is mostly about leakageand then the mortally crippled vampire fell twitching and dying as the stake of wood through its heart put an end to its unlife i felt drulinda coming more than i saw it happen the cold presence of a black court vampire in a fury rubbing abrasively against my wizards senses thomas my brother turned in time to duck a blow so swift i didnt even see it he returned it with one of his own but drulinda though new to the trade was a master vampire a creature with its own terrible will and power thomas had fought other black court vamps beforebut not a master he was on the defensive from the outset though my brother was unthinkably strong and swift when drawing upon his vampiric nature he wasnt strong or swift enough i lay sprawled on the ground still half paralyzed by the pain in the left side of my body and tried to think of what to do next get out i screamed at the bistro get out of here people get the hell out now while i screamed drulinda slammed my brothers back into a metal security grate so hard that it left a broad smear of his pale red blood on its bars people started hurrying out of the bistro running for the parking lot drulinda looked over her shoulder and let out another hissing squall of rage at this opening thomas managed to get a grip on her arm set his feet and swing her into the wall sending cracks streaking through the concrete on the rebound he swung her up and around and then down smashing her down onto the floor then up from that and into a security mesh again crushing tile and bending metal with every impact i heard a scream and looked up to see ennui fall from her impossibly high black heels in her tiny tight black dress as she tried to flee the bistro a horribly disfigured hand had reached out from the rubble over the crushed vampire and now it held her i ran for the girl as my brother laid into drulinda my left arm wasnt talking to me and i fumbled the second canister out of my left jacket pocket with my right arm then dumped garlic over the outstretched vampires hand it began smoking and spasming ennui screamed as the crushing grip broke her ankle i stood up in frustration and started stomping down on the vampires arm supernaturally strong it might be but its bones were made of bone and it couldnt maintain its grip on the girl without them it took a lot of stomping but i was finally able to pull the girl free i tried to get ennui to her feet but her weight came down on her broken ankle and from there it came down on my wounded shoulder i went down to one knee and it was all i could do not to fall i almost didnt notice when my brother flew through the air just over my head smashed out what had to be the last remaining pane of glass at the mall entrance and landed limply in the parking lot i felt drulindas presence coming up behind me the vampire let out a dusty laugh i thought it was just some poor pretty boy to play with silly me i fumbled with the canister for a second and then whirled flinging its contents at drulinda in a slewing arc the vampire blurred to one side dodging the garlic with ease she looked battered and was covered with dust her undead flesh was approximately the consistency of wood and so it wasnt cut and damaged so much as chipped and crushed her clothes were torn and ruinedand none of that mattered she was just as functional and just as deadly as she had been before the fight i dropped the canister and drew forth my pentacle amulet lifting it as a talisman against her the old bit with the crucifix works on the black courtbut it isnt purely about christianity they are repelled not by the holy symbol itself but by the faith of the one holding it up against them id seen vampires repulsed by crosses crucifixes strips of paper written with holy symbols by a shinto priestonce even a star of david me i used the pentacle because that was what i believed in the fivepointed star to me represented the five elements of earth air water fire and spirit bound within the solid circle of mortal will i believed that magic was a force intended to be used to create to protect and to preserve i believed that magic was a gift that had to be used responsibly and wiselyand that it especially had to be used against creatures like drulinda against literal personified evil to protect those who couldnt protect themselves that was what i thought and id spent my life acting in accordance with it i believed pale blue light began to spill from the symboland drulinda stopped with a hiss of sudden rage you she said after a few seconds i have heard of you the wizard dresden i nodded slowly behind her the fire from my earlier spell was spreading the power was out and i had no doubt that drulinda and her former securityguard lackeys had disabled the alarms it wouldnt take long for a fire to go insane in this place once it got its teeth sunk in we needed to get out go i mumbled at ennui she sobbed and started crawling for the exit while i held drulinda off with the amulet the vampire stared steadily at me for a second her eyes all milky white corpse cataracts glinting in the reflected light of the fire then she smiled and moved she was just too damn fast i tried to turn to keep up with her but by the time i did ennui screamed and drulinda had seized her hair and dragged her back out of the immediate circle of light cast by the amulet she lifted the struggling girl with ease so that i could see her mascarastreaked face wizard drulinda said ennui had been cut by flying glass or the fall at some point and some blood had streaked out of her slickedback hair over her ear and down one side of her throat the vampire leaned in extending a tongue like a strip of beef jerky and licked blood from the girls skin you can hide behind your light but you cant save her i ground my teeth and said nothing but your death will profit me grant me standing with others of my kind the feared and vaunted wizard dresden she bared yellowed teeth in a smile so i offer you this bargain throw away the amulet i will let the girl go you have my word she leaned her teeth in close and brushed them over the girls neck otherwise well all of my new friends are gone ill have to make more that made me shudder dying was one thing dying and being made into one of those i lowered the amulet i hesitated for a second and then dropped it drulinda let out a low eager sound and tossed ennui aside like an empty candy wrapper then she was on me letting out rasping giggles for gods sake pressing me down i can smell your fear wizard she rasped i think im going to enjoy this she leaned closer slowly as she bared her teeth her face only inches from mine which was where i wanted her to be i reared up my head and spat out a gooey mouthful of powdered garlic directly into those cataract eyes drulinda let out a scream bounding away in a violent rush clawing at her eyes with her fingersand getting them burned too she thrashed in wild agony swinging randomly at anything she touched or bumped into tearing great gaping gashes in metal fences smashing holes in concrete walls couple words of advice i growled my mouth burning with the remains of the garlic id stuffed it with as shed come sneaking up on me first anytime im not shooting my mouth off to a cliched twobit creature of the night like you its because im up to something drulinda howled more and rushed toward metripping on some rubble and sprawling on the ground only to rush about on all fours like some kind of ungainly horrible insect i checked behind me ennui was already out and thomas was beginning to stir maybe roused by the snow now falling on him i turned back to the blinded painmaddened vampire we were the only ones left in that wing of the mall second i spat never touch my brother on his fucking birthday i reached for my will lifted my hand and snarled fuego fire roared out to eagerly engulf the vampire what the hell the building was burning down anyway freaking amateur villains i muttered glowering down at the splatters on my car thomas leaned against it with one hand pressed to his head a grimace of pain on his face you okay i waved my left arm a little feelings coming back ill have butters check me out later thanks for loaning molly your car least i could do let her drive sarah and ennui to the hospital he squinted at the rising smoke from the mall think the whole thing will go nah i said this wing maybe theyll get here before too much more goes up keef and his folk should be all right my brother grunted how are they going to explain this one who knows i said meteor maybe smashed holes in the roof crushed some poor security guard set the place on fire my vote is for terrorists thomas said terrorists are real popular these days he shook his head but i meant the larpers not the cops oh i said probably they wont talk to anyone about what they saw afraid people would think they were crazy and they would thomas said and they would i agreed come tomorrow it will seem very unreal a few months from now theyll wonder if they didnt imagine some of it or if there wasnt some kind of gas leak or something that made them hallucinate give it a few more years and theyll remember that drulinda and some roughlooking types showed up to give them a hard time they drove a car through the front of the mall maybe they were crazy people dressed in costumes who had been to a few too many larps themselves i shook my head its human nature to try to understand and explain everything the world is less scary that way but i dont think theyll be in any danger really no more so than anyone else thats good thomas said quietly i guess its the way it is in the distance sirens were starting up and coming closer i grunted and said wed better go yeah we got into the beetle i started it up and we headed out i left the lights offno sense attracting attention you going to be all right i asked him he nodded take me a few days to get enough back into me to feel normal buthe shruggedill make it thanks for the backup i said kicked their freaky asses he said and held out his fist i rapped my knuckles lightly against it nice signal the birthday present i figured youd get it i said then i frowned crap i said your present you didnt remember to bring it i was a little busy i said he was quiet for a minute then he asked what was it rockem sockem robots i said he blinked at me what i repeated myself the little plastic robots you make fight i know what they are harry he responded im trying to figure out why youd give me them i pursed my lips for a minute then i said right after my dad died they put me in an orphanage it was christmastime on television they had commercials for rockem sockem robots two kids playing with them you know two brothers i shrugged that was a year when i really really wanted to give those stupid plastic robots to my brother because it would mean you werent alone thomas said quietly yeah i said sorry i forgot them and happy birthday he glanced back at the burning mall well my brother said i suppose its the thought that counts heorot from my big fat supernatural honeymoon edited by p n elrod takes place between white night and small favor once more pat invited me to come play at her literary clubhouse and once more i cheerfully agreed what can i say i fear change the last anthologys theme had been weddings and this one was the logical sequelhoneymoons research into the etymology of honeymoon led me back to its roots in scandinavia and in the british isles where a newly wed bride and groom would depart their village and remain in solitude for a lunar month while being well provided with mead which is made from honey i think the idea was to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that any child conceived in that time was the legitimate heir of the groom or maybe it was just to get a pretty young bride liquored up and wild for a monthviking girls gone wild as it were i have no idea if the information i found mostly on the internet was academically accurate for my purposes that wasnt nearly as important as finding a solid inspiration so from newlyweds mead and norsescandinavian backgrounds i developed a story using everything from the dresden files story line that had the flimsiest of connections to those base ideas i put them all together plopped harry down in the middle of it and gleefully watched as it caught fire i was sitting in my office sorting through my bills when mac called and said i need your help it was the first time id heard him use four whole words all together like that okay i said where id outtersed himanother first loon island pub mac said wrigleyville on the way i hung up stood up put on my black leather duster and said to my dog were on the job my dog mouse who outweighs most european cars bounced up eagerly from where he had been dozing near my offices single heating vent he shook out his thick grey fur especially the shaggy almost leonine ruff growing heavy on his neck and shoulders and we set out to help a friend october had brought in more rain and more cold than usual and that day we had both plus wind i found parking for my battered old volkswagen bug hunched my shoulders under my leather duster and walked north along clark into the wind mouse keeping pace at my side loon island pub was in sight of wrigley field and a popular hangout before and after games bigger than most such businesses it could host several hundred people throughout its various rooms and levels outside large posters had been plastered to the brick siding of the building though the posters were soaked with rain you could still read chicago beer association and night of the living brews followed by an announcement of a homebrewed beer festival and competition with todays date on it there was a lot of foot traffic in and out aha i told mouse explains why mac is here instead of at his own place hes finally unleashed the new dark on the unsuspecting public mouse glanced up at me rather reproachfully from under his shaggy brows then he lowered his head sighed and continued plodding against the rain until we gained the pub mac was waiting for us at the front door he was a sinewy bald man dressed in dark slacks and a white shirt somewhere between the age of thirty and fifty he had a very average unremarkable face one that usually wore a steady expression of patience and contemplation today though that expression was what i could only describe as grim i came in out of the rain and passed off my sixfoot oak staff to mac to hold for me as i shrugged out of my duster i shook the garment thoroughly sending raindrops sheeting from it and promptly put it back on mac runs the pub where the supernatural community of chicago does most of its hanging out his place has seen more than its share of paranormal nasties and if mac looked that worried i wanted the spellreinforced leather of the duster between my tender skin and the source of his concern i took the staff back from mac who nodded to me and then crouched down to mouse who had gravely offered a paw to shake mac shook ruffled mouses ears and said missing girl i nodded scarcely noticing the odd looks i was getting from several of the people inside that was par for the course what do we know husband mac said he jerked his head at me and i followed him deeper into the pub mouse stayed pressed against my side his tail wagging in a friendly fashion i suspected the gesture was an affectation mouse is an awful lot of dog and people get nervous if he doesnt act overtly friendly mac led me through a couple of rooms where each table and booth had been claimed by a different brewer homemade signs bearing a gratuitous number of exclamation points touted the various concoctions except for the one mac stopped at there a cardstock table tent was neatly lettered simply reading mcanallys dark at the booth next to macs a young man goodlooking in a reedy librarianesque kind of way was talking to a police officer while wringing his hands but you dont get it the young man said she wouldnt just leave not today we start our honeymoon tonight the cop a stocky balding fellow whose nose was perhaps more red than warranted by the weather outside shook his head sir im sorry but shes been gone for what an hour or two we dont even start to look until twentyfour hours have passed she wouldnt just leave the young man half shouted look kid the cop said it wouldnt be the first time some guys new wife panicked and ran off you want my advice start calling up her old boyfriends but the cop thumped a finger into the young mans chest get over it buddy come back in twentyfour hours he turned to walk away from the young man and almost bumped into me he took a step back and scowled up at me you want something just basking in the glow of your compassion officer i replied his face darkened into a scowl but before he could take a deep breath and start throwing his weight around mac pushed a mug of his dark ale into the cops hand the cop slugged it back immediately he swished the last gulp around in his mouth purely for form and then tossed the mug back at mcanally belched and went on his way mr mcanally the young man said turning to mac thank goodness i still havent seen her he looked at me is this him mac nodded i stuck out my hand harry dresden roger braddock the anxious young man said someone has abducted my wife he gripped too hard and his fingers were cold and a little clammy i wasnt sure what was going on here but braddock was genuinely afraid abducted her did you see it happen well he said no not really no one did but she wouldnt just walk out not today we got married this morning and were leaving on our honeymoon tonight soon as the festival is over i arched an eyebrow you put your honeymoon on hold to go to a beer festival im opening my own place braddock said mr mcanally has been giving me advice sort of mentoring me this was i mean ive been here every year and its only once a year and the prestige from a win is the networking and his voice trailed off as he looked around yeah the looming specter of sudden loss has a way of making you reevaluate things sometimes its tough to know whats really important until you realize it might be gone you two were at this booth i prompted yes he said he licked his lips she went to pick up some napkins from the bar right over there she wasnt twenty feet away and somehow she just vanished personally i was more inclined to go with the cops line of reasoning than the kids people in general tend to be selfish greedy and unreliable there are individual exceptions of course but no one ever wants to believe that the petty portions of human nature might have come between themselves and someone they care about the kid seemed awfully sincere but endearing awfully sincere people their decisions driven mostly by their emotions are capable of being mistaken on an epic scale the worse the situation looks the harder theyll search for reasons not to believe it it seemed more likely that his girl left him than that someone took her away on the other hand likely isnt the same as trueand mac isnt the kind to cry wolf how long you two been together i asked braddock since we were fifteen he replied an anemic smile fluttered around his mouth almost ten years making it official eh we both knew when it was right he replied he lost the smile just like i know she didnt walk away not unless someone made her do it i stepped around braddock and studied the highbacked booth for a moment a keg sat on the table next to a little cardstock sign that had a cartoon bee decked out with a vikingstyle helmet a baldric and a greatsword words beneath the bee proclaimed braddocks midnight sun cinnamon i grunted and reached down pulling a simple black leather ladies purse from beneath the bench seating not an expensive purse either not much chance shed walk without taking her bag i said thats for damn sure braddock bit his lip closed his eyes and said elizabeth i sighed well dammit now she had a name elizabeth braddock newlywedmaybe shed just run off but maybe she hadnt i didnt think i would like myself very much if i walked and it turned out that she really was in danger and really did get hurt what the hell no harm in looking around i guess the games afoot i said i gestured vaguely with the purse may i sure braddock said sure sure i dumped elizabeths purse out on the booths table behind the beer keg and began rummaging through it the usuala wallet some makeup a cell phone kleenex some feminine sanitary sundries one of those plastic birth control pill holders with a folded piece of paper taped to it and there was a hairbrush an antiquelooking thing with a long pointy silver handle i plucked several strands of dark wavy hair from the brush is this your wifes hair braddock blinked at me for a second then nodded yes of course mind if i borrow this he didnt i pocketed the brush for the moment and glanced at the birth control pill case i opened it only the first several slots were empty i untaped the folded paper and opened it finding instructions for the medicines use who keeps the instruction sheet for crying out loud while i pondered it a shadow fell across braddock and a beefy heavily tattooed arm shoved him back against the spine of the partition between booths i looked up the arm to the beefy heavily tattooed bruiser attached to it he was only a couple of inches shorter than me and layered with muscle gone to seed he was bald and sported a bristling beard scar tissue around his eyes told me hed been a fighter and a lumpy oftenbroken nose suggested that he might not have been much good at it he wore black leather and rings heavy enough to serve as passable brass knuckles on every finger of his right hand his voice was like the rest of himthick and dull he flung a little triangle of folded cardstock at braddock wheres my keg braddock caine braddock stammered what are you talking about my keg bitch the big man snarled a couple of guys who wished they were more like caine lurked behind him propping up his ego its gone you figure you couldnt take the competition this year i glanced at the fallen table tent it also had a little wagnerian cartoon bee on it and the lettering caines kickass i dont have time for this braddock said caine shoved him back against the booth again harder we aint done stay put bitch unless you want me to feed you your ass i glanced at mac who stared at caine frowning but not doing anything mac doesnt like to get involved hes smarter than i am i stepped forward seized caines hand in mine and pumped it enthusiastically hi there harry dresden pi how you doing i nodded at him smiling and smiled at his friends too hey are you allergic to dogs caine was so startled that he almost forgot to try crushing my hand in his when he got around to it it hurt enough that i had to work not to wince im not heavily built but im more than six and a half feet tall and it takes more strength than most have to make me feel it what he said wittily dog what allergic to dogs i clarified and nodded down at mouse occasionally someone has a bad reaction to my dog and id hate that to happen here the biker scowled at me and then looked down two hundred pounds of mouse not acting at all friendly now stared steadily at caine mouse didnt show any teeth or growl he didnt need to he just stared caine lifted his lips up from his teeth in an ugly little smile but he released my hand with a jerk and then sneered at braddock say wheres that pretty little piece of yours she run off to find a real man braddock might have been a sliver over half of caines size but he went after the biker with complete sincerity and without a second thought this time mac moved interposing himself between braddock and caine getting his shoulder against braddocks chest the older man braced himself and shoved braddock back from the brink of a beating though the younger man cursed and struggled against him caine let out an ugly laugh and stepped forward his big hands closing into fists i leaned my staff so that he stepped into it the blunt tip of the wood thrusting solidly against the hollow of his throat he made a noise that sounded like glurk and stepped back scowling ferociously at me i tugged my staff back against my chest so that i could hold up both hands palms out just as the dumpy cop attracted by braddocks thumping and cursing came into the room with one hand on his nightstick easy there big guy i said loud enough to make sure the cop heard the kids just upset on account of his wife he doesnt mean anything by it the bruiser lifted one closed fist as if he meant to drive it at my noggin but one of his two buddies said urgently cop caine froze and glanced back over his shoulder the officer might have been overweight but he looked like he knew how to throw it around and he had a club and a gun besides never mind all the other uniforms theoretically behind him caine opened his fist showing an empty hand and lowered it again sure he said sure misunderstanding happen to anybody you want to walk away the cop told caine do it now otherwise you get a ride caine and company departed in sullen silence glaring daggers at mewell glaring letter openers anyway caine didnt seem real sharp the cop stalked over to me more lightly than he should have been able tono question about it the man knew how to play rough he looked at me then at my staff and kept his nightstick in his hand you dresden uhhuh i said heard of you work for special investigations sometimes call yourself a wizard thats right you know rawlins good man i said the cop grunted he jerked his head toward the departing caine as he put the stick away guys a con a hard case too likes hurting people you keep your eyes open mr wizard or hell make some of your teeth disappear yeah i said golly hes scary the cop eyed me then snorted and said your dentures he nodded and walked out again probably tailing caine to make sure he left the cop and caine werent all that different in some ways the cop would have loved to take his stick to caines head as much as caine had wanted to swat mine they were both damn near equally sensitive about braddocks missing wife too but at least the cop had channeled his inner thug into something that helped out the people around himas long as he didnt have to run up too many stairs i guessed i turned back to mac and found him still standing between the kid and the door mac nodded his thanks to me braddock looked like he might be about to start crying or maybe start screaming no love lost there eh i said to braddock the kid snarled at the empty space where caine had been elizabeth embarrassed him once he doesnt take rejection well and he never forgets do you think he did it not really mac i said something tipped you off that this was from the spooky side lights flicker mac grunted twice braddock stared at mac and then at me what does that have to do with anything active magic tends to interfere with electrical systems i said itll disrupt cell phones screw up computers simpler things like the lights usually just flicker a bit braddock had a look somewhere between uncertainty and nausea on his face magic youre kidding right im tired of having this conversation i said i reached into my pocket for elizabeth braddocks fallen hairs this joint got a back door mac pointed silently thanks i said come on mouse the back door opened into a long narrow dirty alley running parallel to clark the wind had picked up which meant that the cold rain was mostly striking the upper portion of one wall of the alley good for me its tough to get a solid spell put together under even a moderate rain when its really coming down its all but impossible even for a relatively simple workingsuch as a tracking spell id done this hundreds of times and by now it was pretty routine i found a clear spot of concrete in the lee of the sheltering wall and sketched a quick circle around me with a piece of chalk investing the motion with a deliberate effort of will as i completed the circle i felt the immediate resulta screen of energy that rose up from the circle enfolding me and warding out any random energy that might skew the spell i took off my necklace a silver chain with a battered old silver pentacle hanging from it murmuring quietly and tied several of elizabeths hairs through the center of the pentacle after that i gathered up my will feeling the energy focused by the circle into something almost tangible whispered in faux latin and released the gathered magic into the pentacle the silver fivepointed star flickered once a dozen tiny sparks of static electricity fluttering over the metal surface and the hairs bound inside it i grimaced id been sloppy to let some of the energy convert itself into static and id been harping on my apprentice about the need for precision for a week i broke the circle by smudging the chalk with one foot and glanced at mouse who sat patiently mouth open in a doggy grin mouse had been there for some of those lessons and he was smarter than the average dog how much smarter remained to be seen but i got the distinct impression he was laughing at me it was the rain i told him mouse sneezed tail wagging i glowered at him im not sure i could take it if my dog was smarter than me the falling rain would wash away the spell on the amulet if i left it out in the open so i shielded it as carefully as i could with the building and my hand a hat would have come in handy for that purpose actually maybe i should get one i held up the amulet focusing on the spell it quivered on the end of its chain then swung toward the far end of the alley in a sharp sudden motion i drew my hand and the amulet back up into the sleeve of my duster whistling she came right down this alley and judging by the strength of the reaction she was scared bad left a really big trail at that mouse made a chuffing sound and started down the alley snuffling the end of his short lead mostly there for appearances sake dragged the ground i kept pace and by the time mouse was twenty yards down the alley he had begun growling low in his throat that was an occasion worth a raised eyebrow mouse didnt make noise unless there was something bad around he increased his pace and i lengthened my stride to keep up i found myself growling along with him id gotten sick of bad things visiting themselves upon people in my town a long time ago when we hit the open street mouse slowed magic wasnt the only thing that a steady rain could screw up he growled again and looked over his shoulder at me tail drooping i got your back i told him i lifted a section of my long leather duster with my staff so that i could hold the amulet in the shelter it offered i looked only moderately ridiculous while doing so im going to get a hat one of these days i swear the tracking spell held and the amulet led me down the street toward wrigley the silent stadium loomed in the cold grey rain mouse still snuffling dutifully abruptly turned down another alley his steps hurrying to a lope i propped up my coat and consulted the amulet again i was so busy feeling damp and cold and selfconscious that i forgot to feel paranoid and caine came out of nowhere and swung something hard at my skull i turned my head and twitched sideways at the last second taking the blow just to one side of the center of my forehead there was a flash of light and my legs went wobbly i had time to watch caine wind up again and saw that he was swinging a long white dirty athletic sock at me hed weighted one end with something creating an improvised flail my hips bounced off a municipal trash can and i got one arm between the flail and my face the protective spells on my coat are good but theyre intended to protect me against gunfire and sharp pointy things the flail smashed into my right forearm it went numb so what you steal my keg for braddock so his homobee cinnamon crap would win the division im gonna take it out of your ass and with that pleasant mental image caine wound up again with that flail hed made a mistake though pausing to get in a little dialogue like that if hed hit me again immediately he probably could have beaten me unconscious in short order he hadnt hesitated longbut it had been long enough for me to pull my thoughts together as he came in swinging i snapped the lower end of my heavy staff into a rising quarter spin right into his testicles the thugs eyes snapped wideopen and his mouth locked into a silent scream its the little things in life you treasure caine staggered and fell to one side but one of the cainettes came in hard behind him and pasted me in the mouth by itself i might have shrugged it off but caine had already rung my bells once i went down to one knee and tried to figure out what was going on someone with big motorcycle boots kicked me in the guts i fell to my back and drove a heel into his kneecap there was a crackle and a pop and he fell howling the third guy had a tire iron no time for magicmy damn eyes wouldnt focus much less my thoughts by some minor miracle i caught the first twohanded swing on my staff and then two hundred pounds of wet dog slammed into cainette number twos chest mouse didnt bite presumably because there are some things even dogs wont put in their mouths he just overbore the thug and smashed him to the ground pinning him there the two of them thrashed around i got up just as caine came back in swinging his flail i dont think caine knew much about quarterstaff fighting murphy had been teaching it to me however for almost four years i got the staff up as caine swung and intercepted the sock the weighted end wrapped around my staff and i jerked the weapon out of his hands with a sweeping twist with the same motion i brought the other end of the staff around and popped him in the noggin caine flopped to the ground i stood there panting and leaning on my staff hey id won a brawl that generally didnt happen when i wasnt using magic mouse seemed fine if occupied holding his thug down jerk i muttered to the unconscious caine and kicked him lightly in the ribs i have no idea what happened to your freaking keg oh my said a womans voice from behind me she spoke perfectly clear english marked with an accent that sounded vaguely germanic or maybe scandinavian i have to admit i didnt expect youd do that well against them i turned slightly so that i could keep the thugs in my peripheral vision and shifted my grip on the staff as i faced the speaker she was a tall blonde six feet or so even in flat practical shoes her tailored grey suit didnt quite hide an athletes body nor did it make her look any less feminine she had ice blue eyes a stark attractive face and she carried a duffel bag in her right hand i recognized her she was the supernatural security consultant to john marcone the kingpin of chicago crime miss gard isnt it i asked her panting she nodded mr dresden my arm throbbed and my ears were still ringing id have a lovely goose egg right in the middle of my forehead in an hour glad i could entertain you i said now if youll excuse me im working i need to speak to you she said call during office hours caine lay senseless groaning the guy id kicked in the knee whimpered and rocked mindlessly back and forth i glared at the thug mouse had pinned down he flinched there wasnt any fight left in him thank god there wasnt much left in me either mouse i said and started down the alley mouse rose up off the man who said oof as the dog planted both paws in the mans belly as he pushed up mouse followed me im serious mr dresden gard said to my back following us marcone is only a king in his own mind i said without stopping he wants to send me a message he can wait ive got important things to do i know gard said the girl shes a brunette maybe five foot five brown eyes green golf shirt blue jeans and scared half out of her mind i stopped and turned to bare my teeth at gard marcone is behind this that son of a bitch is going to be sorry he ever looked at that no gard said sharply look dresden forget marcone this has nothing to do with marcone todays my day off i stared at her for a moment and only partly because the rain had begun to make the white shirt she wore beneath the suit jacket become transparent she sounded sincerewhich meant nothing ive learned better than to trust my judgment when theres a blonde involved or a brunette or a redhead what do you want i asked her almost the same thing you do she replied you want the girl i want the thing that took her why the girl doesnt have enough time for you to play twenty questions dresden we can help each other and save her or she can die i took a deep breath and then nodded once im listening i lost the trail at the far end of this alley she said clearly you havent yeah i said skip to the part where you tell me how you can help me wordlessly she opened up the duffel bag and drew outi kid you nota doublebitted battleax that must have weighed fifteen pounds she rested it on one shoulder if you can take me to the grendelkin ill deal with it while you get the girl out grendelkin what the hell was a grendelkin dont get me wrongim a wizard i know about the supernatural i could fill up a couple of looseleaf notebooks with the names of various entities and creatures i recognized thats the thing about knowledge though the more you learn the more you realize how much there is to learn the supernatural realms are bigger far bigger than the material world and humanity is grossly outnumbered i could learn about new beasties until i dropped dead of old age a few centuries from now and still not know a quarter of them this one was new on me dresden seconds could matter here gard said beneath the calm mask of her lovely face i could sense a shadow of anxiety of urgency as i absorbed that there was a sharp clicking sound as a piece of broken brick or a small stone from roofing material fell to the ground farther down the alley gard whirled dropping instantly into a fighting crouch both hands were on her ax which she held in a defensive position across the front of her body yikes id seen gard square off against a worldclass necromancer and her pet ghoul without batting a golden eyelash what the hell had her so spooked she came back out of her stance warily then shook her head and muttered something under her breath before turning to me again whats going to happen to that girl you have no idea it shouldnt happen to anyone so im begging you please help me i sighed well dammit she said please the rain was weakening the tracking spell on my amulet and washing away both the scent of the grendelkin and the psychic trail left by the terrified elizabeth but between mouse and me we managed to find where the bad guy had literally gone to earth the trail ended at an old storm cellarstyle door in back of the buildings on the east side of wrigley field under the tracks of the el near addison station the doors were ancient and looked as if they were rusted shutthough they couldnt have been if the trail went through them they were surrounded by a gateless metal fence a sign on the fence declared the area dangerous and to keep outyou know the usual sound advice that thrillseeking blockheads and softhearted wizards with nagging headaches always ignore you sure i asked mouse it went in there mouse circled the fence snuffling at the dry ground protected from the rain by the el track overhead then he focused intently on the doors and growled the amulet bobbed weakly less definitely than it had a few minutes before i grimaced and said it went down here but it traveled north after that gard grunted crap crap i concurred the grendelkin had fled into undertown chicago is an old cityat least by american standards its been flooded burned down several times been constructed and reconstructed ad nauseam large sections of the city have been built up as high as ten and twelve feet above the original ground level while other buildings have settled into the swampy muck around lake michigan dozens and dozens of tunnel systems wind beneath its surface no one knows exactly how many different tunnels and chambers people have created intentionally or by happenstance and since most people regard the supernatural as one big scam no one has noticed all the additional work done by notpeople in the meantime undertown begins somewhere just out of the usual traffic in the commuter and utility tunnels where sections of wall and roof regularly collapse and where people with good sense just arent willing to go from there it gets dark cold treacherous and jealously inhabited increasingly so the farther you go things live down thereall kinds of things a visit to undertown bears more resemblance to suicide than exploration and those who do it are begging to be darwined out of the gene pool smart people dont go down there gard slashed a long opening in the fence with her ax and we descended crumbling old concrete steps into the darkness i murmured a word and made a small effort of will and my amulet began to glow with a gentle bluewhite light illuminating the tunnel only dimlyenough i hoped to see by while still not giving away our approach gard produced a small redfiltered flashlight from her duffel bag a backup light source it made me feel better when youre underground making sure you have light is almost as important as making sure you have air it meant that she knew what she was doing the utility tunnel we entered gave way to a ramshackle series of chambers the spaces between what were now basements and the raised wall of the road that had been built up off the original ground level mouse went first with me and my staff and my amulet right behind him gard brought up the rear walking lightly and warily we went on for maybe ten minutes through difficulttospot doorways and at one point through a tunnel flooded with a foot and a half of icy stagnant water twice we descended deeper into the earth and i began getting antsy about finding my way back spelunking is dangerous enough without adding in anything that could be described with the word ravening this grendelkin i said tell me about it you dont need to know like hell i dont i said you want me to help you you gotta help me tell me how we beat this thing we dont she said i do thats all you need to know that sort of offended me being so casually kept ignorant granted id done it to people myself about a million times mostly to protect them but that didnt make it any less frustratingjust ironic and if it offs you instead i said id rather not be totally clueless when its charging after me and the girl and i have to turn and fight it shouldnt be a problem i stopped in my tracks and turned to regard her she stared back at me eyebrows lifted water dripped somewhere nearby there was a faint rumbling above us maybe the el going by somewhere overhead she pressed her lips together and nodded a gesture of concession its a scion of grendel i started walking again whoa like the grendel obviously gard sighed before beowulf faced him in heorot the grendel i asked the beowulf yes and it actually happened like in the story i demanded it isnt far wrong gard replied an impatient note in her voice before beowulf faced him grendel had already taken a number of women on his previous visits he got spawn upon them ick i said but i think they make a cream for that now gard gave me a flat look you have no idea what youre talking about no kidding i said thats the point of asking you know all you need i ignored the statement and the sentiment behind it to boot a good private investigator is essentially a professional asker of questions if i kept them coming eventually id get some kind of answer back at the pub there was an electrical disruption does this thing use magic not the way you do gard said see there an answer a vague answer but an answer i pressed ahead then how grendelkin are strong gard said fast and they can bend minds in an area around them bend how they can make people not notice them or to notice only dimly disguise themselves sometimes its how they get close sometimes they can cause malfunctions in technology veiling magic i said illusion been there done that i mused mac said there were two disruptions is there any reason it would want to steal a keg from the beer festival gard shot me a sharp look keg thats what those yahoos in the alley were upset about i said someone swiped their keg gard spat out a word that would probably have gotten bleeped out had she said it on some kind of scandinavian talk show what brew eh i said what kind of liquor was in the keg she demanded how the hell should i know i asked i never even saw it dammit but i scrunched up my nose thinking the sign from his table had a drawing of a little viking bee on it and it was called caines kickass a bee she said her eyes glittering youre sure yeah she swore again mead i blinked at her this thing ripped off a keg of mead and a girl is she supposed to be its bowl of bar nuts or something it isnt going to eat her gard said it wants the mead for the same reason it wants the girl i waited a beat for her to elaborate she didnt im rapidly running out of willingness to keep playing along i told her but ill ask the questionwhy does it want the girl procreation she said thank you now i get it i said the thing figures shell need a good set of beer goggles before the deed no gard said oh right because the grendelkin isnt human the thing is going to need the beer goggles no gard said harder i understand just setting the mood then i said maybe it picked up some lounge music cds too dresden gard growled everybody needs somebody sometime i sangbadly gard stopped in her tracks and faced me her pale blue eyes frozen with glacial rage her voice turned harsh but not everybody impregnates women with spawn that will rip its own way out of its mothers womb killing her in the process see another answer it was harsher than i would have preferred i stopped singing and felt sort of insensitive theyre solitary gard continued in a voice made more terrible for its uninflected calm most of the time they abduct a victim rape her rip her to shreds and eat her this one has more in mind theres something in mead that makes the grendelkin fertile its going to impregnate her create another of its kind a thought occurred to me thats what kind of person still has her instructions taped to her birth control medication someone whos never taken it until very recently shes a virgin gard confirmed grendelkin need virgins to reproduce kind of a scarce commodity these days i said gard snapped out a bitter bark of laughter take it from me dresden teenagers have always been teenagers hormoneridden curious and generally ignorant of the consequences of their actions theres never been a glut on the virgin market not in victorian times not during the renaissance not at hastings and not now but even if they were ten times as rare in the modern age there would still be more virgins to choose from than at any other point in history she shook her head there are so many people now we walked along for several paces interesting inflection there i said speaking about those times as if youd seen them firsthand you expect me to believe youre better than a thousand years old would it be so incredible she asked she had me there lots of supernatural critters were immortal or the nextbest thing to it even mortal wizards could hang around for three or four centuries on the other hand id rarely run into an immortal who felt so human to my wizards senses i stared at her for a second and then said you wear it pretty well if its true i would have guessed you were about thirty her teeth flashed in the dim light i believe its currently considered more polite to guess twentynine me and polite have never been on close terms gard nodded i like that about you you say what you think you act its rare in this age i kept on the trail quiet for a time until mouse stopped in his tracks and made an almost inaudible sound in his chest i held up a hand halting gard went silent and still i knelt down by the dog and whispered what is it boy mouse stared intently ahead his nose quivering then he paced forward uncertainly and pawed at the floor near the wall i followed him light in hand on the wet stone floor were a few tufts of greyish hair i chewed my lip and lifted the light to examine the wall there were long scratches in the stonenot much wider than a thumbnail but they were deep you couldnt easily see the bottom of the scratch marks gard came up and peered over my shoulder amid the scents of lime and mildew her perfume something floral i didnt recognize was a pleasant distraction something sharp made those she murmured yeah i said collecting the hairs hold up your ax she did i touched the hairs to the edge of the blade they curled away from it as they touched it blackening and shriveling and adding the scent of burned hair to the mix wonderful i sighed gard lifted her eyebrows and glanced at me faeries i nodded malks almost certainly malks winterfae i said felines about the size of a bobcat nothing steel cant handle then she said rising briskly yeah i said you could probably handle half a dozen she nodded once brandished the ax and turned to continue down the tunnel which is why they tend to run in packs of twenty i added a couple of steps later gard stopped and gave me a glare thats called sharing information i said i gestured at the wall these are territorial markings for the local pack malks are stronger than natural animals quick almost invisible when they want to be and their claws are sharper and harder than surgical steel i once saw a malk shred an aluminum baseball bat to slivers and if that wasnt enough theyre sentient smarter than some people i know ods bodkin gard swore quietly can you handle them they dont like fire i said but in an enclosed space like this i dont like it much either gard nodded once can we treat with them she asked buy passage theyll keep their word like any fae i said if you can get them to give it in the first place but think of how cats enjoy hunting even when they arent hungry think about how they toy with their prey sometimes then distill that joyful little killer instinct out of every cat in chicago and pour it all into one malk theyre to cats what hannibal lecter is to people negotiation isnt an option then i shook my head i dont think we have anything to offer them that theyll want more than our screams and meat no gard nodded frowning best if they never notice us at all then nice thought i said but these things have a cats senses i could probably hide us from their sight or hearing but not both and they could still smell us gard frowned she reached into her coat pocket and drew out a slim box of aged pale ivory she opened it and began gingerly sorting through a number of small ivory squares scrabble tiles i asked i dont want to play with malks theyre really bad about using plurals and proper names theyre runes gard said quietly she found the one she was after took a steadying breath and then removed a single square from the ivory box with the same cautious reverence id seen soldiers use with military explosives she closed the box and put it back in her pocket holding the single ivory chit carefully in front of her on her palm i was familiar with norse runes the rune on the ivory square in her hand was totally unknown to me um whats that i asked a rune of routine she said quietly you said you were skilled with illusion magic if you can make us look like them even for a few moments it should allow us to pass through them unnoticed as if we were a normal part of their day technically i had told gard i was familiar with illusion magic not skilled truth be told it was probably my weakest skill set nobodys good at everything right im good with the kaboom magic my actual use of illusion hadnt passed much beyond the crafts equivalent of painting a few portraits of fruit bowls but id just have to hope that what gard didnt know wouldnt get us both killed elizabeth didnt have much time and i didnt have many options besides what did we have to lose if the bid to sneak by failed we could always fall back on negotiating or slugging it out mouse gave me a sober look groovy i said lets do it a good illusion is all about imagination you create a picture in your mind imagining every detail imagining so hard that the image in your head becomes nearly tangible almost real you have to be able to see it hear it touch it taste it smell it to engage all your senses in its theoretical reality if you can do that if you can really believe in your fake version of reality then you can pour energy into it and create it in the minds and senses of everyone looking at it for the record its also how all the best liars do businessby making their imagined version of things so coherent that they almost believe it themselves im not a terribly good liar but i knew the basics of how to make an illusion work and i had two secret weapons the first was the tuft of hair from an actual malk which i could use to aid in the accuracy of my illusion the second was a buddy of mine a big grey tomcat named mister who deigned to share his apartment with mouse and me mister didnt come with me on cases being above such trivial matters but he found me pleasant company when i was at home and not moving around too much except when he didnt in which case he went rambling i closed my eyes once id drawn my chalk circle gripped the malk hair in my hand and started my image on a model of mister id seen malks a couple of times and most of them bore the same kinds of battle scars mister proudly wore they didnt look exactly like cats though their heads were shaped differently and their fur was rougher stiffer the paws had one too many digits on them too and were wider than a catsbut the motion as they moved was precisely the same noctus ex illuminus i murmured once the image was firmly fixed in my thoughts that of three ugly lean battlemarked malks walking through on their own calm business i sent out the energy that would power the glamour and broke the circle with a slow careful motion is it working gard asked quietly yeah i said focused on the illusion my eyes still closed i fumbled about until i found mouses broad back then rested one hand on his fur stop distracting me walk very well she drew in a short breath said something and then there was a snapping sound and a flash of light the rune is active she said she put her hand on my shoulder the malks werent using any light sources and if a group of apparent malks tried to walk through with one it would kind of spoil the effect we were trying to achieve so wed have to make the walk in the dark we have perhaps five minutes i grunted touched my dog and we all started walking trusting mouse to guide our steps even though it was dark i didnt dare open my eyes any distraction from the image in my head would cause it to disintegrate like toilet paper in a hurricane so i walked concentrating and hoped like hell it worked i couldnt spare any braintime for counting but we walked for what felt like half an hour and i was getting set to ask gard if we were through yet when an inhuman voice not a foot from my left ear said in plain english more of these new claws arrive every day we are hungry we should shred the ape and have done i nearly fell on my ass it startled me so much but i held on to the image in my head id heard malks speak before with their odd inflections and unsettling intonations and the sound only reinforced the image in my head a round of both supporting and disparaging comments rose from all around me all in lazy malkinflected english there were more than twenty of them there was a small horde patience said another malk the tone of voice somehow suggested this was a conversation that had repeated itself a million times let the ape think it has cowed us into acting as its door wardens it hunts in the wizards territory the wizard will come to face it the erlking will give us great favor when we bring the wizards head gosh i felt famous im weary of waiting said another malk let us kill the ape and its prey and then hunt the wizard down patience hunters the wizard will come to us the first one said the apes turn will come after we have brought down the wizard there was an unmistakable note of pleasure in its voice and his little dog too mouse made another subvocal rumble in his chest i could just barely feel it in his back he kept walking though and we passed through the stretch of tunnel occupied by the malks it was another endless stretch of minutes and several turns before gard let out her breath between her teeth and said there were more than twenty yeah i kind of noticed that i think we are past them i sighed and released the image id been holding in my head calling forth dim light from my amulet or tried to release the image at any rate i opened my eyes and blinked several times but my head was like one of those tvs at the department store when one image has been burned into it for too long i looked at mouse and gard and had trouble shaking the picture of the savage squashheaded malks id been imagining around them with such intensity do you have another of those rune things i asked her no gard said well have to get creative on the way out i said theres no need to worry about that yet she said and started walking forward again sure there is once we get the girl we have to get back with her christ havent you read any joseph campbell at all she shrugged one shoulder grendelkin are difficult opponents either well die or it will so theres only a fiftyfifty chance that well need to worry about the malks on the way out why waste the effort until we know if it will be necessary call me crazy but i find that if i plan for the big things like how to get back to the surface it makes it a little simpler to manage the little things like how to keep on breathing she held up a hand and said wait i stopped in my tracks listening mouse came to a halt snuffling at the air his ears twitching around like little radar dishes but he gave no sign that hed detected lurking danger were close to its lair she murmured i arched an eyebrow the tunnel looked exactly the same as it had for several moments now how do you know i can feel it she said you can do that she started forward yes its how i knew it was moving in the city to begin with i ground my teeth it might be nice if you considered sharing that kind of information it isnt far she said we might be in time come on i felt my eyebrows go up mouse had us both beat when it came to purely physical sensory input and hed given no indication of a hostile presence ahead my own senses were attuned to all kinds of supernatural energies and id kept them focused ever since wed entered undertown i hadnt sensed any stirring of any kind that would indicate some kind of malevolent presence if knowledge is power then it follows that ignorance is weakness in my line of work ignorance can get you killed gard hadnt said anything about any kind of mystic connection between herself and this beastie but it was the most likely explanation for how she could sense its presence when i couldnt the problem with that was that those kinds of connections generally didnt flow oneway if she could sense the grendelkin odds were the grendelkin could sense her right back whoa wait i said if this thing might know were coming we dont want to go rushing in blind theres no time its almost ready to breed there was a hint of a snarl in her words as the ax came down off her shoulder gard pulled what looked like a road flare out of her duffel bag and tossed the bag aside then she threw back her head and let out a scream of pure unholy defiance the sound was so loud so raw so primal it hardly seemed human it wasnt a word but that didnt stop her howl from eloquently declaring gards rage her utter contempt for danger for lifeand for death that battle cry scared the living snot out of me and it wasnt even aimed in my direction gard struck the flare to life with a flick of a wrist and shot me a glance over her shoulder eerie green light played up over her face casting bizarre shadows and her icy eyes were very wide and whiterimmed above a smile stretched so tightly that the blood had drained from her lips her voice quavered disconcertingly enough talk holy schwarzenegger gard had lost it this wasnt the reaction of the cool reasoning professional id seen working for marcone id never actually seen anyone go truly oldschool berserkergang but that scream it was like hearing an echo rolling down through the centuries from an ancient world a more savage world now lost to the mists of time and suddenly i had no trouble at all believing her age she charged forward whipping her ax lightly around with her right hand holding the blazing star of the flare in her left gard let out another banshee shriek as she went a wordless cry of challenge to the grendelkin that declared her intent as clearly as any horde of phonemes i am coming to kill you and ahead of us in the tunnels something much much bigger than gard answered her a deepchested basso bellow that shook the walls of the tunnel in answer bring it on my knees turned shaky hell even mouse stood with his ears pressed against his skull tail held low body set in a slight crouch i doubt i looked any more courageous than he did but i kicked my brain into gear spat out a nervous curse and hurried after her charging in headlong might be a really stupid idea but it would be an even worse idea to stand around doing nothing throwing away the only help i was likely to get besides for better or worse id agreed to work with gard and i wasnt going to let her go in without covering her back so i charged headlong down the tunnel toward the source of the terrifying bellow mouse perhaps wiser than i hesitated a few seconds longer then made up for it on the way down the tunnel until he was running a pace in front of me matching my stride wed gone maybe twenty yards before his breath began to rumble out in a growl of pure hostility and he let out his own roar of challenge hey when in cimmeria do as the cimmerians do i screamed too it got lost in all the echoes bouncing around the tunnels gard running hard ten paces ahead of me burst into a chamber she gathered herself in a sudden leap flipping neatly in the air and plummeted from sight the falling green light of the flare showed me that the tunnel opened into the top of a chamber the size of a small hotel atrium and if mouse hadnt stopped first and leaned back against me i might have slid over the edge before i could stop as it was i got a really good look at a drop of at least thirty feet to a wet stone floor gard landed on her feet turned the momentum into a forward roll and a shaggy blur the size of an industrial freezer whipped past her slamming into the wall with a coughing roar and a shudder of impact the blond woman bounced up kicked off a stone wall flipped over again and came down on her feet ax held high shed discarded the flare leaving it in the center of the floor and i got my first good look at the place and at the things in it first of all the chamber cavern whatever it was was huge thirty feet from ceiling to floor at least thirty feet wide and it stretched out into the darkness beyond the sharp light cast by the flare most of it was natural stone some of the surfaces showed signs of being crudely cut with handwielded tools a ledge about two feet wide ran along the edge of the chamber in a cshape up near the top id nearly tumbled off the ledge into the cavern there were stairs cut into the wall below meif you could call the twelveinch projections crudely hacked out of the stone every couple of feet a stairway my glance swept over the cavern below a huge pile of newspapers old blankets bloodstained clothes and unidentifiable bits of fabric must have served as a nest or bed for the creature it was three feet high in the middle and a good ten or twelve feet across a mound of bones nearby was very nearly as large the old ivory gleamed in the eerie light of the flare cleared entirely of meat though the mound was infested with rats and vermin all tiny moving forms and glittering red eyes a huge stone had been placed in the center of the floor a metal beer keg sat on top of it between the tieddown spreadeagled legs of a rather attractive and very naked young woman shed been tied down with rough ropes directly over a thick layer of old bloodstains congealed into an almostrubbery coating on the rock her eyes were wide her face flushed with tears and she was screaming gard whipped her ax through a series of scything arcs in front of her driving them at the big furry blur i had no idea how she was covering the ground fast enough to keep up with the thing they were both moving at kung fu theater speed one of gards swipes must have tagged it because there was a sudden bellow of rage and it bounded into the shadows outside the light of the flare she let out a howl of frustration the head of her ax was smeared with black fluid and as it ran across the steel flickers of silver fire appeared in the shape of more strange runes wizard she bellowed give me light i was already on it holding my amulet high and behind my head ramming more will through the device the dim wizard light flared into incandescence throwing strong light at least a hundred feet down the long galleryand drawing a shriek of pain and surprise from the grendelkin i saw it for maybe two seconds while it crouched with one arm thrown up to shield its eyes the grendelkin was flabby over a quarter ton of muscle and the nails on its fingers and toes were black long and dangerouslooking it was big nine or ten feet and covered in hair it wasnt fur like a bear or a dog but hair human hair with pale skin easily seen beneath so that the impression it gave was one of an exceptionally hirsute man rather than that of a beast and the beast was definitely male terrifyingly soid seen smaller fire extinguishers and from the looks of things gard and i must have interrupted him in the middle of foreplay no wonder he was pissed gard saw the grendelkin and charged forward i saw my chance to pitch in i lifted my staff and pointed it at the creature gathered another surge of will and snarled fuego my staff was an important tool allowing me to focus and direct energy much more precisely and with more concentration than i could manage without it it didnt work as well as my more specialized blasting rod for directing fire but for this purpose it would do just fine a column of golden flame as wide as a whiskey barrel leapt across the cavern to the grendelkin smashing into his head and upper body it was too dispersed to kill the grendelkin outright but hopefully it would blind and distract the beast enough to let gard get in the killing blow the grendelkin lowered his arm and i saw a quick flash of yellow eyes a hideous face and a mouthful of fangs those teeth spread into a smile and i realized i might as well have hit him with the stream of water from a garden hose for all the effect the fire had on him he moved an abrupt whipping of his massive shoulders and flung a stone at me take it from me the grendelkins talents were wasted on the abductrapedevour industry he should have been playing professional ball by the time i realized the rock was on the way it had already hit me there was a popping sound from my left shoulder and a wave of agony something flung me to the ground driving the breath out of my lungs my amulet fell from my suddenly unresponsive fingers and the brilliant light died at once dammit i had assumed big and hostile meant dumb and the grendelkin wasnt the beast had deliberately waited for gard to charge forward out of the light of the dropped flare before he threw wizard gard bellowed i couldnt see anything the brief moment of brilliant illumination had blinded my eyes to the dimmer light of the flare and gard couldnt be in much better shape i got to my feet trying not to scream at the pain in my shoulder and staggered back to look down at the room the grendelkin bellowed again and gard screamedthis time in pain there was the sound of a heavy blow and gard her hands empty flew across the circle of green flarelight a dim shadow she struck the wall beneath me with an ugly heavy sound it was all happening so fast hells bells but i was playing out of my league here i turned to mouse and snarled an instruction my dog stared at me for a second ears flattened to his skull and didnt move go i screamed at him go go go mouse spun and shot off back down the way wed come gard groaned on the floor beneath me stirring weakly at the edge of the dim circle of light cast by the flare i couldnt tell how badly she was hurtbut i knew that if i didnt move before the grendelkin finished her she wasnt going to get any better i could hear elizabeth sobbing in despair get up harry i growled at myself get a move on i could barely move my left arm so i gripped my staff in my right and began negotiating the precarious stone stairway a voice laughed out in the darkness it was a deep voice masculine mellow and smooth when it spoke it did so with precise cultured pronunciation geat bitch the grendelkin murmured thats the most fun ive had in a century surt but i wish there were a few more choosers running about the world youre a dying breed i could barely see the damned stairs in the flares light my foot slipped and i nearly fell whos the seidrmadr the grendelkin asked gesundheit i said the beast appeared at the far side of the circle of light and i stopped in my tracks the grendelkins yellow eyes gleamed with malice and hunger he flexed his clawtipped hands very slowly baring his teeth in another smile my mouth felt utterly dry and my legs were shaking id seen him move if he rushed me things could get ugly strike that when he rushed me things were going to get ugly is that a fire extinguisher in your pocket i asked studying the grendelkin intently or are you just happy to see me the grendelkins smile spread wider most definitely the latter im going to have two mouths to feed shortly what did she promise you to fool you into coming with her you got it backward i permitted her to tag along with me i said the grendelkin let out a low lazily wicked laugh it was eerie as hell hearing such a refined voice come from a package like that do you think youre a threat to me little man you think im not idly the grendelkin dragged the clawed fingers of one hand around on the stone floor beside him little sparks jumped up here and there ive been countering seid since before i left the old world without that youre nothing more than a monkey with a stick he paused and added a rather weak and clumsy monkey at that big guy like you shouldnt have any trouble with little old me then i said his eyes were strange id never seen any quite like that his face though pretty ugly was similar to others id seen i guess you have some history with miss gard there family feuds are always the worst the grendelkin said have to take your word for it i said just like im going to have to take these women id rather do it peaceably than the hard way your call walk away big guy well both be happier the grendelkin looked at me and then threw his head back in a rich deeply amused laugh its not enough that i already have a broodmare and a wounded little wildcat to play with i also have a clown its practically a festival and with that the grendelkin rushed me a crushing fist the size of a volleyball flicked at my face i was fast enough barely to slip the blow i flung myself to the cavern floor gasping as the shock of landing reached my shoulder that sledgehammer of flesh and bone slammed into the wall with a brittle crunching sound chips of flying stone stung my cheek it scared the crap out of me which was just as well terror makes a great fuel for some kinds of magic and the getthehellawayfromme blast of raw force i unleashed on the grendelkin would have flung a parked car to the other side of the street and into the building beyond the grendelkin hadnt been kidding about knowing countermagic though all that naked force hit him and just sort of slid off him like water pouring around a stone it only drove him back about two stepswhich was room enough to let me drop to one knee and swing my staff again it wasnt a bonecrushing blow powered as it was by only one hand and from a fairly unbalanced position but i got him in the fire extinguisher the grendelkin let out a howl about two octaves higher than his original bellows had been and i scooted around him running for the altar stone where elizabeth braddock lay helplessaway from gard i wanted the grendelkin to focus all his attention on me he did behind you elizabeth screamed her eyes wide with terror i whirled and a sweep of the grendelkins arm ripped the staff out of my hand something like a steel vise clamped around my neck and my feet came up off the ground the grendelkin lifted my face to his level his breath smelled of blood and rotten meat his eyes were bright with their fury i kicked at him but he held me out of reach of anything vital and my kicks plunked uselessly into his belly and ribs i was going to make it quick for you he snarled for amusing me but im going to start with your arms if i didnt have him right where i wanted him id have been less than sanguine about my chances of survival id accomplished that much at least he had his back to the tunnel rip them off one at a time little seidrmadr he paused which when viewed from a literary perspective has a certain amount of irony he showed me more teeth ill let you watch me eat your hands let you see what i do to these bitches before im done with you boy was he going to get it one of his hands grabbed my left arm and the pain of my dislocated shoulder made my world go white i fought through the agony ripped elizabeth braddocks pointyhandled hairbrush from my dusters pocket and drove it like an ice pick into the grendelkins forearm he roared and flung me into the nearest wall which hurt lots i fell to the stone floor of the cavern in a heap after that my vision shrank to a tunnel and began to darken this was just as wellfewer distractions that way now all i had to do was time it right a sound groaned down from the tunnel entrance above an odd ululating murmur echoed into unintelligibility the furious grendelkin ripped the brush out of his arm and flung it awaybut when he heard the sound he turned his ugly kisser back toward the source i focused harder on the spell i had coming than upon anything id ever done i had no circle to help me lots of distractions and absolutely no room to screw it up the strange sound resolved itself into a yowling chorus like half a hundred band saws on helium and mouse burst out of the tunnel with a living thunderstorm of malks in hot pursuit my dog flung himself into the empty air and malks bounded after him determined not to let him escape mouse fell thirty feet onto the huge pile of nesting material landing with a yelp the malks spilled after him yowling in fury dozens and dozens of malevolent eyes glittering in the light of the flare some jumped some flowed seamlessly down the rough stairs and others bounded forward sank their claws into the stone of the far wall and slid down it like a fireman down a pole i unleashed the spell useless vermin bellowed the grendelkin his voice still pitched higher than before he pointed at me a batteredlooking man in a long leather coat and roared kill the wizard or ill eat every last one of you the malks now driven as much by fear as anger immediately swarmed all over me i gave them a pretty good time of it but there were probably better than three dozen of them and the leather coat couldnt cover everything claws and fangs flashed blood spattered the malks went insane with bloodlust i screamed swinging wildly with both hands killing a malk here or there but unable to protect myself from all those claws and teeth the grendelkin turned toward the helpless elizabeth it was a real bitch trying to undo the grendelkins knotted ropes while still holding the illusion in place in my mind beneath the glamour that made him look like me he fought furiously clawing and swinging at the malks attacking him it didnt help that elizabeth was screaming again thanks to the illusion of the grendelkin i was holding over myself but hey no plan is perfect mouse i cried a malk flew over my head screaming and splattered against a wall my dog bounded up just as i got the girl loose i shoved her at him and said get her out of here run go go go elizabeth didnt know what the hell was going on but she understood that last part well enough she fled back toward the crude staircase mouse ran beside her and when a malk flung itself at elizabeths naked back my dog intercepted the little monster in the air catching it as neatly as a frisbee at the park mouse snarled and shook his jaws once the malks neck broke with an audible snap my dog dropped it and fled on i grabbed my staff and ran to gard the malks hadnt noticed her yet they were still busy mobbing the grendelkin crap my concentration had wavered it looked like itself again as did i i whirled and focused my will upon the giant pile of cleanpicked bones i extended my staff and snarled counterspell this forzare hundreds of pounds of sharp white bone flung themselves at the grendelkin and the malks alike i threw the bones hard harder than the grendelkin had thrown his rock and the bone shards ripped into them like the blast of an enormous shotgun without waiting to see the results i snatched up the stillburning flare and flung it into the pile of nesting fabric bloody clothes and old newspapers the whole mound flared instantly into angry light and smothering smoke get up i screamed at gard one side of her face was bruised and swollen and she had a visibly broken arm one of the bones in her forearm protruding from the skin with my help she staggered up dazed and choking on the smoke which also blotted out the light i got her onto the stairs and even in our battered state we set some kind of speed record going up them the deafening chorus of bellowing grendelkin and howling malks faded a little as the smoke started choking them too air was moving in the tunnel as the fire drew on it just as it might a chimney i lit up my amulet again to show us the way out wait gard gasped fifty feet up the tunnel wait she fumbled at her jacket pocket where she kept the little ivory box but she couldnt reach it with her sound arm i dug it out for her triangle three lines over it she said leaning against a wall for support get it out i poked through the little ivory scrabble tiles until i found one that matched her description this one i demanded careful she growled its a sunder rune she grabbed it from me took a couple of steps back toward the grendelkins cavern murmured under her breath and snapped the little tile there was a flicker of deep red light and the tunnel itself quivered and groaned run we did behind us the tunnel collapsed in on itself with a roar sealing the malks and the grendelkin away beneath us trapping them in the smothering smoke we both stopped for a moment after that as dust billowed up the tunnel and the sound of furious supernatural beings cut off as if someone had flipped a switch the silence was deafening we both stood there panting and wounded gard sank to the floor to rest you were right i said i guess we didnt need to worry about the malks on the way out gard gave me a weary smile that was my favorite ax go back for it i suggested ill wait for you here she snorted mouse came shambling up out of the tunnel above us elizabeth braddock clung to his collar and looked acutely embarrassed about her lack of clothing whwhat she whispered what happened here i ddont understand its all right mrs braddock i said youre safe were going to take you back to your husband she closed her eyes shuddered and started to cry she sank down to put her arms around mouses furry ruff and buried her face in his fur she was shivering with the cold i shucked out of my coat and draped it around her gard eyed her then her own broken arm and let out a sigh i need a drink i spat some grit out of my mouth ditto come on i offered her a hand up she took it several hours and doctors later gard and i wound up back at the pub where the beer festival was winding to a conclusion we sat at a table with mac the braddocks had stammered a gratuitous number of thanks and rushed off together macs keg had a blue ribbon taped to it hed drawn all of us a mug night of the living brews i said i had painkillers for my shoulder but i was waiting until i was home and in bed to take one as a result i ached pretty much everywhere more like night of the living bruise mac rose drained his mug and held it up in a salute to gard and me thanks no problem i said gard smiled slightly and bowed her head to him mac departed gard finished her own mug and examined the cast on her arm close one little bit i said can i ask you something she nodded the grendelkin called you a geat i said yes he did im familiar with only one person referred to in that way i said there are a few more around gard said but everyones heard of that one you called the grendelkin a scion of grendel i said am i to take it that youre a scion of the geat gard smiled slightly my family and the grendelkins have a long history he called you a chooser i said she shrugged again and kept her enigmatic smile gard isnt your real name i said is it of course not she replied i sipped some more of macs awardwinning dark youre a valkyrie a real one her expression was unreadable i thought valkyries mostly did pickups and deliveries i said choosing the best warriors from among the slain taking them off to valhalla oh and serving drinks there odins virgin daughters pouring mead for the warriors partying until ragnarok gard threw back her head and laughed virgin daughters she rose shaking her head and glanced at her broken arm again then she leaned down and kissed me on the mouth her lips were a sweet hungry little fire of sensation and i felt the kiss all the way to my toessome places more than others ahem she drew away slowly her pale blue eyes shining then she winked at me and said dont believe everything you read dresden she turned to go then paused to glance over her shoulder though to be honest sometimes he does like us to call him daddy im sigrun i watched sigrun go then i finished the last of the beer mouse rose expectantly his tail wagging and we set off for home day off from blood lite edited by kevin j anderson takes place between small favor and turn coat kevin anderson talked to me at nycc and asked me if id be interested in participating in a new kind of anthology for me anyway in which authors known for their work in supernatural and horror fiction tried their hands at comedy i loved the idea poor dresden i mean i keep putting the weight of the world on the poor guys shouldersand i feel really bad about it no really im serious i feel awful honestly okay well less awful and more gleeful but you get the point its easy to torture harry when there are master vampires and superghouls and ghosts and demons and ogres traipsing all over the scenery but i found myself intrigued with the idea of making him suffer just as much frustration and embarrassment in a situation where his opponents and problems were relatively trivial i dont really know how other people reacted to poor harry struggling to get to enjoy a day off workbut i thought it was pretty darned funny the thief was examining another trapped doorway when i heard somethingthe tromp of approaching feet the holy woman was in the middle of another sermon about attentiveness or was in the middle of another sermon about attentiveness or something but i held up my hand for silence and she obliged i could hear twenty sets of feet maybe more i let out a low growl and reached for my sword company easy my son the holy woman said we dont even know who it is yet the ruined mausoleum was far enough off the beaten path to make it unlikely that anyone had just wandered in on us the holy woman was dreaming if she thought the company might be friendly a moment later they appearedthe local magistrate and two dozen of his thugs always with the corrupt government officials muttered the wizard from behind me i glanced back at him and then looked for the thief the nimble little minx was nowhere to be seen you are trespassing boomed the magistrate he had a big boomy voice leave this place immediately on pain of punishment by the crowns law sir replied the holy woman our mission here is of paramount importance the writ we bear from your own liege requires you to render aid and assistance in this matter but not to violate the graves of my subjects he boomed some more begone before i unleash the nine fires of atarak upon enough talk i growled and threw my heavy dagger at his chest propelled by my massive thews the dagger hit him two inches below his left nipplea perfect heart shot it struck with enough force to hurl him from his feet his men howled with surprised fury i drew the huge sword from my back let out a leonine roar and charged the two dozen thugs enough talk i bellowed and whipped the twentypound greatsword at the nearest target as if it were a wooden yardstick he went down in a heap enough talk i howled and kept swinging i smashed through the next several thugs as if they were made of soft wax off to my left the thief came out of nowhere and neatly sliced the achilles tendons of another thug the holy woman took a ready stance with her quarterstaff and chanted out a prayer to her deities at the top of her lungs the wizard shrieked and a fireball whipped over my head exploding twentyone feet in front of me then spread out in a perfect circle like the shock wave of a nuke burning and roasting thugs as it went and stopping a bare twelve inches shy of my nose oh come on i said it doesnt work like that what demanded the wizard it doesnt work like that i insisted even if you call up fire with magic its still fire it acts like fire it expands in a sphere and under a ceiling that means it goes rushing much farther down hallways and tunnels it doesnt just go twenty feet and then stop fireballs used to work like that the wizard sighed but do you know what a chore it is to calculate exactly how far those things will spread i mean it slows everything down its simple math i said and its way better than the fire just spreading twenty feet regardless of whats around it what do fireballs carry tape measures or something billy the werewolf sighed and put down his character sheet and his dice harry he protested gently repeat after me its only a game i folded my arms and frowned at him across his dining room table it was littered with snacks empty cans of pop pieces of paper and tiny model monsters and adventurers including a massively thewed barbarian model for my character georgia billys willowy brunette wife sat at the table with us as did the redheaded bombshell andi while lanky kirby lurked behind several folding screens covered with fantasy art at the head of the table im just saying i said theres no reason the magic cant be portrayed at least a little more accurately is there again with this discussion andi sighed i mean i know hes the actual wizard and all but christ kirby nodded glumly its like taking a physicist to a star trek movie harry georgia said firmly youre doing it again oh no im not i protested all im saying is that georgia arched an eyebrow and gave me a steady look down her aquiline nose you know the law dresden he who kills the cheer springs for beer chanted the rest of the table oh bite me i muttered at them but a grin was diluting my scowl as i dug out my wallet and tossed a twenty on the table okay kirby said roll your fireball damage will billy slung out a double handful of square dice and said hah onepointtwo over median suck on that henchmen theyre all dead kirby confirmed we might as well break there until next week crap i said i barely got to hit anybody i only got to hit one andi said georgia shook her head i didnt even get to finish casting my spell oh yes billy gloated seven modules of identifying magic items and repairing things the stupid barbarian broke but ive finally come into my own was it like that for you harry let you know when i come into my own i said rising but my hopes are high why this very morrow i harry dresden have a day off the devil you say billy exclaimed grinning at me as the group began cleaning up from the evenings gaming session i shrugged into my black leather duster no apprentice no work no errands for the council no warden stuff no trips out of town for paranet business my very own free time georgia gave me a wide smile tell me you arent going to spend it puttering around that musty hole in the ground you call a lab um i said look andi said hes blushing i am not blushing i said i swept up the empty bottles and pizza boxes and headed into billy and georgias little kitchen to dump them into the trash georgia followed me in reaching around me to send several pieces of paper into the trash too hot date with stacy she asked her voice pitched to keep the conversation private i think if i ever called her stacy anastasia might beat the snot out of me for being too lazy to speak her entire name i replied you seem a little tense about it i shrugged a shoulder this is going to be the first time we spend a whole day together without something trying to rip us to pieces along the way i i want it to go right you know i pushed my fingers back through my hair i mean both of us could use a day off sure sure georgia said watching me with calm knowing eyes do you think its going to go anywhere with her i shrugged dont know she and i have very different ideas about well about basically everything except what to do with things that go around hurting people the tall willowy georgia glanced back toward the dining room where her short heavily muscled husband was putting away models opposites attract theres a song about it and everything one thing at a time i said neither one of us is trying to inspire the poets for the ages we like each other we make each other laugh god thats nice these days i sighed and glanced up at georgia a little sheepishly i just want to show her a nice time tomorrow georgia had a gentle smile on her narrow intelligent face i think thats a very healthy attitude i was just getting into my car a battered old volkswagen bug ive dubbed the blue beetle when andi came hurrying over to me thered been a dozen alphas when id first met them college kids who had banded together and learned just enough magic to turn themselves into wolves theyd spent their time as werewolves protecting and defending the town which needed all the help it could get the conclusion of their college educations had seen most of them move on in life but andi was one of the few who had stuck around most of the alphas adopted clothing that was easily discardedthe better to swiftly change into a large wolf without getting tangled up in jeans and underwear on this particular summer evening andi was wearing a flirty little purple sundress and nothing else between her hair her build and her long strong legs andis picture belonged on the nose of a world war ii bomber and her hurried pace was intriguingly kinetic she noticed me noticing and gave me a wicked little smile and an extra jiggle the last few steps she was the sort to appreciate being appreciated harry she said i know you hate to mix business with pleasure but theres something i was hoping to talk to you about tomorrow sorry sweetheart i said in my best bogey dialect not tomorrow day off important things to do i know andi said but i was hoping if it waited until after the arcanos game it can wait until after my dday off i said firmly andi almost flinched at the tone and nodded okay i felt myself arch an eyebrow i hadnt put that much harsh into itand andi wasnt exactly the sort to be fazed by verbal salvos regardless of their nature or volume socially speaking the woman was armored like a battleship okay i replied ill call kirby approached her as i got into the car put an arm around her from behind and tugged her backside against his front side leaning down to sniff at her hair she closed her eyes and pressed herself into him yeah i let myself feel a little smug as i pulled out of the lot and drove home that one had just been a matter of time despite everything georgia had said i totally called it i pulled into the gravel parking lot beside the boardinghouse where i live and knew right away i had a problem perhaps it was my keenly developed intuition honed by years of investigative work as the infamous harry dresden chicagos only professional wizard shamus of the supernatural gumshoe of the ghostly wise guy of the weird warning me with preternatural awareness of the shadow of death passing nearby or maybe it was the giant black van painted with flaming skulls goats head pentacles and inverted crosses that was parked in front of my apartment doorsixsixsix of one half a dozen of another the vans doors opened as i pulled in and people in black spilled out with neither the precision of a professional team of hitters nor the calm swagger of competent thugs they looked like id caught them in the middle of eating sack lunches one of them had what looked like taco sauce spilled down the front of his frothy white lace shirt the other four well they looked like something they were all wearing mostly black and mostly gothware which meant a lot of velvet with a little leather rubber and pvc to spice things up three women two men all of them fairly young all of them carried wands and staves and crystals dangling from chains and all of them had deadly serious expressions on their faces i parked the car never looking directly at them and then got out of it stuck my hands in my duster pockets and stood there waiting youre harry dresden said the tallest one there a young man with long black hair and a matching goatee i squinted at nothing like clint eastwood would do and said nothing like chow yunfat would do youre the one who came to new orleans last week he said it nawlins even though the rest of his accent was midwest standard youre the one who desecrated my works i blinked at him whoa wait a minute there actually was a curse on that nice lady he sneered at me she had earned my wrath how about that i said i figured it for some random bad feng shui his sneer vanished what to tell you the truth it was so minor that i only did the ritual cleansing to make her feel better and show the paranetters how to do it for themselves in the future i shrugged sorry about your wrath there darth wannabe he recovered his composure in seconds apologies will do you no good wizard now he and his posse all raised their various accoutrements sneering malevolently defend yourself okay i said and pulled my out of my pocket darth wannabe and his posse lost their sneers whwhat said one of the girls who had a nose ring that i was pretty sure was a clipon what are you doing im afixin to defend myself i drawled texasstyle i held the gun negligently pointing down and to one side and not right at them i didnt want to hurt anybody look kids you really need to work on your image darth opened his mouth it just hung that way for a minute i mean the vans a bit overdone but hell i cant throw stones my vw bug has a big inside a circle spraypainted on the hood youre sort of slipping elsewhere though i nodded at one of the girls a brunette holding a wand with a crystal on the tip honey i liked the harry potter movies too but that doesnt mean i ran out and got a dark mark tattooed onto my left forearm like you did i eyed the other male and youre wearing a freakin slytherin scarf i mean christ hows anyone supposed to take that seriously you would dare darth wannabe began obviously outraged one more tip kids if you had any real talent the air would practically have been on fire when you got ready to throw down but you losers dont have enough magic between you to turn cereal into breakfast you would dare i can tell because i actually am a wizard i went to school for this stuff you would i mean i know you guys have probably thrown your talents at other people in your weight class had your little duels and maybe someone got a nosebleed and someone went home with a migraine and it gave your inner megalomaniac a boner but this is different i nodded at one of the other girls who had shaved her head clean excuse me miss what time is it she blinked at me um its after one thanks the dim lord tried for his dramatic dialogue again you would dare threaten us with mortal weapons its after midnight i told the idiot im off the clock that killed his momentum again what its my day off and ive got plans so lets just skip ahead darth floundered wordlessly he was really out of his elementand he wasnt giving me anything to work with at all if i waited around for him this was going to take all night all right kid you want some magic i pointed my gun at the van howsabout i make your windows disappear darth swallowed then he lowered his staff a cheaply carved thing you could pick up at tourist traps in acapulco and said this is not over we are your doom dresden as long as you dont drag it out too much good night children darth sneered at me again pulled the shreds of his dignity about him and strode to the van the rest of them followed him like good little darthlings the van started up and tore away throwing gravel spitefully into the blue beetle could it sneer at them the beetle would have done so its dents had dents worse than what that van inflicted i spun the once around my finger and put it back into my pocket clint yunfat as if i didnt have enough to do without worrying about darth wannabe and his groupies i went inside greeted my pets in order of senioritymister my oversized cat first then mouse my undersized ankylosauruswashed up and went to bed the mickey mouse alarm clock told me it was five in the morning when my apartments front door opened the door gets stuck because a hamhanded amateur installed it and it makes a racket when its finally forced open i came out of the bedroom in my underwear with my blasting rod in one hand and my in the other ready to do battle with whatever had come acalling hi boss molly chirped giving my blasting rod and gun a passing glance but ignoring my almostnudity i felt old my apprentice came in and set two starbucks cups down on the coffee table along with a bag that would be full of something expensive that starbucks thought people should eat with coffee molly who was young and tall and blond and built like a brick supermodel offered me one of the cups you want to wake up now or would you rather i kept it warm for you molly i said trying to be polite i cant stand the sight of you go away she held up a hand i know i know captain grumpypants your day off and your big date with luccio yes i said i put as much hostility into it as i could molly had been overexposed to my menace it bounced right off her i just thought it would be a good time for me to work out some of the kinks on my invisibility potion youve said im ready to use the lab alone i said unsupervised that isnt quite the same thing as alone my glower deepened much like having an apprentice puttering around the basement is not quite the same thing as being alone with anastasia youre going horseback riding molly said in a reasonable tone of voice you wont be here and ill be gone by the time you get back and besides i can make sure mouse gets a walk or two while youre gone so you wont have to come rushing back early isnt that thoughtful of me mouses huge grey doggy head came up off the floor and his tail twitched as she said walk he looked at me hopefully oh for crying out i shook my head wearily lock up behind you before you go downstairs she turned back to the front door and started pushing you got it boss i staggered back to my bed to get whatever rest i could before my apprentice died in a fit of sleepdeprivationinduced psychotic mania for the first time ever mickey mouse let me down granted being a wizard means that technology and i dont get along very well things tend to break down a lot faster in the presence of mortal magic than they would otherwisebut thats mostly electronics my windup mickey mouse clock was pure springs and gears and it had given me years and years of loyal service it never went off and when i woke up mickey was cheerfully indicating that i had less than half an hour before anastasia was supposed to arrive i got up and threw myself into the shower bringing my razor with me i was only partway through shaving when the explosion rattled the apartment hard enough to make a film of water droplets leap up off the shower floor i stumbled out wrapped a towel around my waist seized my blasting rodjust in case what was needed was more explosionsand went running into the living room the trapdoor leading down to the lab in my subbasement was open and pink and blue smoke was roiling up out of it in a thick noxious plume hells bells i choked out coughing molly here she called back through her own thick coughing im fine im fine i opened a couple of the sunken windows on opposite sides of the room and the breeze began to thin out the smoke what about my lab i had it contained when it blew she responded more clearly now um just just let me clean up a bit i eyed the trapdoor molly i said warningly dont come down she said her voice near panic ill have it cleaned up in a second okay i thought about storming down there with a good hard lecture about the importance of not busting up your mentors irreplaceable collection of gear but i took a deep breath instead if anything had been destroyed the lecture wouldnt fix it and i had only fifteen minutes to make myself look like a human being and find some way to get rid of the smell of mollys alchemical misadventure so i decided to go finish shaving am i easygoing or what no sooner had i gotten bits of paper stuck to the spots on my face where id been in a hurry than someone began hammering on the front door for crying out loud i muttered its my day off i stomped out to the living room and found the smoke mostly gone if not the smell mouse paced along beside me on the way to the door i unlocked it and wrenched it open careful to open it only an inch or three then peered outside andi and kirby crouched on the other side of my door both of them were dirty haggard and entirely covered with scratches i could tell because both were also entirely naked kirby lowered his arm and stared warily at me then he let out a low growling sound which i realized a second later had been meant to be my name harry you have got to be kidding me i said today harry andi said her eyes brimming please i dont know who else we can turn to dammit i snarled dammit dammit dammit i wrenched the door the rest of the way open and muttered my wards down come in hurry up before someone sees you kirbys nostrils flared as he entered and his face twisted up in revulsion oh andi said as i shut the door that smells terrible tell me about it i said you two look well i would have used different adjectives for kirby than for andi a little thrashed whats up you two get in a fight with a barbed wire golem or something nno andi said nothing like that weve had kirby and i have fleas i blinked kirby nodded somber agreement and growled something unintelligible i checked the fireplace which molly had lit and which was crackling quietly my coffeepot hung on a swinging arm near the fire close enough to stay warm without boiling i went to the pot and checked shed put my cup of expensive starbucks elixir in there to stay warm if id been preparing to murder her that single act of compassion would have been reason enough to spare her life i poured the coffee into the mug molly had left on the mantel and slugged some of it back okay okay i said start from the top fleas i dont know what else to call them andi said when we shift theyre there in our fur biting and itching it was just annoying at first but now its just awful she shuddered and began running her fingertips over her shoulders and ribs i can feel them right now chewing at me biting and digging into me she shook her head and with an almost visible effort forced her hands to be still its getting hard to ththink straight to talk every time we chchange it gets worse i gulped down a bit of coffee frowning that did sound serious i glanced down at the towel around my waist and noted idly that i was the most heavily clothed person in the room all right let me get dressed i said i guess at least one of us should have clothes on andi looked at me blankly what clothes youre naked andi she looked down at herself and then back up at me oh a smile spread over her lips and the angle of her hips shifted slightly and very noticeably maybe you should do something about that kirby looked up from where hed settled down by the fireplace pure murder in his eyes uh i said looking back and forth between them no question about itthe kids were definitely operating under the influence of something ill be right back i threw on some clothes including my shield bracelet in case the murderous look on kirbys face got upgraded to a murderous lunge and went back out into the living room kirby and andi were both in front of the fireplace they were well nuzzling is both polite and generally accurate even if it doesnt quite convey the blush factor the two were inspiring i mean theyd have been asked to leave any halfway reputable club for that kind of thing i lifted my hand to my eyes for a moment concentrated and opened up my third eye my wizards sight that was always a dicey move the sight showed you what truly was all the patterns of magic and life that existed in the universe as they truly werebut you got them in permanent ink you didnt ever get to forget what you saw no matter how bad it was still if something was chewing up my friends i needed to know about it they were worth the risk i opened my eyes and immediately saw the thick bands of power that id laid into the very walls of my apartment when id built up its magical defenses further layers of power surrounded my lab in a second shell of insulating magic beneath my feet from his perch atop one of my bookshelves mister the cat appeared exactly as he always did evidently beyond the reach of such petty concerns as the mere forces that created the universe though my dog mouse was surrounded by a calm steady aurora of silver and blue light more to the point kirby and andi were both engulfed in a number of different shimmering energiesthe flamecolored tinges of lust and passion foremost among them for obvious reason but those werent the only energies at play greenish energy that struck me as something primal and wild that essence of the instinct of the wolf theyd been taught by the genuine article maybe remained strong all around them as did an undercurrent of pinkpurple fear whatever was happening to them it was scaring the hell out of both of them even if they werent able to do anything about it at the moment the golden lightning of a practitioner at work also flickered through their auraswhich shouldnt have been happening oh the alphas all had a lot more talent than darth wannabe and his playmates that went without saying but they had become extremely focused upon a single use of their magicshapeshifting into a wolf which is a lot more complicated and difficult and useful than it looks or sounds but that kind of activity should only have been working if they were actually in the process of changing shapeand they werent i stepped closer peering intently and saw something i rather wouldnt have creatures clung to both of themtiny tiny things dozens of them to my sight they looked something like tiny crabs hardshelled little things with oversized pincers that ripped and tore into their spiritual fleshtearing out tiny pieces that each contained a single glowing mote of both green and gold energy ah i said aha youve got psychophagic mites andi and kirby both jumped in shock i guess they hadnt noticed me coming closer being fully occupied with oh wow theyd sort of segued into nc activities whwhat andi managed to say psychophagic i shook my head dismissing my sight with an effort of will psychic parasites theyve latched onto you from the nevernever theyre exerting an influence on you both pushing you to indulge your um more basic and primitive behavior patterns and feeding on the energy of them andi dragged lustglazed eyes from kirby to me primitive yeah i said i nodded to them hence the two of you um and i imagine they make you want to change form andis eyelids fluttered yes yes that sounds lovely she shook her head slightly and came to her feet her eyes suddenly glimmering with tears is it can you make them go away i put a reassuring hand on her shoulder i cant figure out how they would have gotten there in the first place i mean these things are only attracted to very specific kinds of energy and youd only be vulnerable to them when you were actually drawing upon the matter of the neverneverwhen you were shifted andi blinked and then rubbed at my foreheadandi please dont tell me that you and kirby have been getting down while you were fuzzy the bombshell blushed from the roots of her hair to the tips of her toes god thats just so wrong i shook my head but to answer your question yes i think that harry molly called from the lab um do you have a fire extinguisher what i mean if i needed one she amended her voice quavering hypothetically speaking hypothetically speaking i half shouted molly did you set my lab on fire andi a distracted expression on her face idly lifted my hand from her shoulder and slid my index finger between her lips suckling gently a pleasant flicker of lightning shot up my arm and i felt it all the way to the bottoms of my feet oh hey hohoho hold on there i said pulling my finger away it came out of her mouth with another intriguing sensation and a soft popping sound andi ahem we really need to focus here kirby let out a raw snarl and hit me with a right cross that sent me tumbling back across the room and into one of my bookshelves i rebounded off it fell on my ass and sat there stunned for a second as copies of the black company novels fell from the shelf and bounced off my head i looked up to see kirby seize andi by the wrist and jerk her back behind him placing his body between her and me in a gesture of raw possession then he balled up his hands into fists snarled and took a step toward me mouse loomed up beside me then two hundred pounds of shaggy grey muscle he didnt growl at kirby or so much as bare his teeth he did however stand directly in kirbys path and face him without backing down without blinking kirbys body seemed to shimmer and flow and suddenly a black wolf nearly mouses size but leaner and swifter looking crouched across the apartment white teeth bared amber eyes glowing with rage holy crap kirby was about half a second from losing it and he had the skill and experience to cause some real mayhem i mean taking on an animal is one thing taking on an animal directed by a human intelligence with years of experience in battling the supernatural is a challenge at least an order of magnitude greater if it came down to a fight a real fight between me and kirby i was sure i could beat him but to do it id have to hit him fast and hard without pulling any punches i was not at all confident that i could beat him without killing him kirby i said trying to keep my voice as low and steady as i could kirby man think about this for a minute its harry listen man this is harry and youve just blown your willpower check like completely you need to take a deep breath and get some perspective here youre my friend youre under the influence and im trying to help you harry molly called out her voice higherpitched than ever acid doesnt eat through concrete right i blinked at the trapdoor and screamed in frustration hells bells what are you doing down there kirby took another pace forward wolf eyes bright jaws slavering head held low and ready for a fight behind him andi was watching the whole thing with a wideeyed look that mixed terror lust excitement and rage in equal parts her impressive chest heaving her hands and lower arms had already begun to slowly change sprouting curling russet fur her nails lengthening into dark claws her eyes traveled to me and her mouth dropped open revealing fangs that were already beginning to grow super in a fight against kirby i was worried about him not surviving against kirby and andi in these quarters it would be me who was running against long odds but i try to be an optimist at least things werent going to get any worse above and behind me a window broke a length of lead pipe maybe a foot long capped at both ends with plastic landed on a rug five feet away from me cheap mardi gras style beads were wrapped around it a lit fuse sparked and fizzed at one end of the pipe it was maybe half an inch away from vanishing into the cap but this is my day off i howled i know things looked bad but i honestly think i could have handled it if mister hadnt picked that exact moment to leap down from his perch and go streaking across the room acting upon some feline imperative unknown and unknowable to mere mortals kirby already on the edge of a feral frenzy did what any canine would dohe let out a snarl and gave immediate chase mouse let out a sudden bellow of ragefor crying out loud he hadnt gotten that worked up over me being in dangerand launched himself after kirby andi upon seeing mouse in pursuit of her fellow werewolf shifted entirely to her own wolf shape and flung herself after mouse mister rocketed around my tiny apartment with several hundred pounds of furious canine in pursuit kirby bounded over and around furniture almost as nimbly as mister mouse didnt bother with nimble he simply plowed through whatever was in the way smashing my coffee table and one easy chair knocking over another bookcase and churning the throw rugs on the floor into hummocks of fabric and fiber i leapt for the pipe bomb and picked it up only to have my legs scythed out from beneath me by kirby as he went by mouse accidently slammed a paw bearing his full weight down onto me as he rumbled past in pursuit and got me right where the damn dog always gets a man there was none of that delayedreaction component to the pain either my testicles began reporting the damage instantly loudly and in nauseating intensity i had no time for pain i lunged for the pipe bomb and nearly wet my pants as another explosion shook the flooronly this one was followed an instant later by an absolute flood of bright green smoke that billowed up from the lab i grabbed the pipe bomb and tried to pluck out the fuse but it vanished into the cap and beyond the reach of my fingers in a panic i scrabbled across the floor to the door and ripped it open with terrified strength i hauled back to throw the thing out and there was a sharp burst of sound my hand exploded into pins and needles i fell limply to the floor my head falling in such a way as to bring my gaze over to where my hand had been clutching the pipe bomb a few seconds before and and i was still holding it now unharmed heavy jets of scarlet and purple smoke were billowing wildly from both ends of the pipe scented heavily with a familiar odor smoke bombs the freaking thing had been loaded with something remarkably similar to fourth of july smoke bombs the kind kids play with bemused i tugged one plastic cap off and several little expended canisters fell out along with a note the next time you interfere with me more than smoke will interfere with you more than smoke will interfere with you who talks like that mouse roared snapping my focus back to the here and now as he pounced onto kirbys back smashing the werewolf to the floor by dint of sheer mass mister sensing his opening shot out the front door with a yowl of disapproval and vanished into the outdoors seeking a safer environment like maybe traffic andi leapt onto mouses back fangs ripping but my dog held fast to kirbybuying me a couple of precious seconds i seized a bit of chalk from the basket by the door and choking on smoke ran in a circle around the embattled trio drawing a line of chalk on the concrete floor then i willed the circle closed and the magical construct snapped into existence a silent and invisible field of energy that among other things completely severed the connection between the psychic parasites in the nevernever and the werewolves whaling on my dog the fight stopped abruptly kirby and andi both blinked their eyes several times and hurriedly removed their fangs from mouses hide a few seconds later they shimmered and resumed their human forms dont move i snapped at them infuriated to no end any of you dont break the circle or youll go nuts again sit stay that last was for mouse mostly i couldnt see what molly had done to my lab but the fumes down there were cloying and obviously dangerous i hauled myself over to the trapdoor molly hadnt made it up the folding staircase and just lay sprawled semiconscious against it i had to grab her and haul her up the stairs she was undressed from the waist up i spotted her shirt and bra on the floor near the worktable both of them riddled with acidburned holes i got her laid out on her back elevated her feet on a stray cushion from the smashed easy chair and checked her breathing it didnt take long because she wasnt though she did still have a faint pulse i started rescue breathing for herwhich is a lot more demanding than people think especially when the air is still thick with the smell of god only knows what chemical combinations i finally got her to cough and my racing heartbeat subsided a little as she began breathing again raggedly and opened her eyes i sat up slowly breathing hard and found anastasia luccio standing in the open doorway to my apartment her arms folded over her chest one eyebrow arched anastasia was a pretty girlnot glamorously lovely but believably genuinely pleasant to look at with a fantastic smile and killer dimples she looked like someone in her twenties for reasons too complex to go into right now but she was an older woman a much older woman and there i was apparently sitting up from kissing a topless girl with a naked couple a few feet away and the air thick with a pall of smoke and the smell of noxious fumes for crying out loud my apartment looked like the set of some kind of bizarre porno um i said and swallowed this isnt what it might appear to be anastasia just stared at me i knew it had been a long time since shed opened up to anyone it might not take much to make her close herself off again she shook her head very slowly and the smile lines at the corners of her eyes deepened along with her dimples then she burst out into a hearty belly laugh madre di dio harry i cannot for the life of me imagine what it does appear to be i lifted my eyebrows in surprise you arent upset by the time you get to be my age she replied youve either worked out your insecurities or theyre there to stay besides i simply must know how this happened i shook my head and then smiled at her i my friends needed help she looked back and forth between the alphas and molly and still do she said nodding sharply she came in and as the only one actually wearing shoes began picking up pieces of fallen glass from the broken window literally rolling up her sleeves as she went shall we it took most of the day to get molly to the hospital gather the materials needed to fumigate kirbys and andis auras and actually perform the work to get the job done by the time they left all better and psychophagefree it was after seven so much for our day off i said she turned to consider me would you do it differently if you had it to do again no of course not she shrugged then it was a day well spent there will be others you never can be sure of that though can you her cheeks dimpled again today is not yet over you mourn its death somewhat prematurely i just wanted to show you a nice time for a day not get bogged down in more business anastasia turned to me and put her fingers over my mouth then she replaced her fingers with her lips enough talk she murmured i agreed backup novelette from subterranean press takes place between small favor and turn coat this story was really fun to write id been wanting to show a little more of thomas and his world for several years but it just hadnt ever been a feasible thing for harry to encounter the vampires of the dresden files the white court especially see themselves as a nation of outcasts banded together by similar concerns and dangerous enemies the kind of culture that emerges from that sort of foundation simply doesnt make itself available to outsiders if harry had ever gotten to the inside to see that culture it would have betrayed the usagainstthem integrity of the white court and invalidated the whole setup so when subterranean came to me with a proposal to produce a novelette illustrated by no less than mike mignola i jumped at the chance the challenge here was to present thomas from his own viewpoint one distinct from harrys and even better i wanted to pit brother against brother in such a way that their relationship of trust and mutual regard was maintained but they still got to slug it out with each other i also got to bring some of the other background material of the dresden files story world into play the oblivion war was something i really loved conceptually but like the white court its very nature prevented dresden from getting involved without causing the entire thing to implode this was an ideal place for that piece of universe background and it made me feel all warm and fuzzy to finally get it out where the readers could see it too lets get something clear right up front im not harry dresden harrys a wizard a genuine honesttogoodness wizard hes gandalf on crack and an iv of red bull with a big leather coat and a revolver in his pocket hell spit in the eye of gods and demons alike if he thinks it needs to be done and to hell with the consequencesand yet somehow my little brother manages to remain a decent human being ill be damned if i know how but then ill be damned regardless my name is thomas raith and im a monster the computer in my little office clamored for my attention ive got it set up to play nazi germanys national anthem whenever i receive email from someone in my family not harry my half brother naturally harry and email go together like robert downey jr and sobriety i mean the other side of my family the monsters i finished cleaning off the workstation and checked the clockfive minutes until my next appointment i took a quick look around my boutique smiled at one of my regular customers playfully scolded the young stylist working on her and went back down the hall around the corner down the narrow stairwell and then through ten feet of claustrophobic hallway to get to my office i sat down at the desk and nudged my laptop to life the virus scanner pored over the email before it chimed again a soft sound that a human wouldnt have heard from the end of the hall much less from upstairs and pronounced it safe the email from adminwhitecourtcom was empty but the subject line read re bllvln oh super just what i needed i never really enjoyed hearing from that side of the family even when the subject was something boringlike business pertaining to the war between the vampire courts and the wizards white council for example whenever lara wanted to get in touch with me for any reason it was bad news but when it was about an oblivion matter it was worse i had laras number on the speed dial on my cell phone i gave her a ring brothermine purred my eldest sister her voice pure honey it was the kind of voice that would give men ideasreally bad ideas though theyd never realize that part you hardly ever call me anymore ive hardly ever called you lara period i ignored the lure she was sliding into her voice shed fed very recentlyor was doing so at the moment what do you want you received my email yes theres a project i think youll be interested in why take a look at it she said youll understand the line was supposedly secure but we both knew how much that was worth neither of us would mention any details over the phone and we certainly would not use the word oblivion too many venatori had discovered too late that the enemy had very sharp ears and that they would swiftly carry the war into the homes of those careless enough not to guard their tongues it had been nearly eight years since i had been involved in the oblivion war i suppose i had known i couldnt avoid being drawn back into the fight forever lara the only other venator in the white court was largely occupied with her current responsibilitiesnamely spending her days manipulating our father like a puppet on her psychic strings and ruling the white court from the shadows behind his throne naturally if something came up she would pass it along to me to deal with im busy i told her grooming pets she said trimming their fur checking for fleas priorities brothermine lara is most annoying when she has a point where do you want to meet she laughed a warm little sound tommy tommy im flattered you want to be with me but no ive no time to spend playing games with you ive sent a courier with everything you need and mmmmmm her voice turned into a sensual little purr of pleasure you know the stakes dont ask too many questions brothermine she murmured dont start using that pretty little head for anything taxing go back to your apartment talk to the courier take the job or you and i are going to have a very ahhhhh her breathing sped up a very serious fallingout i could hear other soft sounds in the background and another voice a woman maybe two most of my family isnt what youd call particular when it comes to feeding on mortals id tell you that you were a much nicer person before you got into the powerbehindthethrone game lara i said but you were a bitch then too i hung up on her before she had a chance to reply and went back upstairs thinking it was always good to get as much thinking done as you could before the actual mindboggling crisis came down that way when it got there and you only had half a second to decide what to do before something from beyond the borders of sanity started ripping at your soul you could skip the preliminaries and go straight to the mistake when you deal with someone like my sister you never take anything at face value she was up to something whatever it was it included putting pressure on me to hurry lara wanted me to rush into the situation blindly if that was what she wanted me to do it was probably a good idea not to do it besides i didnt want lara to start getting used to the idea that i would run to do her bidding every time she snapped her fingers more important i didnt want to get into the habit of obeying her it was an important first step toward becoming ensnared by more inflexible means the way she had done to our father anyway i had a business to run and i was hungry michelle marion eldest daughter of the honorable senator marion of the great state of illinois had arrived a minute or two early for her haircut my clients almost always didespecially the young ones michelle was a brunette though you couldnt tell that by looking only her hairdresser knew for sure thomas she exclaimed smiling at me pronouncing it with the latin emphasis what have you done with your hair i had cut it a bit shorter after getting a rather large section of it burned off by a flaming arrow fired by a faerie assassinbut that isnt the sort of thing you share with your customers when youre supposed to be a flaming french master stylist darling i said taking her hands and kissing her on either cheek the hunger inside me stirred as my skin touched hers the demon gleefully danced through her for a heartbeat or two and as it did she shivered her heart rate rose and her pupils dilated the hunger told me what it always did about michelle though she looked sweet gentle and kind her repressed desires far darker would make her easy prey fingers tightening in the back of her hair feeling a mans body press hers against a wallthat was the stuff of her fantasies she would follow me to the hall downstairs without hesitation i could take her there i could fulfill her desires feed the hunger draw away her life and take my fill i could leave my mark ripped into her mind and soul so that forever after she would come to me willingly eagerly yearning to be taken again and again and agai until she died i pushed the hunger back down into the corruption that passes for my soul and i smiled at michelle slipping on the accent as easily as an italian leather glove i grew bored so tediously bored darling i had half decided to shave it all just to shock everyone the girl laughed her cheeks still flushed with excitement in the wake of my demons touch dont you dare have no fear i assured her tucking her arm through mine and walking her to my station the men who prefer such things arent really my type in any case she laughed again and i kept up the inane chatter until i could lean her chair back to the sink and begin washing her hair the hunger lunged forward eager as alwaysand i let it begin to feed upon the girl michelles eyes glazed over slightly as i went through the washvery slowly very thoroughly working a fullscalp massage into the process i felt her mind slip into idle fantasy as the thin warmth of her aura pooled around my fingertips and slid up into me the hunger screamed for me to do more to take more that it wasnt enough but i didnt feeding would have been delicious but it might have hurt her too it might even have killed her so i kept on with the steady gentle circular motions barely tasting of her life force she sighed in bliss as her fantasies dissolved into a gentle euphoria and i shuddered with the need to give in to my hunger and take more some days it was more difficult than others to hold back but its what i do its what i have left michelle left about an hour later hair trimmed color retouched blissfully relaxed flushed happy and humming to herself under her breath i watched her go and my hunger snarled and paced about restlessly in the cage id built for it in my thoughts furious that the prey had escaped for just a second i found myself turning toward her my weight shifting as if to take a step forward to follow her to someplace quiet and i turned away and went back to my station beginning the routine of cleaning not today one day doubtless the hunger would gain the upper hand again and feed and feed until it was the only thing inside and there was nothing left of me but not today i left the store in the good hands of my employees and went out to my car a white hummer huge expensive and ostentatious as hell it was also one of the more robust vehicles a civilian could buy entire sections of houses could fall on it without causing it more than minor inconvenience as could giant demon insects and before you ask i know it from experience just as i know that having a really tough vehicle on hand is not at all a bad move when youve made the kinds of enemies i havewhich is to say all of my own and pretty much all of my little brothers to boot before i got in i checked the engine the undercarriage and the interior for explosives one reason lara might have wanted me to hurry out might have been to make me rush out to the car turn the ignition key and blow tiny pieces of me all over chicago i pulled up a mix list on the trucks mp playercole porter and mozart mostly with a dash of violent femmesand headed back home to my apartment hoping that whatever lara had in mind for me it wouldnt send me running to all corners of the earth again even though our breed of vampire doesnt share the others weaknesses for sunlight and running water and so on the kinds of places oblivion missions had taken me hadnt exactly been tourist attractions i live in a trendy expensive apartment building in chicagos gold coast its not exactly to my taste but its the sort of place where toemoss the french stylist would live one thing you learn young when youre a vampire is how to camouflage yourself and to do that you have to sell every aspect of the disguise its a highsecurity building but laras courier would be waiting for me in my apartment despite that my sister had the resources to get it done before i got out of the truck i reached under the seat and slipped the sheathed kukri knife there into my coat then tucked the barrel of my desert eagle into the waist of my leather pants in back hiding the grip under my coat it had occurred to me ten minutes into michelles appointment that telling me to expect a courier in my apartment would be an excellent way to get me to lower my guard against an assassin who lurked inside waiting for my return i went up to my apartment took the knife in my teeth and drew the gun holding it low the barrel parallel to my leg then i stood as far to the left of the door as i could unlocked it and pushed it open no one opened fire i waited a moment more just being quiet and listening and picked out two thingsthe low throb of an excited heartbeat and the scent of her shampoo her shampoo i came through the door in a rush discarding the weapons and justine met me on the other side she threw her arms around me and i had to fight to remember that if i didnt restrain my strength i might hurt her as i hugged her back she just pressed against me everywhere as if she wanted to just push herself inside me she let out a soft little sob of laughter and pressed her face into my shirt she felt so good soft and warm and alive we just stood there holding each other for a long time my body surged with need and an instant later my hunger howled in frenzied lust justine our doe our bottle of wine ours ours ours so many nights with her screaming under us so many soft sighs so many touchesso much rich warm madnesslaced life rushing into us i ignored the demonbut while blocking it away i moved my hand without really thinking about it and i stroked it over her hair pain pain so unreal so unimaginably intense that i could not adequately describe it surged up my arm as if the softness of those hairs had been the touch of highpower electrical cables i hissed my arm jerking away by pure reflex sunlight holy water garlic and crosses dont bother an incubus of the white court much but the touch of someone who truly loves and is loved in return is a different story i glanced at my hand it was already blistering justine drew away from me her lovely face distressed im sorry she said im sorry i didnt think i shook my head its all right i said quietly and stepped back from her while the demon screamed its frustration behind my eyes she bit her lip and looked up at me uncertainly it had been a long time since i had seen justine facetoface i had forgotten how beautiful she was the lines of her face had changed subtly she looked leaner now more confident more assured maybe i was too used to dealing with things that were immortal or practically so its easy to forget how much difference a couple of years can make her dark hair of course was gone now it was growing in just as rich long and curling as before but now it was silverwhite id done that to herfed on her drained her to the very edge of death almost torn the life from her body in my eagerness to sate the hunger i closed my eyes for a moment at the memory of that pleasure and shivered id nearly killed the woman i loved and remembering it was nearly as arousing as her touch had been when i opened my eyes again justines gaze was steady and calmand knowing it doesnt make you a monster to want she said her voice very gentle its what you do with the want that matters instead of answering her i turned and shut the door then picked up my hardware it isnt gentlemanly to leave weapons lying around on the floor they clashed with the apartments decor too i studied justine from the corner of my eye as i did taking in her clothingelegant businesswear suitable for laras executive assistant or for a corporate courier empty night i swore viciously suddenly furious justine blinked at me what is it lara i spat what did she tell you justine shook her head slowly frowning at me as though trying to read my thoughts from my expression she said to bring you a briefing on a situation you needed to know about nothing could be written down i had to memorize it all and bring it to you along with some photos here she put a slender hand on a valise that sat on my coffee table i stared at her intently then i sat slowly down on one of the chairs in my apartments living room it wasnt a comfortable chair but it was very very expensive i need you to tell me everything she told you i said absolutely every word justine stared back for a long moment her frown deepening why because knowing certain things simply being aware of them was dangerous because justine had been providing me with information from within laras operation and which i had in turn been providing to harry and through him to the white council if lara had found out about that she might have brought justine into the oblivion war if she had i was going to kill my sister i need you to trust me love i said quietly but i cant tell you but why cant you tell me the real bitch about the oblivion war was that question justine i said spreading my hands please trust me justine narrowed her eyes in wary thought which took me somewhat aback it was not an expression i was used to seeing on her face no i was used to seeing a look of dazed satiation after id fed or of molten desire as i stalked her or of shattering ecstasy as i took her i closed my eyes took a deep breath and shoved my demon down again my poor thomas she said quietly when i opened them again she sat down across the table from me her dark eyes compassionate when we were together i never realized how hard it was for you your demon is much stronger than theirs stronger than any but hers isnt it it only matters if i give in to it i replied more harshly than i meant to which means it doesnt matter tell me justine please she folded her arms across her body biting on her bottom lip it really isnt much she said to tell you that word had come to her through the usual channels that the ladies of the dark river were in town she opened the valise and that you would know which one you were dealing with she took out a fullpage photo and slid it across the table to me it was grainy but big enough to clearly show an image of a starkfeatured younglooking woman getting into a cab at ohare the time stamp on the photo said it was from that morning yes i said quietly i know her i thought she was dead lara said that this person had taken a child justine continued though she didnt say how she knew that and that her aim was to draw out one who could do her cause great good i got a sick feeling in my stomach as justine slid out the second photograph and pushed it across the table the photograph was simple this timea hallway a picture of a door its top half of frosted glass bearing simple black lettering harry dresden wizard the door was closed but i could see the outline of a tall feminine form facing an even taller storkish masculine outline the time stamp said it was barely two hours before so lara had been trying to do me a favor after all she had protected justine behind a layer of generalities and i had dithered around cutting hair and indulging my hunger and my suspicions while the stygian sisterhood had suckered my brother into a ploy to bring back one of their monstrous matrons justine had never been stupid even when shed been deep in my influence before shed walked into it with her eyes open hes in trouble isnt he and he doesnt even know it yet i said quietly she pursed her lips in thought and you cant tell him why can you any more than you could tell me i looked up at her helplessly what are you going to do she asked i rose and reclaimed my knife and gun hes my brother i said im going to cover his back how are you going to explain it to him she asked i tugged on a pair of leather gloves and went to her so i could take her hands in mine squeezing gently before i turned to go if he thinks hes helping her and you interfere hes not going to understand she said how are you going to explain it to him thomas it sucks to be a venator im not i said quietly then i and my demon went out to continue an agesold silent war and help my brother i just hoped the two activities wouldnt be mutually exclusive justine had a driver circling the block waiting for her to call she did i walked her to the elevator holding her hand in my gloved fingers the whole way we didnt speak again she smiled at me though when the elevator arrived and kissed my fingers through the glove then she was gone technically there was always a huge empty place inside methat was what the hunger was after all so i told myself that this wasnt any different and i went back to my apartment to get to work purely for form i tried harrys home and office phones before i left my apartment but i got no answer at his apartment and only his answering service at his office i left a message that i needed to talk to him but i doubted he would get it in time for it to be of any help i grimaced as i took my cell phone out of my pocket and left it on my kitchen counter there wasnt any point in carrying it with me technology doesnt get along well with magic twenty or thirty minutes in harrys company could kill a cell phone if he was in a bad moodless if he was actively throwing spells around my own remedial skills werent any particular threat to the phone but once i brought up the tracking spell id need to find my brother my reception would go straight to hell anyway harry waxes poetic about magic hell go on and on about how it comes from your feelings and how its a deep statement about the nature of your soul and then hell whip out some kind of halfdivine halfinsane philosophy hes cobbled together from the words of saints and comic books about the importance of handling power responsibly get him rolling and hell go on and on and on for someone on harrys level maybe its relevant for the rest of us heres what you need to know about magic its a skill anyone can learn it to one degree or another not very many people can be good at it it takes a lot of practice and patience it makes you tired leaves you with headaches and muscle cramps and everyone and their dog has an opinion about the correct way to do it harrys a master of the skillas in simultaneous doctorates from mit harvard and yale and a masters from oxford by comparison i went to a sixmonth votechwhich means i skipped a bunch of the flowery crap and focused on learning some useful things that work it took me a couple of minutes longer than it would have taken him but i used the silver pentacle amulet my mother had given me for my fifth birthday to create a link to harrys amulet a battered twin to mine early springtime in chicago can come at you with a psychotic array of weather this spring had been pleasantly mild and by the time id used the tracking spell to catch up to my little brother the day had faded into a pleasantly brisk evening i held the silver amulet in my right hand its chain wrapped around my knuckles four or five inches above the pendant left dangling the pendant swung steadily back and forth in one direction no matter which way i turned as if it had been guided by a tiny gyroscope id paid a small fortune to park the hummermoney well spent now i followed the swing of the pendant and the spell guiding it across the grounds of millennium park millennium park is something fairly rarea genuinely beautiful park in the middle of a large city granted the buildings spaced around the grounds look like something inspired by an escher painting and a period of liberal chemical xperimentation in an architects underclassman years but even they have their own kind of madmans charm even though night was coming on the park was fairly busy the skating rink stayed open until ten every night and it would only stay open for a few more days before it would shut down until the seasons turned again kids and parents skated around the rink couples strolled together uniformed police officers patrolled in plain sight nearby making sure the good people of chicago were kept safe from predators i spotted harry stalking along the side of the skating rink walking away from me he was head and shoulders taller than most of the people around him professionalbasketballplayer tall and rather forebidding in his big black duster his head was down his attention on something he was holding in his handsprobably a tracking spell of his own i hurried across the distance to the skating rink to begin shadowing him i realized i was being followed about twenty seconds later whoever they were the stygian hadnt told them they were dealing with a vampire they hadnt stayed downwind and a stray breeze had brought in the aromas of a couple of dozen humans who were nearby the reek of a couple of trash cans the scents of several nearby food vendors selling various temptations from their cartsand the distinct rottenmeat and stalesweat stench badly hidden under generous splashes of axe of two ghouls that wasnt good like me ghouls can pass for human theyre the cheap muscleforhire of the supernatural world doubtless the stygian had hired them on against the possibility of interference from the venatori one ghoul i could handle no problem though they were tough to kill strong fast and vicious as the day is long thats nothing i havent slaughtered before two of them though changed the picture it meant that if they had any brains going for them at all they could make it very difficult if not impossible for me to take them out without being incapacitated myself true hired thugs generally werent known for their brains but it wasnt a good time to start making assumptions about the opposition i quickened my pace attempting to catch up with harry and pretended i hadnt noticed the ghouls harry turned aside and hurried across the park grounds toward the pavilion it was an enormous structure which i always thought looked something like a medieval mongols war helmet giant attila chapeau turned into a building where concerts were held on a regular basis for the good people of chicago tonight though the pavilion was dark and empty it should have been locked upand probably was locks though never seemed to pose much of an obstacle to my brother he went to a door on the side of the stage building of the pavilion and opened it vanishing inside i hurried after him and called out his name i was still a good fifty yards away though and he didnt hear me the ghouls did though i heard one of them snarl something to the other and their footsteps quickened to a run i ran faster i beat them to the door and my demon and i shut it behind me hardhard enough to warp the metal door in its metal frame harry i shouted harry we need to talk the ghouls hit the door and tried to open it they didnt have much luck on the first try but they settled in to wrench it open the door was only metal it wouldnt hold them out for long the interior of the building was empty and completely unlit except for the faintest greenish radiance which came through dimly as though reflecting from many other interior surfaces several rooms away my demon had no trouble seeing through it and i went through the halls in silent haste following the faint light source toward its origin one of the ghouls ripped the door off its hinges the metal shrieking behind me one of the ghouls bounded through snarling the pitch and tenor of its voice changing as it came it was changing form growing less human and more dangerous as it ran down its prey i rounded a corner and ran toward a tall figure in a dark coat at the end of a hall lit by a green luminescenceand realized within a few steps that the figure my tracking spell had taken me after was not my brother i drew the desert eagle from under my coat and opened fire the form crouched lifting an arm and bullets bounced off something and began skittering around the concrete of the hallway a magical defensethe stygian a hand lifted and a sphere of light flashed toward me i dove under it but the incoming spell matched my movement and fell to meet me there was a flash of brighter light and an instant of heat that i expected to become agony instead there was just a whirl of confusing dizziness and then i was back on my feetjust as the first ghoul its arms now half again as long as they were and ending in grotesque claws its face distended into a gaping fanged muzzle rounded the corner and leapt at me id brought the kukri its a weapon thats served the gurkhas well for a couple of centuries and with good reason the bentbladed knife the size of a small sword carries a tremendous amount of striking power along its inner edge when wielded properly enough to strike limbs and heads from bodies even when used by relatively small and less powerful mortals in the hands of a vampire its the kind of thing that jabberwocks get twitchy about the first ghoul led with a claw that was fast but not fast enough i left it on the floor of the hallway hamstrung it on the backstroke and emptied the desert eagle into its back as it tried to flee shattering its spine its one of a couple of ways to put a ghoul down fast and for keeps the second ghoul came at me a breath later and hesitated for maybe a quarter of a second upon seeing what was left of the first ghoul that isnt a long time in human terms when you play in my league the ghoul might as well have put a bullet through its own head it would have amounted to the same thing i threw the kukri hard my demon lending me strength and precision and the knife split the ghouls skull open like rotten fruitthe other way to put ghouls down fast i slapped a new clip into the desert eagle and had it trained on the far end of the hall when the dark figure reappeared lit by a faintly glowing green crystal she carried in her left hand her dark hair was tied back from her perfectly expressionless motionless face and her eyes were unreadably reptilian the stygian balera isnt it i asked her the second ghouls momentum had carried it to the ground beside me and it lay there on his back the handle of my knife sticking out of the center of its face the interior of his skull open to view one of his legs was still quivering or are you janera it matters little to us she replied her voice was hollow empty of something vital it sounded about as much like a human voice as the old sixties electric pianos did like actual pianos you cannot win venator the lexicon malos will be renewed depart now live to fight another day i leaned down and jerked my goresoaked knife out of the dead ghoul then i started a steady deliberate walk toward her thats what the other two members of the stygian sisterhood ive met have said so far it hasnt worked out that way i started planning my shot every schmuck who can conjure up a shield that bounces bullets thinks hes hot stuff but it takes concentration to do it and the shields arent omnidirectional a ricochet shot can bounce right around a conjured shieldand besides if i could get her focused on the gun she might not realize i was using the knife on her until it was too late there was a nice smooth polished metal surface behind her the cover to what must have been a heating unit or a lighting control panel or something the steel looked heavy enough to suit my purpose if i could put part of a shot into her back even just a few fragments from a shattered bullet it should be distraction enough to let me put her down lets make this simple i told her hold still smile pretty and your sisters can have an opencasket service her lower lip twitched down away from her teeth in a gesture that looked like something that had never been human attempting a smile but yours she said her voice suddenly a purr will never know you i stepped forward ready to shoot and caught a flicker of my own reflection in the metal behind the stygian it wasnt me the man facing me wasnt me he looked older rough faced with shaggy greying hair and a scruff of a beard his jaws were slightly distended as were his lips and i pegged him at once as a ghoul who had not quite managed to completely hide its true nature under a human outer appearance i lifted my left hand and the knife in it and the ghoul in the reflection did the same thing the stygian gave me another notsmile and vanished around the corner it took me a second to recover and go running after herbut i neednt have bothered a heavy door clanged shut as i rounded the corner and flickering motes of greenish light danced over its surface before leaving me in total darkness im not a member of the elite when it comes to the use of magic but i knew better than to try to force that door against whatever energies the stygian had laid across it in her wake i cursed savagely the entire affair had been an ambush and i had walked right into it this was the difference between harrys use of magic and mine the link between our amulets was strong enough that his more sophisticated spells would never have been deceived the stygian must have used some kind of masking enchantment to trick my own gradeschool version of a tracking spell and then employed an illusion to give herself the appearance of my brother once she had lured me into position to do whatever it was she had done to me why change my face the members of the stygian sisterhood were no amateurs when it came to dangerous even lethal magic why had she done that instead of for example setting my intestines on fire even if my demon had been fully fed and at peak strength i doubted i could have survived something like that now that the actual fighting was over i began to feel the fear had the stygian wished it i would be dead right now and the knowledge was sobering frightening harry had occasionally accused me of being reckless and overconfidentwhich is believe me hypocrisy of a staggering magnitude but in this instance he was probably right and after expending so much energy on running fighting and bending steel with my bare hands i was hungry the park outside this building was just brimming over with happy oblivious kine it would be so easy to cut one out of the herd some tender little doe and i had to focus and concentrate i wasnt working with a safety net another stupid mistake could kill me get your game face on thomas i snarled to myself get your head together the darkness of the building was almost complete but my demon let me see clearly enough the ghouls were already rotting away theyd be nothing but a stinking mess of sludge in a few hours we were far enough into the building that i doubted the sound of the shots had carried out of itbut the cops on patrol in the park would notice the door the ghouls had torn off the building probably sooner rather than later i couldnt stay there i found another way out of the building and hurried back toward my truck i couldnt trust my tracking spell obviously which meant that i had to find harry another way karrin murphy of chicago pd might be able to find out if anyone had seen his car but i had no way of knowing harry would be in it or even nearby and even if i did find him it was going to be hell convincing him of anything when a stranger walked up told harry that he was his brother and asked him to abandon a case first things first i decided i had to find him or none of the rest of it would matter i knew someone who could help harry is one of the top wizards on the planet and he lives in a basement his boardinghouse is a little rundown but roomy i guess the rent is cheap his basement apartment is tiny but the neighbors are elderly and quiet he seems to like it ive known him for years and i still cant quite believe that he really keeps on living there personally i think thats why he hasnt had more trouble at homei dont think his enemies can bring themselves to believe it either maybe they figure its a decoy hes constructed solely to give them somewhere obvious to attack where he can lure them to their deaths certainly the ones who show up dont like the welcome they receive the defensive spells around his home could charbroil a herd of charging buffalo i used the crystal hed given me to disarm his wards and the key hed given me to unlock his door and let myself in his apartment was spotlessly clean as usualhed turned into a neat freak a few years ago for some reason though hed never talked about why an enormous shaggy grey dog two hundred pounds of muscle and fur and white sharp fangs appeared from the little kitchenequipped alcove and growled at me whoa i said holding up my hands mouse its me thomas mouses growl cut off suddenly his ears twitched back and forth and he tilted his head one way and then the other peering at me his nose twitching as he sniffed someone laid an illusion over me i said harry had told me his dog was special and could understand human speech i still wasnt sure whether hed been pulling my leg when he said it harrys got a weird sense of humor sometimes but speaking quietly to animals when they appear nervous is always a good idea and i did not want mouse deciding that i was a threat he was a foo dog and id seen him take on things no mortal animal could survive much less overcome look boy i think harry might be in trouble i need to talk to the skull mouse came over to me and sniffed at me carefully then he made a chuffing sound padded over to one of the throw rugs on the apartments floor and dragged it to one side revealing the liftup trapdoor that led down to the subbasement i paced over to it and ruffled the dogs ears thanks boy mouse wagged his tail at me a folding stepladder led down into my brothers laboratory which i always pronounced with five syllables just to give him a hard time i unfolded it and went down stopping as soon as i could see the whole place you dont just wander around a wizards lab its a bad idea the place was piled high with god only knows what kind of horribly disturbing rare expensive and inane junk there was a lead box on one shelf in which he kept dust made from depleted uranium for crying out loud there was also an eightfootlong scale model of the heart of the chicago skyline on a table in the center of the room its obsessively detailed down to models of trees that actually look like the trees they represent and one of the downtown buildings that was recently demolished its a little bit creepy actually my brothers got a voodoo doll of the entire town he also has a human skull that sits on its own wooden shelf between a pair of candles that have been burned down and replaced so many times that little volcano lumps of colored wax have formed at either end there are romance paperbacks stacked up on either side of the skull along with an old issue of playboy from the seventies with bo derek on the cover and a long strip of scarlet ribbon hey i said skull bob isnt it the skull didnt move i was going to feel really stupid if it turned out that harry had been pulling my leg about the skull the whole time my brother the ventriloquist hey i said skull look its me thomas i know i dont look like thomas but its me harrys in trouble and i need your help to go get him out of it there was a tiny flicker of orange lights in one of the eye sockets of the skull then the flicker grew brighter and was joined by a second in the other socket the skull twitched on the shelf turning a little toward me and said holy clay face batman what happened to you i chewed on my bottom lip for a second debating on what to tell the skull i knew that bob was harrys lab assistant and technical adviser in matters magical that he was some sort of spirit who resided inside the skull and not a mortal being in his own right all the same he was beholden to harry and whatever bob knew harry could potentially learn there isnt much i can tell you i said harrys new client isnt what she appears to be i was trying to warn him she tricked me into following her and did this to my face i think she did it to make it harder for me to warn harry about her uhhuh bob said what do you want from me help me get this thing off my face then help me find harry so i can get him off this case before he gets hurt bob snorted yeah right i frowned what you think im lying to you look thomas the skull said its tone patently patronizing i acknowledge youre cool beyond cool youre goodlooking you get all the girls and you send naked chicks to harrys apartment dressed only in bits of red ribbon all of which i admire in a personbut uh youre still kind of a vampire from a house of vampires famous for being mind benders no less i ground my teeth you think someones controlled me into doing this i think that generally speaking you dont have secrets from your brother man bob said yawning and besides once harry gets onto a case for a client he doesnt come off it hes like a tick only his head doesnt come off quite as easy and theres less chance of his giving you an infection this is important bob i told him so is finding lost children bob said or at least it is to harry i thought it might be because then their mother would be all appreciative and jump into bed with him but apparently its one of those morality things finding kids hits some kind of goodversusevil hot button in his head that was what lara had meant when she said the stygian had taken a child crap now i could see the stygian sisterhoods plan and if i didnt stop themstop harrythe oblivion war could be lost in a night dammit i growled bob i need the help i need you to do this sorry chief bob said dont work for you harry tells me different thats a different story but hes in trouble i said so you say but you arent offering me any details which makes it sound fishy because if i gave you any details they might get back to harry and he might be in even more trouble than he is right now bob stared at me for a second then he said i hereby promote you from mackerel to tuna fish okay i said thinking bob was a spirit such beings were bound by their words and promises by the contracts they made with mortals okay look you serve harry right yep if i give you this information i said and if in your judgment his possession of this information could prove detrimental to his wellbeing i want you to swear to me that you will keep it from him or anyone else who asks you about it okay bob said drawing out the word with tremendous skepticism if you do that i said ill tell you if you cant i wont and bad things are going to happen the skulls eyelights brightened with what looked surprisingly like curiosity okay okay ill bite you have a bargain i do so swear it to you vampire i took a deep breath and glanced around if another venator knew what i was doing theyd put a bullet in my head without thinking twice have you ever heard of the oblivion war no the skull said promptly for a reason i said because its a war being waged for the memory of mankind uh bob said what i sighed and brushed my gloved hand back over my hair look you know that for the most part the old gods have grown less powerful over the years or have changed as they were incorporated into other beliefs sure bob said there hasnt been a first church of marduk for a while now but tiamat got an illustration in the monster manual and had that role in that cartoon so shes probably better off uh okay i said im not sure exactly what youre talking about but generally speaking youre right beings like tiamat needed a certain amount of mortal belief to connect them to the mortal world the eyelights brightened ah the skull said i get it if no one remembers some hasbeen god theres no connection left it cant remain in the mortal world right i said quietly and were not just talking about pagan gods were talking about things that people of today have no words for no concept to adequately define demons of such appetites and fury that the only way mortals in some parts of the world survived them at all was with the help of some of those early gods demons who had to be stopped permanently you cant destroy a primal spiritual entity bob mused even if you disperse it it will just reform in time but you can forget them i said shut them away leave them forever lost outside the mortal world and unable to do harm you can consign them to oblivion bob made a whistling sound what the hell how he doesnt have any lips ballsy bob admitted i mean fighting a war like that the more people you brought in to fight on your side the more the information would spread and the stronger a hold these demons would have so youd have to control who had the information youd have to lock that down hard very i said i know there are fewer than two hundred venatori in the world but were organized in cells i only know one other venator venatori bob said theres like five thousand of those driedup old prunes theyve been helping the council fight the war remember i waved a hand those are the venatori umbrorum yeah bob said the hunters of the shadows one way to translate their name i said and its the one they believe is correct but its more accurate to call them the shadows of the hunters they dont know it but we founded them gave them their store of knowledge use them to gather information to help us keep an eye on things and theyre camouflage too to make our enemies have to work a little harder to find us enemies right bob said a war has to have two sides i nodded or more there are a lot of people interested in the old demons theyre weak compared to what they once were but theyre still a route to power cults priests societies individual lunatics theyre trying to keep the demons nailed to this world were trying to stop them i shook my head the oblivion war has been going on for more than five thousand years sometimes decades will pass without a single battle being fought sometimes it all goes insane how many demons have you guys cut off bob asked brightly then he chirped oh heh i guess you wouldnt know would you if you kacked em you dont even remember em yeah i said kind of a thankless way to fight a war tell me about it i said this is secret stuff bob just knowing it creates a kind of resonance in the mind if someone knows to look for it they can see it if harry finds out about the war and anyone from either side realizes that hes aware the bad guys will assume hes a venator or a rival and kill him bob said his manner suddenly sober and the venatori will assume hes a threat like the rest of the nut balls theyll either consider him a security risk and kill him or impress him into joining their army and hes already fighting one war yeah i said um bob said one wonders why they wont do the same thing to me you arent mortal i said your knowledge wont bind anything to this world the skull somehow looked reassured thats true tell me about this client thats with my boss you know about the prosthanos society i asked buncha lunatics in the baltic region bob replied immediately they lop off their bits and pieces and replace them with grafts from inhuman sources demons and ghouls and such patchwork immortality i nodded the stygian sisterhood does the same thingonly with their psyches instead of with their physical bodies they slice out the parts of their human personalities they dont want and replace them with pieces torn from inhuman minds cheery bob leered sorority huh they hot its generally advantageous i said so for the most part yes theyre dedicated to the service of a number of old demongoddesses whom theyre trying to keep in the world through the publication of a book of rituals called the lexicon malos so the skull said hot girl comes into harrys office he drools on her shoes acts like an idiot and doesnt take her up on her offer to do morally questionable things to him right then and there uh i said im not sure if being a stupid hero he tells her not to worry that hell find her obvious sobstory decoyi mean lost child only when he does find the kid he finds this book of rituals too and being a stalwart warden of the white council now i said bob snorted hell take them this book of dangerous rituals anyone could use and the council will do with it what they did with the necronomicon in order to defuse it i nodded they publish it because they think that by making the rituals available to every nut who wants to try them the power that comes out of them will be so diffused that it will never amount to any harm only the real danger isnt the rituals bob said but the knowledge of the beings behind them and we might never be rid of themjust as well never be rid of the faeries bob looked suddenly wistful you were trying to ditch the faeries the venatori tried yes i said but the gmen stopped us cold gmen what like the government bob asked like the men in black like gutenberg and the grimms i replied bob narrowed his eyelights for a moment apparently in thought this stygian hottie she laid a trap for you she knew who you were and what youd do ive crossed swords with the sisterhood before they know me i shook my head ive got no idea why she messed up my face instead of killing me though because dresden would have sensed it bob said promptly eh murdering someone with magic it leaves an odor and there isnt a body spray on earth that can hide it completely so soon after a kill if harry got close enough to sense a whiff of black magic on her there wouldnt be any way she could pretend to be a damsel in distress hed still be able to tell she was a practitioner only if he actually touched her bob said and even then if shes significantly different from a normal human mentally itll alter the sense of her aura besides sensing a little tingle of magical potential in a client is a whole lot different from realizing that shes spattered in supernatural gore i get it so instead she changed my face technically she didnt change it the skull said its an illusion youre still you under there the question is why would she do that particularly i frowned to slow me down i said thinking it through it didnt take me long to figure out what the stygian had in mind and i clenched my teeth in frustration oh empty night shes told harry that theres a villain in the piece shes shown him the picture of the bad man who took the poor kid i gestured at my face and shes made me look like him damn bob said admiration in his tone thats sneaky harrys awfully quick on the draw these days if you mosey up he might not give you a chance to explain anything i sighed the kind of day im having he probably wouldnt are you going to help me or not answer me one more question the skull said quieter now okay why he asked why would vampires be a part of this why would something that eats people be interested in saving humanity from devouring demon gods i snorted you want me to tell you that its because in our secret hearts we long to be heroes or that deep down theres something in us that cries out for humanity for redemption i shook my head and smiled at him showing teeth at the end of the day because we dont like competition finally bob said with a roll of his eyelights a motive i can understand okay okay the skull turned on its shelf to face the table i can show you how to find harry but the first thing we do is fix your face come on in let me get a better look mnemonic lightning flashed and boomed between my ears and i felt myself smile no i said the skull tilted slightly to one side watching me no no ive got a better idea the skull tried to explain why the tracking spell he showed me was going to work when my own had failed but about five seconds into the technical talk i started substituting blah blah blah for everything he was saying im not a wizard okay im a cheap hack i dont care why it works as long as it works the stygian had staged her little charade in a warehouse down in hammond when i caught up to my brother he and the stygian were lurking in an alley across the street from the warehouse watching the place the stygian was playing her part that of the frightened nervous female anxious with the need to bring her offspring safely home again she was a reasonably good actress too for someone with so little humanity she was probably a couple of centuries old shed had time to get in some practice i went up the side of the building adjacent to the warehouse so that i could get a look at the place too there were a couple more ghouls guarding the building wearing the brown uniforms of private security personnel they kept up a regular walking routine around the warehouses exterior and interior and they werent bothering to so much as glance up at the rooftop i was on it was five floors up with no fire escape and nothing but bricks to hold on to why should they i paced down to the back side of the warehouse where harry and the stygian couldnt spot me waited until the pacing ghouls were both out of sight and then leapt the forty feet or so from my rooftop to the roof of the warehouse i landed in a roll in nearcomplete silence and froze for a long moment waiting to see if anyone raised an outcry no one did i hadnt been spotted i settled down to wait harry made his move sometime between three and four in the morning when the guards were most likely to be bored tired and convinced that nothing was going to happen tonightand when there would be the fewest possible witnesses or innocent bystanders from the front of the warehouse came his resonant baritone crying out one of those pretendlatin spell incantations he uses there was a flash of light a boom like thunder and a crash of something slamming into sheet metal with the force of a cannonball scratch one ghoul my brother hates the creatures with a passion so pure that its almost holy if his first attack hadnt killed the thing hed finish it off before long i heard the other ghoul shriek as it began to transform once everyones attention was on the attack at the front door i went in through a skylight the warehouse was stacked high with years of accumulated junk consisting mostly of the remains of shipping crates stacks of loading pallets and broken boxes an area in the center of the floor had been cleared and the concrete had been heavily marked up with occult symbols painted in blood around a table that was obviously intended to be an altar a kid a little boy maybe nine years old was bound hand and foot on the table his face blotchy from crying he was screaming and struggling against the ropes but was firmly secured to the table harry cried out again the glass in both windows at the front side of the warehouse exploded inward in a flash of scarlet light something that looked disturbingly like a severed arm went tumbling by the open doorway i kept looking until i spotted itthe lexicon malos a leatherbound book like a big old handwritten journal just the kind of impressive grimoire occult nutjobs like the stygians are so giddy about it rested on a little pedestal beside the table it didnt actually have a flashing neon sign over it reading notice me but it was pretty close i went hand over hand along the steelbeam rafters until i got to one of the girders that ran down the wall then i slid down it to the floor and hurried over to the altar and the pedestal i opened the nylon backpack in my hands stuffed the lexicon malos into it zipped it closed and then slid my arms through the shoulder straps i could have bailed then i suppose it would have been the smartest thing once the book was removed from the equation the stygians entire operation was blown granted she and the other members of the sisterhood would try it again somewhere else but they would have been stopped for the time being but the bitch had messed with my brother for the time being wasnt good enough harry came through the front door of the warehouse with the stygian treading fearfully behind him pretending to tremble tall skinny sharpfeatured and somewhat roughlooking harry wore his usual wizarding gearthe black leather duster he carried a carved staff in his left hand a shorter more heavily carved rod in his right and the tip of the rod glowed with a sullen redorange flame i was waiting for them i had wrapped the dark red blanket around my shoulders and upper body like some sort of dramatic ceremonial garb i stood over the child a wickedlooking knife id found lying on the altar in hand with my head thrown back and a sneer on my illusioncovered face so i boomed in my most overblown voice you have defeated my minions you have got to be kidding me my brother said staring at me with an expression somewhere between bemusement and naked contempt i mean jesus look at this place ive seen high school plays with a higher production value than this silence i thundered pointing the knife at him i had eyes only for the stygian in any case she was staring at me with a look of blank surprise heh serves you right sweetheart you shouldnt make up stories about imaginary villains until youre certain they wont come true who dares interrupt my yeah you know what harry asked forzare his staff snapped forward and an invisible truck hit me at thirty miles an hour i flew backward thirty feet or so and hit a stack of loading pallets i went through them that hurt i hit the wall behind them i did not go through it that hurt even more i landed dazed and wobbled to my feet with the help of my demon no problem i told myself id planned to fall back to this position in any casejust not quite that vigorously the circuit box for the building was on the wall two feet to my left i reached out and killed the lights crouch down harry shouted to the woman he thought he was protecting stay still my demon and i adjusted to the darkness almost instantly the stygian had done the same she had produced a wavybladed dagger from nowhere and was running toward me on silent feet her eyes narrowed and intent i threw the prop knife id been holding when she was ten feet away she slipped to one side and it went spinning through the air striking sparks off the far wall her knife struck at me but i slammed the edge of one hand against her forearm knocking it away before it could do more than scratch me i followed that with a pair of sharp blows to the body driving her back a step and then drew my kukri from beneath the red blanketrobes slashing at her head i missed her and the followup rake at her eyes that i made with my other hand failed to connect as well in the background harry had his priorities straight hed brought forth a little light from his amulet and was cutting the child free from the makeshift altar i felt my mouth stretch into a fierce grin so smug hissed the stygian her reptile eyes flat but not for long she raised her voice into a terrified scream let me go dont touch me harry holding the child over one shoulder in a firemans carry spun toward the sound raising his blasting rod and began hurrying toward me run venator hissed the stygian but the blood of the ancient mothers is in your veins now enjoy your last hours the nick on my arm the tiny cut from the dagger suddenly felt very cold the book was out of harrys hands the child was safe i fled the building the wound was poisoned without my demon i dont think i would have lasted more than an hour even with its support i was having trouble staying steady the pain was horrible and my whole body poured sweat even as i shivered with cold the hunger can usually overcome any kind of foreign substancebut while my demon might have been a powerful one it was not well fed and id been using it hard all night it had little strength left with which to fight the poison it was difficult but i persevered for three hours that was how long it took for me to track the stygian and catch her alone the sweep of my kukri had missed her headbut not the hairs growing out of it and while my grasping fingers had not found her eyes an instant later they had snatched those hairs out of the air before they could fall the tracking spell the skull had taught me had been good enough to let me find the stygian despite any countermeasures she might have taken when she entered her hotel room i was half an inch behind her she never knew i was there until my lips touched the back of her neck and i unleashed my demon upon her she let out a sudden gasp as my hunger starved for so long rushed into her flesh though she might have had the mind and thoughts of a dozen alien beings she had a mortal life force and a mortal bodya womans body and as i had told the skull a rather lovely one at that she tried to struggle for five or six seconds until her nervous system succumbed to my hunger until the first orgasm ripped a moan of equal parts ecstasy need and despair from her throat shhhh i told her my teeth gently finding her earlobe and my hands roaming it wont hurt i promise she cried out in despair again as her body began moving in helpless acquiescence to desire and my own reservations flickered and died before the raw aching need of my hunger i spend most of my life fighting my darker nature most of it not all of it i bore the stygian to the floor and fed her to my demon lara would help me get rid of the body a long long shower and the cleansing force of the rising sun had been enough to wash away the illusion that had obscured my true features i visited my brother at his office the next day hows business i asked him he shook his head scowling you know what ive been doing so much gopher work for the council and the wardens i think i must be forgetting how to be a private eye whys that oh i went up against this complete joke of a bad guy yesterday he said kidnapper i mean you should have seen this loser he was a joke uhhuh i said and somehow he manages to get away from me harry shook his head i mean i got the kid back no problem but the little skeeve skated out on me maybe youre getting old he glowered at me the worst part is that the chick who hired me it turns out isnt even his mother she was playing me all along the kids been missing for three days and his real parents are trying to get the cops to freaking arrest me after i pull him off a freaking sacrificial altarokay a cheesy stupid sacrificial altar but a sacrificial altar all the same wheres the chick i asked who knows harry said exasperated shes gone stiffed me too and good luck trying to get the kids parents to pay me for the investigation and rescue theres a better chance of electing a libertarian president the perils of the independent entrepreneur i said you hungry you buying im buying he stood up im hungry he put on his coat and walked with me toward the door shaking his head i tell you thomas sometimes i feel completely unappreciated i found myself smiling wow i said whats it like the warrior novelette from mean streets takes place between small favor and turn coat and before last call once upon a time when moving into a new neighborhood i spent a few days meeting the new neighbors nothing big just visits to say hello introduce myself to the other family with children my sons age another family with a highschoolaged daughter who often babysat for the other families on the street the usual sort of thing i had a bunch of innocuous interactions with them that didnt look like anything specialat the time fastforward five years over the next few years i came to learn that some of the most inane unimportant little things i had done or said in that time had impacted several of my neighbors in enormous ways not necessarily good or bad but significantly and generally in a positive fashion or so it seemed to me if id chosen different words to speak or timed my actions only slightly differently it might well have altered their livesand if i hadnt been paying close attention i might not have realized it had happened at all it was my first reallife lesson in the law of unintended consequencesand the basis of my belief that big important things are built from small and commonplace things and that even our little acts of petty everyday good or evil have a cumulative effect on our world a lot of religions make a distinction between light and darkness and paint portraits of dramatic battles between their champions but maybe the fight on the ground is a lot more common than we ever really think it happens every day and a lot of the time we might not even be aware that its going onuntil five years later i guess our smallest actions and choices matter they tell us about who we are that was the idea i tried to carry into the warrior that and the idea that what seems like a good thing or a bad thing might not be either seen from another point of view many readers were upset with michaels fate at the end of small favorhow horrible that a character who was basically so decent got handed such a horrible fate being shot and crippled for life by the champions of hell itself what a tragedy that he couldnt continue the fight judge for yourself how tragic it was for him i sat down next to michael and said i think youre in danger michael carpenter was a large brawny man though he was leaner now than in all the time id known him months in bed and more months in therapy had left him a shadow of himself and he had never added all the muscle back on even so he looked larger and more fit than most his saltandpepper hair and short beard going heavier on the salt these days he smiled at me that hadnt changed if anything the smile had gotten deeper and more steady danger he said heavens i leaned back on the old wooden bleachers at the park and scowled at him im serious michael paused to shout a word of encouragement at the second baseman or was that baseperson on his daughter alicias softball team he settled back onto the bleachers they were covered in old peeling green paint and it clashed with his powder blue and white shirt which matched the uniform tshirts of the girls below it said coach in big blue letters i brought your sword its in the car harry he said unruffled im retired you know that sure i said reaching into my coat i know that but the bad guys apparently dont i drew out an envelope and passed it to him michael opened it and studied its contents then he replaced them put the envelope back on the bench beside me and rose he started down onto the field leaning heavily on the wooden cane that went everywhere with him now nerve damage had left one of his legs pretty near perfectly rigid and his hip had been damaged as well it gave him a rolling gait i knew he couldnt see out of one of his clear honest eyes very well anymore either he took charge of the practice in the quiet confident way he did everything drawing smiles and laughter from his daughter and her teammates they were obviously having fun it looked good on him i looked down at the envelope and wished i couldnt imagine the photos contained inside it quite so clearly they were all professional clearmichael walking up the handicap access ramp to his church michael opening a door for his wife charity michael loading a big bucket of softballs into the back of the carpenter family van michael at work wearing a yellow hard hat pointing up at a halffinished building as he spoke to a man beside him the pictures had come in the mail to my office with no note and no explanation but their implications were ugly and clear my friend the former knight of the cross was in danger it took half an hour for the softball practice to end and then michael rolled back over to me he stood staring up at me for a moment before he said the sword has passed out of my hands i cant take it up againespecially not for the wrong reason i wont live in fear harry could you maybe settle for living in caution i asked at least until i know more about whats going on i dont think his plan is for me to die now he replied calmly it was never hard to tell when michael was talking about the almighty he could insert capital letters into spoken words im not sure how what happened to no man knows the day or the hour i asked he gave me a wry smile youre taking that out of context i shrugged michael id like to believe in a loving just god who looks out for everyone but i see a lot of people get hurt who dont seem to deserve it i dont want you to become one of them im not afraid harry i grimaced id figured he might react like this and id come prepared to play dirty what about your kids man what about charity if someone comes for you they arent going to be particular about what happens to the people around you id seen him display less expression while being shot his face turned pale and he looked away from me what do you have in mind he asked after a moment im going to lurk and hover i told him maybe catch our photographer before things go any further whether or not i want you to do it he said well yes he shook his head at me and gave me a tight smile thank you harry but no thank you ill manage michaels home was an anomaly so close to the city propera fairly large old colonial house complete with a white picket fence and a yard with trees in it it had a quiet solid sort of beauty it was surrounded by other homes but they never seemed quite as pleasant homey or clean as michaels house i knew he did a lot of work to keep it looking nice maybe it was that simple maybe it was a side effect of being visited by archangels and the like or maybe it was all in the eye of the beholder im pretty sure there wont ever be a place like that for me michael had given a couple of the girlsyoung women i supposea ride home in his white pickup so it had taken us a while to get there and twilight was heavy on the city i wasnt making any particular secret about tailing them but i wasnt riding his back bumper either and i dont think either of them had noticed my beatup old vw michael and alicia got out of the car and went into the house while i drove a slow lap around their block keeping my eyes peeled when i didnt spot any imminent maniacs or anticipatory fiends about to pounce i parked a bit down the street and walked toward michaels place it happened pretty fast a soccer ball went bouncing by me a small person came pelting after it and just as it happened i heard the crunchy hiss of tires on the street somewhere behind me and very near i have long arms and it was a good thing i grabbed the kid who must have been seven or eight about half a second before the oncoming car hit the soccer ball and sent it sailing her feet went flying out ahead of her as i swung her up off the ground and her toes missed hitting the cars fender by maybe six inches the car one of those fancy new hybrids that run on batteries part of the time went by in silence without the sound of the motor to give any warning the driver a young man in a suit was jabbering into a cell phone that he held to his ear with one hand he never noticed as he reached the end of the block he turned on his headlights i turned to find the child a girl with inky black hair and pink skin staring at me with wide dark eyes her mouth open and uncertain she had a bruise on her cheek a couple of days old hi i said trying to be as unthreatening as i could i had limited success tall severelooking men in long black coats who need a shave are challenged that way are you all right she nodded her head slowly am i in trouble i put her down not from me but i heard that moms can get kind of worked up about courtney gasped a womans voice and a woman i presumed to be the childs mother came hurrying from the nearest house like the child she had black hair and very fair skin she had the same wary eyes too she extended her hand to the little girl and then pulled her until courtney stood behind her mother she peeked around at me what do you think youre doing she demandedor tried to it came out as a nervous question who are you just trying to keep your little girl from becoming a victim of the green movement i said she didnt get it her expression changed as she probably wondered something along the lines of is this person a lunatic i get that a lot there was a car maam i clarified she didnt see it coming oh the woman said oh ththank you sure i frowned at the girl you okay sweetheart i didnt give you that bruise did i no she said i fell off my bike without hurting your hands i noted she stared at me for a second before her eyes widened and she hid behind her mother a little more mom blinked at me and then at the child then she nodded to me took the daughter by the shoulders and frogmarched her toward the house without another word i watched them go and then started back toward michaels place i kicked courtneys soccer ball back into her yard on the way charity answered the door when i knocked she was of an age with michael though her golden hair hid fairly well any strands of silver that might have shown she was tall and broadshouldered for a woman and id seen her crush more than one inhuman skull when one of her children was in danger she looked tireda year of seeing your husband undergoing intensely difficult physical therapy can do that i guess but she also looked happy our personal cold war had entered a state of detente of late and she smiled to see me hello harry surprise lesson i think molly went to bed early not exactly i said smiling thought id just stop by to visit charitys smile didnt exactly vanish but it got cautious really harry screamed a little voice and michaels youngest son of the same name flung himself into the air trusting me to catch him little harry was around courtneys age and generally regarded me as something interesting to climb on i caught him and gave him a noisy kiss on the head which elicited a giggle and a protesting yuck charity shook her head wryly well come in let me get you something to drink harry hes not a jungle gym get down little harry developed spontaneous deafness and scrambled up onto my shoulders as we walked into the living room michael and alicia his darkhaired quietly serious daughter were just coming in from the garage after putting away softball gear papa little harry shouted and promptly plunged forward off my shoulders arms outstretched to michael he leaned forward and caught him though i saw him wince and exhale tightly as he did it my stomach rolled uncomfortably in sympathy alicia charity said her daughter nodded hung her ball cap on a wooden peg by the door and took little harry from michael tossing him up into the air and catching him much to the childs protesting laughter come on squirt time for a bath leech harry shouted and immediately started climbing on his sisters shoulders babbling about something to do with robots michael smiled as he watched them exit i asked harry to dinner tonight he told charity kissing her on the cheek did you she said in the exact same tone shed used on me at the door michael looked at her and sighed then he said my office we went into the study michael used as his officemore cluttered than it had been before now that he was actually using it all the timeand closed the door behind us without a word i took out the photos id received and showed them to charity michaels wife was no dummy she looked at them one at a time in rapid succession her eyes blazing brighter with every new image when she spoke her voice was cold who took these i dont know yet i told her though nicodemuss name does sort of leap to mind no michael said quietly he cant harm me or my family anymore were protected by what i asked faith he said simply that would be a maddening answer under most circumstancesbut id seen the power of faith in action around my friend and it was every bit as real as the forces i could manage former presidents get a detail of secret service to protect them maybe former knights of the cross had a similar retirement package only with more seraphim oh youre going to get to the bottom of this charity asked thats the idea i said it might mean i intrude on you all a little harry michael said theres no need for that dont be ridiculous charity replied turning to michael she took his hand very gently though her tone stayed firm and dont be proud he smiled at her it isnt a question of pride im not so sure she said quietly father forthill said we were only protected against supernatural dangers if theres something else afoot youve made so many enemies we have to know whats happening i often dont know whats happening michael said if i spent all my time trying to find out there wouldnt be enough left to live in this is more than likely being done for the sole purpose of making us worried and miserable michael i said quietly one of the best ways i know to counter fear is with knowledge he tilted his head frowning gently at me you say you wont live in fear fine let me poke around and shine a light on things so we know whats going on if it turns out to be nothing no harm done and if it isnt charity asked i kept a surge of quiet anger out of my voice and expression as i looked at her levelly no harm gets done to you and yours her eyes flashed and she nodded her chin once honey michael sighed charity stared at him michael might have slain a dragon but he knew his limits he lifted a hand in acceptance and said why dont you make up the guest bedroom by a little after nine the carpenter household was almost entirely silent i had been shown into the little guest room kept at the end of an upstairs hallway it was really charitys sewing room and was all but filled with colorful stacks of folded fabric some of them in clear plastic containers some of them loose there was room around a little table with a sewing machine on it and just barely enough space to get to the bed id recuperated from injuries there before one thing was newthere was a very fine layer of dust on the sewing machine huh i sat down on the bed and looked around it was a quiet warm cheerful little roomalmost manically so now that i thought about it everything was soft and pleasant and ordered and it took me maybe six or seven whole seconds to realize that this room had been charitys haven how many days and nights must she have been worried about michael off doing literally god only knew what against foes so terrible that no one but he could have been trusted to deal with them how many times had she wondered if it would be a solemn father forthill who came to the door instead of the man she loved how many hours had she spent in this welllit room working on making warm soft things for her family while her husband carried amoracchius s cold bright steel into the darkness and now there was dust on the sewing machine michael had nearly been killed out there on that island he had been crippled forced by his injuries to lay aside the holy sword along with the nearly invisible deadly war that went with it and he was happier than id ever seen him maybe the almighty worked in mysterious ways after all another thought occurred to me as i sat there pondering whoever had sent those pictures hadnt sent them to michaelhed sent them to me what if id put michael and his family into real danger by showing up what if id somehow reacted in exactly the way id been meant to react i grimaced around the cheerful room so much for sleep i got up and padded back downstairs in my sock feet to raid the fridge and while i was in the kitchen munching on an impromptu cold cuts sandwich i saw a shadow move past the back window i had several options but none of them was real appetizing i settled for the one that might accomplish the most i turned and padded as quickly and quietly as i could to the front door slipped out and snuck around the side of the house in the direction that would i hoped bring me up behind the intruder a quick spat of rain had made the grass wet and the night had grown cool enough to make my instantly soaked socks uncomfortable i ignored them and went padding through the grass keeping to the side of the house and watching all around me the backyard was empty i got an itchy feeling on the back of my neck and continued my circle had i given myself away somehow was the intruder even now circling just the way i was hoping to sneak up on me i took longer steps and stayed as quiet as i knew howwhich was pretty darn quiet i had developed my skulking to professional levels over the years and as i rounded the corner i spotted the intruder a dark form hurrying down the sidewalk past courtneys house i couldnt follow him without being spotted pretty quickly unless i cheated which i promptly did my ability to throw up a veil wasnt anything to write home about but it ought to be good enough to hide me from view on a dark night on a heavily shadowed street i focused on my surroundings on drawing the light and shadow around me in a cloak and watched my own vision dim and blur somewhat as i did i half wished id woken up molly the kid is a natural at subtle stuff like veils she can make you as invisible as paris hiltons ethical standards and you can still see out with no more impediment than a pair of mildly tinted sunglasses but since it was me doing the job i was probably just sort of indistinct and blurry and my view of the street was like something seen through dark thin fabric i kept track of the pale concrete of the sidewalk and the movement of the intruder against the background of shadowy shapes and blurry bits of light and walked softly the intruder crept down the street and then quickly crouched down beside my old volkswagen the blue beetle it took him maybe five seconds to open the lock reach into the car and draw out the long slender shape of a sheathed sword he must have come to the house first and circled it to determine where i was he could have spotted my staff which id left resting against the wall by the front door when he looked into the kitchen window and i was pretty sure it was a he i was dealing with too the movement of his arms and legs was brusque choppy masculine i took a few steps to one side and picked up courtneys soccer ball then i approached to within a few yards and tossed it up in a high arc it came down with a rattling thump on the blue beetles hood lurkyboy twitched twisting his upper body toward the sound and freezing and i hit him in a diving tackle with my body as rigid as a spear all of my weight behind one shoulder trying to drive it right through his spine and out his chest he was completely unprepared for it and went down hard driven to the sidewalk with a whuff of expelled air i grabbed him by the hair so that i could introduce his forehead to the sidewalk but his hair was cut nearly militaryshort and i didnt have a good grip he twisted and got me in the floating rib with an elbow and i wasnt in a good enough position to keep him from getting out from under me and scrambling away the sheathed weapon still in hand i focused my will flicked a hand at him and spat forzare unseen force lashed out at the backs of his knees and hit the mystic equivalent of a brick wall there was a burst of twinkling shifting lights and he let out a croaking sound as he kept running something that glowed like a dying ember fell to the sidewalk i pushed myself up to pursue him slipped on the wet grass next to the sidewalk and rolled my ankle painfully by the time id gotten to my feet again he was too far away for me to catch even if my ankle had been steady a second later he hopped a fence and was out of sight i was left there standing beside my car on one foot while neighborhood dogs sent up a racket i gimped forward and looked down at the glowing embers of the thing hed dropped it was an amulet its leather cord snapped in the middle it looked as though it had been a carving of wood and ivory but it was scorched almost completely black so i couldnt be certain i picked it up wrinkling my nose at the smell then i turned back to the car and closed the open door after that i untwisted the piece of wire that held the trunk closed picked up a blanketwrapped bundle and went back to michaels place morning on a school day in the carpenter household is like southampton just before june theres a lot of yelling running around and organizing transport and no one seems to be exactly sure whats going on or maybe that was just me because by a little before eight all the kids were trooping out to their bus stop led by alicia the senior schoolchild so he grabbed the sword and ran molly asked sipping coffee she apparently had a cold and her nose was stuffy and bright pink my apprentice was her mothers daughter tall and blond and too attractive for me ever to be entirely comfortableeven wrapped up in a pink fluffy robe and flannel pjs with her hair a mess give me some credit i said unwrapping the blanketwrapped bundle and producing amoracchius he thought he took the sword michael frowned at me as he put margarine on his toast i thought you told me the sword was best hidden in plain sight ive been getting paranoid in my old age i replied munching on a bit of sausage i blinked at the odd taste and looked at him turkey michael said mildly its better for me its better for everyone charity said firmly including you harry gee i said thanks she gave me an arch look cant you just use the amulet to track him down nope i said putting some salt on the turkey sausage tell her why not grasshopper molly spoke through a yawn it caught on fire fires a purifying force wiped out whatever energy was on the amulet that might link back to the owner she blinked watery eyes besides we dont need it michael frowned at her he took the decoy i said smiling and i know how to find that unless hes gotten rid of it or taken steps to make it untraceable michael said in a patient reasonable tone after all he was evidently prepared with some sort of defensive measure against your abilities different situation entirely i said tracking someone by using one of their personal possessions depends upon following a frequency of energy inherently unstable and transient i actually have a piece of the decoy sword and the link between those two objects is much more concrete itd take one heuh heck of a serious countermeasure to stop me from finding it but you didnt trail him last night charity asked i shook my head i didnt know where id have been going i wasnt prepared and since apparently someone is interested in the swords i didnt want to go off and leave you the sword unprotected here i finished what about the other one michael asked quietly fidelacchius brothersword to michaels former blade currently rested in a cluttered basket in my basementnext to the heavy locked gun safe that was warded with a dozen dangerous defensive spells hopefully anyone looking to take it would open the safe first and get a face full of boom my lab was behind a screen of defensive magic which was in turn behind an outer shell of defensive magic that protected my apartment plus there was my dog mouse two hundred pounds of fur and muscle who didnt take kindly to hostile visitors its safe i told him after breakfast ill track buzzcut guy down have a little chat with him and well put this whole thing to bed sounds simple michael said it could happen michael smiled his eyes twinkling buzz as it turned out wasnt a dummy hed ditched the decoy sword in a dumpster behind a fastfood joint less than four blocks from michaels place michael sat behind the wheel of his truck watching as i stood hipdeep in trash and dug for the sword you sure you dont want to do this part i asked him sourly i would harry he replied smiling but my leg you know the bitch of it was he was being sincere michael had never been afraid of work why dump it here do you think i gestured at a nearby streetlight dark last night no moon this is probably the first place he got a good look at it parked his car here too maybe i found the handle of the cheap replica broadsword id picked up at what had amounted to a martial arts trinkets shop aha i said and pulled it out there was another manila envelope ducttaped to the blade i took the sword and the envelope back to the truck michael wrinkled up his nose at the smell coming up from my garbagespattered jeans but that expression faded when he looked at the envelope taped to the sword he exhaled slowly well he said no use just staring at it i nodded and peeled the envelope from around the blade i opened it and looked in there were two more photos the first was of michael in the uniform shirt he wore when he coached his daughters softball team he was leaning back on the bleachers as he had been when id first walked up to speak to him the second picture was of a weapona longbarreled rifle with a massive steel snout on the end of it and what looked like a telescope for a sight it lay on what looked like a bed with cheap motel sheets hells bells i muttered what is that michael glanced at the picture its a barrett he said quietly fiftycaliber semiautomatic rifle snipers in the middle east who use them are claiming kills at two kilometers sometimes more its one of the deadliest longrange weapons in the world he looked up and around him at all the buildings overkill for chicago really he said with mild disapproval you know what im thinking i said im thinking we shouldnt be sitting here in your truck right next to a spot buzz expected us to go while he and his superrifle are out there somewhere michael looked unperturbed if he wanted to simply kill me here hes had plenty of time to make the shot humor me i said he smiled and then nodded i can take you to your place you can get some clean clothes perhaps that hurts man i said brushing uselessly at my jeans as the truck moved out you know what bugs me about this situation michael glanced aside at me for a second i think i do but it might be different from what you were thinking i ignored him why i mean sure we need to know who this guy is but why is he doing this its a good question he sends the pictures to me not you i said i held up the new photo of the sniper rifle i mean this is obviously an escalation but if what he wanted was to kill you why why document it for me it looks to me michael said as if he wants you to be afraid so he threatens you i demanded thats stupid he smiled do people threaten you very often sure all the time what happens when they do he asked i shrugged i say something mouthy i said then i clean their clocks for them at the first opportunity which is probably why our photographer here call him buzz i said it will make things simpler why buzz hasnt bothered threatening you i frowned so youre saying buzz knows me it stands to reason it seems clear hes trying to push you into some sort of reaction something he thinks youll do if youre frightened like what i asked what do you think he replied i put my hand on the hilt of amoracchius the swords tip rested on the floorboards of the truck between my feet that would be my guess too he said i frowned down at the blade and nodded maybe buzz figured id bring you the sword if you were in danger so that i didnt finish so that id have some way of defending myself michael said gently you can say it harry you wont hurt my feelings i nodded at the true sword sure you dont want it michael shook his head i told you harry that part of my life is over and what if buzz makes good i asked quietly what if he kills you michael actually laughed i dont think thats going to happen he said but if it does he shrugged death isnt exactly a terrifying proposition for me harry if it was i could hardly have borne the sword for as long as i did i know what awaits me and i know that my family will be taken care of i rolled my eyes yeah im sure everything will be fine if your younger kids have to grow up without a father in their lives he winced and then he pursed his lips thoughtfully for a few moments before he replied other children have he said finally and thats it i asked incredulous you just surrender to whatever is going to happen it isnt what id wantbut a lot of things happen that i dont want im just a man the last thing i would expect from you i said is fatalism not fatalism he said his voice suddenly and unexpectedly firm faith harry faith this is happening for a reason i didnt answer him from where i was standing it looked like it was happening because someone ruthless and fairly intelligent wanted to get his hands on one of the swords and worse it looked like he was probably a mortal too if what charity had said was accurate that meant michael didnt have a heavenly insurance policy against the threat it also meant i would have to pull my punchesthe first law of magic prohibited using it to kill a human being there was some grey area involved with it but not much and it was the sort of thing that one didnt play around with the white council enforced the laws and anyone who broke them faced the very real possibility of a death sentence and thats all i need i muttered what nothing michael pulled the truck into the gravel parking lot of my apartment in the basement of a big old boardinghouse i need to drop by a site before we go back to get your car is that all right i took the sword with me as i got out of the truck well i said as long as its all happening for a reason michaels small company built houses years of vanishing at irregular intervals to battle the forces of evil had probably held him back from moving up to building the really expensive really profitable places so he built homes for the upper couple of layers of the middle class instead he probably would have made more money if he cut corners but it was michael i was betting that never happened this house was a new property down toward wolf lake and it had the depressing look of all construction sitesnaked earth trees bulldozed and piled to one side and the standard detritus of any such endeavor mud wood garbage discarded by the workers and big old boot tracks all over the ground half a dozen men were at work putting up the houses skeleton shouldnt take me long michael said sure i said go to it michael hopped down from the truck and gimped his way over to the house moving with an energy and purpose id seldom seen from him i frowned after him and then pulled the first envelope out of my pocket and started looking at the photos inside the photo of michael at a building site had been taken at this one buzz had been here watching michael he might still be here now i got out of the car and slung the swords belt over my shoulder so that it hung with its hilt sticking up next to my head photo in hand i started circling the site trying to determine where buzz had been standing when hed taken his picture i got some looks from the men on the jobbut as i said before im used to that kind of thing it took me only a couple of minutes to find the spot buzz had useda shadowed area of weeds and scrub brush behind the pile of felled trees it was obscured enough to offer a good hiding spot if no one was looking particularly hard but far enough away that he had to have used a zoom lens of some kind to get those pictures i had heard that digital cameras could zoom in to truly ridiculous levels these days i found footprints dont read too much into that im not ranger rick or anything but i had a teacher who made sure i spent my share of time hiking and camping in the rugged country of the ozarks and he taught me the basicswhere to look and what to look for the showers last night had wiped away any subtle signs but i wouldnt have trusted my own interpretation of them in any case i did find one clear footprint of a mans left boot fairly deep and half a dozen partials and a few broken branches in a line leading away hed come here hung around for a while then left which just about anyone could have deduced from the photo even if he hadnt seen any tracks i had this guy practically captured already there werent any bubblegum wrappers discarded cigarettes or fortuitously misplaced business cards that would reveal buzzs identity i hadnt really thought there would be but you always look i slogged across the muddy ground back toward the truck when the door of one of the contractors vans opened and a prematurely balding thin guy with a tool belt and a twofoot reel of electricians wire staggered out he had a shirt with a name tag that read chuck chuck wobbled to one side dragging the handles of some tools along the side panel of michaels truck leaving some marks i glanced into the van there was an empty bottle of jim beam inside with a little still dribbling out the mouth hey chuck i said give you a hand with that he gave me a bleary glance that didnt seem to pick up on anything out of the ordinary about me or the big old sword hanging over my shoulder nah i got it its cool i said im going that way anyhow and those things are heavy i went over to him and seized one end of the reel taking some of the weight the electricians breath was practically explosive he nodded a couple of times and shifted his grip on the reel okay buddy thanks we carried the heavy reel of wire over to the house i had to adjust my steps several times to keep up with the occasional drunken lurch from chuck we took the wire to the pouredconcrete slab that was going to be the garage at some point it looked like and dropped it off thanks man chuck said his sibilants all mushy sure i said look uh do you really think you should be working with electricity right now chuck he gave me an indignant drunken glare whats that supposed to mean oh you just uh look a little sick thats all im just fine chuck slurred scowling i got a job to do yeah i said kind of a dangerous job in a big pile of kindling he peered at me what it came out more like wha ive been in some burning buildings man and take it from me this place i looked around at the wooden framework fwoosh im just saying fwoosh he worked on that one for a moment and then his face darkened into a scowl again he turned and picked up a wrench from a nearby toolbox buzz off freak before i get upset i wasnt going to do anyone any favors by getting into half of a drunken brawl with one of michaels subcontractors i looked around to see if anyone had noticed but they were all at other parts of the house i guessed so i just held up one hand in front of me and said mildly okay im going chuck watched me as i walked out of the garage i looked around until i spotted the power lines running into the house and then i followed the trench they were buried in back to the street until i got to the transformer i looked up at it glanced around a little guiltily and sighed then i waved my hand at the thing exerted my will and muttered hexus wizards and technology dont get along at all prolonged exposure to an active wizard has really detrimental effects on just about anything manufactured after world war ii or so especially anything involving electricity my car breaks down every couple of weeks and thats when im not even trying when im making an effort the transformer exploded in a humming shower of bluewhite sparks and the sound of an electric saw somewhere on the site died down to nothing i went back to the truck and sat quietly until michael returned he gave me a steady look it was in the name of good i said your electrician was snockered by the time the city gets by to repair it hell have sobered up ah michael said chuck hes having trouble at home how do you know hes got a wife a daughter michael said and i know the look maybe if he spent less time with jim beam i said itd go better the booze is new michael said looking worriedly at the house hes a good man hes in a bad time he glanced back at me a moment later thank you though perhaps next time you could just come tell me about it duh harry that probably would have worked too i shook my head calmly thats not how i roll how you roll michael asked smiling i heard molly say it once so it must be cool how you roll michael shook his head and started the truck well you were trying to help thats the important thing harry dresden saving the world one act of random destruction at a time okay i said to molly as i prepared to get into my car just keep your wits about you i know she said calmly if theres any trouble you call the cops i said this guy looks to be operating purely vanilla but he can still kill you just fine i know harry if you see him do not approach himand dont let your dad do it either molly rolled her eyes in exasperation then she muttered a quick word and vanished gone she was standing within an arms length of me but i couldnt see her at all lets see the bozo shoot this said her disembodied voice and while were at it lets hope he isnt using a heatsensitive scope i said drily she flickered back into sight giving me an arch look the point is that im perfectly capable of keeping a lookout and yelling if theres trouble ill go with dad to softball and youll be the second person i call if theres a whiff of peril i grunted maybe i should go get mouse let him stay with you too maybe you should keep him close to the swords molly said quietly my dads just a retired soldier the swords are icons of power the swords are bits of sharp metal the men who hold them make them a threat in case you hadnt noticed my dad isnt one of those men anymore molly said she tucked a trailing strand of golden hair behind one ear and frowned up at me worriedly are you sure this isnt about you blaming yourself for what happened to my dad i dont blame myself i said my apprentice arched an extremely skeptical eyebrow i looked away from her you wanna talk to me about it no i said i suddenly felt very tired not until im sure the swords are safe if he knew where to send the pictures molly said then he knows where your house is but he cant get inside even if he could get the doors or one of the windows to open the wards would roast him and your wards are perfect molly said theres no way anyone could get around them ever the way you told me those necromancers did a few years ago they didnt go around i said they went through but i see your point if i have to ill take one of the ways to wardens command center at edinburgh and leave the swords in my locker mollys eyes widened wow a locker technically i havent used it ive got the combination written down somewhere on a napkin i think does it hurt to be as suave as you boss its agonizing looks it her smile faded what are you going to do after youre sure the swords are safe she hadnt thought it through she didnt know what was going to happen in the next few minutes so i gave her my best fake grin and said one step at a time grasshopper one step at a time i began pouring my will into my shield bracelet about half a mile from home that kind of active magic wasnt good for the beetle but having a headless driver smash it into a building would be even worse i fastened the buttons on my leather duster too the spells that reinforced the coat were fresh and theyd once stood up to the power of a kalashnikov assault riflebut that was a world of difference from the power of acaliber sniper round buzz had missed his shot at the sword at michaels house its really hard to tail someone without being noticed unless youve got a team of several cars working togetherand this had all the earmarks of a lonegunman operation buzz hadnt been tailing me today and unless hed given up entirelysure rightthat could only mean he was waiting for me somewhere hed had plenty of time to set up an ambush somewhere he knew id go home the sword was my priority i wasnt planning on suicide or anything but at the end of the day i was just one guy the swords had been a thorn in the side of evildoers for two thousand years in the long term the world needed them a lot more than it needed one battered and somewhat shabby professional wizard as i came down the street toward my apartment i stomped on the gas granted in an old vw beetle that isnt nearly as dramatic as it sounds my car didnt roar as much as it coughed more loudly but i picked up speed and hit my driveway as hard as i could while keeping all the wheels on the ground i skidded to a stop outside my front door as the engine rattled pinged and began pouring out black smoke which would have been totally cool if id actually made it happen on purpose i flung myself out of the car the sword in hand and into the haze of smoke my shield bracelet running at maximum power in a dome that covered me on all sides i rushed toward the steps leading down to the front door of my basement apartment as my foot was heading down toward the first step there was a flash of light and a sledgehammer hit me in the back it spun me counterclockwise as it flung me down and i went into a bad tumble down the seven steps to my front door i hit my head my shoulder screamed and the taste of blood filled my mouth my shield bracelet seared my wrist gravity stopped working and i wasnt sure which way i was supposed to be falling get up harry i told myself hes coming hes coming for the sword get up id dropped my keys in the fall i looked for them i saw blood all over the front of my shirt the keys lay on the concrete floor of the stairs i picked them up and stared stupidly at them it took me a minute to remember why i needed them and then another minute to puzzle out which of the five keys on the ring went to my front door my head was pounding and i felt sick i couldnt get a breath i tried to reach up to unlock the door but my left shoulder wouldnt hold my weight i almost slammed my head against the concrete again i made it up to a knee i shoved my key at the door hes coming hes coming blue sparks flew up and a little shock lit up my arm with pain my wards id forgotten about my wards i tried to focus my will again but i couldnt get it to gel i tried again and again and finally i was able to perform the routine little spell that disarmed them i shoved my key into the lock and turned it then i leaned against the door it didnt open my door is a heavy steel security door i installed it myself and im a terrible carpenter it doesnt quite line up with the frame and it takes a real effort to get it open and closed i had grown used to the routine bump and thrust of my shoulders and hips that i needed to open it upbut like the spell that disarmed my wards that simple task was at the moment beyond me footsteps crunched in the gravel hes coming i couldnt get it open i sort of flopped against it as hard as i could the door groaned and squealed as it swung open pulled from the other side mouse my huge shaggy grey dog dropped his front paws back to the ground shouldered his way through the door and seized my right arm by the biceps his jaws were like a vise though his teeth couldnt penetrate the leather he dragged me indoors like a giant groggy chew toy and as i went across the threshold i saw buzz appear at the top of the stairs a black shadow against the blue morning sky he raised a gun a military sidearm i kicked the door with both legs as hard as i could the gun barked real guns dont sound like the guns in the movies the sound is flatter more mechanical i couldnt see the flash because id moved the door into the way bullets pounded the steel like hailstones on a tin roof mouse slammed his shoulder against the door and rammed it closed i fumbled at the wards babbling in panicked haste and managed to restore them just in time to hear a loud popping sound a cry and a curse from the other side of the door then i reached up and snapped the dead bolt closed for good measure then i fell back onto the floor of my apartment and watched the ceiling spin for a while in two or three minutes maybe i was feeling a little better my head and shoulder hurt like hell but i could breathe i tried my arms and legs three of them worked i sat up that worked too though it made my left shoulder hurt like more hell and it was hard to see straight through the various pains i knew several techniques for reducing and ignoring pain some of them almost too effectivebut i couldnt really seem to line any of them up and get them working my head hurt too much i needed help i half crawled to my phone and dialed a number i mumbled to the other end of the phone and then lay back on the floor again and felt terrible buzz must have fallen back by now knowing that the sound of the shots could attract attention now that the sword was behind the protection of my wards there was no reason for him to loiter around outside my apartmenti hoped the next thing i knew mouse was pawing at the door making anxious sounds i dragged myself over to it disarmed the wards and unlocked it are these shell casings on the ground is this blood sputtered a little man in pale blue hospital scrubs and a black denim jacket he had a shock of black hair like a startled haystack and black wirerimmed spectacles holy hannah harry what happened to you i closed the wards and the door behind him hi butters i fell down weve got to get you to a hospital he said turning to reach for my phone i slapped my hand weakly down onto it to keep him from picking it up cant no hospitals harry you know im not a doctor yes you are i saw your business card the effort of vocalizing that many syllables hurt im a medical examiner i cut up dead people and tell you things about them i dont do live patients hang around i said its early yet still too many syllables oh this is a load of crap he muttered then he shook his head and said i need some more light matches i mumbled mantel better he found the matches and started lighting candles next ill be getting out a big jar of leeches he found the first aid kit under my kitchen sink boiled some water and came over to check me out i sort of checked out for a few minutes when i came back he was fumbling with a pair of scissors and my duster hey i protested lay off the coat youve dislocated your shoulder he informed me frowning without stopping his work with the scissors you dont want to wriggle it around trying to take your shirt off thats not what i the pin that held the two halves of the scissors together popped as butters exerted more pressure on their handles and the two halves fell apart he blinked at them in shock told you i muttered okay he said i guess we do this the hard way i wont bore you with the details ten minutes later my coat was off my shoulder was back in its socket and butters was pretending that my screams during the two failed attempts to put it back hadnt bothered him i went away again and when i came back butters was pressing a cold coke into my hand here he said drink something stay awake i drank actually i guzzled somewhere in the middle he passed me several ibuprofen tablets and told me to take them i did i blinked blearily at him as he held up my coat he turned it around to show me the back there was a hole in the leather mantle i flipped it up beneath the hole several ounces of metal were flattened against the second layer of spelltoughened leather about three inches below the collar and a hair to the right of my spine that was chilling even through my best defenses that was how close id come to death if buzz had shot me six inches lower only a single layer of leather would have been between the round and my hide a few inches higher and it would have taken me in the neck with absolutely no protection and if hed waited a quarter of a second longer until my foot had descended to the first step leading down to my door he would have sprayed my brains all over the siding of the boardinghouse you broke your nose again butters said thats where some of the blood came from there was a laceration on your scalp too which accounts for the rest i stitched it up youre holding your neck rigid probably whiplash from where the round hit you there are some minor burns on your left wrist and im just about certain youve got a concussion but other than that i muttered i feel great dont joke harry butters said you should be under observation already am i said look where it got me he grimaced doctors are required to report gunshot wounds to the police good thing i dont have any gunshot wounds eh i just fell down some stairs butters shook his head again and turned toward the phone give me a reason not to do it or i call murphy right now i grunted then i said im protecting something important someone else wants it if the police get involved this thing would probably get impounded as evidence thats an unacceptable outcome and it could get a lot of people hurt something important butters said something like a magic sword i scowled at him how do you know that he nodded at my hand because you wont let go of it i looked down to find the burnscarred fingers of my left hand clutching amoracchiuss hilt in a whiteknuckled grasp oh i said yeah kind of a tipoff isnt it think you can let it go now butters asked quietly im trying i said my hands kind of locked up okay lets just go one finger at a time then butters peeled my fingers off the sword one at a time until he had removed it from my grasp my hand closed in on itself tendons creaking and i winced it sort of hurt but at the moment it was a really minor thing butters set the sword aside and immediately took my left hand in his massaging brusquely murphys going to be pissed if you dont call her murphy and i have disagreed before i said butters grimaced okay can i help you are helping besides this butters said i looked at the little me for a moment butters had been my unofficial doctor for a long time never asking a thing in return hed waded into some serious trouble with me once hed saved my life i trusted his discretion i trusted him generally so as the blood started returning to my hand i told him more or less everything about buzz and the swords so this guy buzz butters said hes just a guy lets dont forget i said despite all the nasties running around out there its just guys who dominate most of the planet yeah but hes just a guy butters said hows that i flexed my fingers wincing a little its good thanks he nodded and stood up he went over to the kitchen and filled my dogs water bowl then did the same for my cat mister my point is he said that if this guy isnt a supermagical something he had to find out about the swords like any other guy well i said yeah butters looked at me over his spectacles so he said who knew you had the swords plenty knew i had shiros sword i said but this guy tried to get to me through michael and the only ones who knew about amoracchius were me a couple of archangels michael sanya and butters tilted his head looking at me waiting and the church i growled st mary of the angels is just about as big and impressive as churches get in a city known for its architecture st marys more than holds its own it takes up most of a city block its massive stone and as gothic as black frosting on a birthday cake id watched my back all the way there and was sure no one was following me i parked behind the church and marched up to the delivery door twenty seconds of pounding brought a tall rather befuddledlooking old priest to the door yes he asked im here to see father forthill i said excuse me he said s okay padre i told him clapping his shoulder and moving him aside less than gently ill find him now see here young man he might have said something else but i didnt pay much attention i walked past him into the halls of the church and headed for forthills room i rapped twice on the door opened it and walked in on a priest in his underwear father forthill was a stocky man of medium height with a fringe of white hair around his head and his eyes were the color of robins eggs he wore boxers a tank top and black socks a towel hung around his neck and what hair he had left was wet and stuck to his head a lot of people would have reacted with outrage to my entrance forthill considered me gravely and said ah hello harry i had come in with phasers set on snark but even though im not particularly religious i do have some sense of what is and isnt appropriate seeing a priest in his undies just isnt especially when youve barged into his private chamber uh i said deflating oh forthill shook his head smiling yes priests bathe we eat we sleep occasionally we even have to go to the bathroom yeah i said um yeah i do rather need to get dressed he said gently im saying mass tonight mass forthill actually let out a short belly laugh harry you didnt think that i just sit around in this old barn awaiting my chance to make you sandwiches bandage wounds and offer advice he nodded to where a set of vestments was hung up on the wall on weeknights they let the junior varsity have the ball weve got to talk i said its about the swords he nodded and gave me a quick smile perhaps ill put some pants on first yeah i said sorry i backed out of the room and shut the door the other priest showed up and gave me a gimlet eye a minute later but forthill arrived in time to rescue me dressed in his usual black attire with a white collar its all right paulo he told the other priest ill talk to him father paulo harrumphed and gave me another glare but he turned and left you look terrible forthill said what happened i gave it to him unvarnished merciful god he said when id finished but it wasnt in an oh no tone of voice it was a slower wearier inflection he knew what was going on i cant protect the swords if i dont know what im dealing with i said talk to me anthony forthill shook his head i cant dont give me that i said with quiet heat i need to know im sworn not to speak of it to anyone for any reason he faced me jaw outthrust i keep my promises so youre just going to stand there i snapped and do nothing i didnt say that forthill replied ill do what i can oh sure i said i will he said you have my word youre going to have to trust me that might come easier if youd explain yourself his eyes narrowed son im not a fool dont tell me youve never been behind this particular eight ball before i looked for something appropriately sarcastic and edgy to say in response but all i came up with was touche he ran a hand over his mostly bald scalp and i suddenly saw how much older forthill looked than he had when i met him his hair was even more sparse and brittle looking his hands more weathered with time im sorry harry he said and he sounded sincere if i could is there anything else i could do for you you can hurry i said quietly at the rate were going someone is going to get killed at the rate wed been going probably me i approached the park with intense caution it took me more than half an hour to be reasonably sure that buzz wasnt there somewhere lurking with anothercaliber salutation for me of course he could have been watching from the window of one of the nearby buildingsbut none of them were hotels or apartments and none of the pictures taken in the park had been shot from elevation besides if i avoided every place where a maniac with a highpowered rifle might possibly shoot me id live the rest of my life hiding under my bed still there was no harm in exercising caution rather than walking across the open ground of the park to the softball field i took the circuitous route around the outside of the parkand heard quiet little sobs coming from the shade beneath the bleachers opposite the ones where id sat with michael slowing my steps as i approached i peered under the bleachers a girl in shorts sneakers and a powder blue team jersey was huddled up with her arms wrapped around her knees crying quietly she had stringy red hair and was skinny even for someone her age it took me a minute to recognize her as alicias teammate the second basemperson hey there i said quietly trying to keep my voice gentle you all right the girl looked up her eyes wide and immediately began wiping at her eyes and nose oh oh yes im fine im just fine sir right right next youll tell me youve got allergies i said she looked up at me with a shaky little smile huffed out a breath in the ghost of a laughand it transformed into another sob on her her face twisted up into an agonized grimace she shuddered and wept harder bowing her head i can be such a sucker i ducked down under the bleachers and sat down beside her a couple of feet away the girl cried for a couple more minutes until she began quieting down i know you she said a minute later between sniffles you were talking to coach carpenter yesterday aalicia said you were a friend of the family id like to think so i agreed im harry kelly she said i nodded shouldnt you be practicing with the team kelly she shrugged her skinny shoulders it doesnt help help im hopeless she said whatever it is im doing i just screw it up well thats not true i said with assurance nobody can be bad at everything theres no such thing as a perfect screwup i am she said weve only lost two games all year and both of them were because i screwed up we go to the finals next week and everyones counting on me but im just going to let them down hells bells what a ridiculously tiny problem but it was obvious that it was real to kelly and that it meant the world to her she was just a kid it probably looked like a much larger issue from where she was standing pressure i said yeah i get that she peered at me do you sure i said you feel like peoples lives depend on you and that if you do the wrong thing theyre going to be horribly hurtand it will be your fault yes she said sniffling and ive been trying so hard but i just cant be perfect i asked no of course not but what choice do you have she looked at me uncertainly anything you do you risk screwing up you could do a bad job of crossing the street one day and get hit by a car i probably could she said darkly i held up my hand my point i told her is that if you want to play it safe you can stay at home and wrap yourself up in bubble wrap and never do anything maybe i should i snorted they still make you read dickens in school great expectations yeah you can stay at home and hide if you wantand wind up like miss havisham i said watching life through a window and obsessed with how things might have been dear god she said youve just made dickens relevant to my life weird right i asked her nodding kelly let out a choking little laugh i pushed myself up and nodded to her i never saw you hiding over here okay im just gonna go do what i gotta do and leave you to make the choice choice sure do you want to put your cap back on and play or do you want to wind up an old maid wandering around your house in the rotting remains of a wedding dress and thirty yards of bubble wrap plotting heartlessly against some kid named pip i regarded her soberly theres really no middle ground im pretty sure thats not right she said see there im not much good at offering wise counsel but that didnt stop me from trying i winked at her and walked on around behind the backstop to where michael sat on the bleachers on the far side of the field molly sat on a blanket underneath a tree maybe ten yards away with earbuds trailing wires down into her shirts front pocket as if she were listening to a digital music player it was an effort to blend into the background i supposed since she couldnt have been listening to one of those gizmos any more than i could have she was wearing sunglasses too so i couldnt tell where her focus was but i was sure she was being alert she gave me the barest trace of a nod as i approached her father i sat down next to him and waited for it harry michael said you look awful yes i do i said i told him about the attempted assassination and about my discussion with forthill michael frowned at the children practicing his expression quietly disturbed the church wouldnt do something like that harry it isnt how they operate people are people michael i said people do things they make mistakes but it isnt the church he said if this person is part of the church he isnt acting with their blessing or under their instructions i shrugged maybe maybe not i dont think they were too happy with me when i was a couple of days late turning over the shroud but you did return it safe and sound michael said how many people know about the swords how many knew that i had amoracchius he shook his head im not certain given the sorts of foes they contend with the knowledgeable people within the church are more than mildly secretive and security conscious i gestured around us ballpark it for me he blew out a breath honestly i just dont know ive personally met perhaps two hundred priests who understood our mission but it wouldnt shock me if there were as many as six or seven hundred worldwide but among them that kind of important information would be closely kept four or five at most plus the holy father im going to assume that il papa didnt personally attempt to blow me away i said gravely how do i find out about the others you might talk to father for been there done that he isnt a fountain of exposition michael grimaced i see so other than him he spread his hands i dont know harry forthill was my primary temporal contact i blinked he never talked to you about your support structure in the church he was sworn to secrecy michael said i just had to trust him excuse me he stood up and called to the softball team thank you ladies two laps of the park and well call it a day the team began discarding gloves and such and fell into a line to begin jogging around the exterior of the park in no great hurry talking and laughing as they went i noticed that kelly was among them and felt a little less like a complete incompetent id really like to keep my brains on the inside of my skull i told him when he sat down again and if one of the churchs top guys is leaking information or has sprung a gear they need to know it yes i stared out at the nowempty softball diamond for a minute then i said i dont want to kill anybody but buzz is playing for keeps im not going to pull any punches michael frowned down at his hands harry youre talking about murder what a shock i said after taking one of those monster rounds in the back there must be some way to end this without bloodsh over his shoulder i saw molly abruptly spring to her feet and whip off her sunglasses staring across the park with a puzzled frown on her face then the girls from the team appeared from the direction in which molly had been staring the girls were running as fast as they could screaming as they came coach screamed kelly coach the man took her easy easy michael said rising he put his hands on kellys shoulders as molly came hurrying over easy what are you talking about he came out of the van with one of those electric stunner things kelly babbled through her panting he zapped her and then he put her in the van and drove away molly drew in a sudden breath and almost seemed to turn green michael stared at the girl for a second and then glanced at me his eyes widened in horror alicia he called stepping past kelly and looking wildly around the park alicia he took her sobbed kelly her tears making her face blotchy he took her kelly i said to get her attention what did he look like she shook her head i donti cant white not really tall his hair was cut really short like army haircuts buzz hed threatened michael to get me to bring a sword out in the open where it was vulnerable then hed tried to kill me before i locked it away again and when that failed he tried something else molly michael said quietly take the truck drive sandra and donna home call your mother on the way and tell her whats happened stay at the house but molly began michael turned hard eyes to her and said now yes sir molly said instantly michael tossed her the keys to the truck then he turned to a nearby equipment bag and smoothly withdrew an aluminum bat he whipped it around in a flowing rondello motion nodded as if satisfied and turned to me lets go youre driving okay i said where st marys michael said his tone positively grim im going to talk to forthill forthill had just finished saying evening mass when we showed up father paulo greeted michael like a longlost son and how was he doing and of course we could wait for forthill in his chambers i suspected paulo held deep reservations in regard to me but that was okay i wasnt feeling particularly trusting toward him either wed been waiting in forthills quarters for maybe five minutes when the old priest came in he took one look at michael and got pale talk to me about the order michael said quietly my son forthill said he shook his head you know that i hes taken alicia tony forthills mouth dropped open what hes taken my daughter michael roared his voice shaking the walls i dont care what oaths youve sworn i dont care what the church thinks needs to be kept secret we have to find this man and find him now i blinked at michael and found myself leaning a little away from him the heat of his anger was palpable a living thing that brought its own presence its own gravity into the room forthill faced that anger like an old rock thrusting up stubbornly through a turbulent seaworn and unmoving i will not break my oaths michael not even for you im not asking you to do it for me michael said im asking you to do it for alicia forthill flinched michael he said quietly the order maintains security for a reason its enemies have sought to destroy it for two thousand years and in that time the order has helped hundreds of thousands even millions you know that a breach could put the entire order at riskand that means more than my life or yours or an innocent childs apparently i said i guess youre going to take that suffer the little children to come unto me thing kind of literally eh padre forthill looked from michael to me and then to the floor he took a slow breath and then smoothed his hands over his vestments it never gets any easier does it trying to work out the right thing to do he answered his own question no i suppose its often simpler to determine the proper path than it is to actually walk it forthill rose and walked over to a section of the woodpaneled wall he put his hands at the topright and lowerleft sections of the panel and with a grunt pushed it in it slid aside revealing a space the size of a closet filled with file cabinets and a small bookshelf i traded a glance with michael who raised his eyebrows in surprise he hadnt known about the hideyhole forthill opened a drawer and started thumbing through files the ordo malleus has existed in one form or another since the founding of the church originally we were tasked with the casting out of demons from the possessed but as the church grew it became clear that we needed to be able to counter the threats from other enemies as well other enemies i asked various beings who were masquerading as gods forthill said vampires and other supernatural predators wicked faeries who resented the churchs influence he glanced at me practitioners of witchcraft who turned their hand against the followers of christ hells bells i muttered the inquisition forthill grimaced the inquisition has become the primary reason malleus maintains itself in secrecyand why we very seldom engage in direct action ourselves its all too easy to let power go to your head when youre certain god is on your side the inquisition in many ways attempted to bring our struggle into the lightand because of the situation it helped create more innocent men and women died than throughout centuries of the most savage supernatural depredation we support the knights of the cross and do whatever we can to counsel and protect gods children against supernatural threatsthe way we protected the girl you brought to me the year michaels youngest was born now the order recruits people singly after years of personal observation and maintains the highest levels of personal ethical integrity humanly possible he turned to us with a file folder in his hands but as you pointed out earlier harry were only human i took the folder from him opened it and found buzzs picture i recognized the short haircut and the severe lines of his chin and jaw his eyes were new to me though they were as grey as stone but less warm and fuzzy father roarke douglas i read age fortythree five eleven one hundred eightyfive sniper for the rangers trained in demolitions us army chaplain parish priest in guatemala indonesia and rwanda good lord preserve us michael said yeah a real holy warrior i said i eyed forthill and this guy was brought in ive met roarke on several occasions forthill said i was always impressed with his reserve and calm in the face of crisis he repeatedly distinguished himself by acts of courage in protecting his parishioners in some of the most dangerous locations in the world he shook his head but he changed in the last few years changed michael said how he became a strong advocate for preemptive intervention he wanted to hit back first eh i asked you wouldnt say that if youd seen what life can be like in some of the places father douglas has lived forthill said its not so simple it never is i said he was in particular an admirer of shiros forthill continued when shiro died he was devastated they had worked together several times the way you worked with michael i said forthill nodded roarke was not satisfied with the disposition of fidelacchius he made it known to the rest of malleus too as time went by he became increasingly frustrated that the sword was not being put to use i could see where this one was going and then i got hold of amoracchius too forthill nodded he spent the last year trying to convince the senior members of malleus that we had been deceived that you were in fact an agent of an enemy power who had taken the swords so they could not be used and no one thought to mention the way those archangels gave orders that i was supposed to hold them they never appear to more than one or two people at a timeand you are a wizard harry forthill said father douglas hypothesized that you had created an illusion to serve your purpose or else had tampered directly with our minds and now hes on a crusade i muttered forthill nodded so it would seem i kept on reading the file hes versed in magicwell enough at least to be smart about how he deals with me contacts in various supernatural communities like the venatori umbrorum which probably explains that protective amulet i shook my head and he thinks hes saving the world the guys a certifiable nightmare where is he michael asked quietly he could be anywhere forthill replied malleus sets up caches of equipment money and so forth he could have tapped into any one of them i tried his cell phone hes not returning my calls he thinks youve been mindscrambled by the enemy i muttered what did you expect to accomplish i had hoped forthill said gently that i might ask him to be patient and have faith im pretty sure this guy believes in faith through superior firepower i closed the file and passed it back to forthill he tried to kill me he abducted alicia as far as im concerned hes off the reservation forthills expression became distressed as he looked at me he turned to michael beseeching michaels face was bleak and unyielding and quiet heat smoldered in his eyes the son of a bitch hurt my little girl i rocked a step backward at the profanity so did forthill the room settled into an oppressive silence the old priest cleared his throat after a moment he put the file back in the cabinet and closed the door ive told you what i know he said im only sorry i cant do more you can find her cant you michael asked me the way you found molly sure i said but hes bound to be expecting that magic isnt a cureall but you can find her i shrugged he cant stop me from finding her but he can damn well make sure that something happens to her if i do michael frowned what do you mean maybe he stashes her in a box thats being held fifty feet above the ground with an electromagnet so that when i get close with an active spell up and running it shorts out and she falls the bastard is smart and creative michaels knuckles popped as his hands closed into fists besides i said we dont need to find him no no i said weve got the swords hes got the girl i turned to go hes going to find us father douglas called michaels house later that night and asked for me i took the call in michaels office you know what i want he said without preamble obviously i said what do you have in mind bring the swords he said give them to me if you do so without attempting any tricks or deceptions i will release the girl to you unharmed if you involve the police or attempt anything foolish she will die how do i know you havent killed her already the phone rustled and then alicia said hharry im okay hhe hasnt hurt me nor do i want to father douglas said taking the phone back satisfied can i ask you something i said why are you doing this i am doing gods work okay that doesnt sound too crazy or anything i said if youre so tight with god can you really expect me to believe that youll be willing to murder a teenage girl the world needs the swords he replied in a level calm voice they are more important than any one person and while i would never forgive myself yes i will kill her im just trying to get you to see the fallacious logic youre using here i said see if im such a bad guy to have stolen the swords then why would i give a damn whether or not you murder some kid you dont have to be evil to be ambitiousor wrong you dont want to see the girl harmed give me the swords and she wont be there clearly wasnt going to be any profitable discussion of the situation here father douglas was going to have his way regardless of the impediments of trivial things like rationality where i asked he gave me an address the roof you come to the east side of the building you show me the swords then you come up and make the exchange no staff no rod just you when one hour he said and hung up i put the phone down looked at michael and said we dont have much time the building in question stood at the corner of monroe and michigan overlooking millennium park i had to park a couple of blocks away and walk in with both swords stowed in a big gym bag father douglas hadnt specified where i was supposed to stand and show him the swords but the streetlights adjacent to the building were all inexplicably dark except for one i ambled over to the pool of light it cast down onto the sidewalk opened the bag and held out both swords it was hard to see past the light but i thought i saw a gleam on the roof binoculars a few seconds later a red light flashed twice from the same spot where id thought i had seen something this would be the place then id brought my extremely illegal picklocks with me but as it turned out i didnt need to use them father douglas had already circumvented the locks and presumably the security system the front door was open as was the door to the stairwell from there it was just one long thighburning hike up to the roof i emerged into cold strong wind you get up twenty stories or so and you run into that a lot it ripped at my duster and set it to flapping like a flag i peered around the roof at spinning heat pumps and ac units and various antennae but saw no one the beam of a handheld floodlight hit me and i whirled in place the light was coming from the roof of the building next to mine father douglas flipped it off and after blinking a few times i could see him clearly standing in the wind in priestly black his white collar almost luminous in the ambient light of the city his grey eyes were shadowed and he was maybe a day and a half past time to shave at his feet on the rooftop lay a long plank which he must have used to cross from this rooftop to the next alicia blindfolded and with a gag in her mouth sat in a chair next to him her wrists bound to its arms father douglas lifted a megaphone thats far enough he said i could hear him over the heavy wind thats detcord shes tied up with do you know what that is yeah he held up his other hand this is the detonator as long as its sending a signal shes fine its a deadman switch if i drop it or let it go the signal stops and the cord goes off if the receiver gets damaged and stops receiving the signal the cord goes off if you start using magic and destroy one of the devices it goes off thats way better than the electromagnet thing i muttered to myself i raised my voice and bellowed so how do you want to do this throw them disarm the explosives first no the girl stays where she is once im gone ill send the code to disarm the device i considered the distance it was a good fifteenfoot jump to get from one rooftop to the otheran easy throw douglas i shouted think about this for a minute the swords arent just sharp and shiny theyre symbols if you take one up for the wrong reasons you could destroy it believe me i know the swords are meant for better things than to molder in a dingy basement he replied he held up the detonator surrender them now i stared at him for a long second then i tossed the entire bag over it landed at his feet with a clatter he bent down to open it i steeled myself this was about to get dicey i hadnt counted on the deadman switch or a fifteenfootlong jump father douglas opened the bag the smoke grenade michael had rigged inside it in his workshop went off with a heavy thud white smoke billowed back into his face i took three quick steps and hurled myself into the air for an awful portion of a second twenty stories of open gravity yawned beneath me and then i hit the edge of the other roof and collided with father douglas we went down together i couldnt think about anything but the detonator and i clamped down on that with my left hand crushing his fingers beneath mine so that he couldnt release it he jabbed his thumb at my right eye but i ducked my head and he got nothing but bone he slammed his head against my noseagain with the nose hells bells that hurtand drove a knee into my groin i let him seizing his arm with both hands now squeezing trying to choke off the blood to his hand to weaken it so i could take the detonator from him his left fist slammed into my temple my mouth and my neck i bent my head down and bit savagely at his wrist eliciting a scream of pain from him i slammed my weight against him slipping some fingers into his grasp and got one of them over the pressure trigger then i wrenched with my whole body twisting my shoulders and hips for leverage and ripped the detonator away from him he rolled away from me instantly and seized the bag then he was up and running for a doorway leading down into the building i let him go and rushed over to alicia the darkhaired girl was trembling uncontrollably detcord is basically a long rubber tube filled with explosive compound its a little thicker than a pencil flexible and generally set off by an electrical charge wrap detcord around a concrete column and set it off and the explosion will cut through it like a piece of dry bamboo alicia was tied to the chair with it if it went off it would cut her to pieces the detonator was a simple setupa black plastic box hooked to a twelvevolt battery which was in turn connected to a wire leading to the detcord a green light on the detonator glowed cheerily it matched a cheery green light on the deadman switch transmitter in my hand if what douglas had said was accurate and the light went out things wouldnt be nearly so cheery if i let go of the switch it would stop the signal to the detonator which would then complete the circuit send current to the detcord and boom in theory i should be able to cut the wire leading from the battery and render it harmlessas long as douglas hadnt rigged the device to detonate if that happened i didnt have much time the electronics of the transmitter wouldnt last long around me even though i hadnt used any magic around them i had to get the girl out now i made the call based upon what i knew about father douglas he seemed like he might have good intentions despite all his shenanigans so i gambled that he wouldnt want the girl to die by any means other than a conscious decision from someoneeither him letting go of the trigger or me blowing the transmitter by using magic i took out my pocketknife opened it with my teeth and slashed at the heavy plastic tubing that held her tied down i cut through the tube once unwound it from first one arm then the other and she was free she clawed away the blindfold and gag her fingers still clumsy from being bound come on i said i grabbed her arm and hauled her out of the chair and away from the explosives she staggered leaning against me and i ran for the stairs as we got to the first landing my ongoing presence apparently became too much for the transmitter something sparked and crackled inside the plastic case the cheery green light went out and there was a huge and horrible sound from above and behind us i managed to get between alicia and the stairwell wall as the pressure wave caught us and threw us into it it slammed my alreadyabused head into the wall i staggered under the pain for a minute and forced my way through it like a drowning man clawing for the surface come on i croaked to alicia come on we have to go she looked at me with dull stunned eyes so i just grabbed her hand and started down the stairs with her stuffing the heavy transmitter into my duster pocket with the other hand we had only a few minutes before the place would be swarming with police and firefighters i didnt particularly feel like answering their questions about why my fingerprints were on an expensive transmitter and showed trace evidence of explosive residue going down all those stairs was only slightly less taxing than going up had been and my legs were going to be complaining at me for days we got to the bottom and i led alicia out into an alley then out to monroe i looked wildly up and down the street michaels truck was there waiting right where it was supposed to be out in front of the original building i put my fingers to my lips and let out a shrill whistle michaels truck pulled into the street and stopped in front of us i hurried alicia forward the door swung open and molly leaned out taking alicias hand and pulling her in i went in right behind her though it made things awfully cozy in the pickups cab hes loose with the swords i said did you do it did it molly replied and promptly handed me a dashboard compass with one of her own golden hairs stuck to it with clear tape the needle pointed firmly to the east instead of to the north the grasshopper had set up a basic tracking spell one of the handier tricks i know hes probably moving on foot through the park i told michael circle around to lakeshore get us in front of him are you all right baby michael asked alicia fumbled for his hand and squeezed it tight then she leaned against molly and started crying hurry i told michael hes got to know weve bugged the swords somehow if he finds those hairs molly tied onto the hilts were done he wont get away michael said with perfect confidence and slammed the accelerator down as we approached an intersection sporting a bright red light maybe it was divine intervention or fate or just good driving but the truck shot through the intersection missing two other cars by inches and sailed on forward the needle on the compass pointed steadily toward the park as we went but then abruptly began to traverse from one side to the other i looked up ahead of me and saw a dark form sprinting across the road that separated the park from lake michigan there i shouted pointing there he is michael pulled over to the side of the road and i hit the ground before the truck had stopped moving sprinting after father douglas he was in good shape covering the ground in long loping strides normally it wouldnt have been a contest to catch him i run three or four days a week to train for situations exactly like this one of course when i practice im not generally concussed weary and sporting a recently dislocated shoulder douglas was holding his lead as we sprinted down the beach and i was tiring more rapidly than i should have so i cheated i reached into my pocket drew out the heavy transmitter and flung it at him as hard as i could the black plastic device struck him on the back of the head shattering and sending several heavy batteries flying father douglas staggered and couldnt keep his balance at the pace he was moving he went down in the sand i rushed over to him and seized the bag with the swords only to have him sweep one leg out in a martial arts move then kick my legs out from beneath me i went down too father douglas ripped at the bag but i clung grimly while we fought and kicked at each otheruntil the bag tore open under the strain and spilled the swords onto the sand he seized the hilt of fidelacchius a katanatype sword that was built to look like a simple heavy walking stick until you drew the blade i seized amoracchius scabbard and all and barely brought the sheathed broadsword up in time to deflect a sweeping slash from father douglas he gained his knees and swung again and i had all i could do to lift the sheathed sword and fend off the strike blow after blow rained down on me and there was no time to call upon my power no opportunity to so much as rise to my knees until a sizefourteen work boot hit father douglas in the chest and threw him back michael stood over me an aluminum baseball bat in his right hand he put out his other hand and i slapped amoracchius into it he gripped it midblade like some kind of giant crucifix and with his bat held in a guard position limped toward father douglas the priest stared at michael with wide eyes stay back he said i dont want to hurt you who says youre able to michael rumbled put down the sword and ill let you go douglas stared at him with those cold grey eyes i cant do that then ill put you down and take the sword anyway its over roarke you just dont realize it yet father douglas wasted no more time on talk but came at michael the katana whirling michael batted no pun intended the attack aside like a cat swatting down moths the baseball bat spinning slow he said too slow to hit a halfblind cripple you dont know the first thing about what it means to bear a sword douglas snarled and came at him again michael defeated this attack too with contemptuous ease and followed it by smacking douglas across one cheek with the hilt of the sheathed sword it means sacrifice michael said as douglas reeled it means forgetting about yourself and what you want it means putting your faith in the lord god almighty he swung a pair of blows which douglas defended against barelybut the third a straight thrust with the baseball bats tip drove home into his solar plexus douglas staggered to one knee you abandoned your duty douglas gasped the world grows darker by the day people cry out for our helpand you would have the swords sit with this creature of witchcraft and deceit you arrogant child michael snarled the almighty himself has made his will known if you are a man of faith then you must abide by it you have been lied to douglas said how could god ignore his people when they need his protection so badly that is not for us to know michael shouted dont you see you fool we are only men we see only in one place at one time the lord knows all that might be would you presume to say that you know better than our god what should be done with the swords douglas stared at michael are you stupid enough to believe that he would want you to cast aside your beliefs to impose your will upon the world do you think he wants you to murder decent men and abduct innocent children the bat struck fidelacchius from douglass hands and michael followed it with a pair of crushing blows one to the shoulder and one to the knee douglas went down to the sand in a heap look at yourself michael said his words hard and merciless look at what you have done in gods name look at the bruises on my daughters arms at the blood on my friends face and then tell me which of us has been deceived again the bat swept down and douglas fell senseless to the sand michael stood over the man for a moment his entire body shaking the bat still upraised michael i said quietly he hurt my little girl harry his voice shook with barely repressed rage he isnt going to hurt her now i said he hurt my little girl michael i said gently you cant if this is how it has to be ill do it but you cant man his eyes shifted back toward me for just a second easy easy i told him were done here were done he stared for another long silent moment then he lowered the bat very slowly and bowed his head he stood there for a minute his chest heaving and then dropped the bat he settled down onto the sand with a wince i got up and collected fidelacchius returning it to its sheath thank you michael said quietly he offered me amoracchius hilt are you sure i asked he nodded smiling wearily yes i took the sword and looked at douglas what do we do with him michael stared at him silently for a moment in the background we could hear emergency vehicles arriving to attend to the aftermath of the rooftop explosion well bring him with us michael said the church will deal with its own i sat in the chapel balcony at st marys staring down at the church below me and brooding michael and forthill had been seeing to father douglas who wasnt going anywhere under his own locomotion for a while they had him in a bed somewhere it had hurt to watch michael moving in what was obviously great pain hobble around the room helping to make douglas feel better id have been content to dump the asshole in an alley somewhere and leave him to his fate which might just possibly be one reason i was never going to be a knight i had also swiped forthills flask of scotch from his room and it was keeping me company in the balconytwo more reasons i was never going to be a knight right at the end there i said to no one in particular those two started speaking a different language i mean i understood all the words and i understood the passion behind them but i dont get how they connect you know i sipped some more scotch come to think of it there are a lot of things i dont get about this whole situation and you want an explanation of some kind asked a man seated in the pew beside me i just about jumped out of my skin he was an older man he had dark skin and silverwhite hair and he wore a workmans blue jumpsuit like you often see on janitors the name tag read jake you i breathed youre the archangel youre uriel he shrugged the gesture carried acknowledgment somehow what are you doing here i askedmaybe a bit blearily i was concussed and half the flask was gone perhaps im a hallucination brought on by head trauma and alcohol he said oh i said i peered at him and then offered him the flask want a belt very kind he said and took a swig from the flask he passed it back to me i dont exactly make it a habit to do this but if youve got questions ask them okay i said why did you guys let michael get so screwed up we didnt let him do anything jake replied calmly he chose to hazard himself in battle against the enemy the enemy chose to shoot him and where to point the gun and when to pull the trigger he survived the experience so in other words god was doing nothing to help jake smiled wouldnt say that but you got to understand son god isnt about making good things happen to you or bad things happen to you hes all about you making choicesexercising the gift of free will god wants you to have good things and a good life but he wont gift wrap them for you you have to choose the actions that lead you to that life free will huh yes for example your free will on that island i eyed him and sipped more scotch you saw the valkyrie staring at michael you thought he was in danger so even though it was your turn you sent him up to the helicopter in your place no good deed goes unpunished i said with one too many sh sounds thats where he got hurt jake shrugged but if you hadnt youd have died in that harness and hed have died on that island i scowled what jake waved a hand i wont bore you with details but suffice to say that your choice in that moment changed everything but you lost a knight i said a warrior jake smiled did we he can barely walk without that cane sure he handled douglas but thats a far cry from dealing with a denarian ah jake said you mean warrior in the literal sense what other kind of warrior is there i asked the important kind i frowned again harry jake said sighing the conflict between light and darkness rages on so many levels that you literally could not understand it all not yet anyway sometimes that battlefield is a literal one sometimes its a great deal more nebulous and metaphorical but michael and i are literal guys i said jake actually laughed yeah do you think we angled to have you brought into this situation because we needed you to beat someone up well generally speaking yeah i gestured with the flask pretty much all we did was beat up this guy who had good intentions and who was desperate to do something to help jake shook his head the real war happened when you werent looking huh courtney jake said the little girl who almost got hit by a car what about her i asked you saved her life he said moreover you noted the bruise on her cheekone she acquired from her abusive father your presence heightened her mothers response to the realization that her daughter was being abused she moved out the next morning he spread his hands in that moment you saved the childs life prevented her mother from alcohol addiction in response to the loss and shattered a generational cycle of abuse more than three hundred years old i um chuck the electrician jake continued he was drunk because hed been fighting with his wife two months from now their fouryearold daughter is going to be diagnosed with cancer and require a marrow transplant her father is the only viable donor you saved his life with what you didand his daughters life too and the struggle that family is going to face together is going to leave them stronger and happier than theyve ever been i grunted that smells an awful lot like predestination to me what if those people choose something different its a complex issue jake admitted but think of the course of the future as oh flowing water if you know the lay of the land you can make a good guess where its going now someone can always come along and dig a ditch and change that flow of waterbut honestly youd be shocked how seldom people truly choose to exercise their will within their lives i grunted what about second baseperson kelly i saved her life too no but you made a young woman feel better in a moment where she felt as though she didnt have anyone she could talk to just a few kind words but its going to make her think about the difference those words made shes got a good chance of winding up as a counselor to her fellow man the five minutes of kindness you showed her is going to help thousands of others he spread his hands and that only takes into account the past day despair and pain were averted loss and tragedy thwarted do you think you havent struck a blow for the light warrior um and last but not least lets not forget michael he said hes a good man but where his children are involved he can be completely irrational he was a hairbreadth from losing control when he stood over douglas on the beach your words your presence your will helped him to choose mercy over vengeance i just stared at him for a moment but i didnt actually mean to do any of that he smiled but you chose the actions that led to it no one forced you to do it and to those people what you did saved them from danger as real as any creature of the night he turned to look down at the church below and pursed his lips people have far more power than they realize if they would only choose to use it michael might not be cutting demons with a sword anymore harry but dont think for a second that he isnt still fighting the good fight its just harder for you to see the results from down here i swigged more scotch thinking about that hes happier now i said his family too funny how making good choices leads to that what about father douglas i asked whats going to happen for the most part jake said that will be up to him hopefully hell choose to accept his errors and change his life for the better i nodded slowly then i said lets talk about my bill jakes eyebrows shot up what my bill i said enunciating you dragged me into this mess you can pay me same as any other client where do i send the invoice youre youre trying to bill the lord god almighty jake said as if he couldnt quite believe it heluh heck no i said im billing you that isnt really how we work it is if you want to work with me i told him thrusting out my jaw cough up otherwise maybe next time ill just stand around whistling when you want me to help you out jakes face broadened into a wide merry grin and laughter filled his voice no you wont he said and vanished i scowled ferociously at the empty space where hed been a moment before cheapskate i muttered but i was pretty sure he was right last call from strange brew edited by p n elrod takes place between small favor and turn coat having already written a meadthemed short story i wasnt quite sure what to do with this one but hey it was pat elrod asking me and ive never been good at saying no and i decided to tread upon what is very nearly holy ground in the dresden filesthe forces of darkness were going to violate macs beer naturally harry gets to respond just as many readers would oh snap this was a fairly lighthearted piece for me anyway and i tried to carry the same sense of energy and pace through this story that you get from the really good monster of the week episodes of the xfiles ill have to make it up to mac sometime all i wanted was a quiet beer that isnt too much to ask is itone contemplative drink at the end of a hard day of professional wizarding maybe a steak sandwich to go with it you wouldnt think so but somebody or maybe somebody disagreed with me mcanallys pub is a quiet little hole in the wall like a hundred others in chicago in the basement of a large office building you have to go down a few stairs to get to the door when you get inside youre at eye level with the creaky old ceiling fans in the rest of the place and you have to take a couple of more steps down from the entryway to get to the pubs floor its lit mostly by candles the finish work is all handcarved richly polished wood stained a deeper brown than most would use and combined with the candles it feels cozily cavelike i opened the door to the place and got hit in the face with something id never smelled in macs pub beforethe odor of food being burned it should say something about macs cooking that my first instinct was to make sure the shield bracelet on my left arm was ready to go as i drew the blasting rod from inside my coat i took careful steps forward into the pub blasting rod held up and ready the usual lighting was dimmed and only a handful of candles still glimmered the regular crowd at macs members of the supernatural community of chicago were strewn about like broken dolls half a dozen people lay on the floor limbs sprawled oddly as if theyd dropped unconscious in the middle of calisthenics a pair of older guys who were always playing chess at a table in the corner lay slumped across the table pieces were spread everywhere around them some of them broken and the old chess clock they used had been smashed to bits three young women who had watched too many episodes of charmed and who always showed up at macs together were unconscious in a pile in the corner as if theyd been huddled there in terror before they collapsedbut they were spattered with droplets of what looked like blood i could see several of the fallen breathing at least i waited for a long moment but nothing jumped at me from the darkness and i felt no sudden desire to start breaking things and then take a nap mac i called quietly someone grunted i hurried over to the bar and found mac on the floor beside it hed been badly beaten his lips were split and puffy his nose had been broken both his hands were swollen and purpledefensive wounds probably the baseball bat he kept behind the bar was lying next to him smeared with bloodprobably his own stars and stones i breathed mac i knelt down next to him examining him for injuries as best i could i didnt have any formal medical training but several years service in the wardens in a war with the vampires of the red court had shown me more than my fair share of injuries i didnt like the look of one of the bruises on his head and hed broken several fingers but i didnt think it was anything he wouldnt recover from what happened i asked him went nuts he slurred one of his cut lips reopened and fresh blood appeared violent i winced no kidding i grabbed a clean cloth from the stack on the shelf behind the bar and ran cold water over it i tried to clean some of the mess off his face theyre all down i told him as i did alive its your place how do you want to play it even through as much pain as he was in mac took a moment to consider before answering murphy he said finally id figured calling in the authorities would mean a lot of questions and attention but it also meant everyone would get medical treatment sooner mac tended to put the customer first but if hed wanted to keep it under the radar i would have understood that too ill make the call i told him the authorities swooped down on the place with vigor it was early in the evening and we were evidently the first customers for the night shift emts jesus sergeant karrin murphy said from the doorway looking around the interior of macs place what a mess tell me about it i said glumly my stomach was rumbling and i was thirsty besides but it just didnt seem right to help myself to any of macs stuff while he was busy getting patched up by the ambulance guys murphy blew out a breath well brawls in bars arent exactly uncommon she came down into the room removed a flashlight from her jacket pocket and shone it around but maybe youll tell me what really happened mac said his customers went nuts they started acting erratic and then became violent what all of them at the same time that was the impression he gave me he wasnt overly coherent murphy frowned and slowly paced the room sweeping the light back and forth methodically you get a look at the customers there wasnt anything actively affecting them when i got here i said im sure of that they were all unconscious minor wounds looked like they were mostly selfinflicted i think those girls were the ones to beat mac murphy winced you think he wouldnt defend himself against them he could have pulled a gun instead he had his bat out he was probably trying to stop someone from doing something stupid and it went bad you know what im thinking murphy asked when something odd happens to everyone in a pub she had stopped at the back corner among the remnants of broken chessmen and scattered chairs the circle of illumination cast by her flashlight had come to rest on a pair of dark brown beer bottles ugly thought i said macs beer in the service of darkness she gave me a level look well as level a look as you can give when youre a fivefoot blonde with a perky nose glaring at a gangly wizard most of seven feet tall im serious harry could it have been something in the beer drugs a poison something from your end of things i leaned on the bar and chewed that thought over for a moment oh sure technically it could have been any of those a number of drugs could cause psychotic behavior though admittedly it might be hard to get that reaction in everyone in the bar at more or less the same time poisons were just drugs that happened to kill you or the reverse and if those people had been poisoned they might still be in a lot of danger and once you got to the magical side of things any one of a dozen methods could have been used to get to the people through the beer theyd imbibedbut all of them would require someone with access to the beer to pull it off and mac made his own brew in fact he bottled it himself it wasnt necessarily the beer i said you think they all got the same steak sandwich the same batch of curly fries she shook her head come on dresden the food here is good but that isnt what gets them in the door mac wouldnt hurt anybody i said quietly really murph asked her voice quiet and steady youre sure about that how well do you really know the man i glanced around the bar slowly whats his first name harry dammit murph i sighed you cant go around being suspicious of everyone all the time sure i can she gave me a faint smile its my job harry i have to look at things dispassionately its nothing personal you know that yeah i muttered i know that but i also know what its like to be dispassionately suspected of something you didnt do it sucks she held up her hands then lets figure out what did happen ill go talk to the principals see if anyone remembers anything you take a look at the beer yeah i said okay after bottling it mac transports his beer in wooden boxes like old apple crates only more heavyduty they arent magical or anything theyre just sturdy as hell and they stack up neatly i came through the door of my apartment with a box of samples and braced myself against the impact of mister my tomcat who generally declares a suicide charge on my shins the minute i come through the door mister is huge and most of his mass is muscle i rocked at the impact and the bottles rattled but i took it in stride mouse my big shaggy dogosaurus was lying full on his side by the fireplace napping he looked up and thumped his tail on the ground once then went back to sleep no work ethic around here at all but then he hadnt been cheated out of his wellearned beer i took the box straight down the stepladder to my lab calling hi molly as i went down molly my apprentice sat at her little desk working on a pair of potions she had maybe five square feet of space to work with in my cluttered lab but she managed to keep the potions clean and neat and still had room left over for her latin textbook her notebook and a can of pepsi the heathen mollys hair was kryptonite green today with silver tips and she was wearing cutoff jeans and a tight blue tshirt with a superman logo on the front she was a knockout hiya harry she said absently outfits a little cold for march isnt it if it were youd be staring at my chest a lot harder she said smirking a little she glanced up and it bloomed into a full smile hey beer youre young and innocent i said firmly setting the box down on a shelf no beer for you youre living in denial she replied and rose to pick up a bottle of course she did id told her not to i watched her carefully the kids my apprentice but shes got a knack for the finer aspects of magic shed be in real trouble if she had to blast her way out of a situation but when it comes to the cobwebfine enchantments shes a couple of lengths ahead of me and pulling away fastand i figured this had to be subtle work she frowned almost the second she touched the bottle thats odd she gave me a questioning look and i gestured at the box she ran her fingertips over each bottle in turn theres energy there what is it harry i had a good idea of what the beer had done to its drinkersbut it just didnt make sense i wasnt about to tell her that though it would be very antiobiwan of me you tell me i said smiling slightly she narrowed her eyes at me and turned back to her potions muttering over them for a few moments and then easing them down to a low simmer she came back to the bottles and opened one sniffing at it and frowning some more no taste testing i told her it isnt pretty i wouldnt think so she replied in the same tone shed used while working on her latin its laced with some kind of contagion focus i think i nodded she was talking about magical contagion not the medical kind a contagion focus was something that formed a link between a smaller amount of its mass after it had been separated from the main body a practitioner could use it to send magic into the main body and by extension into all the smaller foci even if they werent in the same physical place it was sort of like planting a transmitter on someones car so that you could send a missile at it later can you tell what kind of working its been set up to support i asked her she frowned she had a pretty frown give me a minute ticktock i said she waved a hand at me without looking up i folded my arms and waited i gave her tests like this one all the timeand there was always a time limit in my experience the solutions you need the most badly are always timecritical im trying to train the grasshopper for the real world here was one of her first realworld problems but she didnt have to know that so long as she thought it was just one more test shed tear into it without hesitation i saw no reason to rattle her confidence she muttered to herself she poured some of the beer out into the beaker and held it up to the light from a specially prepared candle she scrawled power calculations on a notebook and twenty minutes later she said hah tricky but not tricky enough oh i said no need to be coy boss she said the contagion looks like a simple compulsion meant to make the victim drink more but its really a psychic conduit i leaned forward seriously molly stared blankly at me for a moment then she blinked and said you didnt know i found the compulsion but it was masking anything else that had been laid on the beer i picked up the halfempty bottle and shook my head i brought it here because youve got a better touch for this kind of thing than i do it would have taken me hours to puzzle it out good work but you didnt tell me this was for real she shook her head dazedly harry what if i hadnt found it what if id been wrong dont get ahead of yourself grasshopper i said turning for the stairs you still might be wrong theyd taken mac to stroger and he looked like hell i had to lie to the nurse to get in to talk to him flashing my consultants id badge and making like i was working with the chicago cops on the case mac i said coming to sit down on the chair next to his bed how are you feeling he looked at me with the eye that wasnt swollen shut yeah they said you wouldnt accept any painkillers he moved his head in a slight nod i laid out what id found it was elegant work mac more intricate than anything ive done his teeth made noise as they ground together he understood what two complex interwoven enchantments meant as well as i dida serious player was involved find him mac growled the words slurring a little any idea where i could start i asked him he was quiet for a moment then shook his head caine i lifted my eyebrows that thug from night of the living brews hes been around he grunted last night closing he closed his eyes loudmouth i stood up and put a hand on his shoulder rest ill chat him up mac exhaled slowly maybe unconscious before id gotten done speaking i found murphy down the hall three of them are awake she said none of them remember anything for several hours before they presumably went to the bar i grimaced i was afraid of that i told her what id learned a psychic conduit murphy asked whats that its like any electrical power line i said except it plugs into your mindand whoever is on the other end gets to decide what goes in murphy went a little pale shed been on the receiving end of a couple of different kinds of psychic assault and it had left some marks so do what you do put the whammy on them and lets track them down i grimaced and shook my head i dont dare i told her all ive got to track with is the beer itself if i try to use it in a spell itll open me up to the conduit itll be as if i drank the stuff murphy folded her arms and if that happens you wont remember anything you learn anyway like i said i told her its highquality work but ive got a name a perp im sure hes guilty of something his names caine hes a con big dumb violent and thinks hes a brewer she arched an eyebrow you got a history with this guy ran over him during a case maybe a year ago i said it got ugly more for him than me he doesnt like mac much hes a wizard hells bells no i said then how does he figure in lets ask him murphy made short work of running down an address for herbert orson caine mugger rapist and extortionista cheap apartment building on the south end of bucktown murphy knocked at the door but we didnt get an answer its a good thing hes a con she said reaching for her cell phone i can probably get a warrant without too much trouble with what i asked her suggestive evidence of the use of black magic tampering with drinks at a bar doesnt require the use of magic murphy said hes a rapist and he isnt part of the outfit so he doesnt have an expensive lawyer to raise a stink howsabout we save the good people of chicago time and money and just take a look around breaking and entering i wont break anything i promised ill do all the entering too no she said but she looked up at me her jaw set stubbornly no harry i sighed these guys arent playing by the rules we dont know hes involved yet im not cutting corners for someone who might not even be connected i was partway into a snarky reply when caine opened the door from the stairwell and entered the hallway he spotted us and froze then he turned and started walking away caine murphy called chicago pd he bolted murph and i had both been expecting that evidently we both rushed him he slammed the door open but id been waiting for that too i sent out a burst of my will drawing my right hand in toward my chest as i shouted forzare invisible force slammed the door shut as caine began to go through it it hit him hard enough to bounce him all the way back across the hall into the wall opposite murphy had better acceleration than i did she caught up to caine in time for him to swing one paw at her in a looping punch i almost felt sorry for the slob murphy ducked the punch then came up with all of her weight and the muscle of her legs and body behind her response she struck the tip of his chin with the heel of her hand snapping his face straight up caine was brawny big and tough he came back from the blow with a dazed snarl and swatted at murphy again murph caught his arm tugged him a little one way a little the other and using his own arm as a fulcrum sent him flipping forward and down hard onto the floor he landed hard enough to make the floorboards shake and murphy promptly shifted her grip twisting one hand into a painful angle holding his arm out straight using her leg to pin it into position that would be assault murphy said in a sweet voice and on a police officer in the course of an investigation no less bitch caine said im gonna break your we didnt get to find out what he was going to break because murphy shifted her body weight maybe a couple of inches and he screamed instead whaddayou want caine demanded lemme go i didnt do nothin sure you did i said cheerfully you assaulted sergeant murphy here i saw it with my own eyes youre a twotime loser caine murphy said this will make it number three by the time you get out the first thing youll need to buy will be a new set of teeth caine said a lot of impolite words wow i said coming to stand over him that sucks if only there were some way he could be of help to the community you know prove how he isnt a waste of space some other person could be using screw you caine said i aint helping you with nothing murphy leaned into his arm a little again to shut him up what happened to the beer at mcanallys she asked in a polite tone caine said even more impolite words im pretty sure that wasnt it murphy said im pretty sure you can do better bite me cop bitch caine muttered sergeant bitch murphy said have it your way bonehead bet youve got all kinds of fans back at stateville but she was frowning when she said it thugs like caine rolled over when they were facing hard time they didnt risk losing the rest of their adult lives out of simple contrarinessunless they were terrified of the alternative someone or dare i say it something had caine scared well that table could seat more than one player the thug had a little blood coming from the corner of his mouth he must have bitten his tongue when murphy hit him i pulled a white handkerchief out of my pocket and in a single swooping motion stooped down and smeared some blood from caines mouth onto it what the hell he said or something close to it what are you doing dont worry about it caine i told him it isnt going to be a longterm problem for you i took the cloth and walked a few feet away then i hunkered down and used a piece of chalk from another pocket to draw a circle around me on the floor caine struggled feebly against murphy but she put him down again sit still she snapped ill pull your shoulder right out of its socket feel free i told murphy he isnt going to be around long enough to worry about it i squinted up at caine and said beefy little bit of a gut bet you eat a lot of greasy food huh caine whwhat he said what are you doing heart attack should look pretty natural i said murph get ready to back off once he starts thrashing i closed the circle and let it sparkle a little as i did it was a waste of energyspecial effects like that almost always arebut it made an impression on caine jesus christ caine said wait cant wait i told him gotta make this go before the blood dries out quit being such a baby caine she gave you a chance i raised my hand over the fresh blood on the cloth lets see now i cant talk caine yelped if i talk shell know murphy gave his arm a little twist who she demanded i cant jesus i swear dresden dontit isnt my fault they needed bloodstone and i had the only stuff in town that was pure enough i just wanted to wipe that smile off that bastards face i looked up at caine with a gimlet eye my teeth bared you aint saying anything that makes me want you to keep on breathing i cant caine wailed shell know i fixed my stare on caine and raised my hand in a slow heavily overdramatized gesture intimidatus dorkus maximus i intoned making my voice intentionally hollow and harsh and stressing the long vowels decker caine screamed decker he set up the deal i lowered my hand and let my head rock back decker i said that twit murphy watched me and didnt let go of caine though i could tell she didnt want to keep holding him i shook my head at murphy and said let him scamper murph she let him go and caine fled for the stairs on his hands and knees sobbing he staggered out falling down the first flight from the sound of it i wrinkled up my nose as the smell of urine hit me ah the aroma of truth murphy rubbed her hands on her jeans as if trying to wipe off something greasy jesus harry what i said you didnt want to break into his place i didnt want you to put a gun to his head either she shook her head you couldnt really have killed him i asked i broke the circle and rose yeah with him right here in sight yeah i probably could have she shivered jesus christ i wouldnt i said i went to her and put a hand on her arm i wouldnt karrin you know that she looked up at me her expression impossible to read you put on a really good act harry it would have fooled a lot of people it looked natural on me i said yeah she touched my hand briefly with hers so i guess we got something i shook off dark thoughts and nodded weve got a name burt decker ran what was arguably the sleaziest of the halfdozen establishments that catered to the magical crowd in chicago left hand goods prided itself on providing props and ingredients to the black magic crowd oh that wasnt so sinister as it sounded most of the trendy selfappointed death eater wannabes in chicagoor any other city for that matterdidnt have enough talent to strike two rocks together and make sparks much less hurt anybody the really dangerous black wizards dont shop at places like left hand goods you could get everything you needed for most black magic at the freaking grocery store but all the same plenty of losers with bad intentions thought left hand goods had everything you needed to create your own evil empireand burt decker was happy to make them pay for their illusions me and murphy stepped in between the display of socially maladjusted fungi on our right a tank of newts pluck your owning eyes the sign said on the left and stepped around the big shelf of quasilegal drug paraphernalia in front of us decker was a shriveled little toad of a man he wasnt overweight but his skin looked too loose from a plump youth combined with a lifetime of too many naps in tanning beds he was immaculately groomed and his hair was a gorgeous black streaked with a dignified silver that was like a rolls hood ornament on a vw rabbit he had beady black eyes with nothing warm behind them and when he saw me he licked his lips nervously hiya burt i said there were a few shoppers none of whom looked terribly appealing murphy held up her badge so everyone could see it and said we have some questions she might as well have shouted fire the store emptied murphy swaggered past a rack of discount porn dvds her coat open just enough to reveal the shoulder holster she wore she picked one up gave it a look and tossed it on the floor christ i hate scum vendors like this hey burt said you break it you bought it yeah right murphy said i showed him my teeth as i walked up and leaned both my arms on the counter he stood behind it crowded into his personal space his cologne was thick enough to stop bullets burt i said make this simple okay tell me everything you know about caine deckers eyes went flat and his entire body became perfectly still it was reptilian caine i smiled wider big guy shaggy hair kind of a slob with piss running down his leg he made a deal with a woman for some bloodstone and you helped murphy had paused at a display of what appeared to be small smoky quartz geodes the crystals were nearly black with purple veins running through them and they were priced a couple of hundred dollars too high i dont talk about my customers decker said it isnt good for business i glanced at murphy burt we know youre connected she stared at me for a second and sighed then she knocked a geode off the shelf it shattered on the floor decker winced and started to protest but the words died on his lips you know what isnt good for business decker i asked having a big guy in a grey cloak hang out in your little bad juju mart your customers start thinking that the council is paying attention how much business do you think youll get decker stared at me with toad eyes nothing on his face oops murphy said and knocked another geode to the floor people are in the hospital burt i said macs one of themand he was beaten on ground held neutral by the unseelie accords burt bared his teeth it was a gesture of surprise yeah i said i drew my blasting rod out of my coat and slipped enough of my will into it to make the runes and sigils carved along its length glitter with faint orange light the smell of wood smoke curled up from it you dont want the heat this is gonna bring down burt murphy knocked another geode down and said im the good cop all right burt said jesus will you lay off ill talk but you aint gonna like it i dont handle disappointment well burt i tapped the glowing ember tip of the blasting rod down on his countertop for emphasis i really dont burt grimaced at the black spots it left on the countertop skirt comes in asking for bloodstone but all i got is this crap from south asscrack says she wants the real deal and shes a bitch about it i tell her i sold the end of my last shipment to caine woman pisses you off murphy said and you send her to do business with a convicted rapist burt looked at her with toad eyes howd you know where to find caine i asked hes got a discount card here filled out an application i glanced from the porn to the drug gear uhhuh whats he doing with bloodstone why should i give a crap burt said its just business howd she pay what do i look like a fucking video camera you look like an accomplice to black magic burt i said crap burt said smiling slightly i havent had my hands on anything i havent done anything you cant prove anything murphy stared hard at decker then quite deliberately she walked out of the store i gave him my sunniest smile thats the upside of working with the grey cloaks now burt i said i dont need proof i just need an excuse burt stared hard at me then he swallowed toadlike she paid with a visa i told murphy when i came out of the store meditrina bassarid murphy frowned up at my troubled expression whats wrong you ever see me pay with a credit card no i figured no credit company would have you come on murph i said thats just unamerican i dont bother with the things because that magnetic strip goes bad in a couple of hours around me she frowned like everything electronic does so so if ms bassarid has caine scared out of his mind on magic i said murphy got it why is she using a credit card because she probably isnt human i said nonhumans can sling power all over the place and not screw up anything if they dont want to it also explains why she got sent to caine to get taught a lesson and wound up scaring him to death instead murphy said an impolite word but if shes got a credit card shes in the system to some degree i said how long for you to find something she shrugged well see you get a description blueblack hair green eyes long legs and great tits i said she eyed me quoting i said righteously im sure she was fighting off a smile what are you going to do go back to macs i said he loaned me his key murphy looked sideways at me did he know he was doing that i put my hand to my chest as if wounded murphy i said hes a friend i lit a bunch of candles with a mutter and a wave of my hand and i stared around macs place out in the dining area chaos reigned chairs were overturned salt from a broken shaker had spread over the floor none of the chairs were broken but the framed sign that read accorded neutral territory was smashed and lay on the ground near the door an interesting detail that behind the bar where mac kept his iceboxes and his woodburning stove everything was as tidy as a surgical theater with the exception of the uncleaned stove and some dishes in the sink nothing looked like a clue i shook my head and went to the sink i stared at the dishes i turned and stared at the empty storage cabinets under the bar where a couple of boxes of beer still waited i opened the icebox and stared at the food and my stomach rumbled there were some cold cuts i made a sandwich and stood there munching it looking around the place and thinking i didnt think of anything productive i washed the dishes in the sink scowling and thinking up a veritable thunderstorm i didnt get much further than a light sprinkle though before a thought struck me there really wasnt very much beer under the bar i finished the dishes pondering that had there been a ton earlier no id picked up the halfused box and taken it home the other two boxes were where id left them but mac usually kept a legion of beer bottles down there so why only two now i walked down to the far end of the counter a nagging thought dancing around the back of my mind where i couldnt see it mac kept a small office in the back corner consisting of a table for his desk a wooden chair and a couple of filing cabinets his food service and liquor permits were on display on the wall above it i sat down at the desk and opened the filing cabinets i started going through macs records and books intrusive as hell i know but i had to figure out what was going on before matters got worse and that was when it hit mematters getting worse i could see a mortal wizard motivated by petty spite greed or some other mundane motivation wrecking macs bar people can be amazingly petty but nonhumans nowthat was a different story the fact that this bassarid chick had a credit card meant she was methodical i mean you cant just conjure one out of thin air shed taken the time to create an identity for herself that kind of forethought indicated a scheme a plan a goal untidying a chicago bar neutral ground or not was not by any means the kind of goal that things from the nevernever set for themselves when they went undercover into mortal society something bigger was going on then macs place must have been a side item for bassarid or maybe a steppingstone mac was no wizard but he was savvy it would take more than cheap tricks to get to his beer with him here and i was betting he had worked out more than one way to realize it if someone had intruded on his place when he was gone so if someone wanted to get to the beer theyd need a distraction like maybe caine caine made a deal with bassarid evidentlyi assumed he gave her the bloodstone in exchange for being a pain to mac so she ruins macs day gets the bloodstone in exchange end of storynice and neat except that it didnt make a lot of sense bloodstone isnt exactly impossible to come by why would someone with serious magical juice do a favor for caine to get some because maybe caine was a stooge a distraction for anyone trying to follow bassarids trail what if bassarid had picked someone who had a history with mac so that i could chase after him while she did whatever she planned to do with the rest of macs beer wherever the hell that was it took me an hour and a half to find anything in macs filesthe first thing was a book a really old book bound in undyed leather it was a journal apparently and written in some kind of cipher also interesting but probably not germane the second thing i found was a receipt for a whole hell of a lot of money along with an itemized list of what had been soldbeer representing all of macs various heavenly brews someone at worldclass limited had paid him an awful lot of money for his current stock i got on the phone and called murphy who bought the evil beer murphy asked the beer isnt evil its a victim and i dont recognize the name of the company worldclass limited keys clicked in the background as murphy hit the internet caterers murphy said a moment later high end i thought of the havoc that might be about to ensue at some wedding or bar mitzvah and shuddered hells bells i breathed weve got to find out where they went egad holmes murphy said in the same tone i would have said duh yeah sorry what did you get on bassarid next to nothing murphy said itll take me a few more hours to get the information behind her credit card no time i said she isnt worried about the cops whoever she is she planned this whole thing to keep her tracks covered from the likes of me arent we full of ourselves murphy grumped call you right back she did the caterers arent available she said theyre working the private boxes at the bulls game i rushed to the united center murphy could have blown the whistle and called in the artillery but she hadnt uniformed cops already at the arena would have been the first to intervene and if they did they were likely to cross bassarid whatever she was she would be more than they could handle shed scamper or worse one of the cops could get killed so murphy and i both rushed to get there and find the bad guy before she could pull the trigger so to speak on the chicago pd it was half an hour before the game and the streets were packed i parked in front of a hydrant and ran half a mile to the united center where thousands of people were packing themselves into the building for the game i picked up a ticket from a scalper for a ridiculous amount of money on the way emptying my pockets and earned about a million glares from bulls fans as i juked and ducked through the crowd to get through the entrances as quickly as i possibly could once inside i ran for the lowest level the bottommost ring of concession stands and restrooms circling entrances to the arenathe most crowded level currentlywhere the entrances to the most expensive ring of private boxes were i started at the first box i came to knocking on the locked doors no one answered at the first several and at the next the door was opened by a blonde who in an expensive business outfit showing a lot of decolletage had clearly been expecting someone else who are you she stammered i flashed her my laminated consultants id too quickly to be seen department of alcohol tobacco and firearms maam i said in my officials voice which is like my voice only deeper and more pompous ive heard it from all kinds of government types weve had a report of tainted beer i need to check your bar see if the bad batch is in there oh she said backing up her body language immediately cooperative i pegged her as somebodys receptionist maybe of course i padded into the room and went to the bar rifling bottles and opening cabinets until i found eleven dark brown bottles with a simple cap with an m stamped into the metalmacs mark i turned to find the blonde holding out the halfempty bottle number twelve in a shaking hand her eyes were a little wide um am i in trouble i might be i took the beer bottle from her moving gingerly and set it down with the others have you been feeling uh sick or anything i asked as i edged toward the door just in case she came at me with a baseball bat she shook her head breathing more heavily her manicured fingernails trailed along the vneck of her blouse i i mean you know her face flushed just looking forward to the game uhhuh i said warily her eyes suddenly became warmer and very direct i dont know what it was exactly but she was suddenly filled with that energy women have that has nothing to do with magic and everything to do with creating it the temperature in the room felt as if it went up about ten degrees maybe you should examine me sir i suddenly had a very different idea of what mac had been defending himself from with that baseball bat and it had turned ugly on him hells bells i thought i knew what we were dealing with fantastic idea i told her you stay right here and get comfortable im going to grab something sweet ill be back in two shakes all right she cooed her suit jacket slid off her shoulders to the floor dont be long i smiled at her in what i hoped was a suitably sultry fashion and backed out then i shut the door checked its frame and focused my will into the palm of my right hand i directed my attention to one edge of the door and whispered forzare metal squealed as the door bent in its frame with any luck it would take a couple of guys with crowbars an hour or two to get it open againand hopefully bubbles would pitch over into a stupor before she did herself any harm it took me three more doors to find one of the staff of worldclass limiteda young man in dark slacks a white shirt and a black bow tie who asked if he could help me i flashed the id again weve received a report that a custom microbrew your company purchased for this event has been tainted chicago pd is on the way but meanwhile i need your company to round up the bottles before anyone else gets poisoned drinking them the young man frowned isnt it the bureau excuse me you said department of alcohol tobacco and firearms its a bureau hells bells why did i get someone who could think now can i see that id again he asked look buddy i said youve gotten a bad batch of beer if you dont round it up people are going to get sick okay the cops are on the way but if people start guzzling it now it isnt going to do anybody any good he frowned at me better safe than sorry right i asked him evidently his ability to think did not extend to areas beyond asking stupid questions of wellmeaning wizards look uh really you should take this up with my boss then get me to him i said now the caterer might have been uncertain but he wasnt slow we hurried through the growing crowds to one of the workrooms that his company was using as a staging area a lot of people in white shirts were hurrying all over the place with carts and armloads of everything from crackers to cheese to bottles of wineand a dozen of macs empty wooden boxes were stacked up to one side of the room my guide led me to a harriedlooking woman in catering wear who listened to him impatiently and cut him off halfway through i know i know she snapped look ill tell you what i told sergeant murphy a city health inspector is already here and theyre already checking things out and i am not losing my contract with the arena over some pointless scare you already talked to murphy i said maybe five minutes ago sent her to the woman from the city over at midcourt tall woman i asked feeling my stomach drop blueblack hair uh sort of busty know her do you the head caterer shook her head look im busy yeah i said thanks i ran back into the corridor and sprinted for the boxes at midcourt drawing out my blasting rod as i went and hoping i would be in time to do murphy any good a few years ago id given murphy a key to my apartment in a sense it was a small amulet that would let her past the magical wards that defend the place i hadnt bothered to tell her the thing had a second purposeid wanted her to have one of my personal possessions something i could if necessary use to find her if i needed to she would have been insulted at the very idea a quick stop into the mens room a chalk circle on the floor a muttered spell and i was on her trail i actually ran past the suite she was in before the spell let me know i had passed her and i had to backtrack to the door i debated blowing it off the hinges there was something to be said for a shockandawe entrance of course most of those things couldnt be said for doing it in the middle of a crowded arena that was growing more crowded by the second id probably shatter the windows at the front of the suite and that could be dangerous for the people sitting in the stands beneath them i tried the door just for the hell of it and it opened well dammit i much prefer making a dramatic entrance i came in and found a plushlooking room complete with dark thick carpeting leather sofas a buffet bar a wet bar and two women making out on a leather love seat they looked up as i shut the door behind me murphys expression was at best vague her eyes hazy unfocused the pupils dilated until you could hardly see any blue and her lips were a little swollen with kissing she saw me and a slow and utterly sensuous smile spread over her mouth harry there you are the other woman gave me the same smile with a much more predatory edge she had shoulderlength hair so black it was highlighted with dark shining blue her greengold eyes were bright and intense her mouth full she was dressed in a grey business skirtsuit with the jacket off and her shirt mostly unbuttoned if not quite indecent she was otherwise as burt decker had described herstatuesque and beautiful so she said in a throaty rich voice this is harry dresden yes murphy said slurring the word drunkenly harry and his rod she let out a giggle i mean my god she giggled i like his looks the brunette said strong intelligent yeah murphy said ive wanted him for the longest time she tittered him and his rod i pointed said blasting rod at meditrina bassarid what have you done to her i the woman said nothing murphys face flushed yet the woman let out a smoky laugh toying with murphys hair were getting to that i only shared the embrace of the god with her wizard i was going to kick your ass for that murphy said she looked around and i noticed that a broken lamp lay on the floor and the end table it had sat on had been knocked over evidence of a struggle but i feel so good now smoldering blue eyes found me harry come sit down with us you should the woman murmured well have a good time she produced a bottle of macs ale from somewhere come on have a drink with us all id wanted was a beer for petes sake but this wasnt what i had in mind it was just wrong i told myself very firmly that it was wrong even if karrin managed somehow to make her guns shoulder rig look like lingerie or maybe that was me meditrina was a roman goddess of wine i said instead and the bassarids were another name for the handmaidens of dionysus i nodded at the beer in her hand and said i thought maenads were wine snobs her mouth spread in a wide genuinelooking smile and her teeth were very white any spirit is the spirit of the god mortal thats what the psychic conduit links them to i said to dionysus to the god of revels and ecstatic violence of course the maenad said mortals have forgotten the true power of the god the time has come to begin reminding them if youre going to muck with the drinks why not start with the big beer dispensary in the arena youd get it to a lot more people that way she sneered at me beer brewed in cauldrons the size of houses by machines and then served cold it has no soul it isnt worthy of the name got it i said youre a beer snob she smiled her gorgeous green eyes on mine i needed something real something a craftsman took loving pride in creating this actually made sense from a technical perspective magic is about a lot of things and one of them is emotion once you begin to massmanufacture anything by the very nature of the process you lose the sense of personal attachment you might have to something made by hand for the maenads purposes it would have meant that the massproduced beer had nothing she could sink her magical teeth into no foundation upon which to lay her complex compulsion macs beer certainly qualified as being produced with pridereal personal pride i mean not official corporate spokesperson pride why i asked her why do this at all i am hardly alone in my actions wizard she responded and it is who i am i frowned and tilted my head at her mortals have forgotten the gods she said hints of anger creeping into her tone they think the white god drove out the many gods but they are here we are here i too was worshipped in my day mortal man maybe you didnt know this i said but most of us couldnt give a rats ass raining down thunderbolts from on high isnt exclusive territory anymore she snarled her eyes growing even brighter indeed we withdrew and gave the world into your keepingand what has become of it in two thousand years youve poisoned and raped mother earth who gave you life youve cut down the forests fouled the air and darkened apollos chariot itself with the stench of your smithies and touching off a riot at the bulls game is going to make some kind of point i demanded she smiled showing sharp canines my sisters have been doing football matches on the continent for years were expanding the franchise she drank from the bottle wrapping her lips around it and making sure i noticed moderation its disgusting we should have strangled aristotle in his crib alcoholismcalling the god a disease she bared her teeth at me a lesson must be taught murphy shivered and then her expression turned ugly her blue eyes focusing on me show your respect to the god wizard the maenad spat drink or i will introduce you to pentheus and orpheus greek guys both of whom were torn to pieces by maenads and their mortal female companions in orgies of ecstatic violence murphy was breathing heavily now sweating her cheeks flushed her eyes burning with lust and rage and she was staring right at me hooboy make you a counteroffer i said quietly break off the enchantment on the beer and get out of my town now and i wont fedex you back to the aegean in a dozen pieces if you will not honor the god in life meditrina said then you will honor him in death she flung out a hand and murphy flew at me with a howl of primal fury i ran away dont get me wrong ive faced a lot of screaming charging monsters in my day granted not one of them was small and blond and pretty from making out with what might have been a literal goddess all the same my options were limited murphy obviously wasnt in her right mind i had my blasting rod ready to go but i didnt want to kill her i didnt want to go hand to hand with her either murphy was a dedicated martial artist especially good at grappling and if it came to a clinch i wouldnt fare any better than caine had i flung myself back out of the room and into the corridor beyond before murphy could catch me and twist my arm into some kind of escher portrait i heard glass breaking somewhere behind me murphy came out hard on my heels and i brought my shield bracelet up as i turned trying to angle it so that it wouldnt hurt her my shield flashed to bluesilver life as she closed on me and she bounced off it as if it had been solid steel stumbling to one side meditrina followed her clutching a broken bottle the whites of her eyes visible all the way around the bright green an ecstatic and entirely creepy expression of joy lighting her face she slashed at me three quick graceful motions and i got out of the way of only one of them hot pain seared my chin and my right hand and my blasting rod went flying off down the corridor bouncing off peoples legs im not an expert like murphy but ive taken some classes too and more important ive been in a bunch of scrapes in my life in the literal school of hard knocks you learn the ropes fast and the lessons go bonedeep as i reeled from the blow i turned my momentum into a spin and swept my leg through meditrinas goddess or not the maenad didnt weigh half what i did and her legs went out from under her murphy blindsided me with a kick that lit up my whole rib cage with pain and she had seized an arm before i could fight through it if it had been my right arm im not sure what might have happened but she grabbed my left and i activated my shield bracelet sheathing it in sheer kinetic power and forcing her hands away i dont care how many aikido lessons youve hadthey dont train you for force fields i reached out with my will and screamed forzare then i seized a large plastic waste bin with my power with a flick of my hand i flung it at murphy it struck her hard and knocked her off me i backpedaled meditrina had regained her feet and was coming for me bottle flickering she drove me back into the beerstand counter across the hall and i brought up my shield again just as her makeshift weapon came forward glass shattered against it cutting her own handalways a risk with a bottle but the force of the blow was sufficient to carry through the shield and slam my back against the counter i bounced off some guy trying to carry beer in plastic cups and went down soaked in brew murphy jumped on me then pinning my left arm down as meditrina started raking at my face with her nails both of them screaming like banshees i had to shut one eye when a sharp fingernail grazed it but i saw my chance as meditrinas handshot horribly strong handsclosed over my throat i choked out a gasped forzare and reached out my right hand snapping a slender chain that held up one end of a sign suspended above the beer stand behind me a heavy wooden sign that read in large cheerful letters please drink responsibly swung down in a ponderous scything arc and struck meditrina on the side of the head hitting her like a giants fist her nails left scarlet lines on my throat as she was torn off me murphy looked up shocked and i hauled with all my strength i had to position her before she took up where meditrina left off i felt something wrench and give way as my thumb left its socket and i howled in pain as the sign swung back albeit with a lot less momentum now and clouted murphy on the noggin too then a bunch of people jumped on us and the cops came running while they were arresting me i managed to convince the cops that there was something bad in macs beer they got with the caterers and rounded up the whole batch apparently before more than a handful of people could drink any there was some wild behavior but no one else got hurt none of which did me any good after all i was soaked in budweiser and had assaulted two attractive women i went to the drunk tank which angered me mainly because id never gotten my freaking beer and to add insult to injury after paying exorbitant rates for a ticket i hadnt gotten to see the game either theres no freaking justice in this world murphy turned up in the morning to let me out she had a black eye and a signshaped bruise across one cheekbone so let me get this straight murphy said after we went to left hand goods we followed the trail to the bulls game then we confronted this maenad character there was a struggle and i got knocked out yep i said there was really no point in telling it any other way the nefarious hooch would have destroyed her memory of the evening the truth would just bother her hell it bothered meon more levels than i wanted to think about well bassarid vanished from the hospital murphy said so shes not around to press charges and given that you were working with me on an investigation and because several people have reported side effects that sound a lot like they were drugged with rohypnol or somethingand because it was you who got the cops to pull the rest of the bottlesi managed to get the felony charges dropped youre still being cited for drunk and disorderly yay i said without enthusiasm could have been worse murphy said she paused and studied me for a moment you look like hell thanks i said she looked at me seriously then she smiled stood up on her tiptoes and kissed my cheek youre a good man harry come on ill give you a ride home i smiled all the way to her car love hurts from songs of love and death edited by george r r martin and gardner dozois takes place between turn coat and changes gardner dozois has a bunch of awards for his anthologies because hes good at them and i leapt at his invitation to contribute to the anthology he was working on with george r r martin originally titled starcrossed lovers despite my enthusiasm finding a starting point for a dresden story was sort of a puzzler for me since harry dresden might be in the top three starinfluencefree lovers in the whole contemporaryfantasy genre how was i going to bring him into a story with a theme like that answer get him into the thick of things next to murphy when seemingly random love spells are running amok through the city after that all i had to do was apply his usual streak of luck and cackle madly to myself while typing the title of the anthology changed to songs of love and death after i had written the story which is probably a good thing otherwise i may have tried to find a way to fit a deathmetal battle of the bands into the margins somewhere no one deserves that murphy gestured at the bodies and said love hurts i ducked under the crime scene tape and entered the wrigleyville apartment the smell of blood and death was thick it made gallows humor inevitable murphy stood there looking at me she wasnt offering explanations that meant she wanted an unbiased opinion from cpds special investigations consultantwho is me harry dresden as far as i know i am the only wizard on the planet earning a significant portion of his income working for a law enforcement agency i stopped and looked around taking inventory two bodies naked male and female still intertwined in the act one little pistol illegal in chicago lying upon the limp fingers of the woman two gunshot wounds to the temples one each there were two overlapping fanshaped splatters of blood and more had soaked into the carpet the bodies stank like hell some very unromantic things had happened to them after death i walked a little farther into the room and looked around somewhere in the apartment an old vinyl was playing queen freddie wondered who wanted to live forever as i listened the song ended and began again a few seconds later popping and scratching nostalgically the walls were covered in photographs i dont mean there were a lot of pictures on the wall like at greatgrandmas house i mean covered in photographs entirely completely papered i glanced up so was the ceiling i took a moment to walk slowly around looking at pictures all of them every single one of them featured the two dead people together posed somewhere and looking deliriously happy i walked and peered plenty of the pictures were nearduplicates in most details except that the subjects wore different sets of clothinggenerally cutesy matching tshirts most of the sites were tourist spots within chicago it was as if the couple had gone on the same vacation tour every day over and over again collecting the same general batch of pictures each time matching tshirts i said creepy murphys smile was unpleasant she was a tiny compactly muscular woman with blond hair and a button nose id say she was so cute i just wanted to put her in my pocket but if i tried to do it shed break my arm murph knows martial arts she waited and said nothing another suicide pact thats the third one this month i gestured at the pictures though the others werent quite so cuckoo for cocoa puffs or ah in medias res i shrugged and gestured at the obsessive photographs this is just crazy murphy lifted one pale eyebrow ever so slightly remind mehow much do we pay you to give us advice sherlock i grimaced yeah yeah i know i was quiet for a while and then said what were their names greg and cindy bardalacki murphy said seemingly unconnected dead people but they share similar patterns of death now were upgrading to irrational and obsessive behavior as a precursor i frowned i checked several of the pictures and went over to eye the bodies oh i said oh hells bells murphy arched an eyebrow no wedding rings any where i said no wedding pictures and i finally found a framed family picture which looked to have been there for a while among all the snapshots greg and cindy were both in it along with an older couple and a younger man jesus murph i said they werent a married couple they were brother and sister murphy eyed the intertwined bodies there were no signs of struggle clothes champagne flutes and an empty bubbly bottle lay scattered married no she said couple yes she was unruffled shed already worked that out for herself ick i said but that explains it explains what these two they were togetherand they went insane doing it this has the earmarks of someone tampering with their minds murphy squinted at me why i spread my hands lets say greg and cindy bump into bad guy x bad guy x gets into their heads and makes them fall wildly in love and lust with each other theres nothing they can do about the feelingswhich seem perfectly naturalbut on some level theyre aware that what theyre doing is not what they want and dementedly wrong besides their compromised conscious minds clash with their subconsciousi gestured at the picturesand it escalates until they cant handle it anymore and bang i shot murphy with my thumb and forefinger if youre right they arent the deceased murphy said theyre the victims big difference which is it wish i could say i said but the only evidence that could prove it one way or another is leaking out onto the floor if we get a survivor maybe i could take a peek and see but barring that were stuck with legwork murphy sighed and looked down two suicide pacts couldtechnicallybe a coincidence three of them no way its natural this feels more like somethings mo could it be another one of those skavis vampires they gun for loners i said shaking my head these deaths dont fit their profile so youre telling me we need to turn up a common denominator to link the victims gosh i wish i could have thought of that on my own i winced yeah i glanced over at a couple of other si detectives in the room taking pictures of the bodies and documenting the walls and so on forensics wasnt onsite they dont like to waste their time on the suicides of the emotionally disturbed regardless of how bizarre they might be that was crap work and as such had been dutifully passed to si i lowered my voice if someone is playing mind games the council might know something ill try to pick up the trail on that end you start from here hopefully ill earn my pay and well meet in the middle right murph stared at the bodies and her eyes were haunted she knew what it was like to be the victim of mental manipulation i didnt reach out to support her she hated showing vulnerability and i didnt want to point out to her that id noticed freddie reached a crescendo that told us love must die murphy sighed and called for the love of god someone turn off that damn record im sorry harry captain luccio said we dont exactly have orbital satellites for detecting black magic i waited a second to be sure she was finished the presence of so much magical talent on the far end of the call meant that at times the lag could stretch out between chicago and edinburgh the headquarters of the white council of wizards anastasia luccio captain of the wardens my exgirlfriend had been readily forthcoming with the information the council had on any shenanigans going on in chicagowhich was exactly nothing too bad we dont eh i asked unofficiallyis there anyone who might know anything the gatekeeper perhaps he has a gift for sensing problem areas but no one has seen him for weeks which is hardly unusual and frankly warden dresden youre supposed to be the one giving us this kind of information her voice was half teasing half deadly serious what do you think is happening three couples apparently loveydovey as hell have committed dual suicide in the past two weeks i told her the last two were brother and sister there were some seriously irrational components to their behavior you suspect mental tampering she said her voice was hard luccio had been a victim too i found myself smiling somewhat bitterly at no one she had been among other things mindboinked into going out with me which was apparently the only way anyone would date me lately it seems a reasonable suspicion ill let you know what i turn up use caution she said dont enter any suspect situation without backup on hand theres too much chance that you could be compromised compromised i asked of the two people having this conversation which one of them exposed the last guy rearranging peoples heads touche luccio said but he got away with it because we were overconfident so use caution anyway planning on it i said there was a moment of awkward silence and then anastasia said how have you been harry keeping busy i said she had already apologized to me sort of for abruptly walking out of my personal life shed never intended to be there in the first place there had been a real emotional tsunami around the events of last year and i wasnt the one who had gotten the most hurt by them you keeping busy she was quiet for a moment and then said i know its over but im glad for the time we had together it made me happy sometimes i miss feeling that i thought completing the sentence my throat felt tight nothing wrong with happy no there isnt when its real her voice softened be careful harry please i will i said i started combing the supernatural world for answers and got almost nothing the little folk who could usually be relied on to provide some kind of information had nothing for me their memory for detail was very short and the deaths had happened too long ago to get me anything but conflicting gibberish from them i made several mental nighttime sweeps through the city using the scale model of chicago in my basement and got nothing but a headache for my trouble i called around the paranet the organization of folk with only modest magical gifts the kind who often found themselves being preyed upon by more powerful supernatural beings they worked together now sharing information communicating successful techniques and generally overcoming their lack of raw magical muscle with mutually supportive teamwork they didnt have anything for me either i hit mcanallys a hub of the supernatural social scene and asked a lot of questions no one had any answers then i started contacting the people i knew in the scene starting with the ones i thought most likely to provide information i worked my way methodically down the list crossing out names until i got to ask random people on the street there are days when i dont feel like much of a wizard or an investigator or a wizard investigator ordinary pis have a lot of days like that where they look and look and look for information and find nothing i get fewer of those days than most on account of the whole wizard thing giving me a lot more optionsbut sometimes i come up goose eggs anyway i just hate doing it when lives may be in danger four days later all i knew was that nobody knew about any black magic happening in chicago and the only traces of it i did find were the minuscule amounts of residue left from black magic wrought by those without enough power to be a threat warden ramirez had coined the phrase dim magic to describe that kind of petty essentially harmless malice there were also the usual traces of dim magic performed subconsciously from a bed of dark emotions probably by someone who might not even know they had a gift in other words goose eggs fortunately murphy got the job done sometimes hard work is way better than magic murphys saturn had gotten a little blown up a couple of years back sort of my fault and what with her demotion and all it would be a while before shed be able to afford something besides her old harley for some reason she didnt want to take the motorcycle so that left my car the ever trusty almost always blue beetle an oldschool vw bug that had seen me through one nasty scrape after another more than once it had been pounded badly but always it had risen to do battle once moreif by battle one means driving somewhere at a sedate speed without much acceleration and only middling gas mileage dont start its paid for i stopped outside murphys little white house with its little pink rose garden and rolled down the window on the passenger side make like the dukes of hazzard i said doors stuck murphy gave me a narrow look then she tried the door it opened easily she slid into the passenger seat with a smug smile closed the door and didnt say anything police work has made you cynical i said if you want to ogle my butt youll just have to work for it like everyone else harry i snorted and put the car in gear where we going nowhere until you buckle up she said putting her own seat belt on its my car i said its the law you want to get cited cause i can do that i debated whether or not it was worth it while she gave me her cop lookand produced a ballpoint pen i buckled up murphy beamed at me springfield head for i i grunted kind of out of your jurisdiction if we were investigating something murphy said were not were going to the fair i eyed her sidelong on a date sure if someone asks she said off handedly then she froze for a second and added its a reasonable cover story right i said her cheeks looked a little pink neither of us said anything for a little while i merged onto the highway always fun in a car originally designed to rocket down the autobahn at a blistering one hundred kilometers an hour and asked murphy springfield state fair she said that was the common denominator i frowned going over the dates in my head state fair only runs what ten days murphy nodded they shut down tonight but the first couple died twelve days ago they were both volunteer staff for the fair and they were down there on the grounds setting up murphy lifted a foot to rest her heel on the edge of the passenger seat frowning out the window i found skeeball tickets and one of those chintzy stuffed animals in the second couples apartment and the bardalackis got pulled over for speeding on i five minutes out of springfield and bound for chicago so maybe they went to the fair i said or maybe they were just taking a road trip or something murphy shrugged possibly but if i assume that its a coincidence it doesnt get me anywhereand weve got nothing if i assume theres a connection weve got a possible answer i beamed at her i thought you didnt like reading parker she eyed me that doesnt mean his logic isnt sound oh right she exhaled heavily its the best ive got i just hope that if i get you into the general area you can pick up on whatever is going on yeah i said thinking of walls papered in photographs me too the smells are what i enjoy the most about places like the state fair you get combinations of smells at such events like none found anywhere else popcorn roast nuts and fast food predominate and you can get anything you want to clog your arteries or burn out your stomach lining chili dogs funnel cakes fried bread majorly greasy pizza candy apples ye gods evil food smells amazingwhich is either proof that there is a satan or some equivalent out there or that the almighty doesnt actually want everyone to eat organic tofu all the time i cant decide other smells are a cross section depending on where youre standing disinfectant and filth walking by the portapotties exhaust and burned oil and sunbaked asphalt and gravel in the parking lots sunlight on warm bodies suntan lotion cigarette smoke and beer near some of the attendees the pungent honest smell of livestock near the animal shows stock contests or pony ridesall of it charging right up your nose i like indulging my sense of smell smell is the hardest sense to lie to murphy and i started in midmorning and began walking around the fair in a methodical search pattern it took us all day the state fair is not a rinkydink event dammit she said weve been here all day you sure you havent sniffed out anything nothing like what were looking for i said i was afraid of this of what a lot of times magic like thiscomplex longlasting subtle darkdoesnt thrive well in sunlight i glanced at the lengthening shadows give it another half hour and well try again murphy frowned at me i thought you always said magic isnt about good and evil neither is sunshine murphy exhaled her displeasure plain you might have mentioned it to me before no way to know until we tried i said think of it this way maybe were just looking in the exact wrong place she sighed and squinted around at the nearby food trailers and concession stands ugh think theres anything here that wont make me split my jeans at the seams i beamed probably not how about dogs and a funnel cake bastard murphy growled then okay halfway through my second hot dog i realized we were being followed i kept myself from reacting took another bite and said maybe this is the place after all murphy had found a place selling turkey drumsticks she had cut the meat from the bone and onto a paper plate and she was eating it with a plastic fork she didnt stop chewing or look up whatcha got guy in a maroon tee and tan bdu pants about twenty feet away off your right shoulder ive seen him at least two other times today doesnt necessarily mean hes following us hes been busy doing nothing in particular all three times murphy nodded five eight or so long hair little soul tuft under his mouth yeah he was sitting on a bench when i came out of the portapotty murphy said also doing nothing she shrugged and went back to eating how do you want to play it were here with a zillion people harry she deepened her voice and blocked out any hint of a nasal tone you want i should whack him until he talks i grunted and finished my hot dog doesnt necessarily mean anything maybe hes got a crush on you murphy snorted maybe hes got a crush on you i covered a respectable belch with my hand and reached for my funnel cake who could blame him i took a bite and nodded all right well see what happens then murphy nodded and sipped at her diet coke will says you and anastasia broke up a while back will talks too much i said darkly she glanced a little bit away hes your friend he worries about you i studied her averted face for a moment and then nodded well i said tell will he doesnt need to worry it sucked it sucks less now ill be fine fish in the sea never meant to be et cetera i paused over another bite of funnel cake and asked hows kincaid the way he always is murphy said you get to be a few centuries old you get a little set in your ways she shook her head its his type hed be that way if he were twenty he walks his own road and doesnt let anyone make him do differently like she stopped before she could say who kincaid was like she ate her turkey leg a shiver passed over the fair a tactile sensation to my wizards senses sundown twilight would go on for a while yet but the light left in the sky would no longer hold the creatures of the night at bay murphy glanced up at me sensing the change in my level of tension she finished off her drink while i stuffed the last of the funnel cake into my mouth and we stood up together the western sky was still a little bit orange when i finally sensed magic at work we were near the carnival a section of the fair full of garishly lit rides heavily slanted games of chance and chintzy attractions of every kind it was full of screaming excited little kids parents with frayed patience and fashionenslaved teenagers music tinkled and brayed tinny tunes lights flashed and danced barkers bleated out cajolement encouragement and condolences in almostequal measures we drifted through the merry chaos our maroonshirted tail following along ten to twenty yards behind i walked with my eyes half closed giving no more heed to my vision than a bloodhound on a trail murphy stayed beside me her expression calm her blue eyes alert for physical danger then i felt ita quiver in the air no more noticeable than the fading hum from a gently plucked guitar string i noted its direction and walked several more paces before checking again in an attempt to triangulate the source of the disturbance i got a rough fix on it in under a minute and realized i had stopped and was staring harry murphy asked what is it something down there i said nodding to the midway its faint but its something murph inhaled sharply this must be the place there goes our tail we didnt have to communicate the decision to each other if the tail belonged to whoever was behind this we couldnt let him get away to give the culprit forewarningand odds were excellent that the sudden rabbit impersonation by the man in maroon would result in his leading us somewhere interesting we turned and gave pursuit a footrace on open ground is one thing running through a crowded carnival is something else entirely you cant sprint unless you want to wind up falling down a lot and attracting a lot of attention you have to hurry along hopping between clusters of people never really getting the chance to pour on the gas the danger in a chase like this isnt that the quarry will outrun you but that youll lose him in the crowd i had a huge advantage im freakishly tall i could see over everyone and spot mr maroon bobbing and weaving his way through the crowd i took the lead and murphy followed i got within a couple of long steps of maroon but was interdicted by a gaggle of seniors in shriners caps he caught a break at the same time a stretch of open ground beyond the shriners and by the time i got through i saw maroon handing tickets to a carnie he hopped up onto a platform got into a little roller coasterstyle car and vanished into an attraction dammit murphy said panting what now behind the attraction advertised as the tunnel of terror there was an empty space the interior of a circle of several similar rides and games there wouldnt be anyone to hide behind in there you take the back ill watch the front whoever spots him gives a shout got it murphy hurried off around the tunnel of terror she frowned at a little plastic barrier with an authorized personnel only notice on it then calmly ignored it and went on over anarchist i muttered and settled down to wait for maroon to figure out hed been treed he didnt appear the dingy little roller coaster car came wheezing slowly out of the opposite side of the platform empty the carnie an old fellow with a scruffy white beard didnt noticehe was dozing in his chair murphy returned a few seconds later there are two doors on the back she reported both of them chained and locked from the outside he didnt come out that way i inhaled and nodded at the empty car not here either look we cant just stand around maybe hes running through a tunnel or something weve got to know if hes inside ill go flush him out she said you pick him up when he shows no way i said we stay with our wingi glanced at murphyperson the power i sensed came from somewhere nearby if we split up were about a million times more vulnerable to mental manipulation and if this guy is more than he appears neither of us wants to take him solo she grimaced nodded and we started toward the tunnel of terror together the old carnie woke up as we came up the ramp let out a wheezing cough and pointed to a sign that required us to give him three tickets each for the ride i hadnt bought any and the ticket counter was more than far enough away for maroon to scamper if we stopped to follow the rules sir murphy said a man were looking for just went into your attraction but he didnt come out again we need to go in and look for him he blinked gummy eyes at murphy and said three tickets you dont understand she said a fugitive may be hiding inside the tunnel of terror we need to check and see if hes there the carnie snorted three tickets missy though it aint the nicest room you two could rent murphys jaw muscles flexed i stepped forward hey man i said harry dresden pi if you wouldnt mind all we need to do is get inside for five minutes he eyed me pi huh i produced my license and showed it to him he eyed it and then me you dont look like no private investigator i ever saw wheres your hat in the shop i said transmission gave out i winked at him and held up a folded twenty between my first and second fingers five minutes he yawned naw cant let nobody run around loose in there he reached out and took the twenty then again what you and your lady friend mutually consent to do once youre inside aint my affair he rose pulled a lever and gestured at the car mount up he leered and keep your ah extremities inside the car at all times we got in and i was nearly scalded by the steam coming out of murphys ears you just had to play along with that one we needed to get inside i said just doing my job sergeant she snorted hey murph look i said holding up a strap of old worn leather seat belts she gave me a look that could have scoured steel then with a stubborn set of her jaw secured the flimsy thing her expression dared me to object i grinned and relaxed it isnt easy to really get murphs goat and get away with it on the other side of the platform the carnie pulled another lever and a moment later the little cart started rolling forward at the blazing speed of one maybe even two miles an hour a dark curtain parted ahead of us and we rolled into the tunnel of terror murphy promptly drew her gunit was dark but i heard the scratch of its barrel on plastic as she drew it from its holder she snapped a small led flashlight into its holder beneath the gun barrel and flicked it on we were in a cramped little tunnel every surface painted black and there was absolutely nowhere for maroon to be hiding i shook out the charm bracelet on my left wrist preparing defensive energies in case they were needed murph and i had been working together long enough to know our roles if trouble came i would defend us murphy and her sig would reply a door opened at the end of the little hallway and we rolled forward into an open set dressed to look like a rustic farmhouse with a lot of subtle details meant to be scarysevered fingers at the base of the chickenchopping stump just below the bloody ax glowing eyes appearing in an upstairs window of the farmhouse that kind of thing there was no sign of maroon and precious little place for him to hide better get that seat belt off i told her we want to be able to move fast if it comes to that yeah she said and reached down just as something huge and terrifying dropped onto the car from the shadows above us screaming adrenaline hit my system like a runaway bus and i looked up to see a decidedly demonic scarecrow hanging a few feet above our heads bouncing on its wires and playing a recording of cackling mad laughter jesus christ murphy breathed lowering her gun she was a little white around the eyes we looked at each other and both burst into high nervous laughs tunnel of terror murphy said we are so cool total badasses i said grinning the car continued its slow grind forward and murphy unfastened the seat belt we moved into the next area meant to be a zombieinfested hospital it had a zombie mannequin which burst out of a closet near the track and plenty of gore we got out of the car and scouted a couple of spots where he might have been but wasnt then we hopped into the car again before it could leave the set so it went on through a ghoulish graveyard a troglodyteteaming cavern and a literal old west ghost town we came up with nothing but we moved well as a team better than i could remember doing with anyone before everything felt as smooth and natural as if wed been moving together our whole lives we did it in total silence too divining what each other would do through pure instinct even great teams lose a game here or there though we came up with diddly and emerged from the tunnel of terror with neither maroon nor any idea where hed gone hells bells i muttered this week has been an investigative suckfest for me murphy tittered again you said suck i grinned at her and looked around well i said we dont know where maroon went if they hadnt made us already they have now can you pick up on the signalwhatsit again energy signature i said maybe its pretty vague though im not sure how much more precise i can get lets find out she said i nodded right then we started around the suspect circle of attractions moving slowly and trying to blend into the crowds when a couple of rowdy kids went by one chasing the other i put an arm around her shoulders and drew her into the shelter of my body so she wouldnt get bowled over she exhaled slowly and did not step away from me my heart started beating faster harry she said quietly yeah you and me why havent we ever she looked up at me why not the usual i guess i said quietly trouble duty other people involved she shook her head why not she repeated her eyes direct all these years have gone by and something could have happened but it never did why not i licked my lips just like that we just decide to be together her eyelids lowered why not my heart did the drum solo from wipeout why not i bent my head down to her mouth and kissed her very gently she turned into the kiss pressing her body against mine it was a little bit awkward i was most of two feet taller than she was we made up for grace with enthusiasm her arms twining around my neck as she kissed me hungry and deep whoa i said drawing back a moment later work right she looked at me for a moment her cheeks pink her lips a little swollen from the kiss and said right she closed her eyes and nodded right work first then dinner i asked dinner my place we can order in my belly trembled in sudden excitement at that proposition right i looked around so lets find this thing and get it over with we started moving again a circuit around the attractions got me no closer to the source of the energy id sensed earlier dammit i said frustrated when wed completed the pattern hey murphy said dont beat yourself up about it harry her hand slipped into mine our fingers intertwining ive been a cop a long time you dont always get the bad guy and if you go around blaming yourself for it you wind up crawling into a bottle or eating your own gun thank you i said quietly but heh murphy said you said but we both grinned like fools i looked down at our entwined hands i like this so do i murphy said why didnt we do this a long time ago beats me are we just that stupid she asked i mean people in general are we really so blind that we miss whats right there in front of us as a species were essentially insane i said so yeah probably i lifted our hands and kissed her fingertips im not missing it now though her smile lit up several thousand square feet of the midway good the echo of a thought rattled around in my head insane oh i said oh hells bells she frowned at me what murph i think we got whammied she blinked at me what no we didnt i think we did i didnt see anything or feel anything i mean nothing harry ive felt magic like that before look at us i said waving our joined hands weve been friends a long time harry she said and weve had a couple of near misses before this time we just didnt screw it up thats all thats happening here what about kincaid i asked her she mulled over that one for a second then she said i doubt hell even notice im gone she frowned at me harry i havent been this happy in i never thought i could feel this way again about anyone my heart continued to go pittypat i know exactly what you mean i said i feel the same way her smile warmed even more then whats the problem isnt that what love is supposed to be like effortless i had to think about that one for a second and then i said carefully and slowly murph think about it what do you mean you know how good this is i asked yeah how right it feels she nodded yeah how easy it was she nodded energetically her eyes bright i leaned down toward her for emphasis it just isnt fuckedup enough to really be you and me her smile faltered my god she said her eyes widening we got whammied we returned to the tunnel of terror i dont get it she said i dont i didnt feel anything happen i dont feel any different now i thought being aware of this kind of thing made it go away no i said but it helps sometimes do you still i squeezed her hand once more before letting go yeah i said i still feel it is it is it going to go away i didnt answer her i didnt know or maybe i didnt want to know the old carnie saw us coming and his face flickered with apprehension as soon as he looked at us he stood up and looked from the control board for the ride to the entranceway to the interior yeah i muttered sneaky bastard you just try it he flicked one of the switches and shambled toward the tunnels entrance i made a quick effort of will raised a hand and swept it in a horizontal arc snarling forzare unseen force knocked his legs out from beneath him and tossed him into an involuntary pratfall murphy and i hurried up onto the platform before he could get to his feet and run we neednt have bothered the carnie was apparently a genuine old guy not some supernatural being in disguise he lay on the platform moaning in pain i felt kind of bad for beating up a senior citizen but hey on the other hand he did swindle me out of twenty bucks murphy stood over him her blue eyes cold and said wheres the bolthole the carnie blinked at her wha the trapdoor she snapped the secret cabinet where is he i frowned and walked toward the entranceway please the carnie said i dont know what youre talking about the hell you dont murphy said she leaned down and grabbed the man by the shirt with both hands and leaned closer a snarl lifting her lip the carnie blanched murph could be pretty badass for such a tiny thing i loved that about her i cant the carnie said i cant i get paid not to see anything shell kill me shell kill me i parted the heavy curtain leading into the entry tunnel and spotted it at oncea circular hole in the floor about two feet across the top end of a ladder just visible a round lid lay rotated to one side painted as flat black as the rest of the hall here i said to murph thats why we didnt spot anything by the time you had your light on it was already behind us murphy scowled down at the carnie and said give me twenty bucks the man licked his lips then he fished my folded twenty out of his shirt pocket and passed it to murphy she nodded and flashed her badge get out of here before i realize i witnessed you taking a bribe and endangering lives by letting customers use the attraction in an unsafe manner the carnie bolted murphy handed me the twenty i pocketed it and we climbed down the ladder we reached the bottom and went silent again murphys body language isnt exactly subtleit cant be when youre her size and working law enforcement but she could move as quietly as smoke when she needed to im gangly it was more of an effort for me the ladder took us down to what looked like the interior of a buried railroad car there were electrical conduits running along the walls light came from a doorway at the far end of the car i moved forward first shield bracelet at the ready and murphy walked a pace behind me and to my right her sig held ready the doorway at the end of the railroad car led us into a large workroom teeming with computers file cabinets microscopes and at least one deluxe chemistry set maroon sat at one of the computers his profile in view dammit stu he snarled i told you that you cant keep coming down here to use the john youll just have to walk to one of the he glanced up at us and froze in midsentence his eyes wide and locked on murphys leveled gun stu took the rest of the night off i said amiably wheres your boss a door opened at the far end of the workroom and a young woman of medium height appeared she wore glasses and a lab coat and neither of them did anything to make her look less than gorgeous she looked at us and then at maroon and said in a precise british accent you idiot yeah i said good help is hard to find the woman in the lab coat looked at me with dark intense eyes and i sensed what felt like a phantom pressure against my temples as if wriggling tadpoles were slithering along the surface of my skin it was a straightforward attempt at mental invasion but id been practicing my defenses for a while now and i wasnt falling for something that obvious i pushed the invasive thoughts away with an effort of will and said dont meet her eyes murph shes a vampire red court got it she said her gun never moving from maroon the vampire looked at us both for a moment then she said you need no introduction mr dresden i am baroness leblanc and our nations are not at the moment in a state of war ive always been a little fuzzy on legal niceties i said i had several devices with me that i could use to defend myself i was ready to use any of them a vampire in close quarters is nothing to laugh at leblanc could tear off three or four of my limbs in the time it takes to draw and fire a gun i watched her closely ready to act at the slightest semblance of an attack we both know the war is going to start up again eventually you are out of anything reasonably like your territory she said and you are trespassing upon mine i would be well within my rights under the accords to kill you and bury your torso and limbs in individual graves thats the problem with this ride i complained to murphy theres nothing thats actually scary in the tunnel of terror you did get your money back she pointed out ah true i smiled faintly at leblanc look baroness you know who i am youre doing something to peoples minds and i want it stopped if you do not leave she said i will consider it an act of war hooray i said in a ben stein monotone spinning one forefinger in the air like a new years noisemaker ive already kicked off one war with the red court and i will cheerfully do it again if that is what is necessary to protect people from you thats irrational leblanc said completely irrational tell her murph hes completely irrational murphy said her tone wry leblanc regarded me impassively for a moment then she smiled faintly and said perhaps a physical confrontation is an inappropriate solution i frowned really she shrugged not all of the red court are battlehungry blood addicts dresden my work here has no malevolent designs quite the opposite in fact i tilted my head thats funny all the corpses piled up say differently the process does have its side effects she admitted but the lessons garnered from them serve only to improve my work and make it safer and more effective honestly you should be supporting me dresden not trying to shut me down supporting you i smiled a little just what is it you think youre doing thats so darned wonderful i am creating love i barked out a laugh leblancs face remained steady serious you think that this this warping people into feeling something they dont want to feel is love what is love leblanc said if not a series of electrochemical signals in the brain signals that can be duplicated like any other sensation love is more than that i said do you love this woman yeah i said but that isnt anything new leblanc showed her teeth but your current feelings of longing and desire are new are they not new and entirely indistinguishable from your genuine emotions wouldnt you say sergeant murphy murphy swallowed but didnt look at the vampire leblancs uncomplicated mental attack might be simple for a wizard to defeat but any normal human being would probably be gone before they realized their minds were under attack instead of answering she asked a question of her own why why what why do this why experiment with making people fall in love leblanc arched an eyebrow isnt it obvious i sucked in a short breath realizing what was happening the white court i said the whites were a different breed of vampire from the reds feeding on the life essence of their victims generally through seduction genuine love and genuine tokens of love were their kryptonite their holy water the love of another human being in an intimate relationship sort of rubbed off on you making the very touch of your skin an anathema to the white court leblanc smiled at me granted there are some aberrant effects from time to time but so far thats been a very small percentage of the test pool and the survivors are as you yourself have experienced perfectly happy they have a love that most of your kind seldom find and even more infrequently keep there are no victims here wizard oh i said right except for the victims leblanc exhaled mortals are like mayflies wizard they live a brief time and then they are gone and those who have died because of my work at least died after days or weeks of perfect bliss there are many who ended a much longer life with less what im doing here has the potential to protect mortalkind from the white court forever it isnt genuine love if its forced upon someone murphy said her tone harsh no leblanc said but i believe the real thing will very easily grow from such a foundation of companionship and happiness gosh youre noble i said leblancs eyes sparkled with something ugly youre doing this to get rid of competition i said and hell maybe to try to increase the worlds population make more food the vampire regarded me levelly there are multiple motivations behind the work she said many of my court agreed to the logic you cite when they would never have supported the idea of strengthening and defending mortals ohhhhh i said drawing the word out youre the vampire with a heart of gold florence nightingale with fangs i guess that makes it okay then leblanc stared at me then her eyes flicked to murphy and back she smiled thinly there is a special cage reserved for you at the red court dresden its bars are lined with blades and spikes so that if you fall asleep they will cut and gouge you awake shut up murphy said leblanc continued in a calmly amused tone the bottom is a closed bowl nearly a foot deep so that you will stand in your own waste and there are three spears with needlesized tips waiting in a rack beneath the cage so that any who pass you can pause and take a few moments to participate in your punishment shut up murphy growled eventually leblanc purred your guts will be torn out and left in a pile at your feet and when you are dead your skin will be flayed from your body tanned and made into upholstery for one of the chairs in the red temple shut up snarled murphy and her voice was savage her gun whipped over to cover leblanc shut your mouth bitch i realized the danger an instant too late it was exactly the reaction leblanc had intended to provoke murph no once murphys sig was pointing elsewhere maroon produced a gun from beneath his desk and raised it he was pulling the trigger even before he could level it for a shot blazing away as fast as he could move his finger he wasnt quite fifteen feet away from murphy but the first five shots missed her as i spun and brought the invisible power of my shield bracelet down between the two of them bullets hit the shield with flashes of light and sent little concentric blue rings rippling through the air from the point of impact murphy meanwhile had opened up on leblanc murph fired almost as quickly as maroon but she had the training and discipline necessary for combat her bullets smacked into the vampires torso tearing through pale flesh and drawing gouts of redblack blood leblanc staggered to one sideshe wouldnt be dead but the shots had probably rung her bell for a second or two i lowered the shield as maroons gun clicked on empty lifted my right fist and triggered the braided energy ring on my index finger with a short uplifting motion the ring saved back a little energy every time i moved my arm storing it so that i could unleash it at need unseen force flew out from the ring plucked maroon out of his chair and slammed him into the ceiling he dropped back down hit his back on the edge of the desk and fell into a senseless sprawl on the floor the gun flew from his fingers im out murphy screamed i whirled back to find leblanc pushing herself off the wall regaining her balance she gave murphy a look of flat hatred and her eyes flushed pure black iris and sclera alike she opened her mouth in an inhuman scream and then the vampire hiding beneath leblancs seemingly human form exploded outward like a racehorse emerging from its gate leaving shreds of pale bloodless skin in its wake it was a hideous thingblack and flabby and slimy looking with a flaccid belly a batlike face and long spindly limbs leblancs eyes bulged hideously as she flew toward me i brought my shield up in time to intercept her and she rebounded from it to fall back to the section of floor already stained with her blood down murphy shouted i dropped down onto my heels and lowered the shield leblanc rose up again even as i heard murphy take a deep breath exhale halfway and hold it her gun barked once the vampire lost about a fifth of her head as the bullet tore into her skull she staggered back against the wall limbs thrashing but she still wasnt dead she began to claw her way to her feet again murphy squeezed off six more shots methodically none of them missed leblanc fell to the floor murphy took a step closer aimed and put another ten or twelve rounds into the fallen vampires head by the time she was done the vampires skull looked like a smashed gourd a few seconds later leblanc stopped moving murphy reloaded again and kept the gun trained on the corpse nice shootin tex i said i checked out maroon he was still breathing so murphy said problem solved not really i said leblanc was no practitioner she cant be the one who was working the whammy murphy frowned and eyed maroon for a second i went over to the downed man and touched my fingers lightly to his brow there was no telltale energy signature of a practitioner nope who then i shook my head this is delicate difficult magic there might not be three people on the entire white council who could pull it off so its most likely a focus artifact of some kind a what an item that has a routine built into it i said you pour energy in one end and you get results on the other murphy scrunched up her nose like those wolf belts the fbi had yeah just like that i blinked and snapped my fingers just like that i hurried out of the little complex and up the ladder i went to the tunnel car and took the old leather seat belt out of it i turned it over and found the back inscribed with nearly invisible sigils and signs now that i was looking for it i could feel the tingle of energy moving within it hah i said got it murphy frowned back at the entry to the tunnel of terror what do we do about billy the kid not much we can do i said you want to try to explain what happened here to the springfield cops she shook her head me either i said the kid was leblancs thrall i doubt hes a danger to anyone without a vampire to push him into it besides the reds would probably kill him on general principles anyway once they found out about leblancs death we were silent for a moment then stepped in close to each other and hugged gently murphy shivered you okay i asked quietly she leaned her head against my chest how do we help all the people she screwed with burn the belt i said and stroked her hair with one hand that should purify everyone its linked to everyone she said slowly i blinked twice yeah so once you do it well see what a bad idea this is and remember that we both have very good reasons to not get together yeah and we wont be feeling this anymore this happy this complete no we wont her voice cracked dammit i hugged her tight yeah i want to tell you to wait awhile she said i want us to be all noble and virtuous for keeping it intact i want to tell you that if we destroy the belt well be destroying the happiness of god knows how many people junkies are happy when theyre high i said quietly but they dont need to be happy they need to be free i put the belt back into the car turned my right hand palm up and murmured a word a sphere of whitehot fire gathered over my fingers i flicked a hand and the sphere arched gently down into the car and began charring the belt to ashes i felt sick i didnt watch i turned to karrin and kissed her again hot and urgent and she returned the kiss frantically it was as though we thought we might keep something from escaping our mouths if they were sealed together in a kiss i felt it when it went away we both stiffened slightly we both remembered that we had decided the two of us couldnt work out we both remembered that murphy was already involved with someone else and that it wasnt in her nature to stray she stepped back from me her arms folded across her stomach ready i asked her quietly she nodded and we started walking neither of us said anything until we reached the blue beetle you know what harry she said quietly from the other side of the car i know i told her like you said love hurts we got into the beetle and headed back to chicago aftermath original novella takes place an hour or two after the end of changes to quote a great man nuff said i cant believe hes dead harry dresden professional wizard it sounds like a bad joke like most people at first i figured it was just his schtick his approach to marketing himself as a unique commodity in private investigation a job market that isnt ever exactly teeming with business well thats not entirely true i knew better id seen something that the rules of the normal world just couldnt explain and he was right in the middle of it but i did what everyone does when they run into the supernatural i told myself that it was dark and that i didnt really know what i had seen no one else had witnessed anything to support me they would call me crazy if i tried to tell anyone about it by the time a week had passed i had half convinced myself that i hallucinated the whole thing a year later i was almost certain it had been some kind of trick an illusion pulled off by a smarmy but savvy con but he was for real believe me i know several years and several hundred nightmares later i know he was the real thing god i was already thinking about him in the past tense sergeant murphy said one of the lab guys dresden was almost one of our own in special investigations wed pulled every string we had to get a forensics team on the site excuse me sergeant murphy i turned to face the forensic tech he was cute in a notquitegrown puppyish kind of way the id clipped to his lapel said his name was jarvis he looked nervous im murphy i said um right he swallowed and looked around i dont know how to tell you this but my boss said i shouldnt be talking to you he said you were on suspension i looked at him calmly he wasnt more than average height but that put his head about eight and a half inches over mine he still had that whippet thinness that some twentysomethings hang on to for a while after their teenage years i smiled at him and tried to put him at ease i get it i said i wont tell anyone if you wont he licked his lips nervously jarvis i said please i gestured at the bloodstain on the exterior of the cabin of a dumpy little secondhand boat the lettering on which proclaimed it the water beetle he is my friend i didnt say wasnot out loud you dont ever do that until youve found the remains its professional jarvis exhaled and looked around i thought he looked as if he might throw up the blood spatter suggests that whoever was struck there took a hit somewhere in his upper torso its impossible to be sure buthe swallowedit was a heavy spray maybe an arterial hit or maybe not i said he was too young to notice the way i was grasping at straws or maybe not he agreed theres not enough blood on the site to call it a murder but we think most of it we didnt find the round it went through the victim and both walls of the uh boat there its probably in the lake i grunted its something i picked up over a fifteenyear career in law enforcement men have managed to create a complex and utterly impenetrable secret language consisting of monosyllabic sounds and partial wordsand they are apparently too thick to realize it exists maybe they really are from mars id been able to learn a few martian phrases over time and one of the useful ones was the grunt that meant i acknowledge that ive heard what you said please continue smears on the deck and the guardrail suggest that the victim went over the side and into the water jarvis continued his tone subdued theres a dive team on the way but i used the martian phrase for you neednt continue i know what youre talking about it sounded a lot like the first grunt to anyone without a y chromosome but i really did get it lake michigan is jealous and protective of her dead the waters depth and the yearround cold temperatures that go with it mean that corpses dont tend to produce many gasses as they decompose as a result they often dont bob to the surface like you see in all those cop shows on cable they just lie on the bottom no one knows how many poor souls earthly remains rest in the quiet cold of michigans depths it hasnt been long i said even if he fell off the back into the open water he cant have gone far yes maam jarvis said um if youll excuse me i nodded at him and shoved my hands into the pockets of my coat night was coming on but it wouldnt make a lot of differencethe lake wasnt exactly crystal clear on the best days the divers would have to use flashlights day or night even though we werent more than fifty yards from shore on the docks of the marina the water beetle called home that would limit the area of water they could search at any given moment the cold would impose limits on their dive time sonar might or might not be useful this close to chicago the lake floor was cluttered with all kinds of things theyd have to get lucky to get a good radar hit and find him if he was in there hed been there for several hours and the wind had been rising the whole time stirring the surface of the lake harrys corpse would have had plenty of time to fall to the bottom and begin to drift the dive team probably wasnt going to find him theyd try but dammit i stared hard at the lengthening shadows and tried to make my tears evaporate through sheer will im very sorry sergeant jarvis said i replied with the martian for thank you for your concern but at the moment i need some space that ones easy i just stared forward without saying anything and after a moment jarvis nodded and toddled off to continue working a while later stallings was standing next to me wearing his badge prominently out on his coat after id been busted back to sergeant stallings had replaced me as the head of special investigations chicagos unofficial monster squad we dealt with the weird stuff no one would accept and then lied about what wed been doing so that everything fit neatly into a report stallings was a big rawboned man comfortably solid with age his hair thinning on top he had a mustache like magnums id been his boss for nearly seven years we got along well with each other he never treated me like his most junior subordinatemore like an adviser who had been made available to the new commander the forensics boys were sealing the doors of the little boat with crime scene tape having taken enough samples and photographs to choke a rhinoceros before anyone spoke hey he said hey he exhaled through his nose and said hospital checks have come up with zip i grimaced they would when harry got hurt the hospital was the last place he wanted to be he felt too vulnerable thereand he worried that the way a wizards presence disrupted technology could hurt or kill someone on life support or do harm to some innocent bystander but there was so much blood on the boat if he was that badly hurt he couldnt have gone anywhere on his own power and down here anyone who had found him would have called emergency services and the blood trail led to the lake i shook my head several times i didnt want to believe it but you cant make fact into fiction no matter how much denial youve got to draw upon stallings sighed again then he said youre on suspension murphy and this is a crime scene not until we know a crimes been committed i said we dont absolutely know anyones been hurt or killed right now its just a mess god dammit he said his voice weary youre a civilian now karrin get away from the fucking scene before someone gets word to rudolph about this and infernal affairs comes down here to toss your ass in jail on any other day i would think you were talking sense i said i dont care what you think he said i care what you do and what youre going to do is turn around walk over to your car get in it go home and get a good nights sleep you look like a hundred miles of bad road through hell see most women would have been a little put out by a remark like that especially if they were wearing slacks that flattered their hips and butt with a darling red silk blouse and a matching silver necklace and two bracelets studded with tiny sapphires which theyd inherited from their grandmother and more makeup than they usually wore in a week and new perfume and great shoes by any measure that kind of remark was insulting when you were dressed for a date it was more so but stallings wasnt trying to piss me off the insult was martian too for something along the lines of i have so much regard for you that i went out of my way to create this insult so that we can have the fun of a mildly adversarial conversation see how much i care john i replied using his first name you are a sphincter douche translation i love you too he gave me a quiet smile and nodded men he was right there was nothing i could do here i turned my back on the last place id seen harry dresden and walked back to my car it had been a long day starting most of two days before including a gunfight at the fbi buildingwhich the news was still going insane about especially after the office building bombing a couple of days before thatand a pitched battle at an ancient mayan temple that ended in the utter destruction of the vampires of the red court and after that things had gotten really dangerous id shown up to that ratty old boat where harry was crashing dressed in the outfit stallings had insulted harry and i were supposed to go grab a few drinks and and see what happened instead id found nothing but his blood i didnt think i would sleep but two days plus of physical and psychological stress made it inevitable nightmares came to haunt me but they didnt make much of an impression id seen worse in the real world i did cry though i remember thatwaking up in the middle of the night from bad dreams that were old hat by now sobbing my eyes out in pure reaction to the events of the past two days it happens you feel overwhelmed you cry you feel better and you go back to sleep if you dont get it dont ask it doesnt really translate into martian i woke up to a firm knock at my front door i got out of bed my sig in my hand and flicked a quick glance out the window at the backyard it was empty and there was no one at the door that led into my kitchen only after i had checked my six oclock did i go to the front door glancing quickly out the window in the hall as i went i recognized the stout young man standing on the porch and i relaxed somewhat since i slept in an oversized tshirt i grabbed a pair of sweats and hopped into them then went to see the werewolf standing at my door will borden didnt look like a werewolf he was about five five five six and built like an armored car all flat heavy muscle he wore glasses his brown hair was cut short and neat and you would never have guessed from looking at him that he and his friends had been responsible for a forty percent drop in crime in a sixblock radius around the university of chicagoand that didnt even take into account the supernatural predators that had been driven away and that now avoided the neighborhood strictly speaking i probably should have arrested him as a known vigilante of course strictly speaking i wasnt a cop anymore i wouldnt be arresting anybody ever again that thought hit my stomach like a lead wrecking ball and no amount of bravado or discipline could keep it from hurting so i turned away from it i answered the door and said hello will sergeant murphy he said nodding at me got a minute its early i said not bothering to correct his form of address i need your help he said i took a deep breath through my nose it wasnt as though i had to go to work it wasnt as though i had a hot date waiting for me part of me longed to slam the door in wills face and go back to bed id always thought that kind of selfish reaction had been a fairly small portion of my character today it felt huge the house was silent and empty behind me okay i said come in i seated him at the kitchen table and went back to my room to put on clothes that looked a little less pajamalike when i came back out will had gotten the coffeepot going and brew was already a finger deep in the little glass pitcher i popped some bread in the toaster and watched it carefully to make sure it didnt burn my toaster was an old one but even so i didnt need to be watching it it just gave me something to do until the coffee was done i took the finished toast and coffee to the table a bit for each of us and set out a jar of strawberry preserves will accepted the food readily and naturally wolfed it down we did all of that in silence okay i said settling back in my chair and studying him what help georgias gone he said simply i kept myself from wincing georgia was wills wife theyd been together since they were barely out of high school theyd learned to be werewolves together apparently i liked them both tell me work had me out of town he said omaha georgia is getting ready to defend her dissertation she stayed home we both watched the newsabout dresdens office building and the terrorists at the fbi we were worried but i got a call from her late last night she was his face became pale she was almost incoherent terrified she wasnt making any sense then the call cut off abruptly his voice shook she was screaming i tried to call the cops but i nodded but if it was something bad enough to make her scream there wouldnt be much the cops could do to help and between the bombing and the attack they were all overworked anyway theyll get to it as soon as they can yeah will said so i left a message with dresdens service and came back to chicago the apartment door was broken maybe kicked in the place was a wreck he swallowed she was gone and i couldnt pick up a trail i went to harrys place but there was still smoke coming up from what was left then i came here i nodded slowly then i asked why he blinked and looked at me as if id broken out into a musical number seriously yeah he always told us that if we ever needed him but couldnt find him we were supposed to go to you that you were the person in this city who could help us better than anyone else i stared at him for a minute then i said yeah i can just see him saying that i shook my head and never bothering to mention it to me ill give will credithe was obviously terrified but he managed to try a joke he probably thought you were formidable enough without the confidence boost from something like that like i need his approval to be confident i muttered i studied will for a moment i knew him well enough to know there was something off in his behavior he was too quiet will wasnt the sort of man to sit at a table fiddling with his napkin when his wife was missing and quite possibly in danger he was terrified frightened to such a degree that it was nearly paralytic i recognized the look id seen it in the mirror often enough what arent you telling me will i asked quietly he closed his eyes and shivered as a tear tracked down each cheek georgias pregnant he whispered seven months i nodded then i pushed the rest of my coffee away and got up let me get my coat its supposed to be nice today will said with the coat i can carry more guns i said oh he said right wills apartment was a wreck the lock had been smashed though the door was still in one piece the furniture was askew a few things were broken paperback books had been knocked off a shelf a laptop computer lay on its side a blue screen of death glaring from its monitor a mug of cocoa had been spilled and lay in a drying puddle on the hardwood floor i looked back and forth for a moment frowning the spill lay near the laptop and both were to the right side of a comfortablelooking recliner which had been bowled over backward there was a therapeutic contoured pillow lying a few feet beyond that so i said maybe it went like this the attacker kicks in the door theres a partial impression of a shoes tread on it georgias sitting in her chair there working on her computer i frowned some more she drink a lot of cocoa no will said only when shes really upset she jokes about it being selfmedication so shed been upset already even before the attack she was sitting in the chair with her laptop and her cocoa and i walked over to the fallen chair and found a simple household wireless phone lying behind it something besides the prospect of an attack had upset her i said she took the time to make a cup of cocoa and you dont do that when theres a maniac at the door she made herself a comfort drink and huddled up in her chair to call you do you have any idea what could have upset her like that will shook his head normally no but shes been on a hormone crazy train the past few months shes overreacted to a lot of things i nodded and stood there just trying to absorb it all to get an image of how things might have fit together i pictured georgia a long lean willowy woman curled up in the recliner her face blotchy her eyes red almost curling up around her baby and the sound of her husbands voice someone broke the door in with a single kick and rushed her georgia was a fighter accustomed to combat even if it was mostly when she was in the form of another creature she used the first defense she could bring to bearher legs as her attacker rushed her she kicked out with both legs trying to shove him away but he had too much momentum and instead georgias kick had flung her chair over backward a pregnant woman nowhere near as lithe or graceful as she usually was she turned and tried to get away theres no blood i said the attacker had dragged her out by main force either hed beaten her with his fists and feeteasy on a pregnant woman who would instinctively curl her body around her unborn child so that blows landed mostly on the back ribs and buttocksor else hed choked her unconscious either way hed subdued her without apparently drawing blood then they left i shook my head what do you think will asked i think you dont want to know no i dont he said but i need to i nodded i repeated my theory and its supporting evidence it made will go pale and silent how was her handtohand i asked him fair she used to teach womens selfdefense seminars on campus i dont think shes ever had to use it in earnest his voice trailed off as he stared at the fallen chair what did you find out that i couldnt i asked i mean with the whole werewolf thing he shook his head the human brain isnt wired for serious scentprocessing he said not like a wolfs anyway shifting sort of turns up the volume in your nose but its really hard to sort things out i can follow a trail if im on it soon enough but when a bunch of scents get mixed together its a crap shoot in here theres new paint spilled cocoa the last day or two of meals he shrugged magic never seems to make things any easier i said will snorted faintly dresden keeps saying the same thing i felt an odd pain in my chest i ignored it i walked over to the apartments little kitchen and studied it for a minute then i said so shes a cocoa junkie well shes functional she drink instant are you kidding the pitch and cadence of his voice changed a little becoming slightly higher and more clearly inflected in what was probably an unconscious imitation of his wife its the spam of cocoas i got a pen out of my pocket and used it to lift a second cup this one with a bit of lipstick smeared on the rim the bottom of the cup was sticky with the residue of real cocoa the kind you make from milk and chocolate some of it was still liquid enough to stir as the cup shifted i showed it to him georgia doesnt wear makeup he half whispered i know i said and the cocoa in this cup has been sitting out for about the same length of time as the cocoa in the other cup so the next question we need to answer who was drinking cocoa with georgia when the door broke in will shook his head either its the attackers scent or its someone we know someone who is over a lot i nodded redhead right the one who likes wearing the tight shirts andi will said and marcy she moved back to town after kirbys funeral their scents are here too marcy little mousey girl brown hair she and andi had kind of a thing in school liberal werewolves i said two words rarely seen adjacent to each other lots of people experiment in college will said you probably did yeah i said i tried getting into watching european football it didnt work out neither did marcy and andi bad blood there not that i know of they were still roommates after they split but marcy left town will nodded she wanted into the animation business she pulled a job at skywalker seriously cool stuff so cool that she left it to come back here will shrugged a shoulder she said it was more important for her to be here to help us and she lived in a cardboard box or something socked most of her money into the bank says the interest is enough to get by on for now i decided to remain skeptical on that story you happen to remember if either of them wears this color lipstick he shook his head sorry not really the kind of thing i notice if i remembered right most guys who looked at andi wouldnt be entirely certain whether or not she had lips afterward but shed probably have back problems at some point okay i said maybe the cops will be here soon and maybe not either way i dont think we should wait around for them will nodded what are we going to do this isnt exactly highdollar soundproof housing someone in this building must have heard or seen something maybe will said though he didnt sound confident i turned to leave the apartment and tried not to notice the little crib and changing table that had already been set up just beyond the open door of the apartments second bedroom we wont know until we ask come on canvassing a building isnt particularly fun work its awkward boring repetitive and frustrating most of the people you talk to dont want to be talking to you and want out of the conversation as quickly as possibleor else theyre just delighted to be talking to you and want to keep talking to you even though they dont know a damn thing you have to ask the same questions over and over again get the same answers over and over again and generally look like youre an idiot without a single clue and you pretty much are or you wouldnt be canvassing the building in the first place you grow a thick skin fast for that kind of thing when you do police work this is getting us nowhere will said after the umpteenth door his frustration and worry finally boiling over to the point that it was beginning to outweigh his terror for his wife and child he turned to face me his stance unconsciously confrontational his shoulders squared his chest thrust out his hands clenched into fists we need to do something else ah masculine assertivenessive got nothing against it as long as it helps get the job done instead of making it harder yeah i asked him you think wed be better off walking down the street calling her name will nno but but what i asked him keeping my tone reasonable while facing him with an equal amount of readytokickyourass martian body language you do not intimidate me you came to me for help im giving it to you either you work with me or you tell me you want to go it alone right now he backed off unclenching his hands and looking away i relaxed as well will hadnt meant to deliver a threat to me as such but he was a hell of a lot bigger and stronger than i was stronger isnt everything but simple mass and power mean a lot in a fight and will had the ferocity and killer instinct to make them count even more heavily than most hed never consideredhell probably never noticedthe full depth of the statement he was making with his stance and clenched fists its another in a long list of things that martians hardly ever think about almost any woman knows that almost any man is stronger than she is oh men know theyre stronger but they seldom actually stop to think through the implications of that simple realityimplications that are both unnerving and virtually omnipresent if you arent a martian you think about life differently when you know that half the people you see have the physical power to do things to you regardless of whether you intend to allow itand even implied threats of physical violence have to be taken seriously will hadnt intended to frighten me he just wanted to find his wife i know its frustrating i told him but its the best way to find out something we didnt know before weve been through the whole building he snapped the most weve got is a neighbor a couple of floors up who heard a thump which tells us there wasnt much of a fight i said or theyd have probably heard it fights are loud will even when only one person is fighting a building like this everyone knows it when the neighbor beats his wife somebody should have heard her scream maybe it wasnt as loud as you thought it was right in your ear and it upset you if it ended quickly enough it might not even have woken anyone up i looked out the hallway window toward more of the same sort of apartment building across the parking lot will wasnt going to be terribly helpful in his current state im going to check across the lot see if anyone happened to see or hear anything last night i want you to call andi and marcy get them over here if you can reach them after that go over your phones caller id georgias cell phones caller id her email see if anyone odd has been in contact with her okay he said frowningbut nodding control your emotions will stay calm i told him calms the best way to think and thinkings the best way to find georgia and help her he inhaled deeply still nodding look sergeant one of the guys in that building maybe you shouldnt go over there by yourself i smiled sweetly at him he lifted his empty hands as if id pointed a gun right sorry three buildings had apartments in them that faced out on the common parking lot in general and had a view of the bordens apartment in particular i stood in the parking lot looking up at the windows for a moment and then started with the building on the left most of an hour later i hadnt learned anything else and i figured out my main problem i wasnt harry dresden dresden would have looked around with a vague expression on his face and wandered around bumping into things and barely comporting himself with professional caution even at a crime scene hed ask a few questions that wouldnt make much sense on the surface make a few remarks he thought were witty and glibly insult anyone who appeared to be a repressive authority figure then hed do something that didnt make any goddamn sense and produce results out of thin air like a magician pulling a rabbit out of his hat if harry were here he could have taken some hairs out of georgias hairbrush done something stupidlooking with them and followed her across the town or the state or for all i knew to the other side of the universe he could have told me more about what had happened at georgias than i could have known maybe even identified the perp in general or specifically and if things got hot when we went after the bad guy he would have been there throwing fire and lightning around as if they were his own personal toys created especially and exclusively for him to play with watching dresden operate was usually one of two things mildly amusing or positively terrifying on a scene his whole personal manner always made me think of autistic kids he never met anyones eyes for more than a flickering second he moved with the sort of exaggerated caution of someone who was several sizes larger than normal keeping his hands and arms in close to his body he spoke a little bit softly as if apologizing for the resonant baritone of his voice but when something caught his attention he changed his dark intelligent eyes would glitter and his gaze became something so intense that it could start a fire during the situations that changed from investigation to desperate struggle his whole being shifted in the same way his stance widened becoming more aggressive and confident and his voice rose up to become a ringing trumpet that could have been clearly heard from opposite ends of a football stadium quirky nerd gone terrifying icon present not many vanillas as he called nominally normal humans had seen dresden standing his ground in the fullness of his power if we had more of us would have taken him seriouslybut i had decided that for his sake if nothing else it was a good thing that his full capabilities went unrecognized dresdens power would have scared the hell out of most people just like it had scared me it wasnt the kind of fear that makes you scream and run thats fairly mild as fear goes thats scooby doo fear no seeing dresden in action filled you with the fear that you had just become a casualty of evolutionthat you were watching something far larger and infinitely more dangerous than yourself and that your only chance of survival was to kill it immediately before you were crushed beneath a power greater than you would ever know i had come to terms with it not everyone would in fact it might be for that very reason that someone had put the hit on him a bullet that strikes from long range and goes cleanly through a human body and then through the hull of a boat twice leaving a series of neat holes is almost certainly a very highpowered rifle round a professional rifleman shooting from a good way out was one of the things dresden had acknowledged had a real chance of taking him out cleanly he might be a wizard a wielder of tremendous power and knowledge as if theyre any different but he wasnt immortal quick tough tricky as hell sure but not untouchable not in any number of senses i should know having touched himeven if i hadnt touched him anywhere near soon or often enough and now i never would dammit i pushed thoughts of the man out of my head before i started crying again its hard enough to pull off an air of authority when youre five feet tall without also having red watery eyes and a running nose dresden was gone his cheesy jokes and his corny sense of humor were gone his ability to know the unknowable to fight the unfightable and to find the unfindable was gone the rest of us were just going to have to carry on as best we could without him i knocked on doors and talked to a lot of people most of them collegeage kids attending school in town i got a whole lot of nothing about georgia though i did get tips on some drug sales that had gone down in the parking lot id pass them on to the right people on the force where they would become more scenery for the endless march of the war on drugs and wouldnt amount to anything the tips did prove the point id made to will though neighbors see things maybe i just hadnt talked to the right neighbor yet when i hit building three i felt the change in climate as i went through the door it was more rundown than the other apartments some fresh graffiti marked an interior wall more of the doors had double dead bolts on them the carpet was old and stained the pane of a window had been broken out and replaced with a piece of wood the whole place screamed that unpleasant sorts were lurking about making the buildings super reluctant to maintain the halls and foyer maybe forcing him to continue dealing with problems and damage over and over again i couldnt hear any music thats unusual in buildings like that one mostly inhabited by students kids love their music however mindnumbing or earrending it might be and you can almost always hear at least a beat thumping somewhere nearby not here though i kept my eyes open tried to grow a new pair for the back of my head and started knocking on doors no lied a small fragilelooking woman who said her name was maria a resident of the third floor she hadnt opened the door more than the security chain allowed i didnt hear or see anything i tried to make my smile reassuring maam the way this usually works is that i ask you a question and then you tell me a lie if you give me a dishonest answer before i have the chance to ask the question it offends my sense of propriety her head shook in quick jerky spasms as her eyes widened nno im not lying i dont know anything maria tried to shut the door i got my boot into it first youre lying i said gently youre scared i get that ive gotten the same treatment from almost everyone in the building she looked away from me as if seeking an escape route ill ccall the police i am the police i said which was technically true they hadnt fired me yet oh god she said she shook her head more and more desperation in the gesture i dont want to be i cant be seen talking to you go away i lifted my eyebrows maam please if youre in trouble i wasnt sure shed even heard me id seen women like her often enough to know the look she was terrified of something probably a husband or boyfriend or a string of husbands and boyfriends and maybe a father before that she was living scared and shed been doing it for a long time fear had ground away at her and the only way shed been able to survive was by capitulating maria was damaged goods she shook her head sobbing and just started pushing at the door i was about to pull my foot out and go away you cant force someone to accept your help is there some kind of problem here asked a boozeroughened voice i turned to face a wooly mammoth of a man he was well over six feet tall and probably weighed three of me though more of it was mass than muscle he wore a white undershirt that showed off his belly and a buttondown shirt with the name ray embroidered on one breast he looked at me and at the apartment door and scowled mary you got some kind of problem maria had gone still like a rabbit that suspects a predator is nearby no ray she whispered its nothing sure as hell dont sound like nothing ray said he folded his arms im trying to get the city out here to fix the lights on the street and the fuse box and youre making enough noise to fuck up my conversation all the way down the hall im sorry ray maria whispered something flickered behind rays eyes an ugly little light jesus i give you all that extra time to pay off on the rent and you treat me like this maria sounded as though someone were strangling her it was an accident it wont happen again well talk he said maria flinched as if the words had smeared her with grime my hand clenched into a fist well dammit id seen rays type before toobullies who never managed to outgrow the playground people who liked having power over others and who controlled them through fear he was big and he thought that made him more powerful than everyone else the worm probably had a record probably had done some time probably for something fairly gutless for guys like ray sometimes prison only convinces them what dangerous badasses they are serving as a confirmation and validation of their status as predators ray looked from maria to me with that same ugly light in his eyes youre the super i asked he grunted in martian fuck off and die its an expressive language martian whats it to you he asked im the curious sort i said fuck off and die ray said in english this time get out he looked past me to maria close that goddamn door iive been trying maria said my foot and my heavy black work boot were both still between the door and its frame flat rage hit rays eyes and it was aimed at maria that made up my mind for me ray was obviously an abuser and one who took out his frustrations wherever he damn well pleased instead of upon their source he was going to be unhappy with me and when he realized he couldnt take it out on me maria would be the recipient of his rage it more or less obliged me to protect her and i wasnt going to enjoy doing it even one little bit either honest get your foot out of the door before i tear it off ray growled suppose i dont i said last chance ray said his eyes narrowing to slits he was breathing faster now and i could see sweat beading on his brow get out of here now or what i asked mildly you gonna hit me ray selfcontrol was not one of rays strong suits he spat out the word bitch spraying spittle with it as he did he moved toward me all threehundredandchange pounds of him his hands balled into fists the size of cantaloupes there was something ray didnt know about me i know martial arts im not a truly advanced student but ive practiced every day since i was seventeen i started with aikido then wing chun then jujitsu ive studied kali savate krav maga tae kwan do judo boxing and shaolin kung fu it sounds impressive laid out like that but it really isnt once you get two or three arts down the next dozen or so come pretty quick since they are all addressing the same problem and because human bodies are human bodies regardless of which continent youre on they share characteristic motions and timing ray swept a fist at me in a looping punch a kiddieleague fighter could have avoided so i took my foot out of marias door and ducked it he kept coming forward in a fleshy avalanche while i went under his arm and took a pair of steps to one side on a diagonal angle he tried to grab me as i slipped loose but he wound up losing his balance badly in doing it i gave him a helpful push with the first two knuckles of my left fist right in the kidney ray smashed into the drywall and left dents i thought about how long it had taken him to build up speed and i took several steps back he turned screaming a vicious oath and came at me gathering sluggish momentum like an overloaded tractor trailer i had to back up another pair of steps to give him enough space to move into a wobbling run he didnt bother with a punch this time he simply grabbed at me with his huge arms i timed it carefully and dropped to the floor at the last instant sweeping my leg out in an almostgentle kick that did nothing except prevent his right foot from proceeding forward and to the floor in proper rhythm with his left the bigger they are the harder they fall ray fell pretty hard he staggered up to his hands and knees and swiped a paw at me in another grab jesus christ basic selfdefense instructors would kill to have a video of this he was coming at me with every stupidaggressive move he possibly could as if working his way through a list there were a lot of things i could have done with the gift hed made me of his hand but in real conflict i dont get fancy i go with simple fast and reliable i let him grab my wrist then broke his grip wrapped him into a wrist lock and applied pressure that kind of hold has very little to do with muscle or mass that one is all about exploiting the machinery of the human body it wouldnt have mattered if ray was in shape he could have looked like schwarzenegger as conan and he would have been just as helpless human joints are all built to more or less the same specifications out of similar materials no matter how much muscle or lard is on top of them theyre vulnerable if you know how to use them against your opponent i did three hundred plus pounds of body odor stupid and mean slammed down onto the worn dirty carpeting in the hallway as if dropped from a crane while he lay there stunned i twisted his wrist straight up and behind him keeping his arm locked straight with my other hand from there i could literally take his arm out of his shoulder socket with about as much effort as it would take to push a grocery cart and i could make him hurta lot if need bein order to discourage him from trying any more stupid moves being ray he tried stupid again screaming and thrashing against the lock i sighed and kept control and he and his face relived his crushing impact with the carpet we repeated that several times until the lesson began to drill its way through to rayhe wasnt going anywhere it would hurt if he tried so ive been talking to people in several buildings i said in a calm conversational tone ray was puffing like an engine i was wondering if you could tell me if you saw anything odd or unusual last night probably between two and three in the morning youre breaking my fucking arm ray growledor tried to it had been watered down with whine no no no i said if i broke your arm youd hear a snapping sound it sounds a lot like a tree branch breaking actually though a little more muffled what you have to worry about is me dislocating your arm at the shoulder and elbow thats worse overall just as painful and it takes a hell of a lot more effort to recover jesus ray said are you telling me that jesus was visiting between two and three last night im dubious ray i didnt see nothing he said a few panting seconds later all right jesus christ i didnt see nothing aha i said you sound like an honest man i used my bracing arm to reach for my coat pocket then tossed my badge down onto the floor in front of him he stared at it for a long second and then his face went white heres what happens i said very quietly youre going to resign from your job youll write a very nice letter to your boss and then you get out of this building youre gone by noon tomorrow you cant do that he said i can do whatever i want i said which of us do you think the judge will believe ray that isnt how i approached law enforcement it isnt how any good cop does either but the criminals are always willing even eager to believe the absolute worst about cops i think it makes them feel better if they can convince themselves that the police are just like them only with badges and a paycheck youre going one way or another you dont play ball i send the city inspector in here to verify all the code violations on this building fire extinguishers are missing the smoke detectors are years old and most of the ones that arent missing entirely are just hanging from their wires youve got mold and fungus issues all over the place lights are out theres trash piling up outside i yawned on top of that there are drug deals going down in your parking lot ray i figure youre in on that no he said no im not sure you are it fits you doesnt it and here you are assaulting an officer i shook my head sadly so when the building fails inspection maybe even makes it into the paper youll be fired anyway and on top of that ill finger you in the drug deals ill press charges for assault how many strikes do you already have on you big guy can you handle two more youre bluffing he said maybe i admitted on the other hand maybe i just give john marcone a call and tell him how youre helping some of his streetlevel guys run some deals behind his back invoking the name of marcone to a chicago criminal is as significant as invoking the name of a saint to a devout catholic hes the biggest fish in the pond the head of organized crime in chicagoand damn good at it his people fear him and even cops take him very very seriously one day hed slip up and cpd the fbi or maybe the irs would nail him until then he was the deadliest predator in the jungle ray shuddered look up ray i said quietly he did and he saw what i had seen a moment before doors were open all up and down the hallway people stood in them men and women children parents the elderly they all stood there silently and watched a little blond woman handling big mean ray as if he were an unruly child their eyes were very hard and there wasnt any fear in them now look at them ray i said he did he shuddered again then his body stopped straining and he sagged down ill go he said fucking right you will i shoved on his arm and he screamed with painbut i hadnt dislocated it i only did it to give myself a moment to pick up my badge and step out of grab range just in case he was too dumb to quit he wasnt he simply lay there like a beached shark ill be checking back here ray regularly if i think youve harmed any of these people stolen or broken their propertyhell if i hear that you gave them a dirty look i am going to find you and shove a bundle of rusty rebar up your ass i promise i took out one of my business cards now obsolete i supposed and wrote down a phone number i took the card to maria and held it out for her if you have any trouble you call this number on the back you ask for lieutenant stallings tell him murphy gave you the number maria bit her lip then she looked at ray and back to me she took the card with a hurried nervous little motion and scampered back closing her apartment door several locks clicked shut i didnt say anything else i walked out of the building i was halfway across the lot heading back to wills place when i heard quick footsteps coming behind me i turned with one hand close to my sig but relaxed when i recognized maria she stopped in front of me and said i ssaw something i nodded and waited there were some odd sounds late last night like like thumps and a little while later a car rolled in it pulled up to the building across the lot and a man got out and left it running like he wasnt worried about it being stolen did you recognize him i asked maria shook her head but he was big almost as big as ray but he you know he moved better he was in shape and he was wearing an expensive suit what else can you tell me about him i asked maria shrugged not not anything really i saw him come out again right away then he got into the car and drove away i didnt see any plates or anything im sorry nothing to be sorry about i said quietly thank you she nodded and turned to scurry back toward her building then she stopped and looked back at me i dont know if it matters she said but the man had one of those army haircuts i stiffened a little do you remember what color hair red she said like bright orangered she swallowed if it matters it matteredbut i didnt want to scare her so i nodded and smiled then said thank you maria seriously she tried to smile back and did pretty well then she looked around her as if uncomfortable standing in so much open space and hurried back to her building a big guy in a suit with a bright red crew cutit was almost word for word the short description in the notes of the file that cpd kept for a man named hendricks hendricks was a former college football player he weighed upward of three hundred pounds none of it excess he had been under suspicion for several mysterious disappearances mostly of criminal figures who seemed to have earned his bosss displeasure and his boss had presumably sent him to will and georgias building late last night but why to get an answer i was going to have to talk to hendrickss boss i had to go see gentleman john marcone the police know where marcone can be reached finding him doesnt do diddly to let us nail him the fact that he has his fingers in so many pies means that not only do we have to work against marcone and his shadowy empire but we have our own superiors and politicians breathing down our necks as well oh they never say anything directly like stop arresting marcones most profitable pimps instead we get a long speech about racial and socioeconomic profiling we get screams from political action committees we get vicious editorial pieces in the newspapers and on tv we mostly stay quiet and keep plugging away at our jobs experience has taught us that hardly anyone ever cares what we think or have to say they demand answers but they dont want to listen im not saying that cops are a bunch of white knights im just saying that the politicians can spin things all sorts of ways if it means that theyre guaranteed stacks of cash for their campaign chestsor that marcones blackmailers wont expose some dark secret from their pasts i still had friends in the cpd i called one who worked in the organized crime division and asked him where i could find marcone aw murph malone said he sounded weary this aint the time since when have you been big on punctuality i asked i need this its about dresden malone grunted dresden had saved his uncle from some kind of possession or and i still have trouble with the concept when i say it an evil enchantment the elder malone had been suffering to a degree i had never seen elsewhere cops and medics and so on couldnt do a thing for the man dresden had walked in shooed everyone else out of the room and five minutes later malone was sane again if worse for wear it had made an impression on malones nephew okay he said give me a couple minutes they got everyone with a star running around the city looking for bin laden or bigfoot or whoever else might have blown up that building i aint slept in two days and the fbi is coming down like a freaking cloud of angry mama birds after what happened at their office he cleared his throat um i heard you might have been around there i grunted neutrally weird stuff huh i sighed internal affairs or the fbi might still have my phone tapped and i was reluctant to say much on the other hand what were they going to do take my career away serious weirdness the same flavor as the kind that hit the old velvet room that was where dresden had fought a whole bunch of vampires and wound up burning down the entire house malone whistled was it as bad as that guy down in the si holding tank the kid meant the loupgarou we were stupid enough to lock harley macfinn in a normal cell he transformed into this hideous ice agelooking thing it was half the size of an old buick and it could only loosely be called a wolf brave men had died that night fighting with weapons that were utterly useless against the loupgarou carmichael my old partner had died there all but throwing himself into the things jaws to buy me a few seconds i feel nauseated when i think about it i dont know really things happened too fast i rounded up some people went down a stairway and out swat went in but by the time they did there was nothing left but staff hiding in closets and under desks and a lot of bodies jesus he said malone i need this i pressed firmly call you back in a minute he said i put my phone back into my coat pocket and looked at will we were both standing on the sidewalk in front of his apartment this is crazy will said quietly vampires hitting a government building blowing up buildings in a major city they dont do that if they followed all the rules they wouldnt be bad guys i said its just he swallowed i really wish harry was around hed have a take on it that makes two of us will shook his head ive been too crazy to even ask where is he i glanced at him and away keeping my face still the color drained out of wills cheeks no hes not it doesnt work like that we dont know where he is i said he was staying out on that ratty boat he uses until he could find somewhere else to sleep we found blood bullet holes blood trail leading into the lake will shook his head but if he was hurt he wouldnt go to a hospital hed call waldo butters he took his cell phone from his pocket hes in my contacts we can call i know about butters will i interrupted gently i called him first thing after i saw the blood he hasnt heard from harry oh my oh my god will said his voice a whisper i felt like id just doubletapped santa claus maybe he isnt dead i said maybe it was somebody else with the same blood type who got shot or maybe dresden pulled one of his tricks and just vanished whoosh off to a wizard hospital somewhere yeah will said nodding yeah maybe i mean he can do all kinds of things right all kinds of things i said including dying but i didnt say that detective malone was good to his word and five minutes later we were heading for a building on the north edge of bucktown another renovation project gentleman johnnies mostly legitimate business interests had secured he had purchased refurbished updated and preserved more than a dozen buildings in the city over the past several years hed been feted and decorated and honored at various society functions as a man who was preserving the native beauty of chicago architecture saving it from being destroyed and forgotten et cetera if you didnt consider the drugs gambling prostitution extortion and other shadow franchises he ruled i guess he was a real citizen hero contractors were hard at work on the building as we came in and a security guard in a white shirt and black pants walked over to us with a frown as i entered the building will was at my back i hoped that if things went nutty i wouldnt have to drag him with me when i shot my way out i felt myself smile at that image mostly because of its fantasy content if blood was spilled in marcones headquarters i wouldnt live long enough to drag anybody out no trespassers the guard said firmly this is a construction site dangerous youll have to leave i eyed the man and said im here to see john marcone the guard eyed me then he got on his little radio and spoke into it a moment later a voice squawked an answer mr marcone is not available yes he is i said go tell him karrin murphy is here to see him im afraid not he said youll have to leave he had a gun a mm glock i noted i took out the little leather wallet with my police id in it and said if you make me open this it gets official there will be official questions official paperwork and lots of men in uniform trespassing all over your site i held the wallet out as if presenting a crucifix to a vampire fingers poised as if to open it do you want to be the one who gives your boss that kind of headache his eyes moved from me to will he looked quickly away then he took a few steps back toward the interior of the building and had a low rather emphatic conversation with his radio i folded my arms and tapped one foot impatiently would you really do that will asked me cant i said im getting fired but they dont know that will made a choking sound the guard came back and said through that door two floors down then take your first left and youll see it he coughed youll have to leave any weapons with me i snorted and said like hell then i brushed past him nudging him slightly aside with my shoulder as though spoiling for a fight martian for it is inappropriate for you to screw with me in any way he got the message he didnt try to stop us wills quiet chuckle followed me down the stairs marcones office was located in what appeared to be a dining hall the room was huge and tiled and several contractorsmost of them brawnier and more heavily tattooed than the average laborersat at long tables eating caterers kept several serving tables of food stocked with the same attention and care that i would have expected in a highsociety gala it was brightly lit and a raised stage at one end of the room which would presumably host a full orchestral band if one were present had instead been loaded with computers and office furniture the portrait of a busy executive marcone sat at an enormous old desk holding a phone to his ear with one shoulder his business shirt rolled up to his elbows everything about him screamed successful patriarch his suit jacket hung over the back of his chair was worth more than some small nations his loosened tie a simple silver number rather than a bright power tie bespoke confidence and strength that needed no such sartorial declaration his hands were broad and looked strong there were scars on his knuckles his short conservatively cut hair was dark except for just enough silver at his temples to announce a man in his physical and mental prime he was well built and obviously kept himself in shape and his features were regular and appealing he was by no means beautiful but his face projected strength and competence he looked like a man others would willingly follow two other people stood on the stage slightly behind him testimony to his ability to lead the first was a woman a blond amazon more than six feet tall in a grey business suit she had the legs that had been cruelly denied me at birth the bitch her name was gard and dresden had believed she was an actual literal valkyrie the other was hendricks he wasnt truly ugly but he reminded me of a gargoyle anyway a slabmuscled being with a misshapen appearance and beady eyes ready to leap into action on behalf of the man he watched over his eyes tracked me as i approached gards blue eyes focused on me for a moment then skipped past me to will she narrowed her eyes and murmured something toward marcone chicagos resident lord of the underworld gave no indication that hed heard her and i caught the last few lines of a conversation as i approached youll just have to do it yourself he paused listening then he said i dont have the proper resources for such a thingand even if i did i wouldnt waste them by sending them there blind and unprepared youll have to use your own people he paused again and then said neither of us will ever be scratching each others back mutually or otherwise i will not send my people into danger without more information should you change your mind you may feel free to contact me good day he hung up the phone and then turned toward me he had eyes the color of severaldaysold grass clippings they were opaque reptilian he made a steeple of his fingertips and said ms murphy news travels fast i said to me yes his mouth turned up in a heartless smile which are you here for work or revenge why would i want revenge on such a pillar of the community dresden he said simply i assume youre here because you think me responsible what if i am i asked then i would advise you to leave you wouldnt live long enough to take your gun from your coat and besides i said you didnt do it right and you have a perfectly rational reason to explain why you didnt even want him dead he shrugged a motion he managed to infuse with elegance no more than any other day at any rate he said i had no need to assassinate dresden hed been working diligently to get himself killed for several yearsas i pointed out to him a few days ago i kept my heart on lockdown the cocky bastards tone made me want to scream and tear out his eyes i wouldnt give him the satisfaction of knowing hed rattled me im here for another reason oh he asked politely too politely he knew hed known why i was coming since before i came through the door i stopped and played the past several hours back in my imagination before i spotted where id contacted his net maria i said she was one of yours hendricks eyed gard she rolled her eyes and withdrew a twentydollar bill from her jacket pocket she passed it to the big man hendricks pocketed it with a small complacent smile marcone took no evident note of the interaction yes the superintendent you met had been providing the means for some of my competitors to operate maria was observing his business partners so that we could track them back to their source and encourage them to operate elsewhere i stared at him hard she just let ray treat her like that and was well paid to do it marcone replied admittedly she was looking forward to closing the contract maria hadnt been a broken little mouse hell she was one of marcones troubleshooters it was a widely used euphemism for hitters in marcones outfit everyone knew it was the troubleshooters job to identify trouble within the organizationand shoot it and youre just standing there sharing all this with me i asked his expression turned bland it isnt as though im confessing to a police officer is it ms murphy i clenched my teeth i swear scratch out his goddamn eyes that was why maria came running out after meshe took enough time to call in report and ask you for instructions marcone nodded his head very slightly and she was also why hendricks showed up i continued maria saw or heard something and reported in marcone spread his hands you apprehend the situation i clenched a fist again to let out some of the anger his deliberate choice of words had inspired why will demanded suddenly stepping forward to stand beside me i noted that both will and i were under average height we stood staring up at marcone on the raised stage it was hard not to feel like an extra in the cast of oliverplease sir may i have some more why he repeated why did you send your man to my apartment marcone tilted his head slightly to regard will what are you willing to pay for such information young man wills upper lip lifted away from his teeth how about i dont tear you and your goons into hamburger marcone regarded will for maybe three seconds his face blank then he made a single swift motion i barely saw the gleam of metal as the small knife flickered across the space between them and buried itself two inches deep in wills right biceps will let out a cry and staggered my own hands went toward my coat but gard had lifted a shotgun from behind a cabinet and leveled it on me as my fingers touched the handle of my sig hendricks had produced a heavycaliber pistol from his suit though he hadnt aimed at anyone i stopped then moved my fingers slowly from my gun will ripped the knife out of his arm then turned to marcone his teeth bared dont confuse yourself with dresden mr borden marcone said his voice level and cold his eyes were something frightening pitiless you dont have the power to threaten me the instant you begin to change ms gard here will fire on ms murphyand then upon you his voice dropped to a barely audible murmur the next time you offer me a threat i will kill you wills breaths came in pained gasps each exhalation tinged with a growl but he didnt answer the room had become completely quiet the men who were eating lunch had stopped moving as if frozen in place no one looked directly at the confrontation but all of them were watching from the corners of their eyes a lot of hands were out of sight he means it will i said quietly this wont help her marcone left it like that for a moment staring at will before he settled back into his chair again his eyes becoming hooded and calm once more have you given thought to your next career move ms murphy im always looking for competent help when i find it i pay a premium for it i wondered where hed heard about my suspension but i supposed it wasnt important he had more access to the cpd than most cops i asked him calmly does the job involve beating you unconscious and throwing you into a cell forever no marcone said although it offers an excellent dental plan and combined with your pension check it would make you a moderately wealthy woman not interested i said i will never work for you never is a very long time ms murphy marcone blinked slowly and then sighed clearly the atmosphere has become unproductive he said ms gard please escort them both from the premises give them the information they want yes sir gard said she lowered the shotgun slowly then she returned it to its place behind the desk picked up a file folder from it and walked out to will and me i stooped and picked up the dropped bloodstained knife before she could reach it then i wiped it clean on a pocket handkerchief taking the blood from it before offering the handle to ms gard i was more or less ignorant about magic but i knew that gard knew more about it than i and that blood could be used in spells or incantations or whatever to the great detriment of the bleeder by wiping the blood from the blade id prevented them from having an easy way to get to will gard smiled at me very slightly and nodded her head in what looked like approval she took the knife slipped it into a pocket and then said this way please we followed her back out of the room will walked with his left hand pressed to his right biceps his expression furious there was blood but not much of it his shirt was soaking it up and hed clamped his hand hard over the wound the knife hadnt hit any major blood vessels or hed have been on the floor by now wed clean it up once we were out of here you may know ms gard said as we walked that mr marcones business interests are varied some of them have fierce competitors drugs i said extortion prostitution those are the moneymakers theres always competition for territory gard continued as if she hadnt heard me competition has increased rather dramatically of late and it has consisted of increasingly competent personnel weve also had a number of issues with involuntary employee dereliction will let out a snort does she mean what i think she means hitters i said quietly marcones been losing people i frowned but there hasnt been any particular increase in the number of homicides they havent been killed gard said frowning theyve vanished quickly quietly sometimes with minimal signs of a struggle will inhaled sharply georgia gard passed me the folder i opened it and found a simple printout of a web browser document craigslist i read for wills benefit talent search chicago standard compensation for new talent contact for delivery dates and theres an email address i know some of the business dresden was involved in yesterday she said quietly in the past twentyfour hours announcements like this have appeared in london chicago new york los angeles paris rome berlin i get the point i said something big is happening exactly gard said she glanced at will and said someone is rounding up those mortals possessed of modest supernatural gifts talent search i said yes gard said i dont know who or what is behind it we havent been able to get close whoever they are theyre quite wellinformed and they know our personnel why was hendricks at my apartment will asked maria saw someone force your wife and another young woman out of the building and into a car we know about your gifts obviously marcone sent hendricks to case the scene to look for any evidence of our opponents identity he found nothing she shook her head from here on i have only conjecture gard said ill give it to you if you want it you dont need to i told her someone started picking on the little guys in town within a few hours of dresdens shooting he never would have stood for something like that so whoever is responsible for these disappearances might well be behind the shooting too excellent gard said nodding in approval we dont really specialize in finding people she glanced down at me but you do i am not doing this for marcone i snarled we reached the buildings entrance and ms gard looked at me thoughtfully a word of advice be cautious what official channels you use for assistance we arent the only ones who have compromised the local authorities yes i said i know how it works gard frowned at me and then nodded her head a little more deeply than was usual of course my apologies i frowned at her trying to figure out what she meant there wasnt any trace of sarcasm or irony in her words or her body language damn i wasnt used to confronting nonmartians nothing to apologize for i said after a hesitation i didnt sleep well last night she studied me for a moment i cant tell if what im seeing in you is courage or despair id ask but im almost sure you wouldnt know the answer excuse me gard nodded exactly she sighed im sorry about dresden he was a brave man i suddenly felt furious that she had spoken of harry in the past tense it wasnt anything i hadnt done in my thoughtsbut i hadnt spoken the words aloud either they havent found a body i told her and i heard a fierceness in my voice i had not intended dont write him off just yet the valkyrie gave me a smile that bared her canine teeth good hunting she bade us and then went back inside the building i turned to will and said lets take care of your arm its fine will said dont play tough guy with me i said let me see will sighed then he took his hand away from the wound there was a slit in his shirtsleeve where the knife had gone in it was too high up on his arm to make rolling the sleeve up practical so i tore it a little wider and examined the wound it wasnt bleeding there was an angry swollen purple line over the puncture mark it wasnt a scab either it was just healing albeit into a damn ugly scar i whistled softly how weve been experimenting will said quietly closing an injury isnt really much different from shifting back into human form my arm still hurts like hell but i can stop bleedingprobably if it isnt too bad were not sure about the limits leaves a hell of a mark though his stomach gurgled and the energy for it has to come from somewhere im starving neat trick i thought so will kept pace beside me as we headed back to the car what do we do next food i said then we contact the bad guys he frowned wont that just you know warn them that were on to them no i said theyll want to meet me why i looked up at him because im going to be selling them some new talent we went to my place there wasnt much point in setting the dogs on the owner of the email address it would prove to be anonymous and given what i had for hard evidence even if i could get someone to pay attention to me by the time it went through channels and peeled away all the red tape and got a judge somewhere to move i was sure the address would be old news and anyone connected to it would long since have departed i might have gotten some help from a friend at the bureau except that in the wake of the red court attack on their headquarters building they would be going crazy looking for the terrorists responsible they too were long since departed dresden had seen to that the tv news was all about the bombing the attack while everyone speculated about who had done what and used the occasion to put forward their own social and political agendas people suck but theyre the only ones around who can keep the lights on i turned will loose on my fridge and then sent him out to make a few discreet inquiries of the local supernatural scene i heard his car door close when he returned about the time the daylight was turning golden orange it looked like it would be another cold night there was the sound of a second car door closing will knocked at the front door and i answered it with my gun held low and against my leg there proved to be a girl with him she was a little taller than i which still put her below average and i had pencils bigger around than she was her glasses were oversized her hair thin straight and the same brown of a house mouses fur still there was something in the way she held herself that put up the hairs on the back of my neck the young woman might be a lightweight but so were ratsand you didnt want to trap one of them in a corner if you could avoid it she contained a measure of danger that demanded respect her eyes flickered to my face and then down to my gun hand in the same first half second of recognition she stopped slightly behind will her body language wary murphy will said noddingbut he didnt try to come in or make any other movement that might force me to react uh maybe you remember marcy we were all at marcones place stuck down in that muddy pit drugged good times the young woman asked hopefully my partner died the day before when the loupgarou gutted him not so much i said i looked at will you trust her sure will said without a seconds hesitation maybe im getting cynical as i age i stared at marcy hard for a second before i said i dont no one said anything for a minute then will said im vouching for her youre emotionally involved will i said its compromising your judgment marcone could have put a bullet through your head instead of tossing that little knife at you if dresden was standing here telling you to be suspicious what would you do wills expression darkened but i saw him get ahold of himself and take a deep breath i dont know he said finally i dont know ive known marcy for years you knew her years ago i corrected him with gentle emphasis marcy rubbed one foot against the other calf and stood looking down her eyes on her feet it looked like a habitual stance social camouflage shes right will she said in a quiet voice will frowned at her how she should be suspicious of me given the circumstances ive been back in town for what two weeks and something like this happens id be worried too she looked up at me her expression uncertain i want to help sergeant murphy she said what do we do i stared at them both thinking dammit this was another one of those dresden things he could have pinched his nose for a second then swept his gaze over them and reported whether or not they were who they said they were supernatural creatures are big on shapeshifting they use it to get in close to their prey in an attack like that a mortal has the nextbest thing to zero probability of escaping i knew it had been done to me the sense of chagrin and helplessness is terrible to start with i said let me see if you can come in marcy frowned at me what do you mean i mean that if youre a shapeshifter or something you might not have an easy time coming over the threshold christ sergeant will began of course shes a shapeshifter so am i i glowered at them both if shes who she says she is she wont have a problem i said will sighed and looked at marcy sorry no its fine the young woman said its smart to be careful marcy held her hands out to her sides in plain sight and stepped into the house good enough houses are surrounded by a barrier of energy dresden always called it the threshold its all murky magic stuff to me but the general guideline is that anything thats too hideously supernatural cant come in without being invited a threshold will stop spirits ghosts some vampires but not others and will generally ward away things that intend to eat your face not everything not hardly but a lot of things no i said and put my gun away but its a start i nodded to a chair in the living room sit down she did and she sat looking down at her hands which were folded in her lap will followed marcy in and gave me a look that meant in martian what the hell do you think youre doing i ignored him marcy i said why didnt you respond to will when he tried to contact you earlier i tried she said i called back as soon as i got the message but i didnt have wills cell number only georgias why not i asked um she said i just got back into town and georgia doesnt need any stress and hes married i mean you dont just go asking for a husbands phone number you know which was reasonable put that way i nodded neither approving nor disapproving i left messages on the answering machine at the apartment marcy said it was all i could do and i checked the messages after id run your errands will said i called her back and had her come over she swept for scents and then we came here will i said firmly please let me handle this he clenched his jaw and subsided leaning against a wall i turned back to where marcy sat and continued towering over her a posture of parentalstyle authority tell me about your relationship to georgia were friends marcy said close friends really i think of her as a close friend i mean she was very kind to me when andi broke it off with me and we were friends for years before that i nodded did will explain what was going on she nodded georgia and andi have been taken how do you know it was andi with georgia because i was there marcy said i mean not last night but the night before last will was out of town and we had a girls night girls night we hung out and made fondue and watched movies and lied about how we all looked better now than when we first met well except that andi actually does she shook her head um anyway we stayed up late talking and andi slept in the guest bed and i slept on the couch she glanced up at my eyes for the first time that was when we had the nightmares nightmares she shuddered i i dont want to think about it but all three of us had an almost identical nightmare it was the worst for georgia she was she looked at will it was as if she hadnt quite woken up out of the dream she kept jerking and twitching she gave me a weak smile took two cups of cocoa to snap her out of it i kept my face neutral and gave her nothing go on me and andi talked about it and decided that one of us should stay with her we were going to trade off like until will came home the first night was andi i take it marcy nodded biting her lip yes sounds reasonable i said reasonable logicaland impossible to verify and the kid was shaking jesus christ karrin said a gentler voice inside me what are you doing shes scared to death i tried to make my tone a little warmer what do you know about their abduction specifically marcy can you tell me anything at all that might point toward the identity of the kidnappers she shook her head i cant think of anything that i picked up beforehand but im certain it was andi and georgia who were taken how can you be sure i asked will cleared his throat and spoke quietly marcys got a nose shes better with scents than any of the rest of us i eyed marcy could you pick up their trail they were taken downstairs and loaded into the back of a car marcy said promptly an older model burning too much oil but i couldnt follow them after that i think ill be able to recognize the scent of their captors though if i run into it i nodded shed gotten a ton more out of the scene than will had such a talent could be damn useful all the same i wasnt sure she sounded sincere to me and im pretty good at knowing when someone isnt but theres always a better liar out there i just wasnt sure but you have to trust someone sometime even when it seems risky when lives are on the line maybe even especially then okay i said calmly and took a seat in another chair will i asked what did you find out there are half a dozen other folks who have gone missing in the past day and a half will said at least thats how many bock and mcanally know about word about the kidnappings is out on the paranet and has been spreading since yesterday morning people are moving places in groups of three and four at least mcanallys is packed the community knows something is up theyre scared marcy nodded it isnt just chicago its happening all over the country group leaders are keeping everyone informed asking after their people reporting them missing to the local cops for whatever good that might do her voice trailed off into a little squeak as she looked at me um sorry i ignored her martian for this is easier for all of us if we just pretend i didnt hear it will did you turn up anything we can use he shook his head no one has seen or heard anything at any of the disappearances but there are rumors that someone found a gang of red court vampires torn apart in a basement across town maybe that has something to do with whats going on it doesnt i said firmly not directly at least dresden killed the red court will blinked you mean those vampires in the basement i mean the red court i said all of them will let out a quiet whistle uh wow thats pretty big magic i guess yeah i said marcys face was twisted up in a frown of concentration was was this the night before last by any chance i glanced aside at her and nodded once if there was a really big surge of magic maybe that explains the dreams she said it wasnt just the three of us the night before last a lot of peopleparanet people i meanhad nightmares too some of them were bad enough that people havent slept since a couple of folks wound up in the hospital she blinked at will thats what happened with you will what do you mean will said when georgia called you shed had the nightmare twice during the day when she tried to sleep she must have had it again and tried to call you theres no point in speculation for now i looked at will in short more people missing bad dreams everyone is gathering in defensive herds that about it more or less will said what did you get i sent an email to the address marcone gave us told them i had a talent in need of placement i got a public phone location im supposed to be there to answer a call at nine tonight will frowned so they can get a look at you first right probably you shouldnt look like you marcy blurted her face colored slightly i mean like youre the supernatural cop in chicago everyone knows that and it makes sense that anyone planning something here wouldnt have much trouble finding out who might actually get in their way unfortunately i said i dont have a different look will looked at marcy frowning and then said ah makeover we have a little time marcy said nodding hey i said shes right ms murphy will said youve been seen with dresden a lot and no offense but not many people look like you do meaning i asked him i smiled wills eyes might have checked the distance between himself and the door meaning youre outside the norm for adult height and weight he said exceptionally so we should do what we can to make it harder to identify you will had a point i supposed annoying as it might be his logic was sound and i was almost certainly a little sensitive where my height was concerned i sighed all right but if i hear montage music starting to play im cutting it short will seeming to relax nodded cool marcy nodded with him so what about will and me i mean what do the two of us do i looked at the pair of young werewolves and pursed my lips how do you feel about duct tape when i answered the pay phone outside a small grocery store on belmont i felt like an idiot in the windows of a darkened shop across the street i could see my reflection halloween had come early this year i wore boots not unlike herman munsters with elevator soles about three inches thick making me look taller my hair was dyed matte black and was slicked down to my skull there was so much product in it i was fairly sure it would deflect bullets i wore some black dance tights marcy had donated to the cause a black tshirt and a black leather jacket in a youth size my face was the worst part of the disguise i was all but smothered beneath the makeup dark tones of silver that faded to black made a mess of my eyes altering their shape by means of suggestion through clever application of liner in the evening light i might have looked asian my lips were darkened too a shade of wine red that somehow managed to complement the eye shadow the lipstick changed the shape of my mouth slightly and made my lips look fuller i glowered at the reflection this costume had exactly one thing going for it i didnt look a thing like me the phone rang and i picked it up jerking it off the base unit as if impatient i glared around me my eyes tracking across every spot i thought could contain an observer and said yeah the merchandise murmured a soft sibilant voice with an odd accent describe there was something intrinsically unsettling about the voice the hairs on the back of my neck stood up one male and one female mid to latetwenties shapeshifters there was a rustle of static over the line unless the speaker could make an extremely odd hissing sound all things considered i gave it even odds ten thousand said the voice i could have played it a couple of different ways the kinds of people who get into this sort of deal come in about three general types greedy lowlife sons of bitches cold professionals engaged in a business transaction and desperate amateurs who are in over their heads id already decided to try to come across as the first on the list forty thousand i shot back instantly each there was a furious sound on the other end of the phone it wasnt a human sound either i could pluck out your eyes and cut your tongue into slivers hissed the voice something about it scared the hell out of me touching on some instinctual level that ray in all his repulsive mass had not i felt myself shudder despite my effort not to do so whatever i said trying to sound bored even if you could do it it gets you nothing but hey no skin off my ass either way there was a long silence on the other end of my phone i thought i felt some kind of pressure building behind my eyelids i told myself it was my imagination yo anyone there i complained listen are you up for doing some business or did i just waste my time after another pause the voice hissed something in a bubbling serpentine tongue the phone rustled as if changing hands and a very deep male voice said twenty thousand each im not selling the female for less than thirty fifty total then rumbled the new voice it sounded entirely human cash i demanded done i kept tracking the street with my eyes looking for their spotter but saw no one how do you handle delivery theres a warehouse fat chance i pull in there youll just pop me and make the body disappear along with the freaks what do you suggest rumbled the voice buttercup park thirty minutes one carrier carrier hands me half the cash then carrier verifies the merchandise in the back of my truck carrier hands me the rest of the money i hand him the keys to the vehicle carrying the merchandise we all walk away happy the deepvoiced man thought about it for a moment and then grunted translation agreed how will you identify me i snorted and said park isnt huge tough guy and it aint my first rodeo i hung up on him then went back to my motorcycle and left heading for buttercup park a lighted sign hanging outside a bank told me it was a quarter after nine the metro traffic grid was dying down for the night i got there in a little more than fifteen minutes parked my harley in a garage and made my way to where georgias highdollar suv was waiting in the same structure i went around to the back and opened the hatch will was just finishing wrapping marcy in what appeared to be several layers of duct tape covering her in a swath from her hips to her deltoids trapping her arms against her sides she was wearing a simple sundress with i assumed nothing underneath i guess when you change into a wolf you dont take your ensemble with youbeing trapped in undies made for a different species could prove awkward in a fight will looked up and gave me a quick nod of greeting all set so far youre sure you wont have a problem getting out i asked will snorted claws fangs itll sting a bit when it tears out the hair nothing serious spoken like someone whos never had his legs waxed marcy said in a nervous forcedly jovial tone she might have looked like a skinny little thing but the muscles showing on her legs were lean and ropy will tore off the end of the duct tape and passed the roll to me he sat down on the open floor in the back of the suv the seats of which had been folded away to make room for the prisoners he stripped out of his shirt leaving only a pair of loose sweats i started wrapping him tighten your muscles i said when im done relax them it should leave you enough room to maintain blood flow right will said houdini he contracted the muscles in his upper body and the duct tape creaked damn the kid was built given that i was more or less leaning against his naked back to reach around him with the roll of tape it was impossible not to notice dresden hadnt been muscled as heavily as will harryd had a runners build all lean tight dense muscle that i clenched my jaw and kept wrapping tape one more time i said i meet the contact then bring him here i held up the suvs remote control fob ill disarm the security system so you know were coming if you hear me say the word red it means things arent going well get loose and help me jump the contact well question him find out where the other specials are being kept otherwise sit tight and make like you got hit with tranquilizer darts ill shadow you back to their hq what then marcy asked well have to play that by ear i said if there arent many of them well hit them and get your people out if theyve got a lot of muscle ill make a call if i can get a large force here theyll run rather than fight can you be sure of that will asked dresden said that to the supernatural world bringing in mortal authorities was equated with nuclear exchanges no one wants to be the one to trigger a new inquisition of some kind so any group with a sense of reason will cut their losses rather than tangle with the cops the way they didnt tangle with fbi headquarters will asked i had sort of hoped no one would notice that flaw in my reasoning that was an act of war this is some kind of profitgaining scheme come on karrin will said youve got to know better than that this is a professional operation i said whoever is behind it is depending on distraction and speed to enable them to get away with it theyll already have their escape plan ready to go if a bunch of cars and lights come at them i think their first instinct will be to run rather than fight yeah marcy said nodding that makes sense youve always said supernatural predators dont want a fight if they can avoid one will lone predators dont will said but this is an organization and you might have noticed how a lot of supernatural types are a couple of french fries short of a happy meal and im talking about more than here tonight more than georgia and andi more than just chicago i frowned at him what do you mean he leaned forward his eyes intent i mean that if dresden just blew up the red court that means the status quo is gone theres a power vacuum and every spook out there is going to try to fill it the rules have changed we dont know how these people are going to react a sobering silence fell over us i hadnt followed the line of reasoning like will had or rather i hadnt followed it far enough id only been thinking of dresdens cataclysm in terms of its effect on my city upon people who were part of my life but he was right dear god he was right the sudden demise of the red court with consequences that would reach around the whole world would make the fall of the soviet union look like a minor organizational crisis so what i asked we back out are you kidding will said they took my wife we go get her and anyone else theyve taken right marcy said firmly from where she lay on the bed of the vehicle i felt a smile bare my teeth and if they fight wills face hardened then we kick their fucking ass ass said marcy nodding i finished wrapping will in the duct tape he exhaled slowly and relaxed he took a few experimental breaths and then nodded okay good lie down both of you ill be back with the buyer be careful will said if you arent back in twenty minutes ill come looking if im not back in twenty minutes there wont be much point in finding me i said then i shut them into the suv and headed for the park buttercup park wasnt exactly overwhelming there were grass playground equipment and a tree or two on an island bordered by four city streets that was pretty much it it was the sort of place my lowlife persona would choose it was out in the open and there was not much to break up the line of sight it was a good location for criminals with mutual trust issues to meet up each could be sure the other was alone each could be reasonably sure the other wouldnt start shooting right out there in front of god and everybody the park as it should have been was empty the surrounding streetlights left little hidden on the green grass but the playground equipment cast long asymmetric shadows a man sat on one of the swings he was hugethe biggest individual id ever seen he was heavy with muscle though it was an athletes balanced buildmade for action not for display his hips strained the heavy flexible plastic seat of the swing to the horizontal he must have been better than seven feet tall he was quietly sitting there completely still watching and waiting his head was shaved and his skin was dark he wore a simple outfitblack chinos and a thin turtleneck sweater if the october chill was bothering him it didnt show i stomped over toward him in my munster boots when i was about thirty feet away he turned his head toward me his gaze was startling his eyes were bluewhite as on some northern sled dogs and looked nearly luminous in the half shadows he lifted his eyebrows as i came closer then rose and bowed politely from the waist i realized that he wasnt seven feet tall he was more like seven foot four or five good evening he said his basso rumble was unmistakable this was the person i had spoken to earlier i stopped in front of him and put a hand on my hip eyeing him as if i wasnt much impressed as long as you brought the money it will be i drawled he reached into a cavernous pocket in his pants and drew out a brick wrapped in plastic he tossed it to me half i caught it and tore open the plastic with my teeth then i started counting the money all of it in nonsequential ben franklins a trace of impatience entered my contacts voice its all there talking to me is just going to make me lose count and start over i said what am i supposed to call you nothing he said no one i am nothing to you nothing it is i replied the bills were bound in groups of fifty i counted one out and compared its thickness to that of the others then flipped through just to be sure nothing wasnt trying to short me by throwing some twenties into the middle of the stack then i stuck the money in my jacket pocket and said were in business nothing inclined his head a bit the merchandise come with me i said injecting my voice with breezy confidence i turned to stomp back toward the garage parking lot and nothing paced along beside me already this wasnt going well this guy was huge i was good but training and practice can get you only so far the old saying is that a good big man will beat a good little man which is sexist as all getout but no less true levels of skill being equal whoever has the size and weight advantage damn near always wins nothing probably outweighed all three of us together and i already had a sense from the way he held himself and moved that he was a person accustomed to violence he was good i could shoot him probably but i didnt need a dead trafficker on my hands i needed one who could talkwhich meant i was going to have to let will and marcy be taken how long you fellas setting up shop i asked him as we walked might be able to come up with another one if the price is right nothing looked at me for a moment before speaking if you cannot do it by dawn do not bother maybe well see how this plays out nothing shrugged and kept on walking i caught sight of our reflection in a passing windowbiker barbie and bigfoot i tried to keep out of his reach as we walked but there was only so much sidewalk and nothings arms looked long enough to slap me from the middle of the street as we walked i noticed the smell the man just smelled wrong i wasnt sure what it wassomething musty vaguely like the scent of stagnant water and rotting fish it hung in the air around him you arent really human are you i noted as we walked into the parking garageand away from any potential witnesses not anymore he replied as he spoke the collar of the turtleneck stirred it rippled as if something had moved beneath it well i am i said completely worthless for whatever youre doing collecting specials so dont be thinking you can get three for the price of two nothing looked down at me with those unsettling eyes you are pathetic i put a little extra swagger into my step careful what you say there big guy youll turn me on nothing made a small quiet sound of disgust and shook his head it was hard not to smile as i watched him pigeonhole me into scum treacherous decadent its right up here before we approach the vehicle he said you should know that if you have associates waiting in ambuscade i will break their necksand yours i lifted my hands jesus show a little trust will you were all capitalists here i pointed the fob at the suv and disarmed the alarm with a little electronic chirp the lights flashed once i tossed him the keys that one ill stay back here if you like acceptable he said and strode to the suv watching him bend down to look in was like a scene from jurassic park he opened the rear hatch and then lifted his hands to his neck for a moment he tugged the turtleneck down a little the skin of nothings neck was deformed with narrow flaps of skin somehow and it took me a few seconds to realize what i was looking at gills the man had gills and he was breathing through them they opened and closed in a rhythm not far removed from a dogs sniffing werewolves he said valuable they make good pets i asked he reached in and seized will lifting him with one hand the young man remained limp his eyes closed their blood has unique properties what did you use to subdue them roofies the way my dating life has been going i keep some on hand he made a dissatisfied sound and tugged his collar up again the drug might lower their value i hope not i said this has been such a nice conversation id hate for it to end in a gunshot nothing turned his head slightly and gave me a very cold little smile i felt threatened enough to produce my gun without even consciously thinking about it i held it in two hands pointed at the ground near his feet we stayed that way facing off for several seconds then he shrugged a shoulder he produced another brick of bills and threw it to me along with the truck keys then he gathered up marcy and tossed her over one shoulder and will over the other he turned to the entrance of the garage and made several sharp popping clicks as he went producing with an odd quiver of his chest and throat a sound that was somehow familiar they must have been a signal a moment later a van with rentalagency plates pulled up to the curb and stopped a man dressed identically to nothing rolled open the side door nothing put the two werewolves inside then followed them somehow compressing his bulk enough to get into the van the driver pulled back into traffic a second later the entire pickup had taken less than ten seconds i got back onto my motorcycle and rolled out of the garage with my lights off before their van had gotten to the end of the block then settling in to follow them from several car lengths back i tried to make like a hole in the air nothing and his driver headed for the docks which was hardly unanticipated chicago supports an enormous amount of shipping traffic that travels through the great lakes and offloads cargo to be transferred to railroads or trucking companies for shipment throughout the united states such ships remain one of the best means for moving illegal goods without being discovered there are plenty of storage buildings down by the docks and nothing went to one of the seedier more rundown warehouses on the waterfront i noted the location and went on by without stopping then i circled around killed the engine with the bike still in motion and came coasting back over the cracked old asphalt the whisper of my tires lost in the susurrus of city sounds and water lapping the lakeshore there wasnt much to see the warehouse had a single set of standard doors and several large steel doors that would roll up to allow crates and shipping containers to be brought inside they were all closed a single guard a man in a watch cap and a squall coat wandered aimlessly around outside the building smoking cigarettes and looking bored i got rid of the damn clunky munster boots and pulled on the black slippers i always wore on the practice mat i pulled weapons and gear out of the bikes saddlebags attached the items to the tactical harness under my coat and slipped closer i stayed where it was dark using the shadows to hide my approach then i found a particularly deep patch of darkness and waited it took a seemingly endless five minutes for the guard to get close enough for me to shoot him with a taser darts leapt out and plunged into his chest trailing shining wires and i pulled the trigger while he jerked and twitched and fell to the ground i wasnt sure if this guy was human or not but i wasnt taking chances i kept the juice on him until i was sure he was down for the count when i let up he just lay there on his side curled up halfway into a fetal position quivering and twitching while drool rolled out of his mouth actually he sort of reminded me of my second husband in the morning i jerked the darts out of him and shoved the taser and the trailing wire into my jacket pocket it would take too much time to reset it for use and i had a bad feeling that the electronic device wouldnt do me much good inside the warehouse i could have slapped some heavy restraining ties on himbut i would be happier if anyone who found the downed man had no idea what had happened to him so much for the easy part my p hung easily from the tac harness its stock high its barrel hanging down the line of my body i took a moment to screw a suppressor onto the end of the gun and lifted it to firing position against my shoulder the little belgian assault weapon was illegal for a civilian to own within city limits the suppressor too if i got caught with them id be in trouble if i got caught using them id do time both of those consequences were subordinate to the fact that if i didnt go in armed for bear i might not live to congratulate myself on my sterling citizenship well theres no such thing as a perfect solution is there i moved quietly back to the entry door silenced weapon tight against my shoulder i duckwalked my steps quick and small and rolling to keep my upper body level as it moved id put a red dot sight on the p and it floated in my vision as a translucent crosshair of red light the sight made the weapon to some degree point and click the idea was for the bullets to go wherever the crosshairs were centered i had it sighted for short work even though id seen more action than practically any cop in the countrythanks to dresdeni could count on one hand the number of times id used a weapon in earnest against a target more than seven or eight yards away standing next to the entry door i tested the knob it turned freely so the folks inside had been relying on their guard to keep intruders out i thought of the first hissing voice id spoken to on the phone and shivered they wouldnt be relying on purely physical defenses but i knew something about those too harrys defenses had been deadly dangerousbut to create them apparently you had to use the energy of a threshold which only grew up around an actual home this old warehouse was a place of business and didnt have a threshold so if a spell had been put up to guard the door it would have to be fairly weak of course weak was a relative term in dresdens vocabulary it might hit me only hard enough to break bones instead of disintegrating me completelyif there was a spell there at all i hated this magic crap screw it i couldnt just stand here all night i turned the doorknob slowly keeping my body as far to one side as possible then i pushed in gently and the door swung open by an inch or three when nothing exploded or burst into wails of alarm i eased up next to it and peeked into the building it was like looking into another world green and blue light crawled and slithered up the walls and over the warehouses interior eerie and subtly unsettling each color moving in waves of differing widths and speeds the strange scent of water and fish was strong inside there were things on the wallgrowths was all i could call them ugly patches of some kind of lumpy rough substance i didnt recognize were clumped all around the walls and ceiling of the warehouse in roughly circular patches about six feet across cages were scattered all around the floora bunch of fivefoot cubes made of heavy steel grid people were locked up in several of them the doors held shut by heavy chains most of them just sat staring at nothing or lay upon their sides doing the same thing completely motionless that wasnt normal even someone who was drugged but conscious would show a little more animation than that this meant magic was involved some kind of invasive mental stuff and a little voice in my head started screaming ive been subjected to that kind of invasion more than once its bad my legs felt weak my hands shook the rippling colors of light on the walls became something sinister disorienting the beginnings of another attack on my mind jesus christ i wanted to turn around and scurry away as swiftly and as meekly as possible in fact i tried to my legs quivered as if preparing to move but the motion drew my gaze across another row of cages and i saw georgia she was naked kneeling her hands wrapped gently around her swelling stomach cradling her unborn child her head was bowed in a posture of meekness and her sleek shoulders and neck were relaxed but i saw her eyes open and staring at the bottom of the cage and i saw the defiance flickering in them whatever held the others held georgia as wellbut she evidently had not been subdued as readily as they had she was still fighting them something deep inside me something hard and fierce and furious locked my legs into place i stared at georgia and i knew i couldnt run i remembered that will and marcy were in there waiting for me to announce that the moment was right to change form and fight i remembered that nearly all of those people in the cages were young even younger than the werewolvesincluding the youngest of all in georgias cage i remembered blood splattered on the weathered cabin of a boatand that there was no one but me coming to help those kids the fear changed form on me it disguised itself as reason dont go in it told me know your limits send for help but the only serious help i could get would be siand they would be putting their own careers as well as their lives on the line if they came to my aid i could send for the regular police drop in an anonymous call but in this part of town it might take half an hour for them to show up even when they did arrive theyd be lambs to the slaughter most of the force had no idea what really went on in the citys darkest shadows you could go get the sword said my fear you know where it is you know how strong it makes you not many people could honestly say theyd wielded a magic sword against the forces of darkness but im one of them fidelacchius the sword of faith lay waiting for the hand of someone worthy to wield it against the powers of darkness in the final battle with the red court that hand had been mine in the darkest moment of that fight when all seemed lost it had been my hand upon fidelacchius that had tipped the balance enabling dresden to prevail and i had felt a power greater than i supporting me guiding my movements and for a single swift moment entering into me and making use of my lips and tongue to pronounce sentence upon the murderous creatures surrounding us i could go for the sword odds were it would be of some help but i knew that if i did i would have taken the easy path i would have turned away from a source of terror for the most excellent rational of reasons and the next time i faced the same kind of fear it would be a little easier to turn away a little easier to find good reasons not to act the sword was a source of incredible powerbut it was nothing but cool motionless steel without the hand that could grip it the muscles that would move it the eyes and the mind that would guide it without them the sword was nothing i stopped and stared down at my shaking hand without my hand my mind my will the sword was nothing and if that was true then it must also be true that my hand was what mattered that it had been my hand my will that had made the difference and my hand was right here in fact i had two of them my breathing steadied and slowed sword or no sword i had sworn to serve and protect the people of this city and if i turned away from that oath now if i gave in to my fear even for the most seductively logical of reasons then i had no right to take up the sword of faith in any case my hands stopped shaking and my breathing slowed and steadied bringing the terror under control i whispered a quick almost entirely mental prayer to st jude the patron of lost causes and policemen it sounded something like ohgodohgodohgod help i nudged the door open a few more inches then slid into the warehouse moving with as much speed and silence as i possessed my gun at the level and ready i moved down the length of the warehouse mostly hidden behind a shelving unit more than twenty feet high it was stacked with pallets loading gear storage bins and the occasional barrel or box of unknown provenance the shifting constantly wavering light made an excellent cover for motion and i timed my steps to move in rhythm with the dancing illumination the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and it felt like every inch of my skin was covered in gooseflesh id been in the presence of dangerous magic often enough to know the feeling of dark power in motion it had been like this at chichen itza and in the waters off the island of demonreach and in the raith deeps and at arctis tor and in the nest of black court vampires and at you get the point this wasnt my first rodeo the most important thing would be to take out nothings presumptive boss and fastpreferably before anyone knew i was here at all the warehouse reeked of magic and if a mortal goes into a fair fight against a wizard the mortal loses period they have power that is literally almost unimaginable and if the bad guy got a chance to defend himself the only uncertainty remaining would be how much creativity he put into killing me at the end of the shelving unit there was a rolling ladder one made to run all the way up and down the shelves and provide easy access the warehouse was darker up near the ceiling than at floor level i didnt even slow down i went up the ladder to the top of the shelving unit and froze in place getting a good clear look at the enemy for the first time there were half a dozen of them including nothing and they all shopped at the same store their outfits were conspicuous due to their uniformity though some instinct made me think that they had been intended as disguisesthat individuality as a concept wasnt of any particular concern to nothing and his crew nothing was by far the largest of the men though none of them looked like featherweights they were loading cages into a railroad cargo container a fairly common sight on large ships some of which could carry hundreds of the metal boxes the cages had been sized to stack exactly into the railroad car two across and three high with no consideration whatsoever for the human cargo there were no blankets no padsnothing but metal cages and vulnerable skin i spotted andis cage not far from georgias the redheaded girl had evidently lacked some critical capacity to resist whatever had been done to her she lay on her back staring blankly up at the roof of her cage the werewolf girl was a bombshell even lying in completely passive relaxation her curves beckoned the eyebut the hollow despair of her expression was haunting nothing was standing over will and marcy who lay limp and motionless on the floor at his feet a couple of turtlenecks were hauling an empty cage toward them how long will it take he was asking a third man without knowing the exact drug several hours the man replied his voice was plainly human and sounded nothing like whoever it was id spoken to on the phone perhaps more nothing frowned can you make a determination of their viability by dawn if i am able to isolate the substance that incapacitated them before then he said i have no means of determining how many attempts will be required it will take as long as it takes he will not be pleased nothing said the man bowed his head my life for the master i will do all in my power to serve him should he be disappointed in me it is meet for him to take my life nothing nodded be about it the man turned and walked quickly away holding two small vials of rich red blood in his handsamples from will and marcy i assumed by then the empty cage had arrived nothing picked up marcy and lifted her toward the waiting cage i bit down on a curse if i let him imprison her a full third of my team would be neutralized as helpless as the prisoners who had already been taken but if i started the music early i risked throwing away my sucker punch nothings master might show up at any time on the other hand nothing seemed to be large and in charge perhaps the hissing person id spoken to on the phone had left matters in nothings shovellike hands or perhaps id read the situation incorrectly what if one of the other turtlenecks had been the first speaker and nothing was really the boss i made up my mind and settled the ps crosshair onto nothings head a little below the tip of his nose the weapon was set for automatic fire and while i could control the weapon fairly well especially when it was loaded with subsonic rounds the recoil would tend to carry the weapons muzzle higher after the first shot against anything human more than one round to the head would be overkill when the merely mortal goes up against the supernatural theres no such thing as overkill i snuggled the gun in close and tight took a deep breath in let it halfway out held it and began to slowly squeeze the weapons trigger the instant before the trigger would have broken there was a shimmering in the air and a man stepped out of it appearing as if from nowhere i backed off the tension on my finger feeling my heart surge with unspent adrenaline the man was of medium height with sallow skin and greasy straight black hair that hung past his shoulders his lips were very thick and his mouth very wide almost to the point of deformity his large eyes were dark and watery and bulging his nose sunken as small as any i had ever seen he was soaking wet and naked his limbs scrawny and long his hands very very wide except for the hair i couldnt help but compare him to a froga sullen vicious frog the man let out a sound somewhat like a muffled belch then vomited water onto the floor flaps of skin at his neck flared in and out spewing smaller sprays of water several times until he drew in a breath through his mouth evidently filling his lungs with air all of the turtlenecks turned to face the creature and fell to their knees including nothing who calmly set marcy aside and went into a full kowtow his palms flat on the floor his forehead pressed down onto his knuckles sssssso he hissed did the inssssolent creature deliver our prizesss i recognized the voice from the telephone yes my lord rumbled nothing as promised and in plenty of time to move did you sssstrike the bitch down nothing rocked back and then bowed again somehow giving the impression that he was doing it more deeply she was clever enough to build safeguards into the meeting i could not do so without attracting attention frogface hissed i will sssettle with the mortal another time he said sssuch insssolence cannot be countenanced no my lord bring the new acquisitionsss i will bind them they have been given drugs my lord the binding could damage them without looking particularly excited about it frogface kicked nothing in the armpit the blow was a more powerful one than frogfaces frame would suggest he was capable of giving it flung nothing from his hands and knees and onto his side by main force bring them i obey wheezed nothing he rose unsteadily and went to pick up will he dropped the young werewolf onto the floor beside marcy sssuch disgusssting thingsss mortalsss frogface murmured his eyes lifted to georgia in her cage she hasss not yet capitulated no my lord nothing muttered interesssting frogface said and a leer spread over his broad mouth when we arrive transport her to my chambers we will sssee what is left of her ssstrength when the ssspawn is taken from her womb jesus men can be assholes even when theyre barely human frogface was officially elected georgia shuddered she lifted her head very slowly as if it had been held down with vast weightsand the glare she turned on frogface was nothing less than murderous frogface chuckled at the expression and turned to face will and marcy he dipped his fingers into a pouch that hung around his neck almost invisible against his leathery skin and withdrew what looked like a small seashell from it he leered at the motionless marcy and said firssst the female he closed his eyes and made a low sound in his throat then began chanting words that bubbled and gobbled out from between his rubbery lips now ive got you i thought to myself and sighted the gun on frogfaces rubbery lips i didnt have dresdens knowledge of magic but i knew any wizard was vulnerable when they began working forces the way frogface was doing the concentration needed was intense if id understood dresden correctly it would mean that frogface would have to be focusing his entire attention on his spellleaving nothing remaining for defending his sallow hide the air began to shimmer around frogfaces hands and fine slithering tendrils emerged from the brightly colored shell and began to drift down toward marcy a cloud of tendrils as fine as a cobweb certain now of my target i breathed held it and squeezed the trigger say what you like about the belgians they can make some fine weaponry the silenced p barely whispered when the burst of automatic fire erupted from the end of the suppressor there was no flash no thunderjust a soft wheezing sound and the click of the guns action cycling thanks to the subsonic ammunition the discharge itself actually made less noise than the rounds striking frogfaces skull there were several wet loud cracking sounds and every one of the rounds id fired struck home one round would have been messy enough when half a dozen of them hit frogfaces head quite literally exploded shattered to pulp and shards of bone by the bullets impact and twothirds of his skull from the upper lip on up simply vanished into greenblooded spray there was a flash of angry red light from the seashell frogface let out a highpitched tinny scream and the nearheadless body began to topple thrashing wildly the turtlenecks all came to their feet looking around in wideeyed confusion my weapon had given them absolutely no clue as to where the attack had come from i sighted in on nothing but from my angle any rounds that went through him would threaten will and a caged prisoner beyond him i shifted targets settling the red crosshairs on another turtleneck standing just past will i squeezed off another whispering burst of a halfdozen or so rounds and the creatures neck exploded into a cloud of scarlet gore the consistency of mucus it went limp settling to the floor like a deflating balloon nothings paleeyed gaze snapped over toward me and i saw his gaze track the fall of brass bullet casings from where they bounced off the floor back up to my position on the shelves he let out an enraged sound pulled a short tube from his pocket and pointed it at me i moved sliding back down the ladder to the floor hardly moving more slowly than if id fallen there was a highpitched whistle and something that looked like a small spiny sea urchin flew past me just over my head close enough for the wind of its passage to stir darkdyed hairs it slammed into the wall behind me and remained there quivering as its spines punched through the metal siding and stuck drops of yellowgreen liquid fell from the tips of some of the spines and began smoking and eating small holes in the concrete floor yikes throaty popping clicking sounds from several sources filled the air an exchange of what could only be language i ran for the far end of the shelving unit as the dark forms of the turtlenecks started moving toward me i caught glimpses of them between the boxes and containers stacked on the lowest shelf running with the lithe floating agility of professional athletes i ran past a clump of the growth on the wall a little lower than most and as i approached it suddenly fluoresced with bioluminescent color on sheer instinct i threw myself flat to the concrete floor and slid past on my belly as the lumpy growths began hissing and jets of mist the same color as the fluid covering the urchin spines began to spray forth at random the smell was hideous and i scrambled back to my feet and kept running down the aisle staying as far from the wall as i could if id been half a step slower i would have died there was a great crash and nothing smashed through the lowest level of the shelving unit thrusting aside a steel drum and a wooden crate the size of a coffin as if theyd been made of styrofoam his fingers missed grabbing onto me by inches a second turtleneck beat me to the end of the shelf i opened up with the p praying that a ricochet wouldnt kill one of the prisoners but my target moved with the speed of a striking serpent bounding forward to plant a foot against the steel wall of the warehouse six feet off the ground using only a single leg he kicked off into a backflip that carried him back past the end of the shelf and out of my line of fire the damn thing hadnt been moving fast enough to dodge bulletsbut hed been moving fast enough to dodge me and i was the one doing the aiming a round might have clipped one of his legs but that was all and nothing was pounding up behind me gaining despite his mass i felt like a squirrel being pursued by a german shepherd if he caught me it would end about the same way so i played squirrel and instead of running in the open i turned ninety degrees to my right and dove between two stacks of pallets on the lowest shelf i took a little skin off an arm in hurling myself between them and emerged onto the open warehouse floor i heard nothings shoes squealing on the floor as he applied the brakes behind me a turtleneck was coming straight at me on a direct line from the cages not yet loaded into the railroad car i brought the p up and dropped to one knee the turtleneck rushed forward his pale blue eyes wide and staring he held an inwardcurving knife in one hand and carried it low and close to his leg he knew how to use it i put the scarlet crosshairs on his sternum and squeezed the trigger the instant before the shots would have sputtered out of the gun the turtleneck leapt straight up flipping once in the air as he went over me after seeing the incredible quickness of the other notquitehumans id been waiting for the dodge as soon as his feet left the floor i spun to my left opening fire the instant the end of the barrel was clear of the prisoners bullets hissed through the air like a great scytheand in the edge of my vision i saw the turtleneck id wounded seconds before hed come charging toward me while id aimed at his buddy and the sudden turn took him by surprise there was no aiming involvedit was a bruteforce approach i emptied the rest of the clip at him and prayed i could leave him no safe space in which to dodge st jude gets a lot of business but sometimes he comes through the hissing puffing little gun spat out a line of deadly projectiles and intersected the turtlenecks path tearing a row of five or six holes across his upper body the turtleneck screamed and went down but the one whod leapt over me dropped back down adjusting swiftly to the situation and then whipped the hooked knife across my belly almost anyone else in town would have been killed the knife struck with enormous power and its blade was sharp standard kevlarstyle body armor wouldnt have done a damn thing to stop it id stopped wearing the standard stuff thanks to one too many exciting outings with dresden i wore a doublethickness vest nowand sandwiched between the layers of antiballistic fabric was a corselet of tightly linked titanium rings manufactured for me by one of dresdens friends the wife of a retired fist of god the knife sliced right through the kevlar it split a ring or three but then the tip caught in the titanium instead of spilling my intestines upon the ground the superhumanly powerful blow wound up dragging me along and flung me across the concrete floor i went down into a roll and spread out the force of the fall coming back up to my feet already having released the empty magazine from the p i was reaching for the fresh one when another turtleneck abruptly closed in on me from behind and slipped a slim ironhard arm around my neck i barely got a hand inside the loop of his arm before he could lock the choke on me and i twisted like an eel to get out his strength was far superior to mine but then whose wasnt even in grappling strength isnt absolutely everything the turtleneck might have been faster than i but i had the advantage of experience my timing was good enough to let me sense the opening the lack of pressure in the weakest part of his hold and i managed to writhe out of his griponly to have a forearm smash down across my shoulders driving me to the floor as i went down i saw that the turtleneck with the knife was only a few steps away id never escape a pair of them i didnt have time to get another magazine into the p so i rolled with it and smashed the heavy polymer stock of the weapon into the nearest turtlenecks kneecap he screamed and seized me by the neck of the leather jacket shaking me like a doll at which point will and marcy gave nothings companions an object lesson as to why werewolves instill terror in mortal hearts and minds there was a flash of dark fur a snarl a horrible tearing sound and the turtleneck screamed he started listing to one side and i realized that one of the werewolves had just severed the hamstring of the turtlenecks unwounded leg we both went down i twisted out of the leather jacket though i had to drop the p and let it hang from my harness to do it and rolled free of the turtleneck an instant later a second slightly lighter brown form teeth gleaming darted past the fallen turtleneck and ripped out what would have been the jugular vein on a human being apparently it was close enough for government work the turtleneck thrashed in dying agony as mucuslike red blood bubbled from the gaping wound and suddenly there were two beasts from the nightmares of mankind standing on either side of me facing the enemy they were wolves one large and dark the other slightly smaller and lighter but both heavily laden with muscle and thick fur and their golden eyes burned with awarenessand fury faced with a pair of murderous werewolves the knifewielding turtleneck slid to a sudden uncertain halt in the sudden silence that followed the sound of me slapping a fresh magazine into the p and racking the first round into the chamber was a sharp trio of clicks pop clickclack see nothing i thought i can make ominous noises too i brought the weapon back up and snarled lose the knife the turtleneck hesitated for half a second eyes darting left and right then released it the steel chimed as the knife hit the floor i kept the weapon on him the trigger half pulled yeah it wasnt the safe smart way to operate but frankly i wouldnt lose any sleep if i accidentally shot this guy he was just too damn fast to give up any advantage at all there were five of them i said to the wolves how many did you handle including the one that was on me the more lightly colored wolf let out two precise low barks i got two i said that leaves this one and the big guy a complex sequence of clicks and pops drifted through the air and the lights went out plunging the warehouse into perfect darkness instinctively my finger tightened on the trigger and i sent a burst of rounds out almost before the lights were gone but i was literally shooting blind against a foe who had supernatural reflexes and had also known thanks to those damn clicks what was about to happen i heard the rounds hammer through the far wall the wolves snarled and started forwardthe warehouse wasnt a lighttight darkroom and a wolfs eyes actually see better in near darkness than in full light the gloom was no obstacle to them but i seized handfuls of fur and hissed wait their momentum dragged me several inches forward before they slowed down but i said the growths on the wall spray out acid at least seven or eight feet dont get suckered in close to one the big guy has something like a gun go the wolves bounded out from beneath my hands leaving me alone in the darkness clicks and pops continued to bounce around the empty space of the warehouse impossible for me to localize they were an ongoing thing every couple of seconds and i couldnt shake the idea that they were coming closer and closer to me even as i crouched there defenseless and hating it my hands were scrabbling at the pouch on my tac vest if there was too much magic running amok flashlights might not be reliable magic screws up technology when theres too much of both of them around and you dont take chances with something as important as being effectively struck blind id prepared the tac vest with this kind of situation in mind i opened the pouch and pulled out a flare popping the pull cord which struck it to life as i did red light glared into the darkness and i lifted the flare over my head and out of my own vision in my left hand i held the p in my right the small weapon could be fired in one hand no problem and while it wouldnt be as accurate i could still send bursts downrange almost as well as i could twohanded the pops and clicks continued everywhere and nowhere i had no idea where will and marcy were and nothing and the other turtleneck had an awful lot of shadow to hide in i realized i was essentially sitting in the middle of an open floor under a spotlight a perfect target for nothing and his weird little urchingun and i retreated toward the caged prisoners georgia i said crouching down beside her i studied the door of the cage and found that the thing wasnt even locked it had a ring for a padlock on it but the doors mechanism was simply cycled closed i spun it open and pulled open the cage door georgia can you move she lifted her head and stared at me grimly then she turned her body and leaned forward moving as though underwater and slowly began to crawl out of the cage i hurried to andis cage and opened that door as wellbut the girl did not so much as blink or stir a finger when i urged her to get out so much for reinforcements i felt useless i couldnt go out there into the dark to join will and marcy in the hunt id be worse than useless stumbling around out there theyd be forced to take their attention from their attack in order to protect me murphy georgia said mmurphy i hurried to her side im here are you hurt she shook her head nnno llisten she lifted her head to meet my eyes her neck wobbling like a paraplegics listen clicks pops once a hackleraising snarl the whishing sound of an urchin flying through the air and the sharp pong of its hitting a metal exterior wall the guards georgia said sonar i stared at her for a second and then clued in to what she was talking about the clicks and pops had sounded familiar because i had heard them before or something very close to themfrom dolphins at the shedd aquarium dolphins sent out sharp pulses of sound and used them to navigate and to find prey in the dark i dropped the flare on the ground well away from georgia and began unscrewing the suppressor on the p will marcy i shouted unable to keep the snarl out of my voice theyre about to go blind then i pointed the weapon up and off at an angle that i thought would send the rounds into the nearby lake flicked the selector to single fire and began methodically triggering rounds the second clip had been loaded with standard rather than subsonic ammo and without the suppressor to dampen the explosion of the propellant the supersonic rounds roared out painfully loud the flash at the muzzle lit the entire warehouse in strobes of white light i didnt fire them in rhythm or any particular pattern i had no idea how actual sonar worked in biological organisms but id taken several nephews as a pack to see the daredevil movie and rhythmic sounds seemed to create a more ordered picture than random bursts of noise as i worked my way through the fiftyround magazine i could all but hear dresdens mockery his voice edged with adrenaline the words coming through a manic grin as id heard several times before murph when youre reaching out to movie concepts that involved millions of dollars in special effects for your tactical battle plan i think you can pretty safely take that as an indicator that you are badly out of your depth but as the last round left the gun i heard one of the turtlenecks screaming in paina horrible cry that ended abruptly and then the warehouse fell silent againonly to be invaded by another steady series of rhythmic clicks and this time they were definitely getting closer i unclipped the p and set it aside i had only the two clips for the weapon but my sig came into my hand with the smooth familiarity of long practice and i moved away from georgia and the other prisoners around behind the empty cages that had been meant for will and marcy i nearly screamed when i kicked a dead body and found the other turtleneck lying in a pool of viscous bloodapparently the other bad guy will and marcy had seen to some instinct warned me i was in danger and i dropped flat another sea urchin projectile streaked over me a second struck a bar in the empty cage and slammed into its floor acid chewing at the steel then there was a third whispering projectile that rushed away from me a wolf began to scream in agonyhorrible horrible highpitched screams nothing had just pulled the same trick i hadshooting at me and enticing one of his other enemies into the open as he did then spinning to fire at an unexpected moment will or marcy had just paid a horrible price for their aggression i came to my knees with a cry of fury and flung my flare it went high into the air spinning spreading red light wide and thin around the inside of the warehouse i saw a massive black form ahead of me turning the tube of his projectile weapon swinging back toward me the sig was faster i had already slid into a weaver stance and i slammed out a trio of shots swift steady and practiced all aimed at the upper torso to avoid any chance of hitting one of the wolves i know at least one of the shots scored a hit on nothing the flare landed still blazing i saw the black outline of his silhouette twist in agony then heard a quavering grunt escape him he moved away from the flare and out of my vision an instant later i saw a wolf leap across the scarlet pool of light and i started squeezing out more rounds from the sig i staggered them just as i had the shots from the p hoping to blind nothing as the wolf attacked the magazine emptied in a few seconds though i hadnt meant to fire that many shots the excitement of the fight was making it hard to stay level i ejected the empty mag slapped in a fresh one and pulled a second flare from my tac vest bringing it to hissing life as i started forward my gun extended i could hear nothing fighting with a wolf his voice emanated from his huge chest a basso growl of rage every bit as angry and animalistic as the snarls of the wolf fighting him i used the sound as my guide and rushed forward the other wolf kept on screaming in agony its shrieks slowly changing and becoming more and more eerily human the scarlet light of the flare fell across nothing and the wolfversion of will just as nothing flung the wolf to the concrete floor with bonejarring force will let out a shriek of pain and bones popped and crackledbut he retained enough awareness to roll out of the way as nothing sent one huge foot stomping down at his skull i started putting rounds into nothings chest from maybe fifteen feet away i was shooting onehanded and was hyped up on adrenaline it wasnt an ideal state for marksmanship but i wasnt trying for points on a targetthis was instinct shooting the kind of accuracy that comes only with endless hours of practice with thousands and thousands of rounds sent downrange it takes a lot of work to make that happen id worked i was using a mm weapon the rounds were on the small side for real combatand nothing was on the other end of the combat universe from small he turned toward me and i saw he no longer had the projectile tubeor two of the fingers on the hand that had been holding it one of the wolves had tried for his throat and evidently had torn open the fine cloth of the sweaters neck because i could see his gills flaring as he charged me shots struck home in his torso i was aiming for the heart which few people realize is fairly low in the chest a couple of inches below the left nipple i hit him with every shot six seven eight it takes an attacker about two seconds to close a gap of thirty feet and get within range for a strike with a knife or fist nothing was about five feet closer than that eight shots all of them hits was damn solid combat shooting it just wasnt enough nothing plowed into me like a runaway truck sending me sprawling we both hit the concrete pushing against him i barely managed to keep his weight from coming down on my chest so that it came down somewhere around my hips instead he seized my right hand and squeezed pain tendons tearing bones cracking he shook his arm once and my sig went tumbling away i didnt hesitate i just doubled up leaning toward him and rammed the blazing end of the flare into the open flap of his gills he screamed louder than a human being could have and both hands flew to his throat to clutch at the flare i got a leg free and kicked him in the chin hard driving down with all the power of my leg behind a crushing heel i heard something crack and he screamed flinching i freed my other leg and scrambled away from him clutching awkwardly at my right ankle with my left hand nothing tore the flare out his pale eyes nearly luminous with rage and came after me roaring i had never been more frightened in my life i couldnt get to the damn holdout gun before he reached me so i did the only thing i could i ran blind into the dark and he came after me like a rabid locomotive i knew i didnt have much room left i knew that i would hit a wall in a few seconds and that then hed have me i could only pray that the shots id put in him were more serious than his reaction to them indicatedthat he was already bleeding massively and that the extra few seconds would be enough time to let him die but somewhere inside i knew better i was playing out of my league and i had known that from the beginning beautiful light suddenly fluoresced in front of methe acid growths on the walls i slammed to a stop in front of the weird clumps of material and saw little tendrils and orifices on the growths tracking and orienting on me i turned to face nothing he came in insanely huge insanely strong and roaring in a terrible fury but terrible fury alone doesnt win fights in fact it can be a deadly weakness in the second it took him to reach me i touched the center of calm in myself earned with endless hours of practice and discipline i judged the distance and the timing it felt as if i had forever to work out what i would need to do and then i did to nothing exactly what id done to ray as he closed i ducked under his huge hands spinning to sweep my right leg across his right foot just as it was about to hit the floor preternaturally strong though he may have been gravity pulled him just as hard as it had ray and his joints operated in exactly the same fashion his right foot was driven to tangle with his left and he went smashing forward into the wall into the growth into the spurting cloud of acidic spray that erupted from it aiming at me i rolled away to one side frantically but i neednt have worried nothings vast bulk shielded me from the acid spray i turned over and backed away awkwardly on my butt and my left hand staring at nothing in sheer fascination he didnt scream i think he was trying the acid must have torn his throat apart first thing he sort of recoiled staggering and fell to his knees i could see his profile dimly in the distant light of the flare and the glow of the acid fungus it just dissolved seeing it was like watching timelapse photography of a statue being worn away by wind and rain fluids pooled around his knees he took several agonized breathsand then there were sucking sounds as the acid ate into his chest wall and then there were no sounds at all he tried to get up twice then he settled down onto his side as if going to sleep the acid kept chewing at him even after he was dead the stench hit me and i retched horribly i backed farther away and sat for a second with my knees up against my chest my good arm wrapped around them and sobbed i hurt so much i hurt so much and my arm throbbed dully dammit dresden i said into the silence in a choked voice dammit here i am doing your job dammit dammit dammit i got to my feet a moment later i recovered the second flare i found my gun i went to do what i could for will and marcy who would both live after that i went around the warehouse and methodically put another halfdozen rounds into the head of each and every fallen turtleneck and i used a can of paint thinner i found in a corner to set their master on fire just to be sure theres no such thing as overkill i stood in the open loading door with will facing into a wind that blew from the east over the lake cool and sweet there was nothing between us and the water but forty feet of paved loading area it was quiet there had been no reaction to the events in the building behind us lying in quiet rows on the concrete floors were the prisoners each of them freed from their respective cages even though his left shoulder had been badly dislocated will had done most of the heavy lifting dragging the cages out of the railroad car so i could open them and with marcys and georgias help drag the prisoners out marcy came up to stand beside us wearing her sundress once more her right shoulder looked hideous the urchin projectile had struck her and two tines had sunk in deeply acid had gone into the muscle and dribbled down from the other tines to slither over her skin burning as it went the tines had been barbed but the acid had liquefied the skin immediately around the barbs and i had been forced to pry the projectile out with a knife marcy had stopped the bleeding the same way will had but her arm was somewhat misshapen and the scar tissue was truly impressive in its hideousness that didnt seem to overly worry the young woman whom i would never again be able to compare to a mouse in any fashion but she looked exhausted shes sleeping marcy reported quietly to will good will said his voice sounded flat detached he was hurting a lot he looked at me eyes dull and said think this will work sunrise i said quietly nodding and glanced back at the rows of motionless prisoners it has a kind of energy a force of positive renewal in it it should wipe away the spells holding them how do you know will asked dresden i said marcy tilted her head suddenly and said someones coming i stood by the door ready to pull it down as a car a silver beemer came around the corner of the warehouse into the paved loading lot it stopped maybe thirty feet away and ms gard got out of it she looked at me for a moment then came around to the front of the car and stood there waiting the eastern wind blew her long blond hair toward us like a gently rolling banner wait here i said quietly you sure will asked yeah he nodded okay i stepped out went down a short set of concrete stairs to the level of the lot and walked over to face gard she looked at me expressionlessly for a moment and then at the prisoners she shook her head slowly and said you did it i didnt say anything thats fomor magic she said quietly one of their lesser sorcerers and his retainers why i asked her why are they doing this gard shook her head and shrugged i dont know but there are teams like it operating all over the world right now not in chicago i said quietly not in chicago she agreed and her mouth stretched into a slow genuine grin she bowed to me from the waist a gesture of antiquated stately grace and said there are few mortals with courage enough to face the fomor and their minions fewer still with skill enough to face them and win her eyes grew serious and she lost the smile hail warrior dresden would have known how to respond to that kind of anachronistic gibberish i nodded back to her and said thank you my employer owes you a debt it seems didnt do it for him but your actions are significant regardless she said this is the second time the fomor have attempted to move on chicagoand failed she was quiet for a moment and then said if you told him you wanted your job back he could make it happen without further obligation i stood very still for a long silent minute then i sighed very tired and said even if i was sure he wouldnt try to use it as leverage down the line if marcone got it for me i wouldnt want it ill make my own way gard nodded her eyes steady and she looked back at the warehouse again theres another position you might consider monoc securities is always hiring my boss is always pleased to find those with the propershe pursed her lipsframe of mind considering your experience and skill set i think you could do very well as one of our security consultants and work for guys like marcone i asked you should bear in mind that this is the second such incursion of the fomor gard said in a level voice and there have been a halfdozen others nosing at the city in the last eight months alone all of them have been turned away courtesy of marcone hes swell i said he keeps his word gard replied which puts him a step above most of your own superiors in my opinion like him or not he has defended this city its no minor thing every predator defends its territory i said pass her eyes glittered with amusement and she shook her head vadderung would definitely find you interesting youve even got the hair for it dont be surprised if you get a call sometime its a free country i said is there anything else gard turned to look at the rapidly lightening eastern horizon and looked from there to the prisoners you seem to have things fairly well contained i nodded dont worry too much about the scene gard said hardly anyone ever noses around places like this but that wasnt what she meant gard was telling me that the evidencethe bodies the rounds the weapons all of itwas going to disappear marcones people were very very good at making evidence vanish in this particular case i wasnt sure i minded it would protect will and marcy both of whom had left blood there and it would also cover me and gard hadnt made me ask for it she held up her hand palm upanother one of those gestures their meanings forgotten by everyone except for longterm wackjobs like dresden i returned it she nodded in approval got into her car and left will came up to stand at my side watching her go then both of us turned to watch the sun beginning to rise over the lake hes really gone will said quietly dresden i mean i frowned and stared at the waters that had by every rational indication swallowed dresdens lifeblood i didnt answer him was she telling the truth you think that marcones the one standing in the gap now probably i said to some degree but she was wrong wrong how dresdens not gone i said i touched a hand lightly to my brow hes here i touched wills bare chest on the left side here without him without what hes done over the years you and i would never have been able to pull this off no he agreed probably not definitely not there are a lot of people hes taught trained defended and hes been an example no single one of us can ever be what he was but together maybe we can the justice league of chicago will asked smiling slightly dibs on batman i said his smile turned into a real grin for a minute then sobered you really think we can do it i nodded firmly well cover his beat that will be a neat trick if you can do it will said if we can do it i corrected him ill need a deputy will someone i trust you he was quiet for a moment then he nodded im in but youre talking about some very ah disparate personalities how long can you keep it up my answer surprised even me until dresden gets back will frowned you really think thats possible i shook my head it doesnt seem to be but theres this voice inside me that keeps pointing out that we havent seen a body until i have the sun rose over the horizon burning gently through the morning haze over the lake and golden light washed over us warm and strong we turned to watch the prisoners and as the light touched them they began to shudder then they began to stir the first to rise was georgia will sucked in a long slow breath his eyes shining until i have i said quietly i cant believe hes dead we walked back to the warehouse together to see to the business of getting the prisoners safely home
