king and queen sat oer the board in high festivity between them there was much discourse about the briny sea our gallant king and youthful queenthey sailed across the foam much better had it been for both that they had stayed at home but barely they a mile had gone when still the vessel stood there came a raven wild who strove to sink them in the flood if any thing the ship doth hold concealed beneath the main ill give thee bird a lump of gold to set it free again o do not sink us in the sea swart bird exclaimed the queen and ill give thee a lump of gold weighs bismer pounds fifteen gold and silver i heed them not i crave another fee the treasure neath thy girdle fair thou now must promise me plenty of gold i have myself from gold no help youll find on what beneath your girdles hid ive firmly set my mind i give what neath my girdles hid my bunch of keyswhat more ill speedily have others forged if i but win to shore then straight she took the little keys and cast them overboard away then flew the raven glad he had obtained her word the queen walks on the yellow sand then oer her came a gloom she felt that germand gladenswayne was quick within her womb and from that day when five short months her head had flitted oer the queen she went to the chamber high and a lovely son she bore born was he in the evening hour they christened him at night they called him germand gladenswayne concealed him whilst they might they fostered him a winters space they fostered him for nine the fairest youth he grew on whom the sun did ever shine so well he throve so well he grew his horse he well could ride wheneer his mother on him gazed so woefully she sighdnow list to me my mother dear one thing i fain would know why dost thou sigh so piteously wheneer i past thee go now hear thou germand gladenswayne ive cause to be forlorn beguiled i gave thee to a fiend before thou yet wast born and do thou hear my mother dear all sorrow cast aside whatever be the will of god by that i must abide it chanced upon a harvest morn the breezes scarcely stirrd that as the chamber door stood ope so wild a yell was heard in came the laidly bird of prey and stood the queen before dost thou remember gracious queen thy gift to me of yore she swore by god and by the saints by all thats good she swore that son nor daughter in the world she never never bore then flew away the bird of prey with an eldritch shriek hes flown wheneer i meet germand gladenswayne ill remember hes my own when germand fifteen years had reached hed fain a damsel wed he loved the daughter of englands king the angellovely maid his longing to be with his plighted maid he might no more withstand o how shall i come across the foam to the floodencircled land it was germand gladenswayne he donned his best array and he has taen to his mother dear to the lofty hall his way in came germand gladenswayne in scarlet clad was he o mother lend me thy feather robe to fly across the sea my feather robe hangs upon the crook the feathers droop so low if thou dost fly to the foreign land i shall see thee never moe the pinions are so broad that they grow heavy in the air ill have another made for me if i live another yearhe set himself in the feather robe flew oer the ocean straight and there met him the raven wild beneath a rock did wait he flew up and he flew down he flew in fearless guise and when he reached the midst of the sea he heard a frightful voice ha well met germand gladenswayne oer long hast thou delayd thou wast but little when to me a present thou wast made o let me fare o let me fly to speak my maiden dear be sure that i when her ive seen again will meet thee here then i will let thee fly but still my mark on thee will set lest thou midst knights and beauteous dames thy raven lord forget then out the boys right eye he tore and drank up half his blood but still he reached the bower of his bride his heart was yet so good he set himself by the damsels bower all bloody and distrest all the dames within that were forgot to smile and jest all the damsels grew so still with horror sat they fast except proud damsel adelude aside her work she cast all the maids within forsook both jest and merry note twas the proud damsel adelude her hands together smote now welcome germand gladenswayne where hast thou been to play say why bebloodied are thy clothes and pale thy cheeks as clay farewell dear damsel adelude i soon from thee must fly for he must have my youthful life who tore from me my eye her silver handled comb she took and strove to comb his head for every hair that she did comb a briny tear she shed for every lock the maiden combed a stream of tears did run how often she the mother cursed who had betrayed her sonit was damsel adelude she took him in her arm accursed be the wicked dame who caused us all this harm hear thou sweet damsel adelude curse not my mother so she had no power in this affair we all to fate must bow he set him in his feather robe and mounted on the wind she set her in another robe and followed fast behind o turn thee damsel adelude turn my beloved one thy bower door doth open stand thy keys lie on the stone though my bower door doth open stand and my keys lie on the stone yet i will follow thee to the place where harm to thee was done all the birds she cut so small she met with there on high except the laidly raven wild and him she could not spy twas the proud damsel adelude flew down towards the strand nought found she of the gladenswayne except the good right hand she flew so wroth the clouds below the laidly bird to find she flew east and she flew west to slay him she designed she hacked the birds into pieces three before her knife that came but when she met the raven wild into ten she hacked his frame and still till she of sorrow died she flew across the heath it was for germand gladenswayne she suffered grief and death
