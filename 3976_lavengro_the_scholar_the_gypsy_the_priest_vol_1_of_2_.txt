mdcccci introduction there have been many romany ryes or gypsy gentlemen as gypsies designate those who though not of their race yet have loved that race and have mastered the romany tongue the first is one of the oddestandrew boorde c carthusian traveller physician and perhaps the original merry andrew he got into trouble over certain delinquencies and died a prisoner in the fleet gaol in he was writing his fyrst boke of the introduction of knowledge and had come to the xxxviii chapiter which treateth of egypt and of theyr money and of theyr speche he started bravely egipt is a countrey ioyned to jury the countrey is plentyfull of wine corne and hony there be many great wyldernes in the which be many great wylde beastes in ye which wildernis liuid many holyfathers as it apperith in vitas patrum the people but here i fancy he suddenly broke off what did he know of the egyptian people greece was the nearest he had ever been to egypt going however for a stroll through his native county of sussex he presently lights on a band of right egyptians belike in front of an alehouse egyptians the very thing like any newspaper correspondent of today he must straightway have whipped out his notebook and jotted down the rest of his chapter the people of the country be swarte and doth go disgisid in theyr apparel contrary to other nacions they be lyght fyngerd and vse pyking they have litle maner and euyl loggyng and yet they be pleasant daunsers ther be few or none of the egypcions yt doth dwel in egipt for egipt is repleted now with infydel alyons ther mony is brasse and golde yf there be any man yt wyl learne parte of theyr speche englyshe and egipt speche foloweth and there duly follows a neat little ollendorfian dialogue about meat and bread wine and beer and suchlike in which dr furnivall boordes editor left it for professor zupitza to recognise excellent romany sit you downe and dryncke drinke drynke for gods sake are two of the phrases the interview was probably prolonged perhaps renewed andrew boorde would find good fellowship with gypsies no is the scholargypsy of whom alas we know all too little neither name nor dates but only just what joseph glanvill tells in his vanity of dogmatizing there was very lately a lad in the university of oxford who being of very pregnant and ready parts and yet wanting the encouragement of preferment was by his poverty forcd to leave his studies there and to cast himself upon the wide world for a livelyhood now his necessities growing dayly on him and wanting the help of friends to relieve him he was at last forced to joyn himself to a company of vagabond gypsies whom occasionly he met with and to follow their trade for a maintenance among these extravagant people by the insinuating subtilty of his carriage he quickly got so much of their love and esteem as that they discoverd to him their mystery in the practice of which by the pregnancy of his wit and parts he soon grew so good and proficient as to be able to outdo his instructours after he had been a pretty while well exercisd in the trade there chancd to ride by a couple of scholars who had formerly bin of his acquaintance the scholars had quickly spyed out their old friend among the gypsies and their amazement to see him among such society had wellnigh discoverd him but by a sign he prevented their owning him before that crew and taking one of them aside privately desired him with his friend to go to an inn not far distant thence promising there to come to them they accordingly went thither and he follows after their first salutations his friends enquire how he came to lead so odd a life as that was and to joyn himself with such a cheating beggerly company the scholargypsy having given them an account of the necessity which drove him to that kind of life told them that the people he went with were not such impostouirs as they were taken for but that they had a traditional kind of learning among them and could do wonders by the power of imagination and that himself had learnt much of their art and improved it further then themselves could and to evince the truth of what he told them he said hed remove into another room leaving them to discourse together and upon his return tell them the sum of what they had talked of which accordingly he performd giving them a full account of what had passed between them in his absence the scholars being amazd at so unexpected a discovery earnestly desird him to unriddle the mystery in which he gave them satisfaction by telling them that what he did was by the power of imagination his phancy binding theirs and that himself had dictated to them the discourse they held together while he was from them that there were warrantable wayes of heightening the imagination to that pitch as to bind anothers and that when he had compassd the whole secret some parts of which he said he was yet ignorant of he intended to leave their company and give the world an account of what he had learned the third of our romany ryes is a scottish peer and a jacobite george seton fifth earl of wintoun he as a young man quarrelled with his father and taking up with a band of gypsies who frequented the seton property set off with them on their wanderings over scotland england and the continent he seems to have been away from june until november and when by his fathers death in he succeeded to the earldom no man knew where to find him till accident led to the discovery the rev robert patten the judas and the historian of the records how on the rebels march from kelso to preston lord wintoun would tell many pleasant stories of his travels and his living unknown and obscurely with a blacksmith in france whom he served some years as a bellowsblower and underservant he was patten adds very curious in working in several handicraft matters and had made good proficiency in them witness the nice way he had found to cut asunder one of the iron bars in his window in the tower by some small instrument scarce perceivable it was on th august that lord wintoun made his escape but like everything else in his life it is wrapped in obscurity for according to the diary of mary countess cowper for th march the last day of his trial my lord winton had sawed an iron bar with the spring of his watch very near in two in order to make his escape but it was found out so possibly there is something in the story told by the author of rab and his friends that he was carried out of the tower in a hamper supposed to be full of family charters by john gunn the head of a band of roving gipsies anyhow ever afterwards he lived at rome where in he was great master of the lodge of freemasonry he died unmarried though lady cowper alleges he has eight wivescharles bosvile the scion of a good old yorkshire house is another who must have known much about the gypsies he was buried at rossington near doncaster on th january and more than a hundred years later the gypsies would visit the churchyard and pour out a flagon of ale on his grave by the chancel door joseph hunter the historian of south yorkshire tells how he had established a species of sovereignty among that singular people the gypsies who before the enclosures frequented the moors round rossington his word with them was law and his authority so great that he perfectly restrained the pilfering propensities for which the tribe is censured and gained the entire goodwill for himself and his subjects of the farmers and people around he was a gentleman with an estate of about l a year and his contemporary abraham de la pryme of hatfield describes him as a mad spark mighty fine and brisk keeping company with a great many gentlemen knights and esquires yet running about the country bamfylde moore carew the son of the rector of bickleigh near tiverton is semimythical though we know that a man of that name did really marry at stoke damerel near plymouth one mary gray on th december gray is an old gypsy surname but the gypsies of his life and adventures are just as unreal as those of any melodrama or penny dreadful the poetphysician john armstrong c was at college at edinburgh with mr lawrie who in was minister of hawick and one year during the vacation they joined a band of gipsies who in those days much infested the borders so says jupiter carlyle in his autobiography and he adds that this expedition which really took place as armstrong informed me in london furnished lawrie with a fine field for fiction and rhodomontade so closely united to the groundwork which might be true that it was impossible to discompound them the fourth lord coleraine better known as colonel george hanger c was a wild harumscarum irishman according to the hon grantley berkeleys my life and recollections in one of his early rambles he joined a gang of gipsies fell in love with one of their darkeyed beauties and married her according to the rites of the tribe he had entered the footguards in and used to introduce his brotherofficers to his dusky bride boasting his confidence in her fidelity his married life went on pleasantly for about a fortnight at the end of which his confidence and his bliss were destroyed together on ascertaining to his intense disgust that his gipsy inamorata had eloped with a bandylegged tinker very unlike the colonel was the mythologist jacob bryant we know the little man with his thirteen spaniels through madame darblays diaries she often visited cypenham his house near windsor it must have been in his garden here that he collected his materials for the paper on the zingara or gypsey language which he read to the royal society in for covascorook laurel is intelligible only by supposing him to have pointed to a laurel and asked what is this and by the gypsys answering in words that mean this is a tree there are a number of similar slips in the vocabulary as sauvee an eagle rightly a needle porcherie brass a halfpenny a copper plastomingree couch coach and baurobevalacochenos storm this last word posed the etymological skill of even prof pott in his great work on die zigeuner but he hazards the conjecture that cochenos may be akin to the greek χολη really the whole may be dismembered into baúro great bával wind and the english acatching us still bryants is not at all a bad vocabulary edward bulwer lord lytton tells in a fragment of autobiography how at twentyone he met a pretty gypsy girl at sunset was guided by her to the tents and spent with these swarthy wanderers five or six very happy days he committed his money fourteen pounds in all to the care of the gypsy grandmother the queen of the camp who was faithful to the customs of the primitive gipsies and would eat nothing in the shape of animal food that had not died a natural death mimy the gypsy girl and he make passionate love till at last she proposes marriage for five years by breaking a piece of burnt earth but the stars and the gypsy brethren forbid the banns so they part eternally it is all the silliest moonshine the most impossible gypsies no bulwer lytton deserves no place among the real romany ryes of these a whole host remain francis irvine a lieutenant in the bengal native infantry on the outwardbound voyage to india on board the preston east indiaman took down a vocabulary of one hundred and thirty romany words from john lee a gypsy recruit for the companys european force no other case is known to me of a gypsy revisiting the land of his forefathers john hoyland a yorkshire quaker in began to study the very destitute and abject condition of the midland gypsies and wrote a historical survey of the customs habits and present state of the gypsies york he is said to have fallen in love with a blackeyed gipsy girl but it does not appear that he married her which is a pity a gypsy quakeress would be a charming fancy that poor thing john clare the peasantpoet is said to have joined some gipsies for a time before and richard bright md famous as the investigator of brights disease must have known much of gypsies both abroad and at home to be able to write his travels through lower hungary james crabb wesleyan minister at southampton and samuel roberts sheffield manufacturer both wrote books on the gypsies but were gypsy philanthropists rather than romany ryes still roberts had a very fair knowledge of the language and at seventyseven longed to be a gypsy and enter a house no more colonel john staples harriot during his residence in north hampshire in theyears was led to pay considerable attention to a race of vagrant men roaming about the highroads and lanes in the vicinity of whitchurch waltham and overton in december he read before the royal asiatic society an excellent romany vocabulary of over four hundred words these were borrows chief predecessors but the list could be largely extended by making it include such names as those of sir john popham lord chiefjustice of england sir william sinclair lord justicegeneral of scotland from mr william sympsoune a great scottish doctor of medicine towards the close of the sixteenth century the countess of cassillis who did not elope with johnnie faa richard head c the author of the english rogue william marsden the orientalist john wilson christopher north the rev john baird minister of yetholm g p r james the novelist and sam bough the landscapepainter and after borrow come many the following are but a few of themjohn phillip ra tom taylor the rev t w norwood george s phillips january searle charles kingsley joseph sheridan le fanu mr charles godfrey leland hans breitmann prof edward henry palmer sir richard burton bath c smart md of manchester mr h t crofton major whytemelville mr joseph lucas the rev r n sanderson dr d fearon ranking mr david macritchie mr g r sims mr george meredith mr theodore wattsdunton f w carew md and mr john sampson thus leaving aside all the foreign romany ryes from the great engraver jacques callot to the present polish novelist sienkiewicz we see that borrow was not quite so sui generis as he claimed for himself and as others have often claimed for him the meagreness of his knowledge of the anglogypsy dialect came out in his wordbook of the romany there must have been over a dozen englishmen who have known it far better than he for his spanishgypsy vocabulary in the zincali he certainly drew largely either on richard brights travels through lower hungary or on brights spanish authority whatever that may have been his knowledge of the strange history of the gypsies was very elementary of their manners almost more so and of their folklore practically nil and yet i would put george borrow above every other writer on the gypsies in lavengro and to a less degree in its sequel the romany rye he communicates a subtle insight into gypsydom that is totally wanting in the worksmainly philologicalof pott liebich paspati miklosich and their confrères take his first meeting with gypsies in the green lane near norman cross there are flaws in it he never would have spoken of the gypsy beldame as my mother there nor could he possibly have guessed that the romany sap means snake yet compare it with maggie tullivers gypsy adventure in the mill on the floss how vivid and vigorous the one how tame and commonplace the other i am not going to dilate on the beauties of lavengro they seem to me sufficiently selfevident but there is one point about the book that deserves some considering its credibility as autobiography professor knapp borrows biographer seems to place implicit confidence in lavengro i find myself unable to agree with him borrow may really have written the story of joseph sell for a collection of christmas tales he may really have camped for some weeks as a tinker near willenhall belle berners may really have had some prototype and he may really have bought the splendid horse of the willenhall tavernkeeper and sold it afterwards at horncastle but is the man in black then also a reality and the reverend mr platitude who thanks god that he has left all his church of england prejudices in italy in other words did tractarianism exist in eight years before it was engendered by kebles sermon david haggart again the scottish jack sheppardborrow describes him as a lad of some fifteen years with prodigious breadth of chest and as defeating in single combat a fullgrown bakers apprentice borrow well may have seen him for in july he really enlisted as a drummer in borrows fathers regiment newly quartered in edinburgh castle but he was not fifteen then only twelve years old and the jew pedlar scene in the first chapter and the old applewomans son in the sixtysecond one might take equal exception to borrows pretended visits to iceland moultan and kiachta he was never within three thousand miles of kiachta to his translation of st lukes gospel into basque of which he had only the merest smattering and to his statement to a cornish clergyman in that his horrors were due to the effects of mrs hernes poisonhe had suffered from them seven years before his gypsy wanderings but the strongest proof of his lax adherence to fact is adduced by professor knapp himself in chapter xvi of lavengro borrow relates how in at tombland fair norwich he doffed his hat to the great trotting stallion marshland shales drew a deep ah and repeated the words of the old fellows around such a horse as this we shall never see again a pity that he is so old yes but as professor knapp has found out with his infinite painstaking marshland shales was not thus paraded until th april lavengro a was written in years after the events recorded there several of its petty slips are probably due to sheer forgetfulness eg as to the four airts of edinburgh castle and the lofty townwalls of berwickupontweed and the rest i imagine were due partly to love of posing but much more to an honest desire to produce an amusing and interesting book borrow was not writing a set autobiography and it seems rather hard to imagine that he was and then to come down on this or that inaccuracy he did pose though all his life long and in every one of his writings he posed to poor old esther faa blythe the queen of the yetholm tinklers when on entering her little cottage he flung his arms up three times into the air and in an exceedingly disagreeable voice exclaimed sossi your nav etc wordbook p he posed shamefully to lieutcol elers napier knapp i and he posed even to me a mere lad when i saw him thrice in at ascot at his house in hereford square and at the nottinghill potteries bookman feb pp yet what books he has given us the very best of them lavengro its fight with theflaming tinman is the finest fight in all the worlds literature lavengro nevertheless met with a very sorry reception it was not genteel enough for the readers of disraeli and bulwer lytton and it is only since borrows death on th july that it has won its due place of preeminence no mans writing says mr wattsdunton can take you into the country as borrows can it makes you feel the sunshine smell the flowers hear the lark sing and the grasshopper chirp they who would know borrow thoroughly should pass from his own works to mr wattsduntons reminiscences of george borrow athenæum sept to his notes upon george borrow lavengro ward lock bowden co to mr william a dutts george borrow in east anglia to unpublished letters of george borrow first printed in the bible society reporter from july onwards and above all to professor william i knapps life writings and correspondence of george borrow vols authors preface to the first edition in the following pages i have endeavoured to describe a dream partly of study partly of adventure in which will be found copious notices of books and many descriptions of life and manners some in a very unusual form the scenes of action lie in the british islandspray be not displeased gentle reader if perchance thou hast imagined that i was about to conduct thee to distant lands and didst promise thyself much instruction and entertainment from what i might tell thee of them i do assure thee that thou hast no reason to be displeased inasmuch as there are no countries in the world less known by the british than these selfsame british islands or where more strange things are every day occurring whether in road or street house or dingle the time embraces nearly the first quarter of the present century this information again may perhaps be anything but agreeable to thee it is a long time to revert to but fret not thyself many matters which at present much occupy the public mind originated in some degree towards the latter end of that period and some of them will be treated of the principal actors in this dream or drama are as you will have gathered from the titlepage a scholar a gypsy and a priest should you imagine that these three form one permit me to assure you that you are very much mistaken should there be something of the gypsy manifest in the scholar there is certainly nothing of the priest with respect to the gypsydecidedly the most entertaining character of the threethere is certainly nothing of the scholar or the priest in him and as for the priest though there may be something in him both of scholarship and gypsyism neither the scholar nor the gypsy would feel at all flattered by being confounded with him many characters which may be called subordinate will be found and it is probable that some of these characters will afford much more interest to the reader than those styled the principal the favourites with the writer are a brave old soldier and his helpmate an ancient gentlewoman who sold apples and a strange kind of wandering man and his wife amongst the many things attempted in this book is the encouragement of charity and free and genial manners and the exposure of humbug of which there are various kinds but of which the most perfidious the most debasing and the most cruel is the humbug of the priest yet let no one think that irreligion is advocated in this book with respect to religious tenets i wish to observe that i am a member of the church of england into whose communion i was baptized and to which my forefathers belonged its being the religion in which i was baptized and of my forefathers would be a strong inducement to me to cling to it for i do not happen to be one of those choice spirits who turn from their banner when the battle bears strongly against it and go over to the enemy and who receive at first a hug and a viva and in the sequel contempt and spittle in the face but my chief reason for belonging to it is because of all churches calling themselves christian ones i believe there is none so good so well founded upon scripture or whose ministers are upon the whole so exemplary in their lives and conversation so well read in the book from which they preach or so versed in general learning so useful in their immediate neighbourhoods or so unwilling to persecute people of other denominations for matters of doctrine in the communion of this church and with the religious consolation of its ministers i wish and hope to live and die and in its and their defence will at all times be ready if required to speak though humbly and to fight though feebly against enemies whether carnal or spiritual and is there no priestcraft in the church of england there is certainly or rather there was a modicum of priestcraft in the church of england but i have generally found that those who are most vehement against the church of england are chiefly dissatisfied with her because there is only a modicum of that article in herwere she stuffed to the very cupola with it like a certain other church they would have much less to say against the church of england by the other church i mean rome its system was once prevalent in england and during the period that it prevailed there was more prolific of debasement and crime than all other causes united the people and the government at last becoming enlightened by means of the scripture spurned it from the island with disgust and horror the land instantly after its disappearance becoming a fair field in which arts sciences and all the amiable virtues flourished instead ofbeing a pestilent marsh where swinelike ignorance wallowed and artful hypocrites like so many willsothewisp played antic gambols about around and above debased humanity but popery still wished to play her old part to regain her lost dominion to reconvert the smiling land into the pestilential morass where she could play again her old antics from the period of the reformation in england up to the present time she has kept her emissaries here individuals contemptible in intellect it is true but catlike and gliding who at her bidding have endeavoured as much as in their power has lain to damp and stifle every genial honest loyal and independent thought and to reduce minds to such a state of dotage as would enable their old popish mother to do what she pleased with them and in every country however enlightened there are always minds inclined to grovelling superstitionminds fond of eating dust and swallowing clayminds never at rest save when prostrate before some fellow in a surplice and these popish emissaries found always some weak enough to bow down before them astounded by their dreadful denunciations of eternal woe and damnation to any who should refuse to believe their romania but they played a poor gamethe law protected the servants of scripture and the priest with his beads seldom ventured to approach any but the remnant of those of the eikonolatryrepresentatives of wormeaten houses their debased dependants and a few poor crazy creatures amongst the middle classeshe played a poor game and the labour was about to prove almost entirely in vain when the english legislature in compassion or contempt or yet more probably influenced by that spirit of toleration and kindness which is so mixed up with protestantism removed almost entirely the disabilities under which popery laboured and enabled it to raise its head and to speak out almost without fear and it did raise its head and though it spoke with some little fear at first soon discarded every relic of it went about the land uttering its damnation cry gathering around itand for doing so many thanks to itthe favourers of priestcraft who lurked within the walls of the church of england frightening with the loudness of its voice the weak the timid and the ailing perpetrating whenever it had an opportunity that species of crime to which it has ever been most partial deathbed robbery for as it is cruel so is it dastardly yes it went on enlisting plundering and uttering its terrible threats till till it became as it always does when left to itself a fool a very fool its plunderings might have been overlooked and so might its insolence had it been common insolence but it and then the roar of indignation which arose from outraged england against the viper the frozen viper which it had permitted to warm itself upon its bosom but thanks popery you have done all that the friends of enlightenment and religious liberty could wish but if ever there were a set of foolish ones to be found under heaven surely it is the priestly rabble who came over from rome to direct the grand movementso long in its getting up but now again the damnation cry is withdrawn there is a subdued meekness in your demeanour you are now once more harmless as a

gravemirrorsalpine countryemblemsslow of speechthe jewstrange gestures on an evening of july in the year at east d a beautiful little town in a certain district of east anglia i first saw the light a my father was a cornish man the youngest as i have heard him say of seven brothers b he sprang from a family of gentlemen or as some people would call them gentillâtres for they were not very wealthy they had a coat of arms however and lived on their own property at a place called tredinnock c which being interpreted means the house on the hill which house and the neighbouring acres had been from time immemorial in their possession i mention these particulars that the reader may see at once that i am not altogether of low and plebeian origin the present age is highly aristocratic and i am convinced that the public will read my pages with more zest from being told that i am a gentillâtre by birth with cornish blood in my veins of a family who lived on their own property at a place bearing a celtic name signifying the house on the hill or more strictly the house on the hillock my father was what is generally termed a posthumous childin other words the gentillâtre who begot him never had the satisfaction of invoking the blessing of the father of all upon his head having departed this life some months before the birth of his youngest son the boy therefore never knew a fathers care he was however well tended by his mother whose favourite he was so much so indeed that his brethren the youngest of whom was considerably older than himself were rather jealous of him i never heard however that they treated him with any marked unkindness and it will be as well to observe here that i am by no means well acquainted with his early history of which indeed as i am not writing his life it is not necessary to say much shortly after his mothers death which occurred when he was eighteen he adopted the profession of arms which he followed during the remainder of his life and in which had circumstances permitted he would probably have shone amongst the best by nature he was cool and collected slow to anger though perfectly fearless patient of control of great strength and to crown all a proper man with his hands with far inferior qualifications many a man has become a fieldmarshal or general similar ones made tamerlane who was not a gentillâtre but the son of a blacksmith emperor of onethird of the world but the race is not always for the swift nor the battle for the strong indeed i ought rather to say very seldom certain it is that my father with all his high military qualifications never became emperor fieldmarshal or even general indeed he had never an opportunity of distinguishing himself save in one battle and that took place neither in flanders egypt nor on the banks of the indus or oxus but in hyde park smile not gentle reader many a battle has been fought in hyde park in which as much skill science and bravery have been displayed as ever achieved a victory in flanders or by the indus in such a combat as that to which i allude i opine that even wellington or napoleon would have been heartily glad to cry for quarter ere the lapse of five minutes and even the blacksmith tartar would perhaps have shrunk from the opponent with whom after having had a dispute with him my father engaged in single combat for one hour at the end of which time the champions shook hands and retired each having experienced quite enough of the others prowess the name of my fathers antagonist was brain what still a smile did you never hear that name before i cannot help it honour to brain who four months after the event which i have now narrated was champion of england having conquered the heroic johnson honour to brain who at the end of other four months worn out by the dreadful blows which he had received in his manly combats expired in the arms of my father who read the bible to him in his latter momentsbig ben brain you no longer smile even you have heard of big ben i have already hinted that my father never rose to any very exalted rank in his profession notwithstanding his prowess and other qualifications after serving for many years in the line he at last entered as captain in the militia regiment of the earl of a at that period just raised and to which he was sent by the duke of york to instruct the young levies in military manœuvres and discipline and in this mission i believe he perfectly succeeded competent judges having assured me that the regiment in question soon came by his means to be considered as one of the most brilliant in the service and inferior to no regiment of the line in appearance or discipline as the headquarters of this corps were at d b the duties of my father not unfrequently carried him to that place and it was on one of these occasions that he became acquainted with a young person of the neighbourhood for whom he formed an attachment which was returned and this young person was my mother c she was descended from a family of french protestants natives of caen who were obliged to leave their native country when old louis at the instigation of the pope thought fit to revoke the edict of nantes their name was petrement and i have reason for believing that they were people of some consideration that they were noble hearts and good christiansthey gave sufficient proof in scorning to bow the knee to the tyranny of rome so they left beautiful normandy for their faiths sake and with a few louis dors in their purse a bible in the vulgar tongue and a couple of old swords which if report be true had done service in the huguenot wars they crossed the sea to the isle of civil peace and religious liberty and established themselves in east anglia and many other huguenot families bent their steps thither and devoted themselves to agriculture or the mechanical arts and in the venerable old city the capital of the province in the northern shadow of the castle of de burgh the exiles built for themselves a church where they praised god in the french tongue and to which at particular seasons of the year they were in the habit of flocking from country and from town to sing thou hast provided for us a goodly earth thou waterest her furrows thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof thou makest it soft with the drops of rain and blessest the increase of it i have been told that in her younger days my mother was strikingly handsome this i can easily believe i never knew her in her youth for though she was very young when she married my father who was her senior by many years she had attained the middle age before i was born no children having been vouchsafed to my parents in the early stages of their union yet even at the present day now that years threescore and ten have passed over her head attended with sorrow and troubles manifold poorly chequered with scanty joys can i look on that countenance and doubt that at one time beauty decked it as with a glorious garment hail to thee my parent as thou sittest there in thy widows weeds in the dusky parlour in the house overgrown with the lustrous ivy of the sister isle the solitary house at the end of the retired court shaded by lofty poplars hail to thee dame of the oval face olive complexion and grecian forehead by thy table seated with the mighty volume of the good bishop hopkins spread out before thee there is peace in thy countenance my mother it is not worldly peace however not the deceitful peace which lulls to bewitching slumbers and from which let us pray humbly pray that every sinner may be roused in time to implore mercy not in vain thine is the peace of the righteous my mother of those to whom no sin can be imputed the score of whose misdeeds has been long since washed away by the blood of atonement which imputeth righteousness to those who trust in it it was not always thus my mother a time was when the cares pomps and vanities of this world agitated thee too much but that time is gone by another and a better has succeeded there is peace now on thy countenance the true peace peace around thee too in thy solitary dwelling sounds of peace the cheerful hum of the kettle and the purring of the immense angola which stares up at thee from its settle with its almost human eyes no more earthly cares and affections now my mother yes one why dost thou suddenly raise thy dark and still brilliant eye from the volume with a somewhat startled glance what noise is that in the distant street merely the noise of a hoof a sound common enough it draws nearer nearer and now it stops before thy gate singular and now there is a pause a long pause ha thou hearest somethinga footstep a swift but heavy footstep thou risest thou tremblest there is a hand on the pin of the outer door there is some one in the vestibule and now the door of thy apartment opens there is a reflection on the mirror behind thee a travelling hat a grey head and sunburnt face my dearest son my darling mother yes mother thou didst recognise in the distant street the hooftramp of the wanderers horse i was not the only child of my parents i had a brother some three years older than myself he was a beautiful child one of those occasionally seen in england and in england alone a rosy angelic face blue eyes and light chestnut hair it was not exactly an anglosaxon countenance in which by the bye there is generally a cast of loutishness and stupidity it partook to a certain extent of the celtic character particularly in the fire and vivacity which illumined it his face was the mirror of his mind perhaps no disposition more amiable was ever found amongst the children of adam united however with no inconsiderable portion of high and dauntless spirit so great was his beauty in infancy that people especially those of the poorer classes would follow the nurse who carried him about in order to look at and bless his lovely face at the age of three months an attempt was made to snatch him from his mothers arms in the streets of london at the moment she was about to enter a coach indeed his appearance seemed to operate so powerfully upon every person who beheld him that my parents were under continual apprehension of losing him his beauty however was perhaps surpassed by the quickness of his parts he mastered his letters in a few hours and in a day or two could decipher the names of people on the doors of houses and over the shopwindows as he grew up his personal appearance became less prepossessing his quickness and cleverness however rather increased and i may say of him that with respect to everything which he took in hand he did it better and more speedily than any other person perhaps it will be asked here what became of him alas alas his was an early and a foreign grave as i have said before the race is not always for the swift nor the battle for the strong and now doubtless after the above portrait of my brother painted in the very best style of rubens the reader will conceive himself justified in expecting a fulllength one of myself as a child for as to my present appearance i suppose he will be tolerably content with that flitting glimpse in the mirror but he must excuse me i have no intention of drawing a portrait of myself in childhood indeed it would be difficult for at that time i never looked into mirrors no attempts however were ever made to steal me in my infancy and i never heard that my parents entertained the slightestapprehension of losing me by the hands of kidnappers though i remember perfectly well that people were in the habit of standing still to look at me ay more than at my brother from which premises the reader may form any conclusion with respect to my appearance which seemeth good unto him and reasonable should he being a goodnatured person and always inclined to adopt the charitable side in any doubtful point be willing to suppose that i too was eminently endowed by nature with personal graces i tell him frankly that i have no objection whatever to his entertaining that idea moreover that i heartily thank him and shall at all times be disposed under similar circumstances to exercise the same species of charity towards himself with respect to my mind and its qualities i shall be more explicit for were i to maintain much reserve on this point many things which appear in these memoirs would be highly mysterious to the reader indeed incomprehensible perhaps no two individuals were ever more unlike in mind and disposition than my brother and myself as light is opposed to darkness so was that happy brilliant cheerful child to the sad and melancholy being who sprang from the same stock as himself and was nurtured by the same milk once when travelling in an alpine country i arrived at a considerable elevation i saw in the distance far below a beautiful stream hastening to the ocean its rapid waters here sparkling in the sunshine and there tumbling merrily in cascades on its banks were vineyards and cheerful villages close to where i stood in a granite basin with steep and precipitous sides slumbered a deep dark lagoon shaded by black pines cypresses and yews it was a wild savage spot strange and singular ravens hovered above the pines filling the air with their uncouth notes pies chattered and i heard the cry of an eagle from a neighbouring peak there lay the lake the dark solitary and almost inaccessible lake gloomy shadows were upon it which strangely modified as gusts of wind agitated the surface occasionally assumed the shape of monsters so i stood on the alpine elevation and looked now on the gay distant river and now at the dark graniteencircled lake close beside me in the lone solitude and i thought of my brother and myself i am no moraliser but the gay and rapid river and the dark and silent lake were of a verity no bad emblems of us two so far from being quick and clever like my brother and able to rival the literary feat which i have recorded of him many years elapsed before i was able to understand the nature of letters or to connect them a lover of nooks and retired corners i was as a child in the habit of fleeing from society and of sitting for hours together with my head on my breast what i was thinking about it would be difficult to say at this distance of time i remember perfectly well however being ever conscious of a peculiar heaviness within me and at times of a strange sensation of fear which occasionally amounted to horror and for which i could assign no real cause whatever by nature slow of speech i took no pleasure in conversation nor in hearing the voices of my fellowcreatures when people addressed me i not unfrequently especially if they were strangers turned away my head from them and if they persisted in their notice burst into tears which singularity of behaviour by no means tended to dispose people in my favour i was as much disliked as my brother was deservedly beloved and admired my parents it is true were always kind to me and my brother who was goodnature itself was continually lavishing upon me every mark of affection there was however one individual who in the days of my childhood was disposed to form a favourable opinion of me one day a jewi have quite forgotten the circumstance but i was long subsequently informed of itone day a travelling jew knocked at the door of a farmhouse in which we had taken apartments i was near at hand sitting in the bright sunshine drawing strange lines on the dust with my fingers an ape and dog were my companions the jew looked at me and asked me some questions to which though i was quite able to speak i returned no answer on the door being opened the jew after a few words probably relating to pedlary demanded who the child was sitting in the sun the maid replied that i was her mistresss youngest son a child weak here pointing to her forehead the jew looked at me again and then said pon my conscience my dear i believe that you must be troubled there yourself to tell me any such thing it is not my habit to speak to children inasmuch as i hate them because they often follow me and fling stones after me but i no sooner looked at that child than i was forced to speak to ithis not answering me shows his sense for it has never been the custom of the wise to fling away their words in indifferent talk and conversation the child is a sweet child and has all the look of one of our peoples children fool indeed did i not see his eyes sparkle just now when the monkey seized the dog by the earthey shone like my own diamondsdoes your good lady want anyreal and fine were it not for what you tell me i should say it was a prophets child fool indeed he can write already or ill forfeit the box which i carry on my back and for which i should be loth to take two hundred pounds he then leaned forward to inspect the lines which i had traced all of a sudden he started back and grew white as a sheet then taking off his hat he made some strange gestures to me cringing chattering and showing his teeth and shortly departed muttering something about holy letters and talking to himself in a strange tongue the words of the jew were in due course of time reported to my mother who treasured them in her heart and from that moment began to entertain brighter hopes of her youngest born than she had ever before ventured to fosterchapter ii barracks and lodgingsa campthe vipera delicate childblackberry timemeum and tuumhythethe golgothadanemans skullsuperhuman staturestirring timesthe seaboard i have been a wanderer the greater part of my life indeed i remember only two periods and these by no means lengthy when i was strictly speaking stationary i was a soldiers son and as the means of my father were by no means sufficient to support two establishments his family invariably attended him wherever he went so that from my infancy i was accustomed to travelling and wandering and looked upon a monthly change of scene and residence as a matter of course sometimes we lived in barracks sometimes in lodgings but generally in the former always eschewing the latter from motives of economy save when the barracks were inconvenient and uncomfortable and they must have been highly so indeed to have discouraged us from entering them for though we were gentry pray bear that in mind gentle reader gentry by birth and incontestably so by my fathers bearing the commission of good old george the third we were not fine gentry but people who could put up with as much as any genteel scotch family who find it convenient to live on a third floor in london or on a sixth at edinburgh or glasgow it was not a little that could discourage us we once lived within the canvas walls of a camp at a place called pett in sussex and i believe it was at this place that occurred the first circumstance or adventure call it which you will that i can remember in connection with myself it was a strange one and i will relate it it happened that my brother and myself were playing one evening in a sandy lane in the neighbourhood of this pett camp our mother was at a slight distance all of a sudden a bright yellow and to my infantine eye beautiful and glorious object made its appearance at the top of the bank from between the thick quickset and gliding down began to move across the lane to the other side like a line of golden light uttering a cry of pleasure i sprang forward and seized it nearly by the middle a strange sensation of numbing coldness seemed to pervade my whole arm which surprised me the more as the object to the eye appeared so warm and sunlike i did not drop it however but holding it up looked at it intently as its head dangled about a foot from my hand it made no resistance i felt not even the slightest struggle but now my brother began to scream and shriek like one possessed o mother mother said he the vipermy brother has a viper in his hand he then like one frantic made an effort to snatch the creature away from me the viper now hissed amain and raised its head in which were eyes like hot coals menacing not myself but my brother i dropped my captive for i saw my mother running towards me and the reptile after standing for a moment nearly erect and still hissing furiously made off and disappeared the whole scene is now before me as vividly as if it occurred yesterday the gorgeous viper my poor dear frantic brother my agitated parent and a frightened hen clucking under the bushes and yet i was not three years old it is my firm belief that certain individuals possess an inherent power or fascination over certain creatures otherwise i should be unable to account for many feats which i have witnessed and indeed borne a share in connected with the taming of brutes and reptiles i have known a savage and vicious mare whose stall it was dangerous to approach even when bearing provender welcome nevertheless with every appearance of pleasure an uncouth wiryheaded man with a frightfully seamed face and an iron hook supplying the place of his right hand one whom the animal had never seen before playfully bite his hair and cover his face with gentle and endearing kisses and i have already stated how a viper would permit without resentment one child to take it up in his hand whilst it showed its dislike to the approach of another by the fiercest hissings philosophy can explain many strange things but there are some which are a far pitch above her and this is one i should scarcely relate another circumstance which occurred about this time but for a singular effect which it produced upon my constitution up to this period i had been rather a delicate child whereas almost immediately after the occurrence to which i allude i became both hale and vigorous to the great astonishment of my parents who naturally enough expected that it would produce quite a contrary effect it happened that my brother and myself were disporting ourselves in certain fields near the good town of canterbury a female servant had attended us in order to take care that we came to no mischief she however it seems had matters of her own to attend to and allowing us to go where we listed remained in one corner of a field in earnest conversation with a redcoated dragoon now it chanced to be blackberry time and the two children wandered under the hedges peering anxiously among them in quest of that trash so grateful to urchins of their degree we did not find much of it however and were soon separated in the pursuit all at once i stood still and could scarcely believe my eyes i had come to a spot where almost covering the hedge hung clusters of what seemed fruitdeliciouslytempting fruitsomething resembling grapes of various colours green red and purple dear me thought i how fortunate yet have i a right to gather it is it mine for the observance of the law of meum and tuum had early been impressed upon my mind and i entertained even at that tender age the utmost horror for theft so i stood staring at the variegated clusters in doubt as to what i should do i know not how i argued the matter in my mind the temptation however was at last too strong for me so i stretched forth my hand and ate i remember perfectly well that the taste of this strange fruit was by no means so pleasant as the appearance but the idea of eating fruit was sufficient for a child and after all the flavour was muchsuperior to that of sour apples so i ate voraciously how long i continued eating i scarcely know one thing is certain that i never left the field as i entered it being carried home in the arms of the dragoon in strong convulsions in which i continued for several hours about midnight i awoke as if from a troubled sleep and beheld my parents bending over my couch whilst the regimental surgeon with a candle in his hand stood nigh the light feebly reflected on the whitewashed walls of the barrackroom another circumstance connected with my infancy and i have done i need offer no apology for relating it as it subsequently exercised considerable influence over my pursuits we were if i remember right in the vicinity of a place called hythe in kent one sweet evening in the latter part of summer our mother took her two little boys by the hand for a wander about the fields in the course of our stroll we came to the village church an old greyheaded sexton stood in the porch who perceiving that we were strangers invited us to enter we were presently in the interior wandering about the aisles looking on the walls and inspecting the monuments of the notable dead i can scarcely state what we saw how should i i was a child not yet four years old and yet i think i remember the evening sun streaming in through a stained window upon the dingy mahogany pulpit and flinging a rich lustre upon the faded tints of an ancient banner and now once more we were outside the building where against the wall stood a loweaved penthouse into which we looked it was half filled with substances of some kind which at first looked like large grey stones the greater part were lying in layers some however were seen in confused and mouldering heaps and two or three which had perhaps rolled down from the rest lay separately on the floor skulls madam said the sexton skulls of the old danes long ago they came pirating into these parts and then there chanced a mighty shipwreck for god was angry with them and he sunk them and their skulls as they came ashore were placed here as a memorial there were many more when i was young but now they are fast disappearing some of them must have belonged to strange fellows madam only see that one why the two young gentry can scarcely lift it and indeed my brother and myself had entered the golgotha and commenced handling these grim relics of mortality one enormous skull lying in a corner had fixed our attention and we had drawn it forth spirit of eld what a skull was yon i still seem to see it the huge grim thing many of the others were large strikingly so and appeared fully to justify the old mans conclusion that their owners must have been strange fellows but compared with this mighty mass of bone they looked small and diminutive like those of pigmies it must have belonged to a giant one of those redhaired warriors of whose strength and stature such wondrous tales are told in the ancient chronicles of the north and whose gravehills when ransacked occasionally reveal secrets which fill the minds of puny moderns with astonishment and awe reader have you ever pored days and nights over the pages of snorroprobably not for he wrote in a language which few of the present day understand and few would be tempted to read him tamed down by latin dragomans a brave old book is that of snorro containing the histories and adventures of old northern kings and champions who seemed to have been quite different men if we may judge from the feats which they performed from those of these days one of the best of his histories is that which describes the life of harald haardraade who after manifold adventures by land and sea now a pirate now a mercenary of the greek emperor became king of norway and eventually perished at the battle of stamford bridge whilst engaged in a gallant onslaught upon england now i have often thought that the old kemp whose mouldering skull in the golgotha of hythe my brother and myself could scarcely lift must have resembled in one respect at least this harald whom snorro describes as a great and wise ruler and a determined leader dangerous in battle of fair presence and measuring in height just five ells neither more nor less i never forgot the danemans skull like the apparition of the viper in the sandy lane it dwelt in the mind of the boy affording copious food for the exercise of imagination from that moment with the name of dane were associated strange ideas of strength daring and superhuman stature and an undefinable curiosity for all that is connected with the danish race began to pervade me and if long after when i became a student i devoted myself with peculiar zest to danish lore and the acquirement of the old norse tongue and its dialects i can only explain the matter by the early impression received at hythe from the tale of the old sexton beneath the penthouse and the sight of the danish skull and thus we went on straying from place to place at hythe today and perhaps within a week looking out from our hostelwindow upon the streets of old winchester our motions ever in accordance with the route of the regiment so habituated to change of scene that it had become almost necessary to our existence pleasant were these days of my early boyhood and a melancholy pleasure steals over me as i recall them those were stirring times of which i am speaking and there was much passing around me calculated to captivate the imagination the dreadful struggle which so long convulsed europe and in which england bore so prominent a part was then at its hottest we were at war and determination and enthusiasm shone in every face man woman and child were eager to fight the frank the hereditary but thank god never dreaded enemy of the anglosaxon race love your country and beat the french and then never mind what happens was the cry of entire england oh those were days of power gallant days bustling days worth the bravest days of chivalry at least tall battalions of native warriors were marching through the land there was the glitter of the bayonet and the gleam of the sabre the shrill squeak of the fife and loud rattling of the drum were heard in the streets of country towns and the loyal shouts of the inhabitants greeted the soldiery on their arrival or cheered them at their departure and now let us leave the upland and descend to the seaboard there is a sight for you upon the billows a dozen menofwar are gliding majestically out of port their long buntings streaming from the topgallant masts calling on the skulking frenchman to come forth from his bights and bays and what looms upon us yonder from the fogbank inthe east a gallant frigate towing behind her the long low hull of a crippled privateer which but three short days ago had left dieppe to skim the sea and whose crew of ferocious hearts are now cursing their imprudence in an english hold stirring times those which i love to recall for they were days of gallantry and enthusiasm and were moreover the days of my boyhoodchapter iii pretty dthe venerable churchthe stricken heartdormant

when i was between six and seven years of age we were once more at d the place of my birth whither my father had been despatched on the recruiting service i have already said that it was a beautiful little townat least it was at the time of which i am speaking what it is at present i know not for thirty years and more have elapsed since i last trod its streets it will scarcely have improved for how could it be better than it then was i love to think on thee pretty quiet d thou pattern of an english country town with thy clean but narrow streets branching out from thy modest marketplace with

most pious bard yes pretty d i could always love thee were it but for the sake of him who sleeps beneath the marble slab in yonder quiet chancel it was within thee that the longoppressed bosom heaved its last sigh and the crushed and gentle spirit escaped from a world in which it had known nought but sorrow sorrow do i say how faint a word to express the misery of that bruised reed misery so dark that a blind worm like myself is occasionally tempted to exclaim better had the world never been created than that one so kind so harmless and so mild should have undergone such intolerable woe but it is over now for as there is an end of joy so has affliction its termination doubtless the allwise did not afflict him without a cause who knows but within that unhappy frame lurked vicious seeds which the sunbeams of joy and prosperity might have called into life and vigour perhaps the withering blasts of misery nipped that which otherwise might have terminated in fruit noxious and lamentable but

mouldering edifice with the low roof inclosing a spring of sanatory waters built and devoted to some saintif the legend over the door be true by the daughter of an east anglian king but to return to my own history i had now attained the age of six shall i state what intellectual progress i had been making up to this period alas upon this point i have little to say calculated to afford either pleasure or edification i had increased rapidly in size and in strength the growth of the mind however had by no means corresponded with that of the body it is true i had acquired my letters and was by this time able to read imperfectly but this was all and even this poor triumph over absolute ignorance would never have been effected but for the unremitting attention of my parents who sometimes by threats sometimes by entreaties endeavoured to rouse the dormant energies of my nature and to bend my wishes to the acquisition of the rudiments of knowledge but in influencing the wish lay the difficulty let but the will of a human being be turned to any particular object and it is ten to one that sooner or later he achieves it at this time i may safely say that i harboured neither wishes nor hopes i had as yet seen no object calculated to call them forth and yet i took pleasure in many things which perhaps unfortunately were all within my sphere of enjoyment i loved to look upon the heavens and to bask in the rays of the sun or to sit beneath hedgerows and listen to the chirping of the birds indulging the while in musing and meditation as far as my very limited circle of ideas would permit but unlike my brother who was at this time at school and whose rapid progress in every branch of instruction astonished and delighted his preceptors i took no pleasure in books whose use indeed i could scarcely comprehend and bade fair to be as arrant a dunce as ever brought the blush of shame into the cheeks of anxious and affectionate parents but the time was now at hand when the ice which had hitherto bound the mind of the child with its benumbing power was to be thawed and a world of sensations and ideas awakened to which it had hitherto been an entire stranger one day a young lady an intimate acquaintance of our family and godmother to my brother drove up to the house in which we dwelt she staid some time conversing with my mother and on rising to depart she put down on the table a small packet exclaiming i have brought a little present for each of the boys the one is a history of england which i intend for my godson when he returns from school the other is and here she said something which escaped my ear as i sat at some distance moping in a corneri intend it for the youngster yonder pointing to myself she then departed and my mother going out shortly after i was left alone i remember for some time sitting motionless in my corner with my eyes bent upon the ground at last i lifted my head and looked upon the packet as it lay on the table all at once a strange sensation came over me such as i had never experienced beforea singular blending of curiosity awe and pleasure the remembrance of which even at this distance of time produces a remarkable effect upon my nervous system what strange things are the nervesi mean those more secret and mysterious ones in which i have some notion that the mind or soul call it which you will has itshabitation how they occasionally tingle and vibrate before any coming event closely connected with the future weal or woe of the human being such a feeling was now within me certainly independent of what the eye had seen or the ear had heard a book of some description had been brought for me a present by no means calculated to interest me what cared i for books i had already many into which i never looked but from compulsion friends moreover had presented me with similar things before which i had entirely disregarded and what was there in this particular book whose very title i did not know calculated to attract me more than the rest yet something within told me that my fate was connected with the book which had been last brought so after looking on the packet from my corner for a considerable time i got up and went to the table the packet was lying where it had been lefti took it up had the envelope which consisted of whitish brown paper been secured by a string or a seal i should not have opened it as i should have considered such an act almost in the light of a crime the books however had been merely folded up and i therefore considered that there could be no possible harm in inspecting them more especially as i had received no injunction to the contrary perhaps there was something unsound in this reasoning something sophistical but a child is sometimes as ready as a grownup person in finding excuses for doing that which he is inclined to but whether the action was right or wrong and i am afraid it was not altogether right i undid the packet it contained three books two from their similarity seemed to be separate parts of one and the same work they were handsomely bound and to them i first turned my attention i opened them successively and endeavoured to make out their meaning their contents however as far as i was able to understand them were by no means interesting whoever pleases may read these books for me and keep them too into the bargain said i to myself i now took up the third book it did not resemble the others being longer and considerably thicker the binding was of dingy calfskin i opened it and as i did so another strange thrill of pleasure shot through my frame the first object on which my eyes rested was a picture it was exceedingly well executed at least the scene which it represented made a vivid impression upon me which would hardly have been the case had the artist not been faithful to nature a wild scene it wasa heavy sea and rocky shore with mountains in the background above which the moon was peering not far from the shore upon the water was a boat with two figures in it one of which stood at the bow pointing with what i knew to be a gun at a dreadful shape in the water fire was flashing from the muzzle of the gun and the monster appeared to be transfixed i almost thought i heard its cry i remained motionless gazing upon the picture scarcely daring to draw my breath lest the new and wondrous world should vanish of which i had now obtained a glimpse who are those people and what could have brought them into that strange situation i asked of myself and now the seed of curiosity which had so long lain dormant began to expand and i vowed to myself to become speedily acquainted with the whole history of the people in the boat after looking on the picture till every mark and line in it were familiar to me i turned over various leaves till i came to another engraving a new source of wondera low sandy beach on which the furious sea was breaking in mountainlike billows cloud and rack deformed the firmament which wore a dull and leadenlike hue gulls and other aquatic fowls were toppling upon the blast or skimming over the tops of the maddening wavesmercy upon him he must be drowned i exclaimed as my eyes fell upon a poor wretch who appeared to be striving to reach the shore he was upon his legs but was evidently half smothered with the brine high above his head curled a horrible billow as if to engulf him for ever he must be drowned he must be drowned i almost shrieked and dropped the book i soon snatched it up again and now my eye lighted on a third picture again a shore but what a sweet and lovely one and how i wished to be treading it there were beautiful shells lying on the smooth white sandsome were empty like those i had occasionally seen on marble mantelpieces but out of others peered the heads and bodies of wondrous crayfish a wood of thick green trees skirted the beach and partly shaded it from the rays of the sun which shone hot above while blue waves slightly crested with foam were gently curling against it there was a human figure upon the beach wild and uncouth clad in the skins of animals with a huge cap on his head a hatchet at his girdle and in his hand a gun his feet and legs were bare he stood in an attitude of horror and surprise his body was bent far back and his eyes which seemed starting out of his head were fixed upon a mark on the sanda large distinct marka human footprint reader is it necessary to name the book which now stood open in my hand and whose very prints feeble expounders of its wondrous lines had produced within me emotions strange and novel scarcelyfor it was a book which has exerted over the minds of englishmen an influence certainly greater than any other of modern timeswhich has been in most peoples hands and with the contents of which even those who cannot read are to a certain extent acquainteda book from which the most luxuriant and fertile of our modern prose writers have drunk inspirationa book moreover to which from the hardy deeds which it narrates and the spirit of strange and romantic enterprise which it tends to awaken england owes many of her astonishing discoveries both by sea and land and no inconsiderable part of her naval glory hail to thee spirit of de foe what does not my own poor self owe to thee england has better bards than either greece or rome yet i could spare them easier far than de foe unabashed de foe as the hunchbacked rhymer styled him the true chord had now been touched a raging curiosity with respect to the contents of the volume whose engravings had fascinated my eye burned within me and i never rested until i had fully satisfied it weeks succeeded weeks months followed months and the wondrous volume was my only study and principal source of amusement for hours together iwould sit poring over a page till i had become acquainted with the import of every line my progress slow enough at first became by degrees more rapid till at last under a shoulder of mutton sail i found myself cantering before a steady breeze over an ocean of enchantment so well pleased with my voyage that i cared not how long it might be ere it reached its termination and it was in this manner that i first took to the paths of knowledge about this time i began to be somewhat impressed with religious feelings my parents were to a certain extent religious people but though they had done their best to afford me instruction on religious points i had either paid no attention to what they endeavoured to communicate or had listened with an ear far too obtuse to derive any benefit but my mind had now become awakened from the drowsy torpor in which it had lain so long and the reasoning powers which i possessed were no longer inactive hitherto i had entertained no conception whatever of the nature and properties of god and with the most perfect indifference had heard the divine name proceeding from the mouths of people frequently alas on occasions when it ought not to be employed but i now never heard it without a tremor for i now knew that god was an awful and inscrutable being the maker of all things that we were his children and that we by our sins had justly offended him that we were in very great peril from his anger not so much in this life as in another and far stranger state of being yet to come that we had a saviour withal to whom it was necessary to look for help upon this point however i was yet very much in the dark as indeed were most of those with whom i was connected the power and terrors of god were uppermost in my thoughts they fascinated though they astounded me twice every sunday i was regularly taken to the church where from a corner of the large spacious pew lined with black leather i would fix my eyes on the dignified highchurch rector a and the dignified highchurch clerk b and watch the movement of their lips from which as they read their respective portions of the venerable liturgy would roll many a portentous word descriptive of the wondrous works of the most high rector thou didst divide the sea through thy power thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters philoh thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat for the people in the wilderness rector thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks thou driedst up mighty waters philoh the day is thine and the night is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun peace to your memories dignified rector and yet more dignified clerkby this time ye are probably gone to your long homes and your voices are no longer heard sounding down the aisles of the venerable churchnay doubtless this has already long since been the fate of him of the sonorous amenthe one of the two who with all due respect to the rector principally engrossed my boyish admirationhe at least is scarcely now among the living living why i have heard say that he blew a fifefor he was a musical as well as a christian professora bold fife to cheer the guards and the brave marines as they marched with measured step obeying an insane command up bunkers height whilst the rifles of the sturdy yankees were sending the leaden hail sharp and thick amidst the redcoated ranks for philoh had not always been a man of peace nor an exhorter to turn the other cheek to the smiter but had even arrived at the dignity of a halberd in his countrys service before his sixfoot form required rest and the greyhaired veteran retired after a long peregrination to his native town to enjoy ease and respectability on a pension of eighteenpence a day and well did his fellowtownsmen act when to increase that ease and respectability and with a thoughtful regard for the dignity of the good church service they made him clerk and precentorthe man of the tall form and of the audible voice which sounded loud and clear as his own bunker fife well peace to thee thou fine old chap despiser of dissenters and hater of papists as became a dignified and highchurch clerk if thou art in thy grave the better for thee thou wert fitted to adorn a bygone time when loyalty was in vogue and smiling content lay like a sunbeam upon the land but thou wouldst be sadly out of place in these days of cold philosophic latitudinarian doctrine universal tolerism and halfconcealed rebellionrare times no doubt for papists and dissenters but which would assuredly have broken the heart of the loyal soldier of george the third and the dignified highchurch clerk of pretty d we passed many months at this place nothing however occurred requiring any particular notice relating to myself beyond what i have already stated and i am not writing the history of others at length my father was recalled to his regiment which at that time was stationed at a place called norman cross in lincolnshire or rather huntingdonshire at some distance from the old town of peterborough for this place he departed leaving my mother and myself to follow in a few days our journey was a singular one on the second day we reached a marshy and fenny country which owing to immense quantities of rain which had lately fallen was completely submerged at a large town we got on board a kind of passageboat crowded with people it had neither sails nor oars and those were not the days of steamvessels it was a treckschuyt and was drawn by horses young as i was there was much connected with this journey which highly surprised me and which brought to my remembrance particular scenes described in the book which i now generally carried in my bosom the country was as i have already said submergedentirely drownedno land was visible the trees were growing bolt upright in the flood whilst farmhouses and cottages were standing insulated the horses which drew us were up to the knees in water andon coming to blind pools and greedy depths were not unfrequently swimming in which case the boys or urchins who mounted them sometimes stood sometimes knelt upon the saddle and pillions no accident however occurred either to the quadrupeds or bipeds who appeared respectively to be quite au fait in their business and extricated themselves with the greatest ease from places in which pharaoh and all his hosts would have gone to the bottom nightfall brought us to peterborough and from thence we were not slow in reaching the place of our destinationchapter iv norman crosswide expansevive

strange place it was this norman cross and at the time of which i am speaking a sad cross to many a norman being what was then styled a french prison that is a receptacle for captives made in the french war it consisted if i remember right of some five or six casernes very long and immensely high each standing isolated from the rest upon a spot of ground which might average ten acres and which was fenced round with lofty palisades the whole being compassed about by a towering wall beneath which at intervals on both sides sentinels were stationed whilst outside upon the field stood commodious wooden barracks capable of containing two regiments of infantry intended to serve as guards upon the captives such was the station or prison at norman cross where some six thousand french and other foreigners followers of the grand corsican were now immured what a strange appearance had those mighty casernes with their blank blind walls without windows or grating and their slanting roofs out of which through orifices where the tiles had been removed would be protruded dozens of grim heads feasting their prisonsick eyes on the wide expanse of country unfolded from that airy height ah there was much misery in those casernes and from those roofs doubtless many a wistful look was turned in the direction of lovely france much had the poor inmates to endure and much to

unworthy entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy when helpless and a captive and such alas was the fare in those casernes and then those visits or rather ruthless inroads called in the slang of the place strawplaithunts when in pursuit of a contraband article which the prisoners in order to procure themselves a few of the necessaries and comforts of existence were in the habit of making redcoated battalions were marched into the prisons who with the bayonets point carried havoc and ruin into every poor convenience which ingenious wretchedness had been endeavouring to raise around it and then the triumphant exit with the miserable booty and worst of all the accursed bonfire on the barrack parade of the plait contraband beneath the view of the glaring eyeballs from those lofty roofs amidst the hurrahs of the troops frequently drowned in the curses poured down from above like a tempestshower or in the terrific warwhoop of vive lempereur it was midsummer when we arrived at this place and the weather which had for a long time been wet and gloomy now became bright and glorious i was subjected to but little control and passed my time pleasantly enough principally in wandering about the neighbouring country it was flat and somewhat fenny a district more of pasture than agriculture and not very thickly inhabited i soon became well acquainted with it at the distance of two miles from the station was a large lake styled in the dialect of the country a mere about whose borders tall reeds were growing in abundance this was a frequent haunt of mine but my favourite place of resort was a wild sequestered spot at a somewhat greater distance here surrounded with woods and thick groves was the seat of some ancient family deserted by the proprietor and only inhabited by a rustic servant or two a place more solitary and wild could scarcely be imagined the garden and walks were overgrown with weeds and briars and the unpruned woods were so tangled as to be almost impervious about this domain i would wander till overtaken by fatigue and then i would sit down with my back against some beech elm or stately alder tree and taking out my book would pass hours in a state of unmixed enjoyment my eyes now fixed on the wondrous pages now glancing at the sylvan scene around and sometimes i would drop the book and listen to the voice of the rooks and wild pigeons and not unfrequently to the croaking of multitudes of frogs from the neighbouring swamps and fens in going to and from this place i frequently passed a tall elderly individual dressed in rather a quaint fashion with a skin cap on his head and stout gaiters on his legs on his shoulders hung a moderate sized leathern sack he seemed fond of loitering near sunny banks and of groping amidst furze and low scrubby bramble bushes of which there were plenty in the neighbourhood of norman cross once i saw him standing in the middle of a dusty road looking intently at a large mark which seemed to have been drawn across it as if by a walkingstick he must have been a large one the old man muttered half to himself or he would not have left such a trail i wonder if he is near he seems to have moved this way he then went behind some bushes which grew on the right side of the road and appeared to be in quest of something moving behind the bushes with his head downwards and occasionally striking their roots with his foot at length he exclaimed here he is and forthwith i saw him dart amongst the bushes there was a kind of scuffling noise the rustling of branches and the crackling of dry sticks i have him said the man at last i have got him and presently he made his appearance about twenty yards down the road holding a large viper in his hand what do you think of that my boy said he as i went up to himwhat do you think of catching such a thing as that with the naked hand what do i think said i why that i could do as much myself you do said the man do you lord how the young people in these days are given to conceit it did not use to be so in my time when i was a child childer knew how to behave themselves but the childer of these days are full of conceit full of froth like the mouth of this viper and with his forefinger and thumb he squeezed a considerable quantity of foam from the jaws of the viper down upon the road thechilder of these days are a generation ofgod forgive me what was i about to say said the old man and opening his bag he thrust the reptile into it which appeared far from empty i passed on as i was returning towards the evening i overtook the old man who was wending in the same direction good evening to you sir said i taking off a cap which i wore on my head good evening said the old man and then looking at me hows this said he you arnt sure the child i met in the morning yes said i i am what makes you doubt it why you were then all froth and conceit said the old man and now you take off your cap to me i beg your pardon said i if i was frothy and conceited it ill becomes a child like me to be so thats true dear said the old man well as you have begged my pardon i truly forgive you thank you said i have you caught any more of those things only four or five said the old man they are getting scarce though this used to be a great neighbourhood for them and what do you do with them said i do you carry them home and play with them i sometimes play with one or two that i tame said the old man but i hunt them mostly for the fat which they contain out of which i make unguents which are good for various sore troubles especially for the rheumatism and do you get your living by hunting these creatures i demanded not altogether said the old man besides being a viperhunter i am what they call a herbalist one who knows the virtue of particular herbs i gather them at the proper season to make medicines with for the sick and do you live in the neighbourhood i demanded you seem very fond of asking questions child no i do not live in this neighbourhood in particular i travel about i have not been in this neighbourhood till lately for some years from this time the old man and myself formed an acquaintance i often accompanied him in his wanderings about the neighbourhood and on two or three occasions assisted him in catching the reptiles which he hunted he generally carried a viper with him which he had made quite tame and from which he had extracted the poisonous fangs it would dance and perform various kinds of tricks he was fond of telling me anecdotes connected with his adventures with the reptile species but said he one day sighing i must shortly give up this business i am no longer the man i was i am become timid and when a person is timid in viperhunting he had better leave off as it is quite clear his virtue is leaving him i got a fright some years ago which i am quite sure i shall never get the better of my hand has been shaky more or less ever since what frightened you said i i had better not tell you said the old man or you may be frightened too lose your virtue and be no longer good for the business i dont care said i i dont intend to follow the business i daresay i shall be an officer like my father well said the old man i once saw the king of the vipers and since then the king of the vipers said i interrupting him have the vipers a king as sure as we have said the old man as sure as we have king george to rule over us have these reptiles a king to rule over them and where did you see him said i i will tell you said the old man though i dont like talking about the matter it may be about seven years ago that i happened to be far down yonder to the west on the other side of england nearly two hundred miles from here following my business it was a very sultry day i remember and i had been out several hours catching creatures it might be about three oclock in the afternoon when i found myself on some heathy land near the sea on the ridge of a hill the side of which nearly as far down as the sea was heath but on the top there was arable ground which had been planted and from which the harvest had been gatheredoats or barley i know not whichbut i remember that the ground was covered with stubble well about three oclock as i told you before what with the heat of the day and from having walked about for hours in a lazy way i felt very tired so i determined to have a sleep and i laid myself down my head just on the ridge of the hill towards the field and my body over the side down amongst the heath my bag which was nearly filled with creatures lay at a little distance from my face the creatures were struggling in it i remember and i thought to myself how much more comfortably off i was than they i was taking my ease on the nice open hill cooled with the breezes whilst they were in the nasty close bag coiling about one another and breaking their very hearts all to no purpose and i felt quite comfortable and happy in the thought and little by little closed my eyes and fell into the sweetest snooze that ever i was in in all my life and there i lay over the hills side with my head half in the field i dont know how long all dead asleep at last it seemed to me that i heard a noise in my sleep something like a thing moving very faint however far away then it died and then it came again upon my ear as i slept and now it appeared almost as if i heard crackle crackle then it died again or i became yet more dead asleep than before i know not which but i certainly lay some time without hearing it all of a sudden i became awake and there was i on the ridge of the hill with my cheek on the ground towards the stubble with a noise in my ear like that of something moving towards me amongst the stubble of the field well i lay a moment or two listening to the noise and then i became frightened for i did not like the noise at all it sounded so odd so i rolled myself on my belly and looked towards the stubble mercy upon us there was a huge snake or rather a dreadful viper for it was all yellow and gold moving towards me bearing its head about a foot and a half above the ground the dry stubble crackling beneath its outrageous belly it might be about five yards off when i first saw it making straight towards me child as if it would devour me i lay quite still for i was stupefied with horror whilst the creature came still nearer and now it was nearly upon me when it suddenly drew back a little and thenwhat do you thinkit lifted its head and chest high in the air and high over my face as i looked up flickering at me with its tongue as if it would fly at my face child what i felt at that moment i can scarcely say but it was a sufficient punishment for all the sins i ever committed and there we two were i looking up at the viper and the viper looking down upon me flickering at me with its tongue it was only the kindness of god that saved me all at once there was a loud noise the report of a gun for a fowler was shooting at a covey of birds a little way off in the stubble whereupon the viper sunk its head and immediately made off over the ridge of the hill down in the direction of the sea as it passed by me howeverand it passed close by meit hesitated a moment as if it was doubtful whether it should not seize me it did not however but made off down the hill it has often struck me that he was angry with me and came upon me unawares for presuming to meddle with his people as i have always been in the habit of doingbut said i how do you know that it was the king of the vipers how do i know said the old man who else should it be there was as much difference between it and other reptiles as between king george and other people is king george then different from other people i demanded of course said the old man i have never seen him myself but i have heard people say that he is a ten times greater man than other folks indeed it stands to reason that he must be different from the rest else people would not be so eager to see him do you think child that people would be fools enough to run a matter of twenty or thirty miles to see the king provided king george havent the french a king i demanded yes said the old man or something much the same and a queer one he is not quite so big as king george they say but quite as terrible a fellow what of him suppose he should come to norman cross what should he do at norman cross child why you were talking about the vipers in your bag breaking their hearts and so on and their king coming to help them now suppose the french king should hear of his people being in trouble at norman cross and he cant come child said the old man rubbing his hands the water lies between the french dont like the water neither vipers nor frenchmen take kindly to the water child when the old man left the country which he did a few days after the conversation which i have just related he left me the reptile which he had tamed and rendered quite harmless by removing the fangs i was in the habit of feeding it with milk and frequently carried it abroad with me in my walkschapter v the tentman and womandark and swarthymanner of speakingbad moneytransfixedfaltering tone little baskethigh opinionplenty of goodkeeping guardtilted cartrubricalsjasperthe right sortthe horseman of the lanejohn newtonthe alarmgentle brothers one day it happened that being on my rambles i entered a green lane which i had never seen before at first it was rather narrow but as i advanced it became considerably wider in the middle was a driftway with deep ruts but right and left was a space carpeted with a sward of trefoil and clover there was no lack of trees chiefly ancient oaks which flinging out their arms from either side nearly formed a canopy and afforded a pleasing shelter from the rays of the sun which was burning fiercely above suddenly a group of objects attracted my attention beneath one of the largest of the trees upon the grass was a kind of low tent or booth from the top of which a thin smoke was curling beside it stood a couple of light carts whilst two or three lean horses or ponies were cropping the herbage which was growing nigh wondering to whom this odd tent could belong i advanced till i was close before it when i found that it consisted of two tilts like those of waggons placed upon the ground and fronting each other connected behind by a sail or large piece of canvas which was but partially drawn across the top upon the ground in the intervening space was a fire over which supported by a kind of iron crowbar hung a caldron my advance had been so noiseless as not to alarm the inmates who consisted of a man and woman who sat apart one on each side of the fire they were both busily employedthe man was carding plaited straw whilst the woman seemed to be rubbing something with a white powder some of which lay on a plate beside her suddenly the man looked up and perceiving me uttered a strange kind of cry and the next moment both the woman and himself were on their feet and rushing out upon me i retreated a few steps yet without turning to flee i was not however without apprehension which indeed the appearance of these two people was well calculated to inspire the woman was a stout figure seemingly between thirty and forty she wore no cap and her long hair fell on either side of her head like horsetails half way down her waist her skin was dark and swarthy like that of a toad and the expression of her countenance was particularly evil her arms were bare and her bosom was but half concealed by a slight bodice below which she wore a coarse petticoat her only other article of dress the man was somewhat younger but of a figure equally wild his frame was long and lathy but his arms were remarkably short his neck was rather bent he squinted slightly and his mouth was much awry his complexion was dark but unlike that of the woman was more ruddy than livid there was a deep scar on his cheek something like the impression of a halfpenny the dress was quite in keeping with the figure in his hat which was slightly peaked was stuck a peacocks feather over a waistcoat of hide untanned and with the hair upon it he wore a rough jerkin of russet hue smallclothes of leather which had probably once belonged to a soldier but with which pipeclay did not seem to have come in contact for many a year protected his lower man as far as the knee his legs were cased in long stockings of blue worsted and on his shoes he wore immense oldfashioned buckles such were the two beings who now came rushing upon me the man was rather in advance brandishing a ladle in his hand so i have caught you at last said he ill teach ye you young highwayman to come skulking about my properties young as i was i remarked that his manner of speaking was different from that of any people with whom i had been in the habit of associating it was quite as strange as his appearance and yet it nothing resembled the foreign english which i had been in the habit of hearing through the palisades of the prison he could scarcely be a foreigner your properties said i i am in the kings lane why did you put them there if you did not wish them to be seen on the spy said the woman hey ill drown him in the sludge in the toadpond over the hedge so we will said the man drown him anon in the mud drown me will you said i i should like to see you whats all this about was it because i saw you with your hands full of straw plait and my mother there yes said the woman what was i about myself how should i know making bad money perhaps and it will be as well here to observe that at this time there was much bad money in circulation in the neighbourhood generally supposed to be fabricated by the prisoners so that this false coin and straw plait formed the standard subjects of conversation at norman cross ill strangle thee said the beldame dashing at me bad money is itleave him to me wifelkin said the man interposing you shall now see how ill baste him down the lane myself i tell you what my chap you had better put down that thing of yours my father lies concealed within my tepid breast and if to me you offer any harm or wrong ill call him forth to help me with his forked tongue man what do you mean ye benguis bantling i never heard such discourse in all my life play mans speech or frenchmans talkwhich i wonder your father tell the mumping villain that if he comes near my fire ill serve him out as i will you take that tiny jesus what have we got here oh delicate jesus what is the matter with the child i had made a motion which the viper understood and now partly disengaging itself from my bosom where it had lain perdu it raised its head to a level with my face and stared upon my enemy with its glittering eyes the man stood like one transfixed and the ladle with which he had aimed a blow at me now hung in the air like the hand which held it his mouth was extended and his cheeks became of a pale yellow save alone that place which bore the mark which i have already described and this shone now portentously like fire he stood in this manner for some time at last the ladle fell from his hand and its falling appeared to rouse him from his stupor i say wifelkin said he in a faltering tone did you ever see the like of this here but the woman had retreated to the tent from the entrance of which her loathly face was now thrust with an expression partly of terror and partly of curiosity after gazing some time longer at the viper and myself the man stooped down and took up the ladle then as if somewhat more assured he moved to the tent where he entered into conversation with the beldame in a low voice of their discourse though i could hear the greater part of it i understood not a single word and i wondered what it could be for i knew by the sound that it was not french at last the man in a somewhat louder tone appeared to put a question to the woman who nodded her head affirmatively and in a moment or two produced a small stool which she delivered to him he placed it on the ground close by the door of the tent first rubbing it with his sleeve as if for the purpose of polishing its surface man now my precious little gentleman do sit down here by the poor peoples tent we wish to be civil in our slight way dont be angry and say no but look kindly upon us and satisfied my precious little god almighty woman yes my gorgeous angel sit down by the poor bodies fire and eat a sweetmeat we want to ask you a question or two only first put that serpent away myself i can sit down and bid the serpent go to sleep thats easy enough but as for eating a sweetmeat how can i do that i have not got one and where am i to get it woman never fear my tiny tawny we can give you one such as you never ate i daresay however far you may have come from the serpent sunk into its usual restingplace and i sat down on the stool the woman opened a box and took out a strange little basket or hamper not much larger than a mans fist and formed of a delicate kind of matting it was sewed at the top but ripping it open with a knife she held it to me and i saw to my surprise that it contained candied fruits of a dark green hue tempting enough to one of my age there my tiny said she taste and tell me how you like them very much said i where did you get them the beldame leered upon me for a moment then nodding her head thrice with a knowing look said who knows better than yourself my tawny now i knew nothing about the matter but i saw that these strange people had conceived a very high opinion of the abilities of their visitor which i was nothing loath to encourage i therefore answered boldly ah who indeed certainly said the man who should know better than yourself or so well and now my tiny one let me ask you one thingyou didnt come to do us any harm no said i i had no dislike to you though if you were to meddle with me man of course my gorgeous of course you would and quite right too meddle with youwhat right have we i should say it would not be quite safe i see how it is you are one of them thereand he bent his head towards his left shoulder myself yes i am one of themfor i thought he was alluding to the soldiersyou had best mind what you are about i can tell youman dont doubt we will for our own sake lord bless you wifelkin only think that we should see one of them there when we least thought about it well i have heard of such things though i never thought to see one however seeing is believing well now you are come and are not going to do us any mischief i hope you will stay you can do us plenty of good if you will myself what good could i do you man what good plenty would you not bring us luck i have heard say that one of them there always does if it will but settle down stay with us you shall have a tilted cart all to yourself if you like well make you our little god almighty and say our prayers to you every morning myself that would be nice and if you were to give me plenty of these things i should have no objection but what would my father say i think he would hardly let me man why not he would be with you and kindly would we treat him indeed without your father you would be nothing at all myself thats true but i do not think he could be spared from his regiment i have heard him say that they could do nothing without him man his regiment what are you talking aboutwhat does the child mean myself what do i meanwhy that my father is an officerman at the barracks yonder keeping guard over the french prisoners man oh then that sap is not your father myself what the snake why no did you think he was man to be sure we did didnt you tell me so myself why yes but who would have thought you would have believed it it is a tame one i hunt vipers and tame them man oh oh grunted the woman thats it is it the man and woman who during this conversation had resumed their former positions within the tent looked at each other with a queer look of surprise as if somewhat disconcerted at what they now heard they then entered into discourse with each other in the same strange tongue which had already puzzled me at length the man looked me in the face and said somewhat hesitatingly so you are not one of them there after all myself one of them there i dont know what you mean man why we have been thinking you were a goblina devilkin however i see how it is you are a sapengro a chap who catches snakes and plays tricks with them well it comes very nearly to the same thing and if you please to list with us and bear us pleasant company we shall be glad of you id take my oath upon it that we might make a mort of money by you and that sap and the tricks it could do and as you seem fly to everything i shouldnt wonder if you would make a prime hand at telling fortunes i shouldnt wonder said i man of course and you might still be our god almighty or at any rate our clergyman so you should live in a tilted cart by yourself and say prayers to us night and morningto wifelkin here and all our family theres plenty of us when we are all together as i said before you seem fly i shouldnt wonder if you could read oh yes said i i can read and eager to display my accomplishments i took my book out of my pocket and opening it at random proceeded to read how a certain man whilst wandering about a certain solitary island entered a cave the mouth of which was overgrown with brushwood and how he was nearly frightened to death in that cave by something which he saw that will do said the man thats the kind of prayers for me and my family arnt they wifelkin i never heard more delicate prayers in all my life why they beat the rubricals hollowand here comes my son jasper i say jasper heres a young sapengro that can read and is more fly than yourself shake hands with him i wish ye to be two brotherswith a swift but stealthy pace jasper came towards us from the farther part of the lane on reaching the tent he stood still and looked fixedly upon me as i sat upon the stool i looked fixedly upon him a queer look had jasper he was a lad of some twelve or thirteen years with long arms unlike the singular being who called himself his father his complexion was ruddy but his face was seamed though it did not bear the peculiar scar which disfigured the countenance of the other nor though roguish enough a certain evil expression which that of the other bore and which the face of the woman possessed in a yet more remarkable degree for the rest he wore drab breeches with certain strings at the knee a rather gay waistcoat and tolerably white shirt under his arm he bore a mighty whip of whalebone with a brass knob and upon his head was a hat without either top or brim there jasper shake hands with the sapengro can he box father said jasper surveying me rather contemptuously i should think not he looks so puny and small hold your peace fool said the man he can do more than thati tell you hes fly he carries a sap about which would sting a ninny like you to dead what a sapengro said the boy with a singular whine and stooping down he leered curiously in my face kindly however and then patted me on the head a sapengro he ejaculated lor yes and one of the right sort said the man i am glad we have met with him he is going to list with us and be our clergyman and god almighty arnt you my tawny i dont know said i i must see what my father will say your father bah but here he stopped for a sound was heard like the rapid galloping of a horse not loud and distinct as on a road but dull and heavy as if upon a grass sward nearer and nearer it came and the man starting up rushed out of the tent and looked around anxiously i arose from the stool upon which i had been seated and just at that moment amidst a crashing of boughs and sticks a man on horseback bounded over the hedge into the lane at a few yards distance from where we were from the impetus of the leap the horse was nearly down on his knees the rider however by dint of vigorous handling of the reins prevented him from falling and then rode up to the tent tis nat said the man what brings him here the new comer was a stout burly fellow about the middle age he had a savage determined look and his face was nearly covered over with carbuncles he wore a broad slouching hat and was dressed in a grey coat cut in a fashion which i afterwards learnt to be the genuine newmarket cut the skirts being exceedingly short his waistcoat was of red plush and he wore broad corduroy breeches and white topboots the steed which carried him was of iron grey spirited and powerful but covered with sweat and foam the fellow glanced fiercely and suspiciously around and said something to the man of the tent in a harsh and rapid voice a short and hurried conversation ensued in the strange tongue i could not take my eyes off this new comer oh that halfjockey halfbruiser countenance i never forgot it more than fifteen years afterwards i found myself amidst a crowd before newgate a gallows was erected and beneath it stood a criminal a notorious malefactor i recognised him at once the horseman of the lane is now beneath the fatal tree but nothing altered still the same man jerking his head to the right and left with the same fierce and under glance just as if the affairs of this world had the same kind of interest to the last grey coat of newmarket cut plush waistcoat corduroys and boots nothing altered but the head alas is bare and so is the neck oh crime and virtue virtue and crimeit was old john newton i think who when he saw a man going to be hanged said there goes john newton but for the grace of god but the lane the lane all was now in confusion in the lane the man and woman were employed in striking the tents and in making hurried preparations for departure the boy jasper was putting the harness upon the ponies and attaching them to the carts and to increase the singularity of the scene two or three wildlooking women and girls in red cloaks and immense black beaver bonnets came from i know not what direction and after exchanging a few words with the others commenced with fierce and agitated gestures to assist them in their occupation the rider meanwhile sat upon his horse but evidently in a state of great impatience he muttered curses between his teeth spurred the animal furiously and then reined it in causing it to rear itself up nearly perpendicular at last he said curse ye for romans how slow ye are well it is no business of mine stay here all day if you like i have given ye warning i am off to the big north road however before i go you had better give me all you have of that truly spoken nat my pal said the man give it him mother there it is now be off as soon as you please and rid us of evil company the woman had handed him two bags formed of stocking half full of something heavy which looked through them for all the world like money of some kind the fellow on receiving them thrust them without ceremony into the pockets of his coat and then without a word of farewell salutation departed at a tremendous rate the hoofs of his horse thundering for a long time on the hard soil of the neighbouring road till the sound finally died away in the distance the strange people were not slow in completing their preparations and then flogging their animals terrifically hurried away seemingly in the same directionthe boy jasper was last of the band as he was following the rest he stopped suddenly and looked on the ground appearing to muse then turning round he came up to me where i was standing leered in my face and then thrusting out his hand he said good bye sap i daresay we shall meet again remember we are brothers two gentle brothers then whining forth what a sapengro lor he gave me a parting leer and hastened away i remained standing in the lane gazing after the retreating company a strange set of people said i at last i wonder who they can bechapter vi three yearslillys grammarproficiencyignorant of figuresthe school bellorder of successionpersecution what are we to donorthwarda goodly scenehaunted groundfeats of chivalryriversover the brig years passed on even three years during this period i had increased considerably in stature and in strength and let us hope improved in mind for i had entered on the study of the latin language the very first person to whose care i was entrusted for the acquisition of latin was an old friend of my fathers a clergyman who kept a seminary at a town the very next we visited after our departure from the cross under his instruction however i continued only a few weeks as we speedily left the place captain said this divine when my father came to take leave of him on the eve of our departure i have a friendship for you and therefore wish to give you a piece of advice concerning this son of yours you are now removing him from my care you do wrong but we will let that pass listen to me there is but one good school book in the worldthe one i use in my seminarylillys latin grammar in which your son has already made some progress if you are anxious for the success of your son in life for the correctness of his conduct and the soundness of his principles keep him to lillys grammar if you can by any means either fair or foul induce him to get by heart lillys latin grammar you may set your heart at rest with respect to him i myself will be his warrant i never yet knew a boy that was induced either by fair means or foul to learn lillys latin grammar by heart who did not turn out a man provided he lived long enough my father who did not understand the classical languages received with respect the advice of his old friend and from that moment conceived the highest opinion of lillys latin grammar during three years i studied lillys latin grammar under the tuition of various schoolmasters for i travelled with the regiment and in every town in which we were stationary i was invariably god bless my father sent to the classical academy of the place it chanced by good fortune that in the generality of these schools the grammar of lilly was in use when however that was not the case it made no difference in my educational course my father always stipulating with the masters that i should be daily examined in lilly at the end of the three years i had the whole by heart you had only to repeat the first two or three words of any sentence in any part of the book and forthwith i would open cry commencing without blundering and hesitation and continue till you were glad to beg me to leave off with many expressions of admiration at my proficiency in the latin language sometimes however to convince you how well i merited these encomiums i would follow you to the bottom of the stair and even into the street repeating in a kind of singsong measure the sonorous lines of the golden schoolmaster if i am here asked whether i understood anything of what i had got by heart i replynever mind i understand it all now and believe that no one ever yet got lillys latin grammar by heart when young who repented of the feat at a mature age and when my father saw that i had accomplished my task he opened his mouth and said truly this is more than i expected i did not think that there had been so much in you either of application or capacity you have now learnt all that is necessary if my friend dr bs opinion was sterling as i have no doubt it was you are still a child however and must yet go to school in order that you may be kept out of evil company perhaps you may still contrive now you have exhausted the barn to pick up a grain or two in the barnyard you are still ignorant of figures i believe not that i would mention figures in the same day with lillys grammar these words were uttered in a place called in the north or in the road to the north to which for some time past our corps had been slowly advancing i was sent to the school of the place which chanced to be a day school it was a somewhat extraordinary one and a somewhat extraordinary event occurred to me within its walls it occupied part of the farther end of a small plain or square at the outskirts of the town close to some extensive bleaching fields it was a long low building of one room with no upper storey on the top was a kind of wooden box or sconce which i at first mistook for a pigeonhouse but which in reality contained a bell to which was attached a rope which passing through the ceiling hung dangling in the middle of the schoolroom i am the more particular in mentioning this appurtenance as i had soon occasion to scrape acquaintance with it in a manner not very agreeable to my feelings the master was very proud of his bell if i might judge from the fact of his eyes being frequently turned to that part of the ceiling from which the rope depended twice every day namely after the morning and evening tasks had been gone through were the boys rung out of school by the monotonous jingle of this bell this ringing out was rather a lengthy affair for as the master was a man of order and method the boys were only permitted to go out of the room one by one and as they were rather numerous amounting at least to one hundred and were taught to move at a pace of suitable decorum at least a quarter of an hour elapsed from the commencement of the march before the last boy could make his exit the office of bellringer was performed by every boy successively and it so happened that the very first day of my attendance at the school the turn to ring the bell had by order of succession arrived at the place which had been allotted to me for the master as i have already observed was a man of method and order and every boy had a particular seat to which he became a fixture as long as he continued at the school so upon this day when the tasks were done and completed and the boys sat with their hats and caps in their hands anxiously expecting the moment of dismissal it was suddenly notified to me by the urchins who sat nearest to me that i must get up and ring the bell now as this was the first time that i had been at the school i was totally unacquainted withthe process which i had never seen and indeed had never heard of till that moment i therefore sat still not imagining it possible that any such duty could be required of me but now with not a little confusion i perceived that the eyes of all the boys in the school were fixed upon me presently there were nods and winks in the direction of the bellrope and as these produced no effect uncouth visages were made like those of monkeys when enraged teeth were gnashed tongues thrust out and even fists were bent at me the master who stood at the end of the room with a huge ferule under his arm bent full upon me a look of stern appeal and the ushers of whom there were four glared upon me each from his own particular corner as i vainly turned in one direction and another in search of one reassuring look but now probably in obedience to a sign from the master the boys in my immediate neighbourhood began to maltreat me some pinched me with their fingers some buffeted me whilst others pricked me with pins or the points of compasses these arguments were not without effect i sprang from my seat and endeavoured to escape along a double line of benches thronged with boys of all ages from the urchin of six or seven to the nondescript of sixteen or seventeen it was like running the gauntlet every one great or small pinching kicking or otherwise maltreating me as i passed by goaded on in this manner i at length reached the middle of the room where dangled the bellrope the cause of all my sufferings i should have passed itfor my confusion was so great that i was quite at a loss to comprehend what all this could mean and almost believed myself under the influence of an ugly dreambut now the boys who were seated in advance in the row arose with one accord and barred my farther progress and one doubtless more sensible than the rest seizing the rope thrust it into my hand i now began to perceive that the dismissal of the school and my own release from torment depended upon this selfsame rope i therefore in a fit of desperation pulled it once or twice and then left off naturally supposing that i had done quite enough the boys who sat next the door no sooner heard the bell than rising from their seats they moved out at the door the bell however had no sooner ceased to jingle than they stopped short and turning round stared at the master as much as to say what are we to do now this was too much for the patience of the man of method which my previous stupidity had already nearly exhausted dashing forward into the middle of the room he struck me violently on the shoulders with his ferule and snatching the rope out of my hand exclaimed with a stentorian voice and genuine yorkshire accent prodigy of ignorance dost not even know how to ring a bell must i myself instruct thee he then commenced pulling at the bell with such violence that long before half the school was dismissed the rope broke and the rest of the boys had to depart without their accustomed music but i must not linger here though i could say much about the school and the pedagogue highly amusing and diverting which however i suppress in order to make way for matters of yet greater interest on we went northward northward and as we advanced i saw that the country was becoming widely different from those parts of merry england in which we had previously travelled it was wilder and less cultivated and more broken with hills and hillocks the people too of those regions appeared to partake of something of the character of their country they were coarsely dressed tall and sturdy of frame their voices were deep and guttural and the half of the dialect which they spoke was unintelligible to my ears i often wondered where we could be going for i was at this time about as ignorant of geography as i was of most other things however i held my peace asked no questions and patiently awaited the issue northward northward still and it came to pass that one morning i found myself extended on the bank of a river it was a beautiful morning of early spring small white clouds were floating in the heaven occasionally veiling the countenance of the sun whose light as they retired would again burst forth coursing like a racehorse over the sceneand a goodly scene it was before me across the water on an eminence stood a white old city surrounded with lofty walls above which rose the tops of tall houses with here and there a church or steeple to my right hand was a long and massive bridge with many arches and of antique architecture which traversed the river the river was a noble one the broadest that i had hitherto seen its waters of a greenish tinge poured with impetuosity beneath the narrow arches to meet the sea close at hand as the boom of the billows breaking distinctly upon a beach declared there were songs upon the river from the fisherbarks and occasionally a chorus plaintive and wild such as i had never heard before the words of which i did not understand but which at the present time down the long avenue of years seem in memorys ear to sound like horam coram dago several robust fellows were near me some kneedeep in water employed in hauling the seine upon the strand huge fish were struggling amidst the meshesprincely salmontheir brilliant mail of blue and silver flashing in the morning beam so goodly and gay a scene in truth had never greeted my boyish eye and as i gazed upon the prospect my bosom began to heave and my tears to trickle was it the beauty of the scene which gave rise to these emotions possibly for though a poor ignorant childa halfwild creaturei was not insensible to the loveliness of nature and took pleasure in the happiness and handiworks of my fellowcreatures yet perhaps in something more deep and mysterious the feelings which then pervaded me might originate who can lie down on elvir hill without experiencing something of the sorcery of the place flee from elvir hill young swain or the maids of elle will have power over you and you will go elfwildso say the danes i had unconsciously laid myself down upon haunted ground and i am willing to imagine that what i then experienced was rather connected with the world of spirits and dreams than with what i actually saw and heard around me surely the elves and genii of the place were conversing bysome inscrutable means with the principle of intelligence lurking within the poor uncultivated clod perhaps to that ethereal principle the wonders of the past as connected with that stream the glories of the present and even the history of the future were at that moment being revealed of how many feats of chivalry had those old walls been witness when hostile kings contended for their possessionhow many an army from the south and from the north had trod that old bridgewhat red and noble blood had crimsoned those rushing waterswhat strains had been sung ay were yet being sung on its bankssome soft as doric reed some fierce and sharp as those of norwegian skaldaglam some as replete with wild and wizard force as finlands runes singing of kalevalas moors and the deeds of woinomoinen honour to thee thou island stream onward may thou ever roll fresh and green rejoicing in

drew nigh to me a man in the habiliments of a fisher he was barelegged of a weatherbeaten countenance and of stature approaching to the gigantic what is the callant greeting for said he as he stopped and surveyed me has onybody wrought ye ony harm not that i know of i replied rather guessing at than understanding his question i was crying because i could not help it i say old one what is the name

before we found ourselves at edinburgh a or rather in the castle into which the regiment marched with drums beating colourflying and a long train of baggagewaggons behind the castle was as i suppose it is now a garrison for soldiers two other regiments were already there the one an irish if i remember right the other a small highland corps it is hardly necessary to say much about this castle which everybody has seen on which account doubtless nobody has ever yet thought fit to describe itat least that i am aware be this as it may i have no intention of describing it and shall content myself with observing that we took up our abode in that immense building or caserne of modern erection which occupies the entire eastern b side of the bold rock on which the castle stands a gallant caserne it wasthe best and roomiest that i had hitherto seenrather cold and windy it is true especially in the winter but commanding a noble prospect of a range of distant hills which i was told were the hieland hills and of a broad arm of the sea which i heard somebody say was the firth of forth my brother who for some years past had been receiving his education in a certain celebrated school in england was now with us and it came to pass that one day my father as he sat at table looked steadfastly on my brother and myself and then addressed my motherduring my journey down hither i have lost no opportunity of making inquiries about these people the scotch amongst whom we now are and since i have been here i have observed them attentively from what i have heard and seen i should say that upon the whole they are a very decent set of people they seem acute and intelligent and i am told that their system of education is so excellent that every person is learnedmore or less acquainted with greek and latin there is one thing however connected with them which is a great drawback the horrid jargon which they speak however learned they may be in greek and latin their english is execrable and yet im told it is not so bad as it was i was in company the other day with an englishman who has resided here many years we were talking about the country and the people i should like both very well said i were it not for the language i wish sincerely our parliament which is passing so many foolish acts every year would pass one to force these scotch to speak english i wish so too said he the language is a disgrace to the british government but if you had heard it twenty years ago captainif you had heard it as it was spoken when i first came to edinburgh only custom said my mother i daresay the language is now what it was then i dont know said my father though i daresay you are right it could never have been worse than it is at present but now to the point were it not for the language which if the boys were to pick it up might ruin their prospects in life were it not for that i should very much like to send them to a school there is in this place which everybody talks about the high school i think they call it tis said to be the best school in the whole island but the idea of ones children speaking scotchbroad scotch i must think the matter over and he did think the matter over and the result of his deliberation was a determination to send us to the school let me call thee up before my minds eye high school to which every morning the two english brothers took their way from the proud old castle through the lofty streets of the old town high schoolcalled so i scarcely know why neither lofty in thyself nor by position being situated in a flat bottom oblong structure of tawny stone with many windows fenced with iron nettingwith thy long hall below and thy five chambers above for the reception of the five classes into which the eight hundred urchins who styled thee instructress were divided thy learned rector and his four subordinate dominies thy strange old porter of the tall form and grizzled hair hight boee and doubtless of norse ancestry as his name declares perhaps of the blood of bui hin digri the hero of northern songthe jomsborg viking who clove thorsteinn midlangr asunder in the dread sea battle of horunga vog and who when the fight was lost and his own two hands smitten off seized two chests of gold with his bloody stumps and springing with them into the sea cried to the scanty relics of his crew overboard now all buis lads yes i remember all about thee and how at eight of every morn we were all gathered together with one accord in the long hall from which after the litanies had been read for so i will call them being an episcopalian the five classes from the five sets of benches trotted off in long files one boy after the other up the five spiral staircases of stone each class to its destination and well do i remember how we of the third sat hushed and still watched by the eye of the dux until the door opened and in walked that model of a good scotchman the shrewd intelligent but warmhearted and kind dominie the respectable carson and in this school i began to construe the latin language which i had never done before notwithstanding my long and diligent study of lilly which illustrious grammar was not used at edinburgh nor indeed known greek was only taught in the fifth or highest class in which my brother was as for myself i never got beyond the third during the two years that i remained at this seminary i certainly acquired here a considerable insight in the latin tongue and to the scandal of my father and horror of my mother a thorough proficiency in the scotch which in less than two months usurped the placeof the english and so obstinately maintained its ground that i still can occasionally detect its lingering remains i did not spend my time unpleasantly at this school though first of all i had to pass through an ordeal scotland is a better country than england said an ugly bleareyed lad about a head and shoulders taller than myself the leader of a gang of varlets who surrounded me in the playground on the first day as soon as the morning lesson was over scotland is a far better country than england in every respect is it said i then you ought to be very thankful for not having been born in england thats just what i am ye loon and every morning when i say my prayers i thank god for not being an englishman the scotch are a much better and braver people than the english it may be so said i for what i knowindeed till i came here i never heard a word either about the scotch or their country are ye making fun of us ye english puppy said the bleareyed lad take that and i was presently beaten black and blue and thus did i first become aware of the difference of races and their antipathy to each other bow to the storm and it shall pass over you i held my peace and silently submitted to the superiority of the scotchin numbers this was enough from an object of persecution i soon became one of patronage especially amongst the champions of the class the english said the bleareyed lad though a wee bit behind the scotch in strength and fortitude are nae to be sneezed at being far ahead of the irish to say nothing of the french a pack of cowardly scoundrels and with regard to the english country it is na scotland it is true but it has its gude properties and though there is neer a haggis in a the land theres an unco deal o gowd and siller i respect england for i have an auntie married there the scotch are certainly a most pugnacious people their whole history proves it witness their incessant wars with the english in the olden time and their internal feuds highland and lowland clan with clan family with family saxon with gael in my time the schoolboys for want perhaps of english urchins to contend with were continually fighting with each other every noon there was at least one pugilistic encounter and sometimes three in one month i witnessed more of these encounters than i had ever previously seen under similar circumstances in england after all there was not much harm done harm what harm could result from short chopping blows a hug and a tumble i was witness to many a sounding whack some bloodshed a blue ee now and then but nothing more in england on the contrary where the lads were comparatively mild gentle and pacific i had been present at more than one death caused by blows in boyish combats in which the oldest of the victors had scarcely reached thirteen years but these blows were in the jugular given with the full force of the arm shot out horizontally from the shoulder but the scotchthough by no means proficients in boxing and how should they box seeing that they have never had a teacherare i repeat a most pugnacious people at least they were in my time anything served them that is the urchins as a pretence for a fray or dorically speaking a bicker every street and close was at feud with its neighbour the lads of the school were at feud with the young men of the college whom they pelted in winter with snow and in summer with stones and then the feud between the old and new town one day i was standing on the ramparts of the castle on the southwestern side which overhangs the green brae where it slopes down into what was in those days the green swamp or morass called by the natives of auld reekie the nor loch it was a dark gloomy day and a thin veil of mist was beginning to settle down upon the brae and the morass i could perceive however that there was a skirmish taking place in the latter spot i had an indistinct view of two parties apparently of urchinsand i heard whoops and shrill cries eager to know the cause of this disturbance i left the castle and descending the brae reached the borders of the morass where was a runnel of water and the remains of an old wall on the other side of which a narrow path led across the swamp upon this path at a little distance before me there was a bicker i pushed forward but had scarcely crossed the ruined wall and runnel when the party nearest to me gave way and in great confusion came running in my direction as they drew nigh one of them shouted to me wha are ye man are ye o the auld toon i made no answer ha ye are o the new toon deil tak ye well moorder ye and the next moment a huge stone sung past my head let me be ye fule bodies said i im no of either of ye i live yonder aboon in the castle ah ye live in the castle then yere an auld tooner come gie us your help man and dinna stand there staring like a dunnot we want help sair eneugh here are stanes for my own part i wished for nothing better and rushing forward i placed myself at the head of my new associates and commenced flinging stones fast and desperately the other party now gave way in their turn closely followed by ourselves i was in the van and about to stretch out my hand to seize the hindermost boy of the enemy when not being acquainted with the miry and difficult paths of the nor loch and in my eagerness taking no heed of my footing i plunged into a quagmire into which i sank as far as my shoulders our adversaries no sooner perceived this disaster than setting up a shout they wheeled round and attacked us most vehemently had my comrades now deserted me my life had not been worth a straws purchase i should either have been smothered in the quag or what is more probable hadmy brains beaten out with stones but they behaved like true scots and fought stoutly around their comrade until i was extricated whereupon both parties retired the night being near at hand ye are na a bad hand at flinging stanes said the lad who first addressed me as we now returned up the brae your aim is right dangerous man i saw how ye skelpit them ye maun help us agin thae new toon blackguards at our next bicker so to the next bicker i went and to many more which speedily followed as the summer advanced the party to which i had given my help on the first occasion consisted merely of outlyers posted about half way up the hill for the purpose of overlooking the movements of the enemy did the latter draw nigh in any considerable force messengers were forthwith despatched to the auld toon especially to the filthy alleys and closes of the high street which forthwith would disgorge swarms of bareheaded and barefooted callants who with gestures wild and eldrich screech and hollo might frequently be seen pouring down the sides of the hill i have seen upwards of a thousand engaged on either side in these frays which i have no doubt were full as desperate as the fights described in the iliad and which were certainly much more bloody than the combats of modern greece in the war of independence the callants not only employed their hands in hurling stones but not unfrequently slings at the use of which they were very expert and which occasionally dislodged teeth shattered jaws or knocked out an eye our opponents certainly laboured under considerable disadvantage being compelled not only to wade across a deceitful bog but likewise to clamber up part of a steep hill before they could attack us nevertheless their determination was such and such their impetuosity that we had sometimes difficulty enough to maintain our own i shall never forget one bicker the last indeed which occurred at that time as the authorities of the town alarmed by the desperation of its character stationed forthwith a body of police on the hillside to prevent in future any such breaches of the peace it was a beautiful sunday evening the rays of the descending sun were reflected redly from the grey walls of the castle and from the black rocks on which it was founded the bicker had long since commenced stones from sling and hand were flying but the callants of the new town were now carrying everything before them a fullgrown bakers apprentice was at their head he was foaming with rage and had taken the field as i was told in order to avenge his brother whose eye had been knocked out in one of the late bickers he was no slinger or flinger but brandished in his right hand the spoke of a cartwheel like my countryman tom hickathrift of old in his encounter with the giant of the lincolnshire fen protected by a piece of wickerwork attached to his left arm he rushed on to the fray disregarding the stones which were showered against him and was ably seconded by his followers our own party was chased half way up the hill where i was struck to the ground by the baker after having been foiled in an attempt which i had made to fling a handful of earth into his eyes all now appeared lost the auld toon was in full retreat i myself lay at the bakers feet who had just raised his spoke probably to give me the coup de grâceit was an awful moment just then i heard a shout and a rushing sound a wildlooking figure is descending the hill with terrible bounds it is a lad of some fifteen years he is bareheaded and his red uncombed hair stands on end like hedgehogs bristles his frame is lithy like that of an antelope but he has prodigious breadth of chest he wears a military undress that of the regiment even of a drummer for it is wild davy whom a month before i had seen enlisted on leith links to serve king george with drum and drumstick as long as his services might be required and who ere a week had elapsed had smitten with his fist drummajor elzigood who incensed at his inaptitude had threatened him with his cane he has been in confinement for weeks this is the first day of his liberation and he is now descending the hill with horrid bounds and shoutings he is now about five yards distant and the baker who apprehends that something dangerous is at hand prepares himself for the encounter but what avails the strength of a baker even full grownwhat avails the defence of a wicker shieldwhat avails the wheelspoke should there be an opportunity of using it against the impetus of an avalanche or a cannon ballfor to either of these might that wild figure be compared which at the distance of five yards sprang at once with head hands feet and body all together upon the champion of the new town tumbling him to the earth amain and now it was the turn of the old town to triumph our late discomfited host returning on its steps overwhelmed the fallen champion with blows of every kind and then led on by his vanquisher who had assumed his arms namely the wheelspoke and wicker shield fairly cleared the brae of their adversaries whom they drove down headlong into the morasschapter viii expert climbersthe cragssomething redthe horrible edgedavid haggartfine materialsthe greatest victoryextraordinary robberthe ruling passion meanwhile i had become a daring cragsman a character to which an english lad has seldom opportunities of aspiring for in england there are neither crags nor mountains of these however as is well known there is no lack in scotland and the habits of individuals are invariably in harmony with the country in which they dwell the scotch are expert climbers and i was now a scot in most things particularly in language the castle in which i dwelt stood upon a rock a bold and craggy one which at first sight would seem to bid defiance to any feet save those of goats and chamois but patience and perseverance generally enable mankind to overcome things which at first sight appear impossible indeed what is there above mans exertions unwearied determination will enable him to run with the horse to swim with the fish and assuredly to compete with the chamois and the goat in agility and sureness of foot to scale the rock was merely childs play for the edinbro callants it was my own favourite diversion i soon found that the rock contained all manner of strange crypts crannies and recesses where owls nestled and the weasel brought forth her young here and there were small natural platforms overgrown with long grass and various kinds of plants where the climber if so disposed could stretch himself and either give his eyes to sleep or his mind to thought for capital places were these same platforms either for repose or meditation the boldest features of the rock are descried on the southern a side where after shelving down gently from the wall for some distance it terminates abruptly in a precipice black and horrible of some three hundred feet b at least as if the axe of nature had been here employed cutting sheer down and leaving behind neither excrescence nor spura dizzy precipice it is assimilating much to those so frequent in the flinty hills of northern africa and exhibiting some distant resemblance to that of gibraltar towering in its horridness above the neutral ground it was now holiday time and having nothing particular wherewith to occupy myself i not unfrequently passed the greater part of the day upon the rocks once after scaling the western crags and creeping round a sharp angle of the wall overhung by a kind of watch tower i found myself on the southern side still keeping close to the wall i was proceeding onward for i was bent upon a long excursion which should embrace half the circuit of the castle when suddenly my eye was attracted by the appearance of something red far below me i stopped short and looking fixedly upon it perceived that it was a human being in a kind of red jacket seated on the extreme verge of the precipice which i have already made a faint attempt to describe wondering who it could be i shouted but it took not the slightest notice remaining as immovable as the rock on which it sat i should never have thought of going near that edge said i to myself however as you have done it why should not i and i should like to know who you are so i commenced the descent of the rock but with great care for i had as yet never been in a situation so dangerous a slight moisture exuded from the palms of my hands my nerves were tingling and my brain was somewhat dizzyand now i had arrived within a few yards of the figure and had recognised it it was the wild drummer who had turned the tide of battle in the bicker on the castle brae a small stone which i dislodged now rolled down the rock and tumbled into the abyss close beside him he turned his head and after looking at me for a moment somewhat vacantly he resumed his former attitude i drew yet nearer to the horrible edge not close however for fear was on me what are you thinking of david said i as i sat behind him and trembled for i repeat that i was afraid david haggart i was thinking of willie wallace myself you had better be thinking of yourself man a strange place this to come to and think of william wallace david haggart why so is not his tower just beneath our feet myself you mean the auld ruin by the side of the nor lochthe ugly stane bulk from the foot of which flows the spring into the dyke where the watercresses grow david haggart just sae geordie myself and why were ye thinking of him the english hanged him long since as i have heard say david haggart i was thinking that i should wish to be like him myself do ye mean that ye would wish to be hanged david haggart i wad na flinch from that geordie if i might be a great man first myself and wha kens davie how great you may be even without hanging are ye not in the high road of preferment are ye not a bauld drummer already wha kens how high ye may rise perhaps to be general or drummajordavid haggart i hae na wish to be drummajor it were na great things to be like the doited carle elsethangude as they call him and troth he has na his name for naething but i should have nae objection to be a general and to fight the french and americans and win myself a name and a fame like willie wallace and do brave deeds such as i have been reading about in his story book myself ye are a fule davie the story book is full of lies wallace indeed the wuddie rebel i have heard my father say that the duke of cumberland was worth twenty of willie wallace david haggart ye had better say naething agin willie wallace geordie for if ye do deil hae me if i dinna tumble ye doon the craig fine materials in that lad for a hero you will say yes indeed for a hero or for what he afterwards became in other times and under other circumstances he might have made what is generally termed a great man a patriot or a conqueror as it was the very qualities which might then have pushed him on to fortune and renown were the cause of his ruin the war over he fell into evil courses for his wild heart and ambitious spirit could not brook the sober and quiet pursuits of honest industry can an arabian steed submit to be a vile drudge cries the fatalist nonsense a man is not an irrational creature but a reasoning being and has something within him beyond mere brutal instinct the greatest victory which a man can achieve is over himself by which is meant those unruly passions which are not convenient to the time and place david did not do this he gave the reins to his wild heart instead of curbing it and became a robber and alas alas he shed bloodunder peculiar circumstances it is true and without malice prépenseand for that blood he eventually died and justly for it was that of the warden of a prison from which he was escaping and whom he slew with one blow of his stalwart arm tamerlane and haggart haggart and tamerlane both these men were robbers and of low birth yet one perished on an ignoble scaffold and the other died emperor of the world is this justice the ends of the two men were widely dissimilaryet what is the intrinsic difference between them very great indeed the one acted according to his lights and his country not so the other tamerlane was a heathen and acted according to his lights he was a robber where all around were robbers but he became the avenger of godgods scourge on unjust kings on the cruel bajazet who had plucked out his own brothers eyes he became to a certain extent the purifier of the east its regenerator his equal never was before nor has it since been seen here the wild heart was profitably employed the wild strength the teeming brain onward lame one onward tamurlank haggart but peace to thee poor david why should a mortal worm be sitting in judgment over thee the mighty and just one has already judged thee and perhaps above thou hast received pardon for thy crimes which could not be pardoned here below and now that thy feverish existence has closed and thy once active form become inanimate dust thy very memory all but forgotten i will say a few words about thee a few words soon also to be forgotten thou wast the most extraordinary robber that ever lived within the belt of britain scotland rang with thy exploits and england too north of the humber strange deeds also didst thou achieve when fleeing from justice thou didst find thyself in the sister isle busy wast thou there in town and on curragh at fair and racecourse and also in the solitary place ireland thought thee her child for who spoke her brogue better than thyselfshe felt proud of thee and said sure ohanlon is come again what might not have been thy fate in the far west in america whither thou hadst turned thine eye saying i will go there and become an honest man but thou wast not to go there davidthe blood which thou hadst shed in scotland was to be required of thee the avenger was at hand the avenger of blood seized manacled brought back to thy native land condemned to die thou wast left in thy narrow cell and told to make the most of thy time for it was short and there in thy narrow cell and thy time so short thou didst put the crowning stone to thy strange deeds by that strange history of thyself penned by thy own hand in the robber tongue thou mightest have been better employed davidbut the ruling passion was strong with thee even in the jaws of death thou mightest have been better employedbut peace be with thee i repeat and the almightys grace and pardonchapter ix napoleonthe stormthe coveup the countrythe trembling handirishtough battletipperary hills elegant lodgingsa speechfair specimenorangemen onward onward and after we had sojourned in scotland nearly two years the long continental war had been brought to an end napoleon was humbled for a time and the bourbons restored to a land which could well have dispensed with them we returned to england where the corps was disbanded and my parents with their family retired to private life i shall pass over in silence the events of a year which offer little of interest as far as connected with me and mine suddenly however the sound of war was heard again napoleon had broken forth from elba and everything was in confusion vast military preparations were again made our own corps was levied anew and my brother became an officer in it but the danger was soon over napoleon was once more quelled and chained for ever like prometheus to his rock as the corps however though so recently levied had already become a very fine one thanks to my fathers energetic drilling the government very properly determined to turn it to some account and as disturbances were apprehended in ireland about this period it occurred to them that they could do no better than despatch it to that country in the autumn of the year we set sail from a port in essex a we were some eight hundred strong and were embarked in two ships very large but old and crazy a storm overtook us when off beachy head in which we had nearly foundered i was awakened early in the morning by the howling of the wind and the uproar on deck i kept myself close however as is still my constant practice on similar occasions and waited the result with that apathy and indifference which violent seasickness is sure to produce we shipped several seas and once the vessel missing stayswhich to do it justice it generally did at every third or fourth tackwe escaped almost by a miracle from being dashed upon the foreland on the eighth day of our voyage we were in sight of ireland the weather was now calm and serene the sun shone brightly on the sea and on certain green hills in the distance on which i descried what at first sight i believed to be two ladies gathering flowers which however on our nearer approach proved to be two tall white towers doubtless built for some purpose or other though i did not learn for what we entered a kind of bay or cove b by a narrow inlet it was a beautiful and romantic place this cove very spacious and being nearly landlocked was sheltered from every wind a small island every inch of which was covered with fortifications appeared to swim upon the waters whose dark blue denoted their immense depth tall green hills which ascended gradually from the shore formed the background to the west they were carpeted to the top with turf of the most vivid green and studded here and there with woods seemingly of oak there was a strange old castle half way up the ascent a village on a cragbut the mists of morning were half veiling the scene when i surveyed it and the mists of time are now hanging densely between it and my no longer youthful eye i may not describe itnor will i try leaving the ship in the cove we passed up a wide river in boats till we came to a city where we disembarked it was a large city as large as edinburgh to my eyes there were plenty of fine houses but little neatness the streets were full of impurities handsome equipages rolled along but the greater part of the population were in rags beggars abounded there was no lack of merriment however boisterous shouts of laughter were heard on every side it appeared a city of contradictions after a few days rest we marched from this place in two divisions my father commanded the second i walked by his side our route lay up the country the country at first offered no very remarkable feature it was pretty but tame on the second day however its appearance had altered it had become more wild a range of distant mountains bounded the horizon we passed through several villages as i suppose i may term them of low huts the walls formed of rough stones without mortar the roof of flags laid over wattles and wickerwork they seemed to be inhabited solely by women and children the latter were naked the former in general bleareyed beldames who sat beside the doors on low stools spinning we saw however both men and women working at a distance in the fields i was thirsty and going up to an ancient crone employed in the manner which i have described i asked her for water she looked me in the face appeared to consider a moment then tottering into her hut presently reappeared with a small pipkin of milk which she offered to me with a trembling hand i drank the milk it was sour but i found it highly refreshing i then took out a penny and offered it to her whereupon she shook her head smiled and patting my face with her skinny hand murmured some words in a tongue which i had never heard before i walked on by my fathers side holding the stirrupleather of his horse presently several low uncouth cars passed by drawn by starved cattle the drivers were tall fellows with dark features and athletic framesthey wore long loose blue cloaks with sleeves which last however dangled unoccupied these cloaks appeared in tolerably good condition not so their under garments on their heads were broad slouching hats the generality of them were barefooted as they passed the soldiers jested with them in the patois of east anglia whereupon the fellows laughed and appeared to jest with the soldiers but what they said who knows it being in a rough guttural language strange and wild the soldiers stared at each other and were silenta strange language that said a young officer to my father i dont understand a word of it what can it be irish said my father with a loud voice and a bad language it is i have known it of old that is i have often heard it spoken when i was a guardsman in london theres one part of london where all the irish liveat least all the worst of themand there they hatch their villanies and speak this tongue it is that which keeps them together and makes them dangerous i was once sent there to seize a couple of desertersirishwho had taken refuge amongst their companions we found them in what was in my time called a ken that is a house where only thieves and desperadoes are to be found knowing on what kind of business i was bound i had taken with me a sergeants party it was well i did so we found the deserters in a large room with at least thirty ruffians horridlooking fellows seated about a long table drinking swearing and talking irish ah we had a tough battle i remember the two fellows did nothing but sat still thinking it best to be quiet but the rest with an ubbubboo like the blowing up of a powdermagazine sprang up brandishing their sticks for these fellows always carry sticks with them even to bed and not unfrequently spring up in their sleep striking left and right and did you take the deserters said the officer yes said my father for we formed at the end of the room and charged with fixed bayonets which compelled the others to yield notwithstanding their numbers but the worst was when we got out into the street the whole district had become alarmed and hundreds came pouring down upon usmen women and children women did i saythey looked fiends half naked with their hair hanging down over their bosoms they tore up the very pavement to hurl at us sticks rang about our ears stones and irishi liked the irish worst of all it sounded so horrid especially as i did not understand it its a bad language a queer tongue said i i wonder if i could learn it learn it said my father what should you learn it forhowever i am not afraid of that it is not like scotch no person can learn it save those who are born to it and even in ireland the respectable people do not speak it only the wilder sort like those we have passed within a day or two we had reached a tall range of mountains running north and south which i was told were those of tipperary along the skirts of these we proceeded till we came to a town the principal one of these regions it was on the bank of a beautiful river which separated it from the mountains it was rather an ancient place and might contain some ten thousand inhabitantsi found that it was our destination there were extensive barracks at the farther end in which the corps took up its quarters with respect to ourselves we took lodgings in a house which stood in the principal street you never saw more elegant lodgings than these captain said the master of the house a tall handsome and athletic man who came up whilst our little family were seated at dinner late in the afternoon of the day of our arrival they beat anything in this town of clonmel i do not let them for the sake of interest and to none but gentlemen in the army in order that myself and my wife who is from londonderry may have the advantage of pleasant company genteel company ay and protestant company captain it did my heart good when i saw your honour ride in at the head of all those fine fellows real protestants ill engage not a papist among them they are too goodlooking and honestlooking for that so i no sooner saw your honour at the head of your army with that handsome young gentleman holding by your stirrup than i said to my wife mistress hyne who is from londonderry god bless me said i what a truly protestant countenance what a noble bearing and what a sweet young gentleman by the silver hairs of his honourand sure enough i never saw hairs more regally silver than those of your honourby his honours grey silver hairs and by my own soul which is not worthy to be mentioned in the same day with one of themit would be no more than decent and civil to run out and welcome such a father and son coming in at the head of such a protestant military and then my wife who is from londonderry mistress hyne looking me in the face like a fairy as she is you may say that says she it would be but decent and civil honey and your honour knows how i ran out of my own door and welcomed your honour riding in company with your son who was walking how i welcomed ye both at the head of your royal regiment and how i shook your honour by the hand saying i am glad to see your honour and your honours son and your honours royal military protestant regiment and now i have you in the house and right proud i am to have ye one and all one two three four true protestants every one no papists here and i have made bold to bring up a bottle of claret which is now waiting behind the door and when your honour and your family have dined i will make bold too to bring up mistress hyne from londonderry to introduce to your honours lady and then well drink to the health of king george god bless him to the glorious and immortalto boyne waterto your honours speedy promotion to be lord lieutenant and to the speedy downfall of the pope and saint anthony of padua such was the speech of the irish protestant addressed to my father in the long lofty diningroom with three windows looking upon the high street of the good town of clonmel as he sat at meat with his family after saying grace like a truehearted respectable soldier as he was a bigot and an orangeman oh yes it is easier to apply epithets of opprobrium to people than to make yourselfacquainted with their history and position he was a specimen and a fair specimen of a most remarkable body of men who during two centuries have fought a good fight in ireland in the cause of civilisation and religious truth they were sent as colonists few in number into a barbarous and unhappy country where ever since though surrounded with difficulties of every kind they have maintained their ground theirs has been no easy life nor have their lines fallen upon very pleasant places amidst darkness they have held up a lamp and it would be well for ireland were all her children like these her adopted ones but they are fierce and sanguinary it is said ay ay they have not unfrequently opposed the keen sword to the savage pike but they are bigoted and narrowminded ay ay they do not like idolatry and will not bow the knee before a stone but their language is frequently indecorous go to my dainty one did ye ever listen to the voice of papist cursing the irish protestants have faults numerous ones but the greater number of these may be traced to the peculiar circumstances of their position but they have virtues numerous ones and their virtues are their own their industry their energy and their undaunted resolution are their own they have been vilified and traducedbut what would ireland be without them i repeat that it would be well for her were all her sons no worse than these much calumniated children of her adoptionchapter x protestant young gentlementhe greek lettersopen chimneymurtaghparis and salamancanothing to do to whit to whoothe pack of cardsbefore christmas we continued at this place for some months during which time the soldiers performed their duties whatever they were and i having no duties to perform was sent to school i had been to english schools and to the celebrated one of edinburgh but my education at the present day would not be what it isperfect had i never had the honour of being alumnus in an irish seminary captain said our kind host you would no doubt wish that the young gentleman should enjoy every advantage which the town may afford towards helping him on in the path of genteel learning its a great pity that he should waste his time in idlenessdoing nothing else than what he says he has been doing for the last fortnightfishing in the river for trouts which he never catches and wandering up the glen in the mountain in search of the hips that grow there now we have a school here where he can learn the most elegant latin and get an insight into the greek letters which is desirable and where moreover he will have an opportunity of making acquaintance with all the protestant young gentlemen of the place the handsome welldressed young persons whom your honour sees in the church on the sundays when your honour goes there in the morning with the rest of the protestant military for it is no papist school though there may be a papist or two therea few poor farmers sons from the country with whom there is no necessity for your honours child to form any acquaintance at all at all and to the school i went where i read the latin tongue and the greek letters with a nice old clergyman who sat behind a black oaken desk with a huge elzevir flaccus before him in a long gloomy kind of hall with a broken stone floor the roof festooned with cobwebs the walls considerably dilapidated and covered over with strange figures and hieroglyphics evidently produced by the application of burnt stick and there i made acquaintance with the protestant young gentlemen of the place who with whatever éclat they might appear at church on a sunday did assuredly not exhibit to much advantage in the schoolroom on the week days either with respect to clothes or looks and there i was in the habit of sitting on a large stone before the roaring fire in the huge open chimney and entertaining certain of the protestant young gentlemen of my own age seated on similar stones with extraordinary accounts of my own adventures and those of the corps with an occasional anecdote extracted from the storybooks of hickathrift and wight wallace pretending to be conning the lesson all the while and there i made acquaintance notwithstanding the hint of the landlord with the papist gossoons as they were called the farmers sons from the country and of these gossoons of which there were three two might be reckoned as nothing at all in the third however i soon discovered that there was something extraordinary he was about sixteen years old and above six feet high dressed in a grey suit the coat from its size appeared to have been made for him some ten years before he was remarkably narrowchested and roundshouldered owing perhaps as much to the tightness of his garment as to the hand of nature his face was long and his complexion swarthy relieved however by certain freckles with which the skin was plentifully studded he had strange wandering eyes grey and somewhat unequal in size they seldom rested on the book but were generally wandering about the room from one object to another sometimes he would fix them intently on the wall and then suddenly starting as if from a reverie he would commence making certain mysterious movements with his thumbs and forefingers as if he were shuffling something from him one morning as he sat by himself on a bench engaged in this manner i went up to him and said good day murtagh you do not seem to have much to do faith you may say that shorsha dearit is seldom much to do that i have and what are you doing with your hands faith then if i must tell you i was een dealing with the cards do you play much at cards sorra a game shorsha have i

he cares about and that makes me dread so going home at nights i should like to know all about you where do you live joyfaith then ye shall know all about me and where i live it is at a place called the wilderness that i live and they call it so because it is a fearful wild place without any house near it but my fathers own and thats where i live when at home and your father is a farmer i suppose you may say that and it is a farmer i should have been like my brother denis had not my uncle phelim the thief tould my father to send me to school to learn greek letters that i might be made a saggart of and sent to paris and salamanca and you would rather be a farmer than a priest you may say thatfor were i a farmer like the rest i should have something to do like the restsomething that i cared forand i should come home tired at night and fall asleep as the rest do before the fire but when i comes home at night i am not tired for i have been doing nothing all day that i care for and then i sits down and stares about me and at the fire till i become frighted and then i shouts to my brother denis or to the gossoons get up i say and lets be doing something tell us the tale of finnmacoul and how he lay down in the shannons bed and let the river flow down his jaws arrah shorsha i wish you would come and stay with us and tell us some o your sweet stories of your ownself and the snake ye carried about wid ye faith shorsha dear that snake bates anything about finnmacoul or brian boroo the thieves two bad luck to them and do they get up and tell you stories sometimes they does but oftenmost they curses me and bids me be quiet but i cant be quiet either before the fire or abed so i runs out of the house and stares at the rocks at the trees and sometimes at the clouds as they run a race across the bright moon and the more i stares the more frighted i grows till i screeches and holloas and last night i went into the barn and hid my face in the straw and there as i lay and shivered in the straw i heard a voice above my head singing out to whit to whoo and then up i starts and runs into the house and falls over my brother denis as he lies at the fire whats that for says he get up you thief says i and be helping me i have been out into the barn and an owl has crowd at me and what has this to do with playing cards little enough shorsha dearif there were cardplaying i should not be frighted and why do you not play at cards did i not tell you that the thief my uncle phelim stole away the pack if we had the pack my brother denis and the gossoons would

speak a considerable quantity of broken irish chapter xi templemoredevils mountainno companionforce of circumstanceway of the worldruined castlegrim and desolatethe donjonold womanmy own house when christmas was over and the new year commenced we broke up our quarters and marched away to templemore this was a large military station situated in a wild and thinly inhabited country extensive bogs were in the neighbourhood connected with the huge bog of allan the palus mæotis of ireland here and there was seen a ruined castle looming through the mists of winter whilst at the distance of seven miles rose a singular mountain exhibiting in its brow a chasm or vacuum just for all the world as if a piece had been bitten out a feat which according to the tradition of the country had actually been performed by his satanic majesty who after flying for some leagues with the morsel in his mouth becoming weary dropped it in the vicinity of cashel where it may now be seen in the shape of a bold bluff hill crowned with the ruins of a stately edifice probably built by some ancient irish king we had been here only a few days when my brother who as i have before observed had become one of his majestys officers was sent on detachment to a village at about ten miles distance he was not sixteen and though three years older than myself scarcely my equal in stature for i had become tall and largelimbed for my age but there was a spirit in him which would not have disgraced a general and nothing daunted at the considerable responsibility which he was about to incur he marched sturdily out of the barrackyard at the head of his party consisting of twenty light infantry men and a tall grenadier sergeant selected expressly by my father for the soldierlike qualities which he possessed to accompany his son on this his first expedition so out of the barrackyard with something of an air marched my dear brother his single drum and fife playing the inspiring old melody marlbrouk is gone to the wars hell never return no more i soon missed my brother for i was now alone with no being at all assimilating in age with whom i could exchange a word of late years from being almost constantly at school i had cast aside in a great degree my unsocial habits and natural reserve but in the desolate region in which we now were there was no school and i felt doubly the loss of my brother whom moreover i tenderly loved for his own sake books i had none at least such as i cared about and with respect to the old volume the wonders of which had first beguiled me into common reading i had so frequently pored over its pages that i had almost got its contents by heart i was therefore in danger of falling into the same predicament as murtagh becoming frighted from having nothing to do nay i had not even his resources i cared not for cards even if i possessed them and could find people disposed to play with them however i made the most of circumstances and roamed about the desolate fields and bogs in the neighbourhood sometimes entering the cabins of the peasantry with a gods blessing upon you good people where i would take my seat on the strangers stone at the corner of the hearth and looking them full in the face would listen to the carles and carlines talking irish ah that irish how frequently do circumstances at first sight the most trivial and unimportant exercise a mighty and permanent influence on our habits and pursuitshow frequently is a stream turned aside from its natural course by some little rock or knoll causing it to make an abrupt turn on a wild road in ireland i had heard irish spoken for the first time and i was seized with a desire to learn irish the acquisition of which in my case became the steppingstone to other languages i had previously learnt latin or rather lilly but neither latin nor lilly made me a philologist i had frequently heard french and other languages but had felt little desire to become acquainted with them and what it may be asked was there connected with the irish calculated to recommend it to my attention first of all and principally i believe the strangeness and singularity of its tones then there was something mysterious and uncommon associated with its use it was not a school language to acquire which was considered an imperative duty no no nor was it a drawingroom language drawled out occasionally in shreds and patches by the ladies of generals and other great dignitaries to the ineffable dismay of poor officers wives nothing of the kind but a speech spoken in outoftheway desolate places and in cutthroat kens where thirty ruffians at the sight of the kings minions would spring up with brandished sticks and an ubbubboo like the blowing up of a powdermagazine such were the points connected with the irish which first awakened in my mind the desire of acquiring it and by acquiring it i became as i have already said enamoured of languages having learnt one by choice i speedily as the reader will perceive learnt others some of which were widely different from irish ah that irish i am much indebted to it in more ways than one but i am afraid i have followed the way of the world which is very much wont to neglect original friends and benefactors i frequently find myself at present turning up my nose at irish when i hear it in the street yet i have still a kind of regard for it the fine old language a labhair padruic ninsefail nan riogh one of the most peculiar features of this part of ireland is the ruined castles which are so thick and numerous that theface of the country appears studded with them it being difficult to choose any situation from which one at least may not be descried they are of various ages and styles of architecture some of great antiquity like the stately remains which crown the crag of cashel others built by the early english conquerors others and probably the greater part erections of the times of elizabeth and cromwell the whole speaking monuments of the troubled and insecure state of the country from the most remote periods to a comparatively modern time from the windows of the room where i slept i had a view of one of these old placesan indistinct one it is true the distance being too great to permit me to distinguish more than the general outline i had an anxious desire to explore it it stood to the southeast in which direction however a black bog intervened which had more than once baffled all my attempts to cross it one morning however when the sun shone brightly upon the old building it appeared so near that i felt ashamed at not being able to accomplish a feat seemingly so easy i determined therefore upon another trial i reached the bog and was about to venture upon its black surface and to pick my way amongst its innumerable holes yawning horribly and half filled with water black as soot when it suddenly occurred to me that there was a road to the south by following which i might find a more convenient route to the object of my wishes the event justified my expectations for after following the road for some three miles seemingly in the direction of the devils mountain i suddenly beheld the castle on my left i diverged from the road and crossing two or three fields came to a small grassy plain in the midst of which stood the castle about a gunshot to the south was a small village which had probably in ancient days sprung up beneath its protection a kind of awe came over me as i approached the old building the sun no longer shone upon it and it looked so grim so desolate and solitary and here was i in that wild country alone with that grim building before me the village was within sight it is true but it might be a village of the dead for what i knew no sound issued from it no smoke was rising from its roofs neither man nor beast was visible no life no motionit looked as desolate as the castle itself yet i was bent on the adventure and moved on towards the castle across the green plain occasionally casting a startled glance around me and now i was close to it it was surrounded by a quadrangular wall about ten feet in height with a square tower at each corner at first i could discover no entrance walking round however to the northern side i found a wide and lofty gateway with a tower above it similar to those at the angles of the wall on this side the ground sloped gently down towards the bog which was here skirted by an abundant growth of copsewood and a few evergreen oaks i passed through the gateway and found myself within a square enclosure of about two acres on one side rose a round and lofty keep or donjon with a conical roof part of which had fallen down strewing the square with its ruins close to the keep on the other side stood the remains of an oblong house built something in the modern style with various windowholes nothing remained but the bare walls and a few projecting stumps of beams which seemed to have been half burnt the interior of the walls was blackened as if by fire fire also appeared at one time to have raged out of the windowholes for the outside about them was black portentously so i wonder what has been going on here i exclaimed there were echoes among the walls as i walked about the court i entered the keep by a low and frowning doorway the lower floor consisted of a large dungeonlike room with a vaulted roof on the left hand was a winding staircase in the thickness of the wall it looked anything but inviting yet i stole softly up my heart beating on the top of the first flight of stairs was an arched doorway to the left was a dark passage to the right stairs leading still higher i stepped under the arch and found myself in an apartment somewhat similar to the one below but higher there was an object at the farther end an old woman at least eighty was seated on a stone cowering over a few sticks burning feebly on what had once been a right noble and cheerful hearth her sideglance was towards the doorway as i entered for she had heard my footsteps i stood suddenly still and her haggard glance rested on my face is this your house mother i at length demanded in the language which i thought she would best understand yes

i set out designing to pay a visit to my brother at the place where he was detached the distance was rather considerable yet i hoped to be back by eveningfall for i was now a shrewd walker thanks to constant practice i set out early and directing my course towards the north i had in less than two hours accomplished considerably more than half of the journey the weather had at first been propitious a slight frost had rendered the ground firm to the tread and the skies were clear but now a change came over the scene the skies darkened and a heavy snowstorm came on the road then lay straight through a bog and was bounded by a deep trench on both sides i was making the best of my way keeping as nearly as i could in the middle of the road lest blinded by the snow which was frequently borne into my eyes by the wind i might fall into the dyke when all at once i heard a shout to windward and turning my eyes i saw the figure of a man and what appeared to be an animal of some kind coming across the bog with great speed in the direction of myself the nature of the ground seemed to offer but little impediment to these beings both clearing the holes and abysses which lay in their way with surprising agility the animal was however some slight way in advance and bounding over the dyke appeared on the road just before me it was a dog of what species i cannot tell never having seen the like before or since the head was large and round the ears so tiny as scarcely to be discernible the eyes of a fiery red in size it was rather small than large and the coat which was remarkably smooth as white as the falling flakes it placed itself directly in my path and showing its teeth and bristling its coat appeared determined to prevent my progress i had an ashen stick in my hand with which i threatened it this however only served to increase its fury it rushed upon me and i had the utmost difficulty to preserve myself from its fangs what are you doing with the dog the fairy dog said a man who at this time likewise cleared the dyke at a bound he was a very tall man rather well dressed as it should seem his garments however were like my own so covered with snow that i could scarcely discern their quality what are ye doing with the dog of peace i wish he would show himself one said i i said nothing to him but he placed himself in my road and would not let me pass of course he would not be letting you till he knew where ye were going hes not much of a fairy said i or he would know that without asking tell him that i am going to see my brother and who is your brother little sas what my father is a royal soldier oh ye are going then to the detachment at by my shoul i have a good mind to be spoiling your journey you are doing that already said i keeping me here talking about dogs and fairies you had better go home and get some salve to cure that place over your eye its catching cold youll be in so much snow on one side of the mans forehead there was a raw and staring wound as if from a recent and terrible blow faith then ill be going but its taking you wid me i will be and where will you take me why then to ryans castle little sas you do not speak the language very correctly said i it is not sas you should call metis sassanach and forthwith i accompanied the word with a speech full of flowers of irish rhetoric the man looked upon me for a moment fixedly then bending his head towards his breast he appeared to be undergoing a kind of convulsion which was accompanied by a sound something resembling laughter presently he looked at me and there was a broad grin on his features by my shoul its a thing of peace im thinking yebut now with a whisking sound came running down the road a hare it was nearly upon us before it perceived us suddenly stopping short however it sprang into the bog on the righthand side after it amain bounded the dog of peace followed by the man but not until he had nodded to me a farewell salutation in a few moments i lost sight of him amidst the snowflakes the weather was again clear and fine before i reached the place of detachment it was a little wooden barrack surrounded by a wall of the same material a sentinel stood at the gate i passed by him and entering the building found myself in a rude kind of guardroom several soldiers were lying asleep on a wooden couch at one end others lounged on benches by the side of a turf fire the tall sergeant stood before the fire holding a cooking utensil in his left hand on seeing me he made the military salutation is my brother here said i rather timidly dreading to hear that he was out perhaps for the day the ensign is in his room sir said bagg i am now preparing his meal which will presently be ready you will find the ensign above stairs and he pointed to a broken ladder which led to some place above and there i found himthe boy soldierin a kind of upper loft so low that i could touch with my hands the sooty rafters the floor was of rough boards through the joints of which you could see the gleam of the soldiers fire and occasionally discern their figures as they moved about in one corner was a camp bedstead by the side of which hung the childs sword gorget and sash a deal table stood in the proximity of the rusty grate where smoked and smouldered a pile of black turf from the boga deal table without a piece of baize to cover it yet fraught with things not devoid of interest a bible given by a mother the odyssey the greek odyssey a flute with broad silver keys crayons moreover and water colours and a sketch of a wild prospect near which though but half finished afforded ample proof of the excellence and skill of the boyish hand now occupied upon it ah he was a sweet being that boy soldier a plant of early promise bidding fair to become in after time all that is great good and admirable i have read of a remarkable welshman of whom it was said when the grave closed over him that he could frame a harp and play it build a ship and sail it compose an ode and set it to music a brave fellow that son of walesbut i had once a brother who could do more and better than this but the grave has closed over him as over the gallant welshman of yore there are now but two that remember himthe one who bore him and the being who was nurtured at the same breast he was taken and i was lefttruly the ways of providence are inscrutable you seem to be very comfortable john said i looking around the room and at the various objects which i have described above you have a good roof over your head and have all your things about you yes i am very comfortable george in many respects i am moreover independent and feel myself a man for the first time in my lifeindependent did i saythats not the word i am something much higher than that here am i not sixteen yet a person in authority like the centurion in the book there with twenty englishmen under me worth a whole legion of his men and that fine fellow bagg to wait upon me and take my orders oh these last six weeks have passed like hours of heaven but your time must frequently hang heavy on your hands this is a strange wild place and you must be very solitary i am never solitary i have as you see all my things about me and there is plenty of company below stairs not that i mix with the soldiers if i did goodbye to my authority but when i am alone i can hear all their discourse through the planks and i often laugh to myself at the funny things they say and have you any acquaintance here the very best much better than the colonel and the rest at their grand templemore i had never so many in my whole life before one has just left me a gentleman who lives at a distance across the bog he comes to talk with me about greek and the odyssey for he is a very learned man and understands the old irish and various other strange languages he has had a dispute with bagg on hearing his name he called him to him and after looking at him for some time with great curiosity said that he was sure he was a dane bagg however took the compliment in dudgeon and said that he was no more a dane than himself but a trueborn englishman and a sergeant of six years standing and what other acquaintance have you all kinds the whole neighbourhood cant make enough of me amongst others theres the clergyman of the parish and his family such a venerable old man such fine sons and daughters i am treated by them like a son and a brotheri might be always with them if i pleased theres one drawback however in going to see them theres a horrible creature in the house a kind of tutor whom they keep more from charity than anything else he is a papist and they say a priest you should see him scowl sometimes at my red coat for he hates the king and not unfrequently when the kings health is drunk curses him between his teeth i once got up to strike him but the youngest of the sisters who is thehandsomest caught my arm and pointed to her forehead and what does your duty consist of have you nothing else to do than pay visits and receive them we do what is required of us we guard this edifice perform our evolutions and help the excise i am frequently called up in the dead of night to go to some wild place or other in quest of an illicit still this last part of our duty is poor mean work i dont like it nor more does bagg though without it we should not see much active service for the neighbourhood is quiet save the poor creatures with their stills not a soul is stirring tis true theres jerry grant and who is jerry grant did you never hear of him thats strange the whole country is talking about him he is a kind of outlaw rebel or robber all three i dare say theres a hundred pounds offered for his head and where does he live his proper home they say is in the queens county where he has a band but he is a strange fellow fond of wandering about by himself amidst the bogs and mountains and living in the old castles occasionally he quarters himself in the peasants houses who let him do just what he pleases he is free of his money and often does them good turns and can be goodhumoured enough so they dont dislike him then he is what they call a fairy man a person in league with fairies and spirits and able to work much harm by supernatural means on which account they hold him in great awe he is moreover a mighty strong and tall fellow bagg has seen him has he yes and felt him he too is a strange one a few days ago he was told that grant had been seen hovering about an old castle some two miles off in the bog so one afternoon what does he do but without saying a word to mefor which by the bye i ought to put him under arrest though what i should do without bagg i have no idea whateverwhat does he do but walk off to the castle intending as i suppose to pay a visit to jerry he had some difficulty in getting there on account of the turfholes in the bog which he was not accustomed to however thither at last he got and went in it was a strange lonesome place he says and he did not much like the look of it however in he went and searched about from the bottom to the top and down again but could find no one he shouted and hallooed but nobody answered save the rooks and choughs which started up in great numbers i have lost my trouble said bagg and left the castle it was now late in the afternoon near sunset when about half way over the bog he met a man and that man was jerry grant theres no doubt of it bagg says it was the most sudden thing in the world he was moving along making the best of his way thinking of nothing at all save a publichouse at swanton morley which he intends to take when he gets home and the regiment is disbandedthough i hope that will not be for some time yet he had just leaped a turfhole and was moving on when at the distance of about six yards before him he saw a fellow coming straight towards him bagg says that he stopped short as suddenly as if he had heard the word halt when marching at double quick time it was quite a surprise he says and he cant imagine how the fellow was so close upon him before he was aware he was an immense tall fellowbagg thinks at least two inches taller than himselfvery well dressed in a blue coat and buff breeches for all the world like a squire when going out hunting bagg however saw at once that he had a roguish air and he was on his guard in a moment good evening to ye sodger says the fellow stepping close up to bagg and staring him in the face good evening to you sir i hope you are well says bagg you are looking after some one says the fellow just so sir says bagg and forthwith seized him by the collar the man laughed bagg says it was such a strange awkward laugh do you know whom you have got hold of sodger said he i believe i do sir said bagg and in that belief will hold you fast in the name of king george and the quarter sessions the next moment he was sprawling with his heels in the air bagg says there was nothing remarkable in that he was only flung by a kind of wrestling trick which he could easily have baffled had he been aware of it you will not do that again sir said he as he got up and put himself on his guard the fellow laughed again more strangely and awkwardly than before then bending his body and moving his head from one side to the other as a cat does before she springs and crying out heres for ye sodger he made a dart at bagg rushing in with his head foremost that will do sir says bagg and drawing himself back he put in a lefthanded blow with all the force of his body and arm just over the fellows right eye bagg is a lefthanded hitter you must know and it was a blow of that kind which won him his famous battle at edinburgh with the big highland sergeant bagg says that he was quite satisfied with the blow more especially when he saw the fellow reel fling out his arms and fall to the ground and now sir said he ill make bold to hand you over to the quarter sessions and if there is a hundred pounds for taking you who has more right to it than myself so he went forward but ere he could lay hold of his man the other was again on his legs and was prepared to renew the combat they grappled each otherbagg says he had not much fear of the result as he now felt himself the best man the other seeming half stunned with the blowbut just then there came on a blast a horrible roaring wind bearing night upon its wings snow and sleet and hail bagg says he had the fellow by the throat quite fast as he thought but suddenly he became bewildered and knew notwhere he was and the man seemed to melt away from his grasp and the wind howled more and more and the night poured down darker and darker the snow and the sleet thicker and more blinding lord have mercy upon us said bagg myself a strange adventure that it is well that bagg got home alive john he says that the fight was a fair fight and that the fling he got was a fair fling the result of a common enough wrestling trick but with respect to the storm which rose up just in time to save the fellow he is of opinion that it was not fair but something irish and supernatural myself i dare say hes right i have read of witchcraft in the bible john he wishes much to have one more encounter with the fellow he says that on fair ground and in fine weather he has no doubt that he could master him and hand him over to the quarter sessions he says that a hundred pounds would be no bad thing to be disbanded upon for he wishes to take an inn at swanton morley keep a cockpit and live respectably myself he is quite right and now kiss me my darling brother for i must go back through the bog to templemorechapter xiii groom and cobstrength and symmetrywheres the saddlethe first rideno more fatiguelove for horses pursuit of wordsphilologist and pegasusthe smithwhat more agrahsassanach ten pence and it came to pass that as i was standing by the door of the barrack stable one of the grooms came out to me saying i say young gentleman i wish you would give the cob a breathing this fine morning why do you wish me to mount him said i you know he is dangerous i saw him fling you off his back only a few days ago why thats the very thing master id rather see anybody on his back than myself he does not like me but to them he does he can be as gentle as a lamb but suppose said i that he should not like me we shall soon see that master said the groom and if so be he shows temper i will be the first to tell you to get down but theres no fear of that you have never angered or insulted him and to such as you i say again hell be as gentle as a lamb and how came you to insult him said i knowing his temper as you do merely through forgetfulness master i was riding him about a month ago and having a stick in my hand i struck him thinking i was on another horse or rather thinking of nothing at all he has never forgiven me though before that time he was the only friend i had in the world i should like to see you on him master i should soon be off him i cant ride then you are all right master theres no fear trust him for not hurting a young gentleman an officers son who cant ride if you were a blackguard dragoon indeed with long spurs twere another thing as it is hell treat you as if he were the elder brother that loves you ride hell soon teach you to ride if you leave the matter with him hes the best riding master in all ireland and the gentlest the cob was led forth what a tremendous creature i had frequently seen him before and wondered at him he was barely fifteen hands but he had the girth of a metropolitan drayhorse his head was small in comparison with his immense neck which curved down nobly to his wide back his chest was broad and fine and his shoulders models of symmetry and strength he stood well and powerfully upon his legs which were somewhat short in a word he was a gallant specimen of the genuine irish cob a species at one time not uncommon but at the present day nearly extinct there said the groom as he looked at him half admiringly half sorrowfully with sixteen stone on his back hell trot fourteen miles in one hour with your nine stone some two and a half more ay and clear a sixfoot wall at the end of it im half afraid said i i had rather you would ride him id rather so too if he would let me but he remembers the blow now dont be afraid young master hes longing to go out himself hes been trampling with his feet these three days and i know what that means hell let anybody ride him but myself and thank them but to me he says no you struck me but said i wheres the saddle never mind the saddle if you are ever to be a frank rider you must begin without a saddle besides if he felt a saddle he would think you dont trust him and leave you to yourself now before you mount make his acquaintancesee there how he kisses you and licks your face and see how he lifts his foot thats to shake hands you may trust him now you are on his back at last mind how you hold the bridlegently gently its not four pair of hands like yours can hold him if he wishes to be off mind what i tell youleave it all to him off went the cob at a slow and gentle trot too fast and rough however for so inexperienced a rider i soon felt myself sliding off the animal perceived it too and instantly stood stone still till i had righted myself and now the groom came up when you feel yourself going said he dont lay hold of the mane thats no use mane never yet saved man from falling no more than straw from drowning its his sides you must cling to with your calves and feet till you learn to balance yourself thats it now abroad with you ill bet my comrade a pot of beer that youll be a regular rough rider by the time you come back and so it proved i followed the directions of the groom and the cob gave me every assistance how easy is riding afterthe first timidity is got over to supple and youthful limbs and there is no second fear the creature soon found that the nerves of his rider were in proper tone turning his head half round he made a kind of whining noise flung out a little foam and set off in less than two hours i had made the circuit of the devils mountain and was returning along the road bathed with perspiration but screaming with delight the cob laughing in his equine way scattering foam and pebbles to the left and right and trotting at the rate of sixteen miles an hour oh that ride that first ridemost truly it was an epoch in my existence and i still look back to it with feelings of longing and regret people may talk of first loveit is a very agreeable event i dare saybut give me the flush and triumph and glorious sweat of a first ride like mine on the mighty cob my whole frame was shaken it is true and during one long week i could hardly move foot or hand but what of that by that one trial i had become free as i may say of the whole equine species no more fatigue no more stiffness of joints after that first ride round the devils hill on the cob oh that cob that irish cobmay the sod lie lightly over the bones of the strongest speediest and most gallant of its kind oh the days when issuing from the barrackgate of templemore we commenced our hurryskurry just as inclination lednow across the fieldsdirect over stone walls and running brooksmere pastime for the cob sometimes along the road to thurles and holy cross even to distant cahirwhat was distance to the cob it was thus that the passion for the equine race was first awakened within mea passion which up to the present time has been rather on the increase than diminishing it is no blind passion the horse being a noble and generous creature intended by the allwise to be the helper and friend of man to whom he stands next in the order of creation on many occasions of my life i have been much indebted to the horse and have found in him a friend and coadjutor when human help and sympathy were not to be obtained it is therefore natural enough that i should love the horse but the love which i entertain for him has always been blended with respect for i soon perceived that though disposed to be the friend and helper of man he is by no means inclined to be his slave in which respect he differs from the dog who will crouch when beaten whereas the horse spurns for he is aware of his own worth and that he carries death within the horn of his heel if therefore i found it easy to love the horse i found it equally natural to respect him i much question whether philology or the passion for languages requires so little of an apology as the love for horses it has been said i believe that the more languages a man speaks the more a man is he which is very true provided he acquires languages as a medium for becoming acquainted with the thoughts and feelings of the various sections into which the human race is divided but in that case he should rather be termed a philosopher than a philologistbetween which two the difference is wide indeed an individual may speak and read a dozen languages and yet be an exceedingly poor creature scarcely half a man and the pursuit of tongues for their own sake and the mere satisfaction of acquiring them surely argues an intellect of a very low order a mind disposed to be satisfied with mean and grovelling things taking more pleasure in the trumpery casket than in the precious treasure which it contains in the pursuit of words than in the acquisition of ideas i cannot help thinking that it was fortunate for myself who am to a certain extent a philologist that with me the pursuit of languages has been always modified by the love of horses for scarcely had i turned my mind to the former when i also mounted the wild cob and hurried forth in the direction of the devils hill scattering dust and flintstones on every side that ride amongst other things taught me that a lad with thews and sinews was intended by nature for something better than mere wordculling and if i have accomplished anything in after life worthy of mentioning i believe it may partly be attributed to the ideas which that ride by setting my blood in a glow infused into my brain i might otherwise have become a mere philologist one of those beings who toil night and day in culling useless words for some opus magnum which murray will never publish and nobody ever read beings without enthusiasm who having never mounted a generous steed cannot detect a good point in pegasus himself like a certain philologist who though acquainted with the exact value of every word in the greek and latin languages could observe no particular beauty in one of the most glorious of homers rhapsodies what knew he of pegasus he had never mounted a generous steed the merest jockey had the strain been interpreted to him would have called it a brave songi return to the brave cob on a certain day i had been out on an excursion in a crossroad at some distance from the satanic hill the animal which i rode cast a shoe by good luck a small village was at hand at the entrance of which was a large shed from which proceeded a most furious noise of hammering leading the cob by the bridle i entered boldly shoe this horse and do it quickly a gough said i to a wild grimy figure of a man whom i found alone fashioning a piece of iron arrigod yuit said the fellow desisting from his work and staring at me oh yes i have money said i and of the best and i pulled out an english shilling tabhair chugam said the smith stretching out his grimy hand no i shant said i some people are glad to get their money when their work is donethe fellow hammered a little longer and then proceeded to shoe the cob after having first surveyed it with attention he performed his job rather roughly and more than once appeared to give the animal unnecessary pain frequently making use of loud and boisterous words by the time the work was done the creature was in a state of high excitement and plunged and tore the smith stood at a short distance seeming to enjoy the irritation of the animal and showing in a remarkable manner a huge fang which projected from the under jaw of a very wry mouth you deserve better handling said i as i went up to the cob and fondled it whereupon it whinnied and attempted to touch my face with its nose are ye not afraid of that beast said the smith showing his fang arrah its vicious that he looks its at you theni dont fear him and thereupon i passed under the horse between its hind legs and is that all you can do agrah said the smith no said i i can ride him ye can ride him and what else agrah i can leap him over a sixfoot wall said i over a wall and what more agrah nothing more said i what more would you have can you do this agrah said the smith and he uttered a word which i had never heard before in a sharp pungent tone the effect upon myself was somewhat extraordinary a strange thrill ran through me but with regard to the cob it was terrible the animal forthwith became like one mad and reared and kicked with the utmost desperation can you do that agrah said the smith what is it said i retreating i never saw the horse so before go between his legs agrah said the smith his hinder legs and he again showed his fang i dare not said i he would kill me he would kill ye and how do ye know that agrah i feel he would said i something tells me so and it tells ye truth agrah but its a fine beast and its a pity to see him in such a state is agam ant leigeasand here he uttered another word in a voice singularly modified but sweet and almost plaintive the effect of it was as instantaneous as that of the other but how differentthe animal lost all its fury and became at once calm and gentle the smith went up to it coaxed and patted it making use of various sounds of equal endearment then turning to me and holding out once more the grimy hand he said and now ye will be giving me the sassanach ten pence agrahchapter xiv a fine old citynorman masterworklollards holegood bloodthe

priest from the wild scenes which i have attempted to describe in the latter pages i must now transport the reader to others of a widely different character he must suppose himself no longer in ireland but in the eastern corner of merry england bogs ruins and mountains have disappeared amidst the vapours of the west i have nothing more to say of them the region in which we are now is not famous for objects of that kind perhaps it flatters itself that it can produce fairer and better things of some of which let me speak there is a fine old city before us and first of that let me speak a fine old city truly is that view it from whatever side you will but it shows best from the east where the ground bold and elevated overlooks the fair and fertile valley in which it stands gazing from those heights the eye beholds a scene which cannot fail to awaken even in the least sensitive bosom feelings of pleasure and admiration at the foot of the heights flows a narrow and deep river with an antique bridge communicating with a long and narrow suburb flanked on either side by rich meadows of the brightest green beyond which spreads the city the fine old city perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old english town yes there it spreads from north to south with its venerable houses its numerous gardens its thrice twelve churches its mighty mound which if tradition speaks true was raised by human hands to serve as the grave heap of an old heathen king who sits deep within it with his sword in his hand and his gold and silver treasures about him there is a grey old castle a upon the top of that mighty mound and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil from among those noble forest trees behold that old norman masterwork b that cloudencircled cathedral spire around which a garrulous army of rooks and choughs continually wheel their flight now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud of her and offer up prayers for her prosperity i myself who was not born within her walls offer up prayers for her prosperity that want may never visit her cottages vice her palaces and that the abomination of idolatry may never pollute her temples ha idolatry the reign of idolatry has been over there for many a long year never more let us hope to return brave hearts in that old town have borne witness against it and sealed their testimony with their hearts bloodmost precious to the lord is the blood of his saints we are not far from hallowed ground observe ye not yon chalky precipice to the right of the norman bridge on this side of the stream upon its brow is a piece of ruined wall the last relic of what was of old a stately pile whilst at its foot is a place called the lollards hole and with good reason for many a saint of god has breathed his last beneath that white precipice bearing witness against popish idolatry midst flame and pitch many a grisly procession has advanced along that suburb across the old bridge towards the lollards hole furious priests in front a calm pale martyr in the midst a pitying multitude behind it has had its martyrs the venerable old town ah there is good blood in that old city and in the whole circumjacent region of which it is the capital the angles possessed the land at an early period which however they were eventually compelled to share with hordes of danes and northmen who flocked thither across the sea to found hearthsteads on its fertile soil the present race a mixture of angles and danes still preserve much which speaks strongly of their northern ancestry amongst them ye will find the light brown hair of the north the strong and burly forms of the north many a wild superstition ay and many a wild name connected with the ancient history of the north and its sublime mythology the warm heart and the strong heart of the old danes and saxons still beats in those regions and there ye will find if anywhere old northern hospitality and kindness of manner united with energy perseverance and dauntless intrepidity better soldiers or mariners never bled in their countrys battles than those nurtured in those regions and within those old walls it was yonder to the west that the great naval hero of britain first saw the light he who annihilated the sea pride of spain and dragged the humbled banner of france in triumph at his stern he was born yonder towards the west and of him there is a glorious relic in that old town in its dark flint guildhouse the roof of which you can just descry rising above that maze of buildings in the upper hall of justice is a species of glass shrine in which the relic is to be seen a sword of curious workmanship the blade is of keen toledan steel the heft of ivory and motherofpearl tis the sword of cordova won in bloodiest fray off saint vincents promontory and presented by nelson to the old capital of the muchloved land of his birth yes the proud spaniards sword is to be seen in yonder guildhouse in the glass case affixed to the wall many other relics has the good old town but none prouder than the spaniards sword such was the place to which when the war was over my father retired it was here that the old tired soldier set himself down with his little family he had passed the greater part of his life in meritorious exertion in the service of his country and his chief wish now was to spend the remainder of his days in quiet and respectability his means it is true were not very ample fortunate it was that his desires corresponded with them with a small fortune of his own and with his halfpay as a royal soldier he had no fears for himself or for his faithful partner and helpmate but then his children how was he to provide for them how launch them upon the wide ocean of the world this was perhaps the only thought which gave him uneasiness and i believe that many an old retired officer at that time and under similar circumstances experienced similar anxiety had the war continued their children would have been of course provided for in the army but peace now reigned and the military career was closed to all save the scions of the aristocracy or those who were insome degree connected with that privileged order an advantage which few of these old officers could boast of they had slight influence with the great who gave themselves very little trouble either about them or their families i have been writing to the duke said my father one day to my excellent mother after we had been at home somewhat better than a year i have been writing to the duke of york about a commission for that eldest boy of ours he however affords me no hopes he says that his list is crammed with names and that the greater number of the candidates have better claims than my son i do not see how that can be said my mother nor do i replied my father i see the sons of bankers and merchants gazetted every month and i do not see what claims they have to urge unless they be golden ones however i have not served my king fifty years to turn grumbler at this time of life i suppose that the people at the head of affairs know what is most proper and convenient perhaps when the lad sees how difficult nay how impossible it is that he should enter the army he will turn his mind to some other profession i wish he may i think he has already said my mother you see how fond he is of the arts of drawing and painting and as far as i can judge what he has already done is very respectable his mind seems quite turned that way and i heard him say the other day that he would sooner be a michael angelo than a general officer but you are always talking of him what do you think of doing with the other child what indeed said my father that is a consideration which gives me no little uneasiness i am afraid it will be much more difficult to settle him in life than his brother what is he fitted for even were it in my power to provide for him god help the child i bear him no ill will on the contrary all love and affection but i cannot shut my eyes there is something so strange about him how he behaved in ireland i sent him to school to learn greek and he picked up irish and greek as well said my mother i heard him say the other day that he could read st john in the original tongue you will find excuses for him i know said my father you tell me i am always talking of my firstborn i might retort by saying you are always thinking of the other but it is the way of women always to side with the secondborn theres whats her name in the bible by whose wiles the old blind man was induced to give to his second son the blessing which was the birthright of the other i wish i had been in his place i should not have been so easily deceived no disguise would ever have caused me to mistake an impostor for my firstborn though i must say for this boy that he is nothing like jacob he is neither smooth nor sleek and though my secondborn is already taller and larger than his brother just so said my mother his brother would make a far better jacob than he i will hear nothing against my firstborn said my father even in the way of insinuation he is my joy and pride the very image of myself in my youthful days long before i fought big ben though perhaps not quite so tall or strong built as for the other god bless the child i love him im sure but i must be blind not to see the difference between him and his brother why he has neither my hair nor my eyes and then his countenance why tis absolutely swarthy god forgive me i had almost said like that of a gypsy but i have nothing to say against that the boy is not to be blamed for the colour of his face nor for his hair and eyes but then his ways and mannersi confess i do not like them and that they give me no little uneasinessi know that he kept very strange company when he was in ireland people of evil report of whom terrible things were saidhorsewitches and the like i questioned him once or twice upon the matter and even threatened him but it was of no use he put on a look as if he did not understand me a regular irish look just such a one as those rascals assume when they wish to appear all innocence and simplicity and they full of malice and deceit all the time i dont like them they are no friends to old england or its old king god bless him they are not good subjects and never were always in league with foreign enemies when i was in the coldstream long before the revolution i used to hear enough about the irish brigades kept by the french kings to be a thorn in the side of the english whenever opportunity served old sergeant meredith once told me that in the time of the pretender there were always in london alone a dozen of fellows connected with these brigades with the view of seducing the kings soldiers from their allegiance and persuading them to desert to france to join the honest irish as they were called one of these traitors once accosted him and proposed the matter to him offering handfuls of gold if he could induce any of his comrades to go over meredith appeared to consent but secretly gave information to his colonel the fellow was seized and certain traitorous papers found upon him he was hanged before newgate and died exulting in his treason his name was michael nowlan that ever son of mine should have been intimate with the papist irish and have learnt their language but he thinks of other things now said my mother other languages you mean said my father it is strange that he has conceived such a zest for the study of languages no sooner did he come home than he persuaded me to send him to that old priest to learn french and italian and if i remember right you abetted him but as i said before it is in the nature of women invariably to take the part of the secondborn well there is no harm in learning french and italian perhaps much good in his case as they may drive theother tongue out of his head irish why he might go to the university but for that but how would he look when on being examined with respect to his attainments it was discovered that he understood irish how did you learn it they would ask him how did you become acquainted with the language of papists and rebels the boy would be sent away in disgrace be under no apprehension i have no doubt that he has long since forgotten it i am glad to hear it said my father for between ourselves i love the poor child ay quite as well as my firstborn i trust they will do well and that god will be their shield and guide i have no doubt he will for i have read something in the bible to that effect what is that text about the young ravens being fed i know a better than that said my mother one of davids own words i have been young and now am grown old yet never have i seen the righteous man forsaken or his seed begging their bread i have heard talk of the pleasures of idleness yet it is my own firm belief that no one ever yet took pleasure in it mere idleness is the most disagreeable state of existence and both mind and body are continually making efforts to escape from it it has been said that idleness is the parent of mischief which is very true but mischief itself is merely an attempt to escape from the dreary vacuum of idleness there are many tasks and occupations which a man is unwilling to perform but let no one think that he is therefore in love with idleness he turns to something which is more agreeable to his inclination and doubtless more suited to his nature but he is not in love with idleness a boy may play the truant from school because he dislikes books and study but depend upon it he intends doing something the whileto go fishing or perhaps to take a walk and who knows but that from such excursions both his mind and body may derive more benefit than from books and school many people go to sleep to escape from idleness the spaniards do and according to the french account john bull the squire hangs himself in the month of november but the french who are a very sensible people attribute the action à une grande envie de se désennuyer he wishes to be doing something say they and having nothing better to do he has recourse to the cord it was for want of something better to do that shortly after my return home i applied myself to the study of languages by the acquisition of irish with the first elements of which i had become acquainted under the tuition of murtagh i had contracted a certain zest and inclination for the pursuit yet it is probable that had i been launched about this time into some agreeable career that of arms for example for which being the son of a soldier i had as was natural a sort of penchant i might have thought nothing more of the acquisition of tongues of any kind but having nothing to do i followed the only course suited to my genius which appeared open to me so it came to pass that one day whilst wandering listlessly about the streets of the old town i came to a small bookstall and stopping commenced turning over the books i took up at least a dozen and almost instantly flung them down what were they to me at last coming to a thick volume i opened it and after inspecting its contents for a few minutes i paid for it what was demanded and forthwith carried it home it was a tessaraglot grammar a strange old book printed somewhere in holland which pretended to be an easy guide to the acquirement of the french italian low dutch and english tongues by means of which any one conversant in any one of these languages could make himself master of the other three i turned my attention to the french and italian the old book was not of much value i derived some benefit from it however and conning it intensely at the end of a few weeks obtained some insight into the structure of these two languages at length i had learnt all that the book was capable of informing me yet was still far from the goal to which it had promised to conduct me i wish i had a master i exclaimed and the master was at hand in an old court of the old town lived a certain elderly personage perhaps sixty or thereabouts he was rather tall and something of a robust make with a countenance in which bluffness was singularly blended with vivacity and grimace and with a complexion which would have been ruddy but for a yellow hue which rather predominated his dress consisted of a snuffcoloured coat and drab pantaloons the former evidently seldom subjected to the annoyance of a brush and the latter exhibiting here and there spots of something which if not grease bore a strong resemblance to it add to these articles an immense frill seldom of the purest white but invariably of the finest french cambric and you have some idea of his dress he had rather a remarkable stoop but his step was rapid and vigorous and as he hurried along the streets he would glance to the right and left with a pair of big eyes like plums and on recognising any one would exalt a pair of grizzled eyebrows and slightly kiss a tawny and ungloved hand at certain hours of the day he might be seen entering the doors of female boardingschools generally with a book in his hand and perhaps another just peering from the orifice of a capacious back pocket and at a certain season of the year he might be seen dressed in white before the altar of a certain small popish chapel chanting from the breviary in very intelligible latin or perhaps reading from the desk in utterly unintelligible english such was my preceptor in the french and italian tongues exul sacerdos vone banished priest i came into england twentyfive year ago my dear chapter xv monsieur dantecondemned musketsportingsweet rivuletthe earls homethe poolthe sonorous voice what dost thou readman of peacezohar and mishnamoneychangers so i studied french and italian under the tuition of the banished priest to whose house i went regularly every evening to receive instruction i made considerable progress in the acquisition of the two languages i found the french by far the most difficult chiefly on account of the accent which my master himself possessed in no great purity being a norman by birth the italian was my favourite vous serez un jour un grand philologue mon cher said the old man on our arriving at the conclusion of dantes hell i hope i shall be something better said i before i die or i shall have lived to little purpose thats true my dear philologistone small poor dog what would you wish to be many things sooner than that for example i would rather be like him who wrote this book quoi monsieur dante he was a vagabond my dear forced to fly from his country no my dear if you would be like one poet be like monsieur boileau he is the poet i dont think so how not think so he wrote very respectable verses lived and died much respected by everybody tother one bad dog forced to fly from his countrydied with not enough to pay his undertaker were you not forced to flee from your country that very true but there is much difference between me and this dante he fled from country because he had one bad tongue which he shook at his betters i fly because benefice gone and head going not on account of the badness of my tongue well said i you can return now the bourbons are restored i find myself very well here not bad country il est vrai que la france sera toujours la france but all are dead there who knew me i find myself very well here preach in popish chapel teach schismatic that is protestant child tongues and literature i find myself very well and why because i know how to govern my tongue never call people hard names ma foi il y a beaucoup de différence entre moi et ce sacre de dante under this old man who was well versed in the southern languages besides studying french and italian i acquired some knowledge of spanish but i did not devote my time entirely to philology i had other pursuits i had not forgotten the roving life i had led in former days nor its delights neither was i formed by nature to be a pallid indoor student no no i was fond of other and i say it boldly better things than study i had an attachment to the angle ay and to the gun likewise in our house was a condemned musket bearing somewhere on its lock in rather antique characters tower with this weapon i had already in ireland performed some execution among the rooks and choughs and it was now again destined to be a source of solace and amusement to me in the winter season especially on occasions of severe frost when birds abounded sallying forth with it at these times far into the country i seldom returned at night without a string of bullfinches blackbirds and linnets hanging in triumph round my neck when i reflect on the immense quantity of powder and shot which i crammed down the muzzle of my uncouth fowlingpiece i am less surprised at the number of birds which i slaughtered than that i never blew my hands face and old honeycombed gun at one and the same time to pieces but the winter alas i speak as a fowler seldom lasts in england more than three or four months so during the rest of the year when not occupied with my philological studies i had to seek for other diversions i have already given a hint that i was also addicted to the angle of course there is no comparison between the two pursuits the rod and line seeming but very poor trumpery to one who has had the honour of carrying a noble firelock there is a time however for all things and we return to any favourite amusement with the greater zest from being compelled to relinquish it for a season so if i shot birds in winter with my firelock i caught fish in summer or attempted so to do with my angle i was not quite so successful it is true with the latter as with the former possibly because it afforded me less pleasure it was indeed too much of a listless pastime to inspire me with any great interest i not unfrequently fell into a doze whilst sitting on the bank and more than once let my rod drop from my hands into the water at some distance from the city behind a range of hilly ground which rises towards the southwest is a small river the waters of which after many meanderings eventually enter the principal river of the district and assist to swell thetide which it rolls down to the ocean it is a sweet rivulet and pleasant is it to trace its course from its springhead high up in the remote regions of eastern anglia till it arrives in the valley behind yon rising ground and pleasant is that valley truly a goodly spot but most lovely where yonder bridge crosses the little stream beneath its arch the waters rush garrulously into a blue pool and are there stilled for a time for the pool is deep and they appear to have sunk to sleep farther on however you hear their voice again where they ripple gaily over yon gravelly shallow on the left the hill slopes gently down to the margin of the stream on the right is a green level a smiling meadow grass of the richest decks the side of the slope mighty trees also adorn it giant elms the nearest of which when the sun is nigh its meridian fling a broad shadow upon the face of the pool through yon vista you catch a glimpse of the ancient brick of an old english hall it has a stately look that old building indistinctly seen as it is among those umbrageous trees you might almost suppose it an earls home and such it was or rather upon its site stood an earls home in days of old for there some old kemp some sigurd or thorkild roaming in quest of a hearthstead settled down in the grey old time when thor and freya were yet gods and odin was a portentous name yon old hall is still called the earls home though the hearth of sigurd is now no more and the bones of the old kemp and of sigrith his dame have been mouldering for a thousand years in some neighbouring knoll perhaps yonder where those tall norwegian pines shoot up so boldly into the air it is said that the old earls galley was once moored where is now that blue pool for the waters of that valley were not always sweet yon valley was once an arm of the sea a salt lagoon to which the warbarks of sigurd in search of a home found their way i was in the habit of spending many an hour on the banks of that rivulet with my rod in my hand and when tired with angling would stretch myself on the grass and gaze upon the waters as they glided past and not unfrequently divesting myself of my dress i would plunge into the deep pool which i have already mentioned for i had long since learned to swim and it came to pass that on one hot summers day after bathing in the pool i passed along the meadow till i came to a shallow part and wading over to the opposite side i adjusted my dress and commenced fishing in another pool beside which was a small clump of hazels and there i sat upon the bank at the bottom of the hill which slopes down from the earls home my float was on the waters and my back was towards the old hall i drew up many fish small and great which i took from off the hook mechanically and flung upon the bank for i was almost unconscious of what i was about for my mind was not with my fish i was thinking of my earlier yearsof the scottish crags and the heaths of irelandand sometimes my mind would dwell on my studieson the sonorous stanzas of dante rising and falling like the waves of the seaor would strive to remember a couplet or two of poor monsieur boileau canst thou answer to thy conscience for pulling all those fish out of the water and leaving them to gasp in the sun said a voice clear and sonorous as a bell i started and looked round close behind me stood the tall figure of a man dressed in raiment of quaint and singular fashion but of goodly materials he was in the prime and vigour of manhood his features handsome and noble but full of calmness and benevolence at least i thought so though they were somewhat shaded by a hat of finest beaver with broad drooping eaves surely that is a very cruel diversion in which thou indulgest my young friend he continued i am sorry for it if it be sir said i rising but i do not think it cruel to fish what are thy reasons for not thinking so fishing is mentioned frequently in scripture simon peter was a fisherman true and andrew and his brother but thou forgettest they did not follow fishing as a diversion as i fear thou doest thou readest the scriptures sometimes sometimesnot dailythat is to be regretted what profession dost thou makei mean to what religious denomination dost thou belong my young friend church it is a very good professionthere is much of scripture contained in its liturgy dost thou read aught besides the scriptures sometimes what dost thou read besidesgreek and dante indeed then thou hast the advantage over myself i can only read the former well i am rejoiced to find that thou hast other pursuits beside thy fishing dost thou know hebrew no thou shouldst study it why dost thou not undertake the study i have no books i will lend thee books if thou wish to undertake the study i live yonder at the hall as perhaps thou knowest i have a library there in which are many curious books both in greek and hebrew which i will show to thee whenever thou mayest find it convenient to come and see me farewell i am glad to find that thou hast pursuits more satisfactory than thy cruel fishing and the man of peace departed and left me on the bank of the stream whether from the effect of his words or from want of inclination to the sport i know not but from that day i became less and less a practitioner of that cruel fishing i rarely flung line and angle into the water but i not unfrequently wandered by the banks of the pleasant rivulet it seems singular to me on reflection that i never availed myself of his kind invitation i say singular for the extraordinary under whatever form had long had no slight interest for me and i had discernment enough to perceive that yon was no common man yet i went not near him certainly not from bashfulness or timidity feelings to which i had long been an entire stranger am i to regret this perhaps for i might have learned both wisdom and righteousness from those calm quiet lips and my aftercourse might have been widely different as it was i fell in with other guess companions from whom i received widely different impressions than those i might have derived from him when many years had rolled on long after i had attained manhood and had seen and suffered much and when our first interview had long since been effaced from the mind of the man of peace i visited him in his venerable hall and partook of the hospitality of his hearth and there i saw his gentle partner and his fair children and on the morrow he showed me the books of which he had spoken years before by the side of the stream in the low quiet chamber whose one window shaded by a gigantic elm looks down the slope towards the pleasant stream he took from the shelf his learned books zohar and mishna toldoth jesu and abarbenel i am fond of these studies said he which perhaps is not to be wondered at seeing that our people have been compared to the jews in one respect i confess we are similar to them we are fond of getting money i do not like this last author this abarbenel the worse for having been a moneychanger i am a banker myself as thou knowest and would there were many like him amidst the moneychangers of princes the hall of many an earl lacks the bounty the palace of many a prelate the piety and learning which adorn the quiet quakers homechapter xvi fair of horseslooks of respectthe fast trotterpair of eyesstrange menjasper your palforce of blood young lady with diamondsnot quite so beautiful i was standing on the castle hill in the midst of a fair of horses i have already had occasion to mention this castle it is the remains of what was once a norman stronghold and is perched upon a round mound or monticle in the midst of the old city steep is this mound and scarped evidently by the hand of man a deep gorge over which is flung a bridge separates it on the south from a broad swell of open ground called the hill of old the scene of many a tournament and feat of norman chivalry but now much used as a showplace for cattle where those who buy and sell beeves and other beasts resort at stated periods so it came to pass that i stood upon this hill observing a fair of horses the reader is already aware that i had long since conceived a passion for the equine race a passion in which circumstances had of late not permitted me to indulge i had no horses to ride but i took pleasure in looking at them and i had already attended more than one of these fairs the present was lively enough indeed horse fairs are seldom dull there was shouting and whooping neighing and braying there was galloping and trotting fellows with highlows and white stockings and with many a string dangling from the knees of their tight breeches were running desperately holding horses by the halter and in some cases dragging them along there were longtailed steeds and docktailed steeds of every degree and breed there were droves of wild ponies and long rows of sober cart horses there were donkeys and even mules the last rare things to be seen in damp misty england for the mule pines in mud and rain and thrives best with a hot sun above and a burning sand below there wereoh the gallant creatures i hear their neigh upon the wind there weregoodliest sight of allcertain enormous quadrupeds only seen to perfection in our native isle led about by dapper grooms their manes ribanded and their tails curiously clubbed and balled ha hahow distinctly do they say ha ha an old man draws nigh he is mounted on a lean pony and he leads by the bridle one of these animals nothing very remarkable about that creature unless in being smaller than the rest and gentle which they are not he is not of the sightliest look he is almost dun and over one eye a thick film has gathered but stay there is something remarkable about that horse there is something in his action in which he differs from all the rest as he advances the clamour is hushed all eyes are turned upon himwhat looks of interestof respectand what is this people are taking off their hatssurely not to that steed yes verily men especially old men are taking off their hats to that oneeyed steed and i hear more than one deepdrawn ah what horse is that said i to a very old fellow the counterpart of the old man on the pony save that the last wore a faded suit of velveteen and this one was dressed in a white frock the best in mother england said the very old man taking a knobbed stick from his mouth and looking me in the face at first carelessly but presently with something like interest he is old like myself but can still trot his twenty miles an hour you wont live long my swain tall and overgrown ones like thee never does yet if you should chance to reach my years you may boast to thy great grand boys thou hast seen marshland shales amain i did for the horse what i would neither do for earl or baron doffed my hat yes i doffed my hat to the wondrous horse the fast trotter the best in mother england and i too drew a deep ah and repeated the words of the old fellows around such a horse as this we shall never see again a pity that he is so old now during all this time i had a kind of consciousness that i had been the object of some persons observation that eyes were fastened upon me from somewhere in the crowd sometimes i thought myself watched from before sometimes from behind and occasionally methought that if i just turned my head to the right or left i should meet a peering and inquiring glance and indeed once or twice i did turn expecting to see somebody whom i knew yet always without success though it appeared to me that i was but a moment too late and that some one had just slipped away from the direction to which i turned like the figure in a magic lanthorn once i was quite sure that there were a pair of eyes glaring over my right shoulder my attention however was so fully occupied with the objects which i have attempted to describe that i thought very little of this coming and going this flitting and dodging of i knew not whom or what it was after all a matter of sheer indifference to me who was looking at me i could only wish whomsoever it might be to be more profitably employed so i continued enjoying what i saw and now there was a change in the scene the wondrous old horse departed with his aged guardian other objects of interest are at hand two or three men on horseback are hurrying through the crowd they are widely different in their appearance from the other people of the fair not so much in dress for they are clad something after the fashion of rustic jockeys but in their lookno light brown hair have they no ruddy cheeks no blue quiet glances belong to them their features are dark their locks long black and shining and their eyes are wild they are admirable horsemen but they do not sit the saddle in the manner of common jockeys they seem tofloat or hover upon it like gulls upon the waves two of them are mere striplings but the third is a very tall man with a countenance heroically beautiful but wild wild wild as they rush along the crowd give way on all sides and now a kind of ring or circus is formed within which the strange men exhibit their horsemanship rushing past each other in and out after the manner of a reel the tall man occasionally balancing himself upon the saddle and standing erect on one foot he had just regained his seat after the latter feat and was about to push his horse to a gallop when a figure started forward close from beside me and laying his hand on his neck and pulling him gently downward appeared to whisper something into his ear presently the tall man raised his head and scanning the crowd for a moment in the direction in which i was standing fixed his eyes full upon me and anon the countenance of the whisperer was turned but only in part and the sideglance of another pair of wild eyes was directed towards my face but the entire visage of the big black man half stooping as he was was turned full upon mine but now with a nod to the figure who had stopped him and with another inquiring glance at myself the big man once more put his steed into motion and after riding round the ring a few more times darted through a lane in the crowd and followed by his two companions disappeared whereupon the figure who had whispered to him and had subsequently remained in the middle of the space came towards me and cracking a whip which he held in his hand so loudly that the report was nearly equal to that of a pocket pistol he cried in a strange tone what the sapengro lor the sapengro upon the hill i remember that word said i and i almost think i remember you you cant be jasper your pal truth and no lie brother it is strange that you should have known me said i i am certain but for the word you used i should never have recognised you not so strange as you may think brother there is something in your face which would prevent people from forgetting you even though they might wish it and your face is not much altered since the time you wot of though you are so much grown i thought it was you but to make sure i dodged about inspecting you i believe you felt me though i never touched you a sign brother that we are akin that we are dui palortwo relations your blood beat when mine was near as mine always does at the coming of a brother and we became brothers in that lane and where are you staying said i in this town not in the town the like of us dont find it exactly wholesome to stay in towns we keep abroad but i have little to do herecome with me and ill show you where we stay we descended the hill in the direction of the north and passing along the suburb reached the old norman bridge which we crossed the chalk precipice with the ruin on its top was now before us but turning to the left we walked swiftly along and presently came to some rising ground which ascending we found ourselves upon a wild moor or heath you are one of them said i whom people call just so said jasper but never mind what people call us and that tall handsome man on the hill whom you whispered i suppose hes one of ye what is his name tawno chikno said jasper which means the small one we call him such because he is the biggest man of all our nation you say he is handsome that is not the word brother hes the beauty of the world women run wild at the sight of tawno an earls daughter near londona fine young lady with diamonds round her neckfell in love with tawno i have seen that lass on a heath as this may be kneel down to tawno clasp his feet begging to be his wifeor anything elseif she might go with him but tawno would have nothing to do with her i have a wife of my own said he a lawful rommany wife whom i love better than the whole world jealous though she sometimes be and is she very beautiful said i why you know brother beauty is frequently a matter of taste however as you ask my opinion i should say not quite so beautiful as himself we had now arrived at a small valley between two hills or downs the sides of which were covered with furze in the midst of this valley were various carts and low tents forming a rude kind of encampment several dark children were playing about who took no manner of notice of us as we passed one of the tents however a canvas screen was lifted up and a woman supported upon a crutch hobbled out she was about the middle age and besides being lame was bitterly ugly she was very slovenly dressed and on her swarthy features ill nature was most visibly stamped she did not deign me a look but addressing jasper in a tongue which i did not understand appeared to put some eager questionsto him hes coming said jasper and passed on poor fellow said he to me he has scarcely been gone an hour and shes jealous already well he continued what do you think of her you have seen her now and can judge for yourselfthat ere woman is tawno chiknos wifechapter xvii the tentspleasant discoursei am pharaohshifting for ones selfhorse

stood at a slight distance from the rest and which exactly resembled the one which i have described on a former occasion we went in and sat down one on each side of a small fire which was smouldering on the ground there was no one else in the tent but a tall tawny woman of middle age who was busily knitting brother said jasper i wish to hold some pleasant discourse with you as much as you please said i provided you can find anything pleasant to talk about never fear said jasper and first of all we will talk of yourself where have you been all this long time here and there said i and far and near going about with the soldiers but there is no soldiering now so we have sat down father and family in the town there and do you still hunt snakes said jasper no said i i have given up that long ago i do better now read books and learn languages well i am sorry you have given up your snakehunting manys the strange talk i have had with our people about your snake and yourself and how you frightened my father and mother in the lane and where are your father and mother where i shall never see them brother at least i hope so not dead no not dead they are bitchadey pawdel whats that sent

sometimes he has but he is not so well off as myself when my father and mother were bitchadey pawdel which to tell you the truth they were for chiving wafodo dloovu a they left me all they had which was not a little and i became the head of our family which was not a small one i was not older than you when that happened yet our people said they had never a better krallis to contrive and plan for them and to keep them in order and this is so well known that many rommany chals b not of our family come and join themselves to us living with us for a time in order to better themselves more especially those of the poorer sort who have little of their own tawno is one of these is that fine fellow poor one of the poorest brother handsome as he is he has not a horse of his own to ride on perhaps we may put it down to his wife who cannot move about being a cripple as you saw and you are what is called a gypsy king ay ay a rommany kral are there other kings those who call themselves so

here they had their reasons brother and you are not english we are not gorgios c and you have a language of your own avali a this is wonderful ha ha cried the woman who had hitherto sat knitting at the farther end of the tent without saying a word though not inattentive to our conversation as i could perceive by certain glances which she occasionally cast upon us both ha ha she screamed fixing upon me two eyes which shone like burning coals and which were filled with an expression both of scorn and malignity it is wonderful is it that we should have a language of our own what you grudge the poor people the speech they talk among themselves thats just like you gorgios you would have everybody stupid singletongued idiots like yourselves we are taken before the poknees of the gav b myself and sister to give an account of ourselves so i says to my sisters little boy speaking rommany i says to the little boy who is with us run to my son jasper and the rest and tell them to be off there are hawks abroad so the poknees questions us and lets us go not being able to make anything of us but as we are going he calls us back good woman says the poknees what was that i heard you say just now to the little boy i was telling him your worship to go and see the time of day and to save trouble i said it in our language where did you get that language says the poknees tis our own language sir i tells him we did not steal it shall i tell you what it is my good woman says the poknees i would thank you sir says i for tis often we are asked about it well then says the poknees it is no language at all merely a madeup gibberish oh bless your wisdom says i with a curtsey you can tell us what our language is without understanding it another time we meet a parson good woman says he whats that you are talking is it broken language of course your reverence says i we are broken people give a shilling your reverence to the poor broken woman oh these gorgios they grudge us our very language she called you her son jasper i am her son brother i thought you said your parents were bitchadey pawdel you thought right brother this is my wifes mother then you are married jasper ay truly i am husband and father you will see wife and chabo a anon where are they now in the gav penning dukkerin b we were talking of language jasper true brother yours must be a rum one tis called rommany i would gladly know it you need it sorely would you teach it me none soonersuppose we begin now suppose we do brother not whilst i am here said the woman flinging her knitting down and starting upon her feet not whilst i am here shall this gorgio learn rommany a pretty manœuvre truly and what would be the end of it i goes to the farming ker a with my sister to tell a fortune and earn a few sixpences for the chabes i sees a jolly pig in the yard and i says to my sister speaking rommany do so and so says i which the farming man hearing asks what we are talking about nothing at all master says i something about the weather when who should start up from behind a pale where he has been listening but this ugly gorgio crying out they are after poisoning your pigs neighbour so that we are glad to run i and my sister with perhaps the farmengro shouting after us says my sister to me when we have got fairly off how came that ugly one to know what you said to me whereupon i answers it all comes of my son jasper who brings the gorgio to our fire and must needs be teaching him who was fool there says my sister who indeed but my son jasper i answers and here should i be a greater fool to sit still and suffer it which i will not do i do not like the look of him he looks overgorgious an ill day to the romans when he masters rommany and when i says that i pens a true dukkerin what do you call god jasper you had better be jawing b said the woman raising her voice to a terrible scream you had better be moving off my gorgio hang you for a keen one sitting there by the fire and stealing my language before my face do you know whom you have to deal with do you know that i am dangerous my name is herne and i comes of the hairy ones and a hairy one she looked she wore her hair clubbed upon her head fastened with many strings and ligatures but now tearing these off her locks originally jet black but now partially grizzled with age fell down on every side of her covering her face and back as far down as her knees no shebear of lapland ever looked more fierce and hairy than did that woman as standing in the open part of the tent with her head bent down and her shoulders drawn up seemingly about to precipitate herself upon me she repeated again and again my name is herne and i comes of the hairy ones i call god duvel brother it sounds very like devil it doth brother it doth and what do you call divine i mean godly oh i call that duvelskoe i am thinking of something jasper what are you thinking of brother would it not be a rum thing if divine and devilish were originally one and the same word it would brother it would from this time i had frequent interviews with jasper sometimes in his tent sometimes on the heath about which we would roam for hours discoursing on various matters sometimes mounted on one of his horses of which he had several i would accompany him to various fairs and markets in the neighbourhood to which he went on his own affairs or those of his tribe i soon found that i had become acquainted with a most singular people whose habits and pursuits awakened within me the highest interest of all connected with them however their language was doubtless that which exercised the greatest influence over my imagination i had at first some suspicion that it would prove a mere madeup gibberish but i was soon undeceived broken corrupted and half in ruins as it was it was not long before i found that it was an original speech far more so indeed than one or two others of high name and celebrity which up to that time i had been in the habit of regarding with respect and veneration indeed many obscure points connected with the vocabulary of these languages and to which neither classic nor modern lore afforded any clue i thought i could now clear up by means of this strange broken tongue spoken by people who dwelt amongst thickets and furze bushes in tents as tawny as their faces and whom the generality of mankind designated and with much semblance of justice as thieves and vagabonds but where did this speech come from and who were they who spoke it these were questions which i could not solve and which jasper himself when pressed confessed his inability to answer but whoever we be brother said he we are an old people and not what folks in general imagine broken gorgios and if we are not egyptians we are at any rate rommany chalsrommany chals i should not wonder after all said i that these people had something to do with the founding of rome rome it is said was built by vagabonds who knows but that some tribe of the kind settled down thereabouts and called the town which they built after their name but whence did they come originally ah there is the difficulty a but abandoning these questions which at that time were far too profound for me i went on studying the language and at the same time the characters and manners of these strange people my rapid progress in the former astonished while it delighted jasper well no longer call you sapengro brother said he but rather lavengro which in the language of the gorgios meaneth word master nay brother said tawno chikno with whom i had become very intimate you had better call him cooromengro b i have put on the gloves with him and find him a pure fist master i like him for that for i am a cooromengro myself and was born at brummagem i likes him for his modesty said mrs chikno i never hears any ill words come from his mouth but on the contrary much sweet language his talk is golden and he has taught my eldest to say his prayers in rommany which my rover had never the grace to do he is the pal of my rom a said mrs petulengro who was a very handsome woman and therefore i likes him and not the less for his being a rye b folks calls me highminded and perhaps i have reason to be so before i married pharaoh i had an offer from a lord i likes the young rye and if he chooses to follow us he shall have my sister what say you mother should not the young rye have my sister ursula i am going to my people said mrs herne placing a bundle upon a donkey which was her own peculiar property i am going to yorkshire for i can stand this no longer you say you like him in that we differs i hates the gorgio and would like speaking romanly to mix a little poison with his waters and now go to lundra c my children i goes to yorkshire take my blessing with ye and a little bit of a gillie d to cheer your hearts with when ye are weary in all kinds of weather have we lived together but now we are parted i goes brokenheartedi cant keep you company ye are no longer rommany to gain a bad brother ye have lost a good motherchapter xviii what professionnot fitted for a churchmanerratic coursethe bitter draughtprinciple of woethou wouldst be joyouswhat ails youpoor child of clay so the gypsies departed mrs herne to yorkshire and the rest to london as for myself i continued in the house of my parents passing my time in much the same manner as i have already described principally in philological pursuits but i was now sixteen and it was highly necessary that i should adopt some profession unless i intended to fritter away my existence and to be a useless burden to those who had given me birth but what profession was i to choose there being none in the wide world perhaps for which i was suited nor was there any one for which i felt any decided inclination though perhaps there existed within me a lurking penchant for the profession of arms which was natural enough as from my earliest infancy i had been accustomed to military sights and sounds but this profession was then closed as i have already hinted and as i believe it has since continued to those who like myself had no better claims to urge than the services of a father my father who for certain reasons of his own had no very high opinion of the advantages resulting from this career would have gladly seen me enter the church his desire was however considerably abated by one or two passages of my life which occurred to his recollection he particularly dwelt on the unheardof manner in which i had picked up the irish language and drew from thence the conclusion that i was not fitted by nature to cut a respectable figure at an english university he will fly off in a tangent said he and when called upon to exhibit his skill in greek will be found proficient in irish i have observed the poor lad attentively and really do not know what to make of him but i am afraid he will never make a churchman and i have no doubt that my excellent father was right both in his premises and the conclusion at which he arrived i had undoubtedly at one period of my life forsaken greek for irish and the instructions of a learned protestant divine for those of a papist gossoon the cardfancying murtagh and of late though i kept it a strict secret i had abandoned in a great measure the study of the beautiful italian and the recitation of the sonorous terzets of the divine comedy in which at one time i took the greatest delight in order to become acquainted with the broken speech and yet more broken songs of certain houseless wanderers whom i had met at a horse fair such an erratic course was certainly by no means in consonance with the sober and unvarying routine of college study and my father who was a man of excellent common sense displayed it in not pressing me to adopt a profession which required qualities of mind which he saw i did not possess other professions were talked of amongst which the law but now an event occurred which had nearly stopped my career and merged all minor points of solicitude in anxiety for my life my strength and appetite suddenly deserted me and i began to pine and droop some said that i had overgrown myself and that these were the symptoms of a rapid decline i grew worse and worse and was soon stretched upon my bed from which it seemed scarcely probable that i should ever more rise the physicians themselves giving but slight hopes of my recovery as for myself i made up my mind to die and felt quite resigned i was sadly ignorant at that time and when i thought of death it appeared to me little else than a pleasant sleep and i wished for sleep of which i got but little it was well that i did not die that time for i repeat that i was sadly ignorant of many important things i did not die for somebody coming gave me a strange bitter draught a decoction i believe of a bitter root which grows on commons and desolate places and the person who gave it me was an ancient female a kind of doctress who had been my nurse in my infancy and who hearing of my state had come to see me so i drank the draught and became a little better and i continued taking draughts made from the bitter root till i manifested symptoms of convalescence but how much more quickly does strength desert the human frame than return to it i had become convalescent it is true but my state of feebleness was truly pitiable i believe it is in that state that the most remarkable feature of human physiology frequently exhibits itself oh how dare i mention the dark feeling of mysterious dread which comes over the mind and which the lamp of reason though burning bright the while is unable to dispel art thou as leeches say the concomitant of diseasethe result of shattered nerves nay rather the principle of woe itself the fountainhead of all sorrow coexistent with man whose influence he feels when yet unborn and whose workings he testifies with his earliest cries when drowned in tears he first beholds the light for as the sparks fly upward so is man born to trouble and woe doth he bring with him into the world even thyself dark one terrible one causeless unbegotten without a father oh how unfrequently dost thou break down the barriers which divide thee from the poor soul of man and overcast its sunshine with thy gloomy shadow in the brightest days of prosperityin the midst of health and wealthhow sentient is the poor human creature of thy neighbourhood how instinctively aware that the floodgates of horror may be cast open and the dark stream engulf him for ever and ever then is it not lawful for man to exclaim better that i had never been born fool for thyself thou wast not born but to fulfil the inscrutable decrees of thy creator and how dost thou know that this dark principle is not after all thy best friend that it is not that which tempers the whole mass of thy corruption it may be for what thou knowest the mother of wisdom and of great works it is the dread of the horror of the night that makes the pilgrim hasten on his way when thou feelest it nigh let thy safety word be onward if thou tarry thou art overwhelmed courage build great workstis urging theeit is ever nearest the favourites of godthe fool knows little of it thou wouldst be joyous wouldst thou then be a fool what great work was ever the result of joy the puny onewho have been the wise ones the mighty ones the conquering ones of this earth the joyous i believe not the fool is happy or comparatively socertainly the least sorrowful but he is still a fool and whose notes are sweetest those of the nightingale or of the silly lark what ails you my child said a mother to her son as he lay on a couch under the influence of the dreadful one what ails you you seem afraid boy and so i am a dreadful fear is upon me mother but of what there is no one can harm you of what are you apprehensive boy of nothing that i can express i know not what i am afraid of but afraid i am mother perhaps you see sights and visions i knew a lady once who was continually thinking that she saw an armed man threaten her but it was only an imagination a phantom of the brain boy no armed man threatens me and tis not a thing like that would cause me any fear did an armed man threaten me i would get up and fight him weak as i am i would wish for nothing better for then perhaps i should lose this fear mine is a dread of i know not what and there the horror lies mother your forehead is cool and your speech collected do you know where you are boy i know where i am and i see things just as they are you are beside me and upon the table there is a book which was written by a florentine all this i see and that there is no ground for being afraid i am moreover quite cool and feel no painbut but and then there was a burst of gemiti

passmy dear old masterthe deal desklanguage of the tentswhere is morfyddgo toonly once it has been said by this or that writer i scarcely know by whom that in proportion as we grow old and our time becomes short the swifter does it pass until at last as we approach the borders of the grave it assumes all the speed and impetuosity of a river about to precipitate itself into an abyss this is doubtless the case provided we can carry to the grave those pleasant thoughts and delusions which alone render life agreeable and to which even to the very last we would gladly cling but what becomes of the swiftness of time when the mind sees the vanity of human pursuits which is sure to be the case when its fondest dearest hopes have been blighted at the very moment when the harvest was deemed secure what becomes from that moment i repeat of the shortness of time i put not the question to those who have never known that trialthey are satisfied with themselves and all around them with what they have done and yet hope to do some carry their delusions with them to the borders of the grave ay to the very moment when they fall into it a beautiful golden cloud surrounds them to the last and such talk of the shortness of time through the medium of that cloud the world has ever been a pleasant world to them their only regret is that they are so soon to quit it but oh ye dear deluded hearts it is not every one who is so fortunate to the generality of mankind there is no period like youth the generality are far from fortunate but the period of youth even to the least so offers moments of considerable happiness for they are not only disposed but able to enjoy most things within their reach with what trifles at that period are we content the things from which in afterlife we should turn away in disdain please us then for we are in the midst of a golden cloud and everything seems decked with a golden hue never during any portion of my life did time flow on more speedily than during the two or three years immediately succeeding the period to which we arrived in the preceding chapter since then it has flagged often enough sometimes it has seemed to stand entirely still and the reader may easily judge how it fares at the present from the circumstance of my taking pen in hand and endeavouring to write down the passages of my lifea last resource with most people but at the period to which i allude i was just as i may say entering upon life i had adopted a profession andto keep up my character simultaneously with that professionthe study of a new languagei speedily became a proficient in the one but ever remained a novice in the other a novice in the law but a perfect master in the welsh tongue yes very pleasant times were those when within the womb of a lofty deal desk behind which i sat for some eight hours every day transcribing when i imagined eyes were upon me documents of every description in every possible hand blackstone kept company with ab gwilymthe polished english lawyer of the last century who wrote long and prosy chapters on the rights of thingswith a certain wild welshman who some four hundred years before that time indited immortal cowydds and odes to the wives of cambrian chieftainsmore particularly to one morfydd the wife of a certain hunchbacked dignitary called by the poet facetiously bwa bachgenerally terminating with the modest request of a little private parlance beneath the green wood bough with no other witness than the eos or nightingale a request which if the poet himself may be believed rather a doubtful point was seldom very seldom denied and by what strange chance had ab gwilym and blackstone two personages so exceedingly different been thus brought together from what the reader already knows of me he may be quite prepared to find me reading the former but what could have induced me to take up blackstone or rather the law i have ever loved to be as explicit as possible on which account perhaps i never attained to any proficiency in the law the essence of which is said to be ambiguity most questions may be answered in a few words and this among the rest though connected with the law my parents deemed it necessary that i should adopt some profession they named the law the law was as agreeable to me as any other profession within my reach so i adopted the law and the consequence was that blackstone probably for the first time found himself in company with ab gwilym by adopting the law i had not ceased to be lavengro so i sat behind a desk many hours in the day ostensibly engaged in transcribing documents of various kinds the scene of my labours was a strange old house occupying one side of a long and narrow court into which however the greater number of the windows looked not but into an extensive garden filled with fruit trees in the rear of a large handsome house belonging to a highly respectable gentleman who moyennant un douceur considérable had consented to instruct my fathers youngest son in the mysteries of glorious english law ah would that i could describe the good gentleman in the manner which he deserves he has long since sunk to his place in a respectable vault in the aisle of a very respectable church whilst an exceedingly respectable marble slab against the neighbouring wall tells on a sunday some eye wandering from its prayerbook that his dust lies below to secure such respectabilities in death he passed a most respectable life let no one sneer he accomplished much his life was peaceful so was his death are these trifles i wish i could describe him for i loved the man and with reason for he was ever kind to me to whom kindness has not always been shown and he was moreover a choice specimen of a class which no longer existsa gentleman lawyer of the old school i would fain describe him but figures with which he has nought to do press forward and keep him from my minds eye there they pass spaniard and moor gypsy turk and livid jew but who is that what that thick pursy manin the loose snuffcoloured greatcoat with the white stockings drab breeches and silver buckles on his shoes that man with the bull neck and singular head immense in the lower part especially about the jaws but tapering upward like a pear the man with the bushy brows small grey eyes replete with catlike expression whose grizzled hair is cut close and whose ear lobes are pierced with small golden rings oh that is not my dear old master but a widely different personage bon jour monsieur vidocq expressions de ma part à monsieur le baron taylor but here he comes at last my veritable old master a more respectablelooking individual was never seen he really looked what he was a gentleman of the lawthere was nothing of the pettifogger about him somewhat under the middle size and somewhat rotund in person he was always dressed in a full suit of black never worn long enough to become threadbare his face was rubicund and not without keenness but the most remarkable thing about him was the crown of his head which was bald and shone like polished ivory nothing more white smooth and lustrous some people have said that he wore false calves probably because his black silk stockings never exhibited a wrinkle they might just as well have said that he waddled because his shoes creaked for these last which were always without a speck and polished as his crown though of a different hue did creak as he walked rather slowly i cannot say that i ever saw him walk fast he had a handsome practice and might have died a very rich man much richer than he did had he not been in the habit of giving rather expensive dinners to certain great people who gave him nothing in return except their company i could never discover his reasons for doing so as he always appeared to me a remarkably quiet man by nature averse to noise and bustle but in all dispositions there are anomalies i have already said that he lived in a handsome house and i may as well here add that he had a very handsome wife who both dressed and talked exceedingly well so i sat behind the deal desk engaged in copying documents of various kinds and in the apartment in which i sat and in the adjoining ones there were others some of whom likewise copied documents while some were engaged in the yet more difficult task of drawing them up and some of these sons of nobody were paid for the work they did whilst others like myself sons of somebody paid for being permitted to work which as our principal observed was but reasonable forasmuch as we not unfrequently utterly spoiled the greater part of the work entrusted to our hands there was one part of the day when i generally found myself quite alone i mean at the hour when the rest went home to their principal meal i being the youngest was left to take care of the premises to answer the bell and so forth till relieved which was seldom before the expiration of an hour and a half when i myself went home this period however was anything but disagreeable to me for it was then that i did what best pleased me and leaving off copying the documents i sometimes indulged in a fit of musing my chin resting on both my hands and my elbows planted on the desk or opening the desk aforesaid i would take out one of the books contained within it and the book which i took out was almost invariably not blackstone but ab gwilym ah that ab gwilym i am much indebted to him and it were ungrateful on my part not to devote a few lines to him and his songs in this my history start not reader i am not going to trouble you with a poetical dissertation no no i know my duty too well to introduce anything of the kind but i who imagine i know several things and amongst others the workings of your mind at this moment have an idea that you are anxious to learn a little a very little more about ab gwilym than i have hitherto told you the two or three words that i have dropped having awakened within you a languid kind of curiosity i have no hesitation in saying that he makes one of the some halfdozen really great poets whose verses in whatever language they wrote exist at the present day and are more or less known it matters little how i first became acquainted with the writings of this man and how the short thick volume stuffed full with his immortal imaginings first came into my hands i was studying welsh and i fell in with ab gwilym by no very strange chance but before i say more about ab gwilym i must be permittedi really mustto say a word or two about the language in which he wrote that same sweet welsh if i remember right i found the language a difficult one in mastering it however i derived unexpected assistance from what of irish remained in my head and i soon found that they were cognate dialects springing from some old tongue which itself perhaps had sprung from one much older and here i cannot help observing cursorily that i every now and then whilst studying this welsh generally supposed to be the original tongue of britain encountered words which according to the lexicographers were venerable words highly expressive showing the wonderful power and originality of the welsh in which however they were no longer used in common discourse but were relics precious relics of the first speech of britain perhaps of the world with which words however i was already well acquainted and which i had picked up not in learned books classic books and in tongues of old renown but whilst listening to mr petulengro and tawno chikno talking over their everyday affairs in the language of the tents which circumstance did not fail to give rise to deep reflection in those moments when planting my elbows on the deal desk i rested my chin upon my hands but it is probable that i should have abandoned the pursuit of the welsh language after obtaining a very superficial acquaintance with it had it not been for ab gwilym a strange songster was that who pretending to be captivated by every woman he saw was in reality in love with nature alonewild beautiful solitary natureher mountains and cascades her forests and streams her birds fishes and wild animals go to ab gwilym with thy pseudoamatory odes to morfydd or this or that other lady fair or uglylittle didst thou care for any of them dame nature was thy love however thou mayest seek to disguise the truth yes yes sendthy lovemessage to morfydd the fair wanton by whom dost thou send it i would know by the salmon forsooth which haunts the rushing stream the glorious salmon which bounds and gambols in the flashing water and whose ways and circumstances thou so well describestsee there he hurries upwards through the flashing water halloo what a glimpse of glorybut where is morfydd the while what another message to the wife of bwa bach ay truly and by whom the wind the swift wind the rider of the world whose course is not to be stayed who gallops oer the mountain and when he comes to broadest river asks neither for boat nor ferry who has described the wind so wellhis speed and power but where is morfydd and now thou art awaiting morfydd the wanton the wife of the bwa bach thou art awaiting her beneath the tall trees amidst the underwood but she comes not no morfydd is there quite right ab gwilym what wantest thou with morfydd but another form is nigh at hand that of red reynard who seated upon his chine at the mouth of his cave looks very composedly at thee thou startest bendest thy bow thy crossbow intending to hit reynard with the bolt just about the jaw but the bow breaks reynard barks and disappears into his cave which by thine own account reaches helland then thou ravest at the misfortune of thy bow and the nonappearance of morfydd and abusest reynard go to thou carest neither for thy bow nor for morfydd thou merely seekest an opportunity to speak of reynard and who has described him like thee the brute with the sharp shrill cry the black reverse of melody whose face sometimes wears a smile like the devils in the evangile but now thou art actually with morfydd yes she has stolen from the dwelling of the bwa bach and has met thee beneath those rocksshe is actually with thee ab gwilym but she is not long with thee for a storm comes on and thunder shatters the rocksmorfydd flees quite right ab gwilym thou hadst no need of her a better theme for song is the voice of the lordthe rock shattererthan the frail wife of the bwa bach go to ab gwilym thou wast a wiser and a better man than thou wouldst fain have had people believe but enough of thee and thy songs those times passed rapidly with ab gwilym in my hand i was in the midst of enchanted ground in which i experienced sensations akin to those i had felt of yore whilst spelling my way through the wonderful bookthe delight of my childhood i say akin for perhaps only once in our lives do we experience unmixed wonder and delight and these i had already knownchapter xx silver greygood word for everybodya remarkable youthclientsgrades in societythe archdeacon reading the bible i am afraid that i have not acted very wisely in putting this boy of ours to the law said my father to my mother as they sat together one summer evening in their little garden beneath the shade of some tall poplars yes there sat my father in the garden chair which leaned against the wall of his quiet home the haven in which he had sought rest and praise be to god found it after many a year of poorly requited toil there he sat with locks of silver grey which set off so nobly his fine bold but benevolent face his faithful consort at his side and his trusty dog at his feet an eccentric animal of the genuine regimental breed who born amongst redcoats had not yet become reconciled to those of any other hue barking and tearing at them when they drew near the door but testifying his fond reminiscence of the former by hospitable waggings of the tail whenever a uniform made its appearanceat present a very unfrequent occurrence i am afraid i have not done right in putting him to the law said my father resting his chin upon his goldheaded bamboo cane why what makes you think so said my mother i have been taking my usual evening walk up the road with the animal here said my father and as i walked along i overtook the boys master mr s we shook hands and after walking a little way farther we turned back together talking about this and that the state of the country the weather and the dog which he greatly admired for he is a goodnatured man and has a good word for everybody though the dog all but bit him when he attempted to coax his head after the dog we began talking about the boy it was myself who introduced that subject i thought it was a good opportunity to learn how he was getting on so i asked what he thought of my son he hesitated at first seeming scarcely to know what to say at length he came out with oh a very extraordinary youth a most remarkable youth indeed captain indeed said i i am glad to hear it but i hope you find him steady steady steady said he why yes hes steady i cannot say that he is not steady come come said i beginning to be rather uneasy i see plainly that you are not altogether satisfied with him i was afraid you would not be for though he is my own son i am anything but blind to his imperfections but do tell me what particular fault you have to find with him and i will do my best to make him alter his conduct no fault to find with him captain i assure you no fault whatever the youth is a remarkable youth an extraordinary youth only as i told you before mr s is the best natured man in the world and it was only with the greatest difficulty that i could get him to say a single word to the disadvantage of the boy for whom he seems to entertain a very great regard at last i forced the truth from him and grieved i was to hear it though i must confess that i was somewhat prepared for it it appears that the lad has a total want of discrimination i dont understand you said my mother you can understand nothing that would seem for a moment to impugn the conduct of that child i am not however so blind want of discrimination was the word and it both sounds well and is expressive it appears that since he has been placed where he is he has been guilty of the grossest blunders only the other day mr s told me as he was engaged in close conversation with one of his principal clients the boy came to tell him that a person wanted particularly to speak with him and on going out he found a lamentable figure with one eye who came to ask for charity whom nevertheless the lad had ushered into a private room and installed in an armchair like a justice of the peace instead of telling him to go about his businessnow what did that show but a total want of discrimination i wish we may never have anything worse to reproach him with said my mother i dont know what worse we could reproach him with said my father i mean of course as far as his profession is concerned discrimination is the very keystone if he treated all people alike he would soon become a beggar himself there are grades in society as well as in the army and according to those grades we should fashion our behaviour else there would instantly be an end of all order and discipline i am afraid that the child is too condescending to his inferiors whilst to his superiors he is apt to be unbending enough i dont believe that would do in the world i am sure it would not in the army he told me another anecdote with respect to his behaviour which shocked me more than the other had done it appears that his wife who by the bye is a very fine woman and highly fashionable gave him permission to ask the boy to tea one evening for she is herself rather partial to the lad there had been a great dinner party there that day and there were a great many fashionable people so the boy went and behaved very well and modestly for some time and was rather noticed till unluckily a very great gentleman an archdeacon i think put some questions to him and finding that he understood the languages began talking to him about the classics what do you think the boy had the impertinence to say that the classics were much overvalued and amongst other things that some horrid fellow or other some welshman i think thank god it was not an irishman was a better poet than ovid the company were of coursehorrified the archdeacon who is seventy years of age and has seven thousand a year took snuff and turned away mrs s turned up her eyes mr s however told me with his usual goodnature i suppose to spare my feelings that he rather enjoyed the thing and thought it a capital joke i think so too said my mother i do not said my father that a boy of his years should entertain an opinion of his owni mean one which militates against all established authorityis astounding as well might a raw recruit pretend to offer an unfavourable opinion on the manual and platoon exercise the idea is preposterous the lad is too independent by half i never yet knew one of an independent spirit get on in the armythe secret of success in the army is the spirit of subordination which is a poor spirit after all said my mother but the child is not in the army and it is well for him that he is not said my father but you do not talk wisely the world is a field of battle and he who leaves the ranks what can he expect but to be cut down i call his present behaviour leaving the ranks and going vapouring about without orders his only chance lies in falling in again as quick as possible does he think he can carry the day by himself an opinion of his own at these yearsi confess i am exceedingly uneasy about the lad you make me uneasy too said my mother but i really think you are too hard upon the child he is not a bad child after all though not perhaps all you could wish him he is always ready to read the bible let us go in he is in the room above us at least he was two hours ago i left him there bending over his books i wonder what he has been doing all this time it is now getting late let us go in and he shall read to us i am getting old said my father and i love to hear the bible read to me for my own sight is something dim yet i do not wish the child to read to me this night i cannot so soon forget what i have heard but i hear my eldest sons voice he is now entering the gate he shall read the bible to us this night what say youchapter xxi the eldest sonsaying of wild finlandthe critical timevaunting pollsone thing wanteda fathers blessing miracle of artthe popes houseyoung enthusiastpictures of englandpersist and wrestlethe little dark man the eldest son the regard and affection which my father entertained for his firstborn were natural enough and appeared to none more so than myself who cherished the same feelings towards him what he was as a boy the reader already knows for the reader has seen him as a boy fain would i describe him at the time of which i am now speaking when he had attained the verge of manhood but the pen fails me and i attempt not the task and yet it ought to be an easy one for how frequently does his form visit my minds eye in slumber and in wakefulness in the light of day and in the night watches but last night i saw him in his beauty and his strength he was about to speak and my ear was on the stretch when at once i awoke and there was i alone and the night storm was howling amidst the branches of the pines which surround my lonely dwelling listen to the moaning of the pine at whose root thy hut is fasteneda saying that of wild finland in which there is wisdom i listened and thought of life and death of all human beings that i have ever known that elder brother was the most frank and generous ay and the quickest and readiest and the best adapted to do a great thing needful at the critical time when the delay of a moment would be fatal i have known him dash from a steep bank into a stream in his full dress and pull out a man who was drowning yet there were twenty others bathing in the water who might have saved him by putting out a hand without inconvenience to themselves which however they did not do but stared with stupid surprise at the drowning ones struggles yes whilst some shouted from the bank to those in the water to save the drowning one and those in the water did nothing my brother neither shouted nor stood still but dashed from the bank and did the one thing needful which under such circumstances not one man in a million would have done now who can wonder that a brave old man should love a son like this and prefer him to any other my boy my own boy you are the very image of myself the day i took off my coat in the park to fight big ben said my father on meeting his son wet and dripping immediately after his bold feat and who cannot excuse the honest pride of the old manthe stout old man ay old man that son was worthy of thee and thou wast worthy of such a son a noble specimen wast thou of those strong singleminded englishmen who without making a parade either of religion or loyalty feared god and honoured their king and were not particularly friendly to the french whose vaunting polls they occasionally broke as at minden and at malplaquet to the confusion vast of the eternal foes of the english land i who was so little like thee that thou understoodst me not and in whom with justice thou didst feel so little pride had yet perception enough to see all thy worth and to feel it an honour to be able to call myself thy son and if at some no distant time when the foreign enemy ventures to insult our shore i be permitted to break some vaunting poll it will be a triumph to me to think that if thou hadst lived thou wouldst have hailed the deed and mightest yet discover some distant resemblance to thyself the day when thou didst all but vanquish the mighty brain i have already spoken of my brothers taste for painting and the progress he had made in that beautiful art it is probable that if circumstances had not eventually diverted his mind from the pursuit he would have attained excellence and left behind him some enduring monument of his powers for he had an imagination to conceive and that yet rarer endowment a hand capable of giving life body and reality to the conceptions of his mind perhaps he wanted one thing the want of which is but too often fatal to the sons of genius and without which genius is little more than a splendid toy in the hands of the possessorperseverance dogged perseverance in his proper calling otherwise though the grave had closed over him he might still be living in the admiration of his fellowcreatures o ye gifted ones follow your calling for however various your talents may be ye can have but one calling capable of leading ye to eminence and renown follow resolutely the one straight path before you it is that of your good angel let neither obstacles nor temptations induce ye to leave it bound along if you can if not on hands and knees follow it perish in it if needful but ye need not fear that no one ever yet died in the true path of his calling before he had attained the pinnacle turn into other paths and for a momentary advantage or gratification ye have sold your inheritance your immortality ye will never be heard of after death my father has given me a hundred and fifty pounds said my brother to me one morning and something which is better his blessing i am going to leave you and where are you going where to the great city to london to be sure i should like to go with you pooh said my brother what should you do there but dont be discouraged i dare say a time will come when you too will go to londonand sure enough so it did and all but too soon and what do you purpose doing there i demanded oh i go to improve myself in art to place myself under some master of high name at least i hope to do so eventually i have however a plan in my head which i should wish first to execute indeed i do not think i can rest till i have done so every one talks so much about italy and the wondrous artists which it has produced and the wondrous pictures which are to be found there now i wish to see italy or rather rome the great city for i am told that in a certain room there is contained the grand miracle of art and what do you call it the transfiguration painted by one rafael and it is said to be the greatest work of the greatest painter which the world has ever known i suppose it is because everybody says so that i have such a strange desire to see it i have already made myself well acquainted with its locality and think that i could almost find my way to it blindfold when i have crossed the tiber which as you are aware runs through rome i must presently turn to the right up a rather shabby street which communicates with a large square the farther end of which is entirely occupied by the front of an immense church with a dome which ascends almost to the clouds and this church they call st peters ay ay said i i have read about that in keyslers travels before the church in the square are two fountains one on either side casting up water in showers between them in the midst is an obelisk brought from egypt and covered with mysterious writing on your right rises an edifice not beautiful nor grand but huge and bulky where lives a strange kind of priest whom men call the pope a very horrible old individual who would fain keep christ in leading strings calls the virgin mary the queen of heaven and himself gods lieutenantgeneral upon earth ay ay said i i have read of him in foxs book of martyrs well i do not go straight forward up the flight of steps conducting into the church but i turn to the right and passing under the piazza find myself in a court of the huge bulky house and then ascend various staircases and pass along various corridors and galleries all of which i could describe to you though i have never seen them at last a door is unlocked and we enter a room rather high but not particularly large communicating with another room into which however i do not go though there are noble things in that second roomimmortal things by immortal artists amongst others a grand piece of corregio i do not enter it for the grand picture of the world is not there but i stand still immediately on entering the first room and i look straight before me neither to the right nor left though there are noble things both on the right and left for immediately before me at the farther end hanging against the wall is a picture which arrests me and i can see nothing else for that picture at the farther end hanging against the wall is the picture of the world yes go thy way young enthusiast and whether to london town or to old rome may success attend thee yet strange fears assail me and misgivings on thy account thou canst not rest thou sayest till thou hast seen the picture in the chamber at old rome hanging over against the wall ay and thus thou dost exemplify thy weaknessthy strength too it may befor the one idea fantastic yet lovely which now possesses thee could only have originated in a genial and fervent brain well go if thou must go yet it perhaps were better for thee to bide in thy native land and there with fear and trembling with groanings with straining eyeballs toil drudge slave till thou hast made excellence thine own thou wilt scarcely acquire it by staring at the picture over against the door in the high chamber of old rome seekest thou inspiration thou needest it not thou hast it already and it was never yet found by crossing the sea what hast thou to do with old rome and thou an englishman did thy blood never glow at the mention of thy native land as an artist merely yes i trow and with reason for thy native land need not grudge old rome her pictures of the world she has pictures of her own pictures of england and is it a new thing to toss up caps and shoutengland against the world yes against the world in all in all in science and in arms in minstrel strain and not less in the art which enables the hand to deceive the intoxicated soul by means of pictures seekest models to gainsborough and hogarth turn not names of the world may be but english namesand england against the world a living master why there he comes thou hast had him long he has long guided thy young hand towards the excellence which is yet far from thee but which thou canst attain if thou shouldst persist and wrestle even as he has done midst gloom and despondencyay and even contempt he who now comes up the creaking stair to thy little studio in the second floor to inspect thy last effort before thou departest the little stout man whose face is very dark and whose eye is vivacious that man has attained excellence destined some day to be acknowledged though not till he is cold and his mortal part returned to its kindred clay he has painted not pictures of the world but english pictures such as gainsborough himself might have done beautiful rural pieces with trees which might well tempt the wild birds to perch upon them thou needest not run to rome brother where lives the old mariolater after pictures of the world whilst at home there are pictures of england nor needest thou even go to london the big city in search of a master for thou hast one at home in the old east angliantown who can instruct thee whilst thou needest instruction better stay at home brother at least for a season and toil and strive midst groanings and despondency till thou hast attained excellence even as he has donethe little dark man with the brown coat and the topboots whose name will one day be considered the chief ornament of the old town and whose works will at no distant period rank amongst the proudest pictures of englandand england against the world thy master my brother thy at present all too little considered mastercrome chapter xxii desire for noveltylives of the lawlesscountenancesold yeoman and damewe live near the seauncouthlooking volumethe other conditiondraoitheaca dilemmathe antinomianlodowick muggletonalmost blind anders vedel but to proceed with my own story i now ceased all at once to take much pleasure in the pursuits which formerly interested me i yawned over ab gwilym even as i now in my minds eye perceive the reader yawning over the present pages what was the cause of this constitutional lassitude or a desire for novelty both it is probable had some influence in the matter but i rather think that the latter feeling was predominant the parting words of my brother had sunk into my mind he had talked of travelling in strange regions and seeing strange and wonderful objects and my imagination fell to work and drew pictures of adventures wild and fantastic and i thought what a fine thing it must be to travel and i wished that my father would give me his blessing and the same sum that he had given my brother and bid me go forth into the world always forgetting that i had neither talents nor energies at this period which would enable me to make any successful figure on its stage and then i again sought up the book which had so captivated me in my infancy and i read it through and i sought up others of a similar character and in seeking for them i met books also of adventure but by no means of a harmless description lives of wicked and lawless men murray and latroonbooks of singular power but of coarse and prurient imaginationbooks at one time highly in vogue now deservedly forgotten and most difficult to be found and when i had gone through these books what was my state of mind i had derived entertainment from their perusal but they left me more listless and unsettled than before and i really knew not what to do to pass my time my philological studies had become distasteful and i had never taken any pleasure in the duties of my profession i sat behind my desk in a state of torpor my mind almost as blank as the paper before me on which i rarely traced a line it was always a relief to hear the bell ring as it afforded me an opportunity of doing something which i was yet capable of doing to rise and open the door and stare in the countenances of the visitors all of a sudden i fell to studying countenances and soon flattered myself that i had made considerable progress in the science there is no faith in countenances said some roman of old trust anything but a persons countenance not trust a mans countenance say some moderns why it is the only thing in many people that we can trust on which account they keep it most assiduously out of the way trust not a mans words if you please or you may come to very erroneous conclusions but at all times place implicit confidence in a mans countenance in which there is no deceit and of necessity there can be none if people would but look each other more in the face we should have less cause to complain of the deception of the world nothing so easy as physiognomy nor so useful somewhat in this latter strain i thought at the time of which i am speaking i am now older and let us hope less presumptuous it is true that in the course of my life i have scarcely ever had occasion to repent placing confidence in individuals whose countenances have prepossessed me in their favour though to how many i may have been unjust from whose countenances i may have drawn unfavourable conclusions is another matter but it had been decreed by that fate which governs our every action that i was soon to return to my old pursuits it was written that i should not yet cease to be lavengro though i had become in my own opinion a kind of lavater it is singular enough that my renewed ardour for philology seems to have been brought about indirectly by my physiognomical researches in which had i not indulged the event which i am about to relate as far as connected with myself might never have occurred amongst the various countenances which i admitted during the period of my answering the bell there were two which particularly pleased me and which belonged to an elderly yeoman and his wife whom some little business had brought to our law sanctuary i believe they experienced from me some kindness and attention which won the old peoples hearts so one day when their little business had been brought to a conclusion and they chanced to be alone with me who was seated as usual behind the deal desk in the outer room the old man with some confusion began to tell me how grateful himself and dame felt for the many attentions i had shown them and how desirous they were to make me some remuneration of course said the old man we must be cautious what we offer to so fine a young gentleman as yourself we have however something we think will just suit the occasion a strange kind of thing which people say is a book though no one that my dame or myself have shown it to can make anything out of it so as we are told that you are a fine young gentleman who can read all the tongues of the earth and stars as the bible says we thought i and my dame that it would be just the thing you would like and my dame has it now at the bottom of her basket a book said i how did you come by it we live near the sea said the old man so near that sometimes our thatch is wet with the spray and it may now be a year ago that there was a fearful storm and a ship was driven ashore during the night and ere the morn was a complete wreck when we got up at daylight there were the poor shivering crew at our door they were foreigners redhaired men whose speech we did not understand but we took them in and warmed them and they remained with us threedays and when they went away they left behind them this thing here it is part of the contents of a box which was washed ashore and did you learn who they were why yes they made us understand that they were danes danes thought i danes and instantaneously huge and grizzly appeared to rise up before my vision the skull of the old pirate dane even as i had seen it of yore in the penthouse of the ancient church to which with my mother and my brother i had wandered on the memorable summer eve and now the old man handed me the book a strange and uncouthlooking volume enough it was not very large but instead of the usual covering was bound in wood and was compressed with strong iron clasps it was a printed book but the pages were not of paper but vellum and the characters were black and resembled those generally termed gothic it is certainly a curious book said i and i should like to have it but i cant think of taking it as a gift i must give you an equivalent i never take presents from anybody the old man whispered with his dame and chuckled and then turned his face to me and said with another chuckle well we have agreed about the price but may be you will not consent i dont know said i what do you demand why that you shake me by the hand and hold out your cheek to my old dameshe has taken an affection to you i shall be very glad to shake you by the hand said i but as for the other condition it requires consideration no consideration at all said the old man with something like a sigh she thinks you like her son our only child that was lost twenty years ago in the waves of the north sea oh that alters the case altogether said i and of course i can have no objection and now at once i shook off my listlessness to enable me to do which nothing could have happened more opportune than the above event the danes the danes and was i at last to become acquainted and in so singular a manner with the speech of a people which had as far back as i could remember exercised the strongest influence over my imagination as how should they notin infancy there was the summereve adventure to which i often looked back and always with a kind of strange interest with respect to those to whom such gigantic and wondrous bones could belong as i had seen on that occasion and more than this i had been in ireland and there under peculiar circumstances this same interest was increased tenfold i had mingled much whilst there with the genuine irisha wild but kindhearted race whose conversation was deeply imbued with traditionary lore connected with the early history of their own romantic land and from them i heard enough of the danes but nothing commonplace for they never mentioned them but in terms which tallied well with my own preconceived ideas for at an early period the danes had invaded ireland and had subdued it and though eventually driven out had left behind them an enduring remembrance in the minds of the people who loved to speak of their strength and their stature in evidence of which they would point to the ancient raths or mounds where the old danes were buried and where bones of extraordinary size were occasionally exhumed and as the danes surpassed other people in strength so according to my narrators they also excelled all others in wisdom or rather in draoitheac or magic for they were powerful sorcerers they said compared with whom the fairy men of the present day knew nothing at all at all and amongst other wonderful things they knew how to make strong beer from the heather that grows upon the bogs little wonder if the interest the mysterious interest which i had early felt about the danes was increased tenfold by my sojourn in ireland and now i had in my possession a danish book which from its appearance might be supposed to have belonged to the very old danes indeed but how was i to turn it to any account i had the book it is true but i did not understand the language and how was i to overcome that difficulty hardly by poring over the book yet i did pore over the book daily and nightly till my eyes were dim and it appeared to me that every now and then i encountered words which i understoodenglish words though strangely disguised and i said to myself courage english and danish are cognate dialects a time will come when i shall understand this danish and then i pored over the book again but with all my poring i could not understand it and then i became angry and i bit my lips till the blood came and i occasionally tore a handful from my hair and flung it upon the floor but that did not mend the matter for still i did not understand the book which however i began to see was written in rhymea circumstance rather difficult to discover at first the arrangement of the lines not differing from that which is employed in prose and its being written in rhyme made me only the more eager to understand it but i toiled in vain for i had neither grammar nor dictionary of the language and when i sought for them could procureneither and i was much dispirited till suddenly a bright thought came into my head and i said although i cannot obtain a dictionary or grammar i can perhaps obtain a bible in this language and if i can procure a bible i can learn the language for the bible in every tongue contains the same thing and i have only to compare the words of the danish bible with those of the english and if i persevere i shall in time acquire the language of the danes and i was pleased with the thought which i considered to be a bright one and i no longer bit my lips or tore my hair but i took my hat and going forth i flung my hat into the air and when my hat came down i put it on my head and commenced running directing my course to the house of the antinomian preacher who sold books and whom i knew to have bibles in various tongues amongst the number and i arrived out of breath and i found the antinomian in his little library dusting his books and the antinomian clergyman was a tall man of about seventy who wore a hat with a broad brim and a shallow crown and whose manner of speaking was exceedingly nasal and when i saw him i cried out of breath have you a danish bible and he replied what do you want it for friend and i answered to learn danish by and may be to learn thy duty replied the antinomian preacher truly i have it not but as you are a customer of mine i will endeavour to procure you one and i will write to that laudable society which men call the bible society an unworthy member of which i am and i hope by next week to procure what you desire and when i heard these words of the old man i was very glad and my heart yearned towards him and i would fain enter into conversation with him and i said why are you an antinomian for my part i would rather be a dog than belong to such a religion nay friend said the antinomian thou forejudgest us know that those who call us antinomians call us so despitefully we do not acknowledge the designation then you do not set all law at nought said i far be it from us said the old man we only hope that being sanctified by the spirit from above we have no need of the law to keep us in order did you ever hear tell of lodowick muggleton not i that is strange know then that he was the founder of our poor society and after him we are frequently though opprobriously termed muggletonians for we are christians here is his book which perhaps you can do no better than purchase you are fond of rare books and this is both curious and rare i will sell it cheap thank you and now be gone i will do all i can to procure the bible and in this manner i procured the danish bible and i commenced my task first of all however i locked up in a closet the volume which had excited my curiosity saying out of this closet thou comest not till i deem myself competent to read thee and then i sat down in right earnest comparing every line in the one version with the corresponding one in the other and i passed entire nights in this manner till i was almost blind and the task was tedious enough at first but i quailed not and soon began to make progress and at first i had a misgiving that the old book might not prove a danish book but was soon reassured by reading many words in the bible which i remembered to have seen in the book and then i went on right merrily and i found that the language which i was studying was by no means a difficult one and in less than a month i deemed myself able to read the book anon i took the book from the closet and proceeded to make myself master of its contents i had some difficulty for the language of the book though in the main the same as the language of the bible differed from it in some points being apparently a more ancient dialect by degrees however i overcame this difficulty and i understood the contents of the book and well did they correspond with all those ideas in which i had indulged connected with the danes for the book was a book of ballads about the deeds of knights and champions and men of huge stature ballads which from time immemorial had been sung in the north and which some two centuries before the time of which i am speaking had been collected by one anders vedel who lived with a certain tycho brahe and assisted him in making observations upon the heavenly bodies at a place called uranias

mindenmelancholy swayne vonvedthe fifth dinner strange doctrinesare you happyimprove yourself in german it might be some six months after the events last recorded that two individuals were seated together in a certain room in a certain street of the old town which i have so frequently had occasion to mention in the preceding pages one of them was an elderly and the other a very young man and they sat on either side of a fireplace beside a table on which were fruit and wine the room was a small one and in its furniture exhibited nothing remarkable over the mantelpiece however hung a small picture with naked figures in the foreground and with much foliage behind it might not have struck every beholder for it looked old and smokedried but a connoisseur on inspecting it closely would have pronounced it to be a judgment of paris and a masterpiece of the flemish school the forehead of the elder individual was high and perhaps appeared more so than it really was from the hair being carefully brushed back as if for the purpose of displaying to the best advantage that part of the cranium his eyes were large and full and of a light brown and might have been called heavy and dull had they not been occasionally lighted up by a sudden gleamnot so brilliant however as that which at every inhalation shone from the bowl of the long clay pipe which he was smoking but which from a certain sucking sound which about this time began to be heard from the bottom appeared to be giving notice that it would soon require replenishment from a certain canister which together with a lighted taper stood upon the table beside him you do not smoke said he at length laying down his pipe and directing his glance to his companion now there was at least one thing singular connected with this last namely the colour of his hair which notwithstanding his extreme youth appeared to be rapidly becoming grey he had very long limbs and was apparently tall of stature in which he differed from his elderly companion who must have been somewhat below the usual height no i cant smoke said the youth in reply to the observation of the other i have often tried but could never succeed to my satisfaction is it possible to become a good german without smoking said the senior half speaking to himself i dare say not said the youth but i shant break my heart on that account as for breaking your heart of course you would never think of such a thing he is a fool who breaks his heart on any account but it is good to be a german the germans are the most philosophic people in the world and the greatest smokers now i trace their philosophy to their smoking i have heard say their philosophy is all smokeis that your opinion why no but smoking has a sedative effect upon the nerves and enables a man to bear the sorrows of this life of which every one has his share not only decently but dignifiedly suicide is not a national habit in germany as it is in england but that poor creature werther who committed suicide was a german werther is a fictitious character and by no means a felicitous one i am no admirer either of werther or his author but i should say that if there ever was a werther in germany he did not smoke werther as you very justly observe was a poor creature and a very sinful one i have heard my parents say that suicide is a great crime broadly and without qualification to say that suicide is a crime is speaking somewhat unphilosophically no doubt suicide under many circumstances is a crime a very heinous one when the father of a family for example to escape from certain difficulties commits suicide he commits a crime there are those around him who look to him for support by the law of nature and he has no right to withdraw himself from those who have a claim upon his exertions he is a person who decamps with other peoples goods as well as his own indeed there can be no crime which is not founded upon the depriving others of something which belongs to them a man is hanged for setting fire to his house in a crowded city for he burns at the same time or damages those of other people but if a man who has a house on a heath sets fire to it he is not hanged for he has not damaged or endangered any other individuals property and the principle of revenge upon which all punishment is founded has not been aroused similar to such a case is that of the man who without any family ties commits suicide for example were i to do the thing this evening who would have a right to call me to account i am alone in the world have no family to support and so far from damaging any one should even benefit my heir by myaccelerated death however i am no advocate for suicide under any circumstances there is something undignified in it unheroic ungermanic but if you must commit suicideand there is no knowing to what people may be brought always contrive to do it as decorously as possible the decencies whether of life or of death should never be lost sight of i remember a female quaker who committed suicide by cutting her throat but she did it decorously and decently kneeling down over a pail so that not one drop fell upon the floor thus exhibiting in her last act that nice sense of neatness for which quakers are distinguished i have always had a respect for that womans memory and here filling his pipe from the canister and lighting it at the taper he recommenced smoking calmly and sedately but is not suicide forbidden in the bible the youth demanded why no but what though it werethe bible is a respectable book but i should hardly call it one whose philosophy is of the soundest i have said that it is a respectable book i mean respectable from its antiquity and from containing as herder says the earliest records of the human race though those records are far from being dispassionately written on which account they are of less value than they otherwise might have been there is too much passion in the bible too much violence now to come to all truth especially historic truth requires cool dispassionate investigation for which the jews do not appear to have ever been famous we are ourselves not famous for it for we are a passionate people the germans are notthey are not a passionate peoplea people celebrated for their oaths we are the germans have many excellent historic writers we tis true we have gibbon you have been reading gibbonwhat do you think of him i think him a very wonderful writer he is a wonderful writerone sui generisuniting the perspicuity of the englishfor we are perspicuouswith the cool dispassionate reasoning of the germans gibbon sought after the truth found it and made it clear then you think gibbon a truthful writer why yes who shall convict gibbon of falsehood many people have endeavoured to convict gibbon of falsehood they have followed him in his researches and have never found him once tripping oh he is a wonderful writer his power of condensation is admirable the lore of the whole world is to be found in his pages sometimes in a single note he has given us the result of the study of years or to speak metaphorically he has ransacked a thousand gulistans and has condensed all his fragrant booty into a single drop of otto but was not gibbon an enemy to the christian faith why no he was rather an enemy to priestcraft so am i and when i say the philosophy of the bible is in many respects unsound i always wish to make an exception in favour of that part of it which contains the life and sayings of jesus of bethlehem to which i must always concede my unqualified admirationof jesus mind you for with his followers and their dogmas i have nothing to do of all historic characters jesus is the most beautiful and the most heroic i have always been a friend to heroworship it is the only rational one and has always been in use amongst civilised people the worship of spirits is synonymous with barbarismit is mere fetish the savages of west africa are all spirit worshippers but there is something philosophic in the worship of the heroes of the human race and the true hero is the benefactor brahma jupiter bacchus were all benefactors and therefore entitled to the worship of their respective peoples the celts worshipped hesus who taught them to plough a highly useful art we who have attained a much higher state of civilisation than the celts ever did worship jesus the first who endeavoured to teach men to behave decently and decorously under all circumstances who was the foe of vengeance in which there is something highly indecorous who had first the courage to lift his voice against that violent dogma an eye for an eye who shouted conquer but conquer with kindness who said put up the sword a violent unphilosophic weapon and who finally died calmly and decorously in defence of his philosophy he must be a savage who denies worship to the hero of golgotha but he was something more than a hero he was the son of god wasnt he the elderly individual made no immediate answer but after a few more whiffs from his pipe exclaimed come fill your glass how do you advance with your translation of tell it is nearly finished but i do not think i shall proceed with it i begin to think the original somewhat dull there you are wrong it is the masterpiece of schiller the first of german poets it may be so said the youth but pray excuse me i do not think very highly of german poetry i have lately been reading shakespeare and when i turn from him to the germanseven the best of themthey appear mere pigmies you will pardon the liberty i perhaps take in saying so i like that every one should have an opinion of his own said the elderly individual and what is more declare itnothing displeases me more than to see people assenting to everything that they hear said i at once come to the conclusion that they are either hypocrites or there is nothing in them but with respect to shakespeare whom i have not read for thirty years is he not rather given to bombast crackling bombast as i think i have said in one of my essays i dare say he is said the youth but i cant help thinking him the greatest of all poets not even excepting homer i would sooner have written that series of plays founded on the fortunes of the house of lancaster than the iliad itself the events described are as lofty as those sung by homer in his great work and the characters brought upon the stage still more interesting i think hotspur as much of a hero as hector and young henry more of a man than achilles and then there is the fat knight the quintessence of fun wit and rascality falstaff is a creation beyond the genius even of homer you almost tempt me to read shakespeare againbut the germans i dont admire the germans said the youth somewhat excited i dont admire them in any point of view i have heard my father say that though good sharpshooters they cant be much depended upon as soldiers and that old sergeant meredith told him that minden would never have been won but for the two english regiments who charged the french with fixed bayonets and sent them to the rightabout in doublequick time with respect to poetry setting shakespeare and the english altogether aside i think there is another gothic nation at least entitled to dispute with them the palm indeed to my mind there is more genuine poetry contained in the old danish book which i came so strangely by than has been produced in germany from the period of the niebelungen lay to the present ah the kœmpe viser said the elderly individual breathing forth an immense volume of smoke which he had been collecting during the declamation of his young companion there are singular things in that book i must confess and i thank you for showing it to me or rather your attempt at translation i was struck with that ballad of orm ungarswayne who goes by night to the gravehill of his father to seek for counsel and then again that strange melancholy swayne vonved who roams about the world propounding people riddles slaying those who cannot answer and rewarding those who can with golden bracelets were it not for the violence i should say that ballad has a philosophic tendency i thank you for making me acquainted with the book and i thank the jew mousha for making me acquainted with you that mousha was a strange customer said the youth collecting himself he was a strange customer said the elder individual breathing forth a gentle cloud i love to exercise hospitality to wandering strangers especially foreigners and when he came to this place pretending to teach german and hebrew i asked him to dinner after the first dinner he asked me to lend him five pounds i did lend him five pounds after the fifth dinner he asked me to lend him fifty pounds i did not lend him the fifty pounds he was as ignorant of german as of hebrew said the youth on which account he was soon glad i suppose to transfer his pupil to some one else he told me said the elder individual that he intended to leave a town where he did not find sufficient encouragement and at the same time expressed regret at being obliged to abandon a certain extraordinary pupil for whom he had a particular regard now i who have taught many people german from the love which i bear to it and the desire which i feel that it should be generally diffused instantly said that i should be happy to take his pupil off his hands and afford him what instruction i could in german for as to hebrew i have never taken much interest in it such was the origin of our acquaintance you have been an apt scholar of late however i have seen little of youwhat is the reason the youth made no answer you think probably that you have learned all i can teach you well perhaps you are right not so not so said the young man eagerly before i knew you i knew nothing and am still very ignorant but of late my fathers health has been very much broken and he requires attention his spirits also have become low which to tell you the truth he attributes to my misconduct he says that i have imbibed all kinds of strange notions and doctrines which will in all probability prove my ruin both here and hereafter whichwhich ah i understand said the elder with another calm whiff i have always had a kind of respect for your father for there is something remarkable in his appearance something heroic and i would fain have cultivated his acquaintance the feeling however has not been reciprocated i met him the other day up the road with his cane and dog and saluted him he did not return my salutation he has certain opinions of his own said the youth which are widely different from those which he has heard that you profess i respect a man for entertaining an opinion of his own said the elderly individual i hold certain opinions but i shouldnot respect an individual the more for adopting them all i wish for is tolerance which i myself endeavour to practise i have always loved the truth and sought it if i have not found it the greater my misfortune are you happy said the young man why no and between ourselves it is that which induces me to doubt sometimes the truth of my opinions my life upon the whole i consider a failure on which account i would not counsel you or any one to follow my example too closely it is getting late and you had better be going especially as your father you say is anxious about you but as we may never meet again i think there are three things which i may safely venture to press upon you the first is that the decencies and gentlenesses should never be lost sight of as the practice of the decencies and gentlenesses is at all times compatible with independence of thought and action the second thing which i would wish to impress upon you is that there is always some eye upon us and that it is impossible to keep anything we do from the world as it will assuredly be divulged by somebody as soon as it is his interest to do so the third thing which i would wish to press upon you yes said the youth eagerly bending forward isand here the elderly individual laid down his pipe upon the tablethat it will be as well to go on improving yourself in german chapter xxiv the alehouse keepercompassion for the richold english gentlemanhow is thismadeirathe greek parr twenty languageswhiters healthabout the fighta sporting gentlemanthe flattened noselend us that pightlethe surly nod holloa master can you tell us where the fight is likely to be such were the words shouted out to me by a short thick fellow in brown topboots and bareheaded who stood with his hands in his pockets at the door of a country alehouse as i was passing by now as i knew nothing about the fight and as the appearance of the man did not tempt me greatly to enter into conversation with him i merely answered in the negative and continued my way it was a fine lovely morning in may the sun shone bright above and the birds were carolling in the hedgerows i was wont to be cheerful at such seasons for from my earliest recollection sunshine and the song of birds have been dear to me yet about that period i was not cheerful my mind was not at rest i was debating within myself and the debate was dreary and unsatisfactory enough i sighed and turning my eyes upward i ejaculated what is truth but suddenly by a violent effort breaking away from my meditations i hastened forward one mile two miles three miles were speedily left behind and now i came to a grove of birch and other trees and opening a gate i passed up a kind of avenue and soon arriving before a large brick house of rather antique appearance knocked at the door in this house there lived a gentleman with whom i had business he was said to be a genuine old english gentleman and a man of considerable property at this time however he wanted a thousand pounds as gentlemen of considerable property every now and then do i had brought him a thousand pounds in my pocket for it is astonishing how many eager helpers the rich find and with what compassion people look upon their distresses he was said to have good wine in his cellar is your master at home said i to a servant who appeared at the door his worship is at home young man said the servant as he looked at my shoes which bore evidence that i had come walking i beg your pardon sir he added as he looked me in the face ay ay servants thought i as i followed the man into the house always look people in the face when you open the door and do so before you look at their shoes or you may mistake the heir of a prime minister for a shopkeepers son i found his worship a jolly redfaced gentleman of about fiftyfive he was dressed in a green coat white corduroy breeches and drab gaiters and sat on an oldfashioned leather sofa with two small thoroughbred black english terriers one on each side of him he had all the appearance of a genuine old english gentleman who kept good wine in his cellar sir said i i have brought you a thousand pounds and i said this after the servant had retired and the two terriers had ceased the barking which is natural to all such dogs at the sight of a stranger and when the magistrate had received the money and signed and returned a certain paper which i handed to him he rubbed his hands and looking very benignantly at me exclaimed and now young gentleman that our business is over perhaps you can tell me where the fight is to take place i am sorry sir said i that i cant inform you but everybody seems to be anxious about it and then i told him what had occurred to me on the road with the alehouse keeper i know him said his worship hes a tenant of mine and a good fellow somewhat too much in my debt though but how is this young gentleman you look as if you had been walking you did not come on foot yes sir i came on foot on foot why it is sixteen miles i shant be tired when i have walked back you cant ride i suppose better than i can walkthen why do you walk i have frequently to make journeys connected with my profession sometimes i walk sometimes i ride just as the whim takes me will you take a glass of wine yes thats right what shall it be madeira the magistrate gave a violent slap on his knee i like your taste said he i am fond of a glass of madeira myself and can give you such a one as you will not drink every day sit down young gentleman you shall have a glass of madeira and the best i have thereupon he got up and followed by his two terriers walked slowly out of the room i looked round the room and seeing nothing which promised me much amusement i sat down and fell again into my former train of thought what is truth said i here it is said the magistrate returning at the end of a quarter of an hour followed by the servant with a tray heres the true thing or i am no judge far less a justice it has been thirty years in my cellar last christmas there said he to the servant put it down and leave my young friend and me to ourselves now what do you think of it it is very good said i did you ever taste better madeira i never before tasted madeira then you ask for a wine without knowing what it is i ask for it sir that i may know what it is well there is logic in that as parr would say you have heard of parr old parr yes old parr but not that parr you mean the english i the greek parr a as people call him i dont know him perhaps notrather too young for that but were you of my age you might have cause to know him coming from where you do he kept school therei was his first scholar he flogged greek into me till i loved himand he loved me he came to see me last year and sat in that chair i honour parrhe knows much and is a sound man does he know the truth know the truth he knows whats good from an oyster to an ostrichhes not only sound but round suppose we drink his health thank you boy heres parrs health and whiters who is whiter dont you know whiter i thought everybody knew reverend whiter the philologist b though i suppose you scarcely know what that means a man fond of tongues and languages quite out of your wayhe understands some twenty what do you say to that is he a sound man why as to that i scarcely know what to say he has got queer notions in his headwrote a book to prove that all words came originally from the earthwho knows words have roots and roots live in the earth but upon the whole i shouldnot call him altogether a sound man though he can talk greek nearly as fast as parr is he a round man ay boy rounder than parr ill sing you a song if you like which will let you into his character give me the haunch of a buck to eat and to drink madeira old and a gentle wife to rest with and in my arms to fold an arabic book to study a norfolk cob to ride and a house to live in shaded with trees and near to a river side with such good things around me and blessed with good health withal though i should live for a hundred years for death i would not call heres to whiters healthso you know nothing about the fight no sir the truth is that of late i have been very much occupied with various matters otherwise i should perhaps have been able to afford you some informationboxing is a noble art can you box a little i tell you what my boy i honour you and provided your education had been a little less limited i should have been glad to see you here in company with parr and whiter both can box boxing is as you say a noble arta truly english art may i never see the day when englishmen shall feel ashamed of it or blacklegs and blackguards bring it into disgrace i am a magistrate and of course cannot patronise the thing very openly yet i sometimes see a prize fight i saw the game chicken beat gulley did you ever see big ben no why do you ask but here we heard a noise like that of a gig driving up to the door which was immediately succeeded by a violent knocking and ringing and after a little time the servant who had admitted me made his appearance in the room sir said he with a certain eagerness of manner here are two gentlemen waiting to speak to you gentlemen waiting to speak to me who are they i dont know sir said the servant but they look like sporting gentlemen andandhere he hesitated from a word or two they dropped i almost think that they come about the fight about the fight said the magistrate no that can hardly be however you had better show them in heavy steps were now heard ascending the stairs and the servant ushered two men into the apartment again there was a barking but louder than that which had been directed against myself for here were two intruders both of them were remarkable looking men but to the foremost of them the most particular notice may well be accorded he was a man somewhat under thirty and nearly six feet in height he was dressed in a blue coat white corduroy breeches fastened below the knee with small golden buttons on his legs he wore white lambswool stockings and on his feet shoes reaching to the ankles round his neck was a handkerchief of the blue and birds eye pattern he wore neither whiskers nor moustaches and appeared not to delight in hair that of his head which was of a light brown being closely cropped the forehead was rather high but somewhat narrow the face neither broad nor sharp perhaps rather sharp than broad the nose was almost delicate the eyes were grey with an expression in which there was sternness blended with something approaching to feline his complexion was exceedingly pale relieved however by certain pockmarks which here and there studded his countenance his form was athletic but lean his arms long in the whole appearance of the man there was a blending of the bluff and the sharp you might have supposed him a bruiser his dress was that of one in all its minutiæ something was wanting however in his mannerthe quietness of the professional man he rather looked like one performing the partwellvery wellbut still performing a part his companionthere indeed was the bruiserno mistake about him a tall massive man with a broad countenance and a flattened nose dressed like a bruiser but not like a bruiser going into the ring he wore whitetopped boots and a loose brown jockey coat as the first advanced towards the table behind which the magistrate sat he doffed a white castor from his head and made rather a genteel bow looking at me who sat somewhat on one side he gave a kind of nod of recognition may i request to know who you are gentlemen said the magistrate sir said the man in a deep but not unpleasant voice allow me to introduce to you my friend mr the celebratedpugilist and he motioned with his hand towards the massive man with the flattened nose and your own name sir said the magistrate my name is no matter said the man were i to mention it to you it would awaken within you no feeling of interest it is neither kean nor belcher and i have as yet done nothing to distinguish myself like either of those individuals or even like my friend here however a time may comewe are not yet buried and whensoever my hour arrives i hope i shall prove myself equal to my destiny however high like bird thats bred amongst the helicons and here a smile half theatrical passed over his features in what can i oblige you sir said the magistrate well sir the soul of wit is brevity we want a place for an approaching combat between my friend here and a brave from town passing by your broad acres this fine morning we saw a pightle which we deemed would suit lend us that pightle and receive our thanks twould be a favour though not much to grant we neither ask for stonehenge nor for tempe my friend looked somewhat perplexed after a moment however he said with a firm but gentlemanly air sir i am sorry that i cannot comply with your request not comply said the man his brow becoming dark as midnight and with a hoarse and savage tone not comply why not it is impossible sir utterly impossible why so i am not compelled to give my reasons to you sir nor to any man let me beg of you to alter your decision said the man in a tone of profound respect utterly impossible sir i am a magistrate magistrate then fare ye well for a greencoated buffer and a harmanbeck sir said the magistrate springing up with a face fiery with wrath but with a surly nod to me the man left the apartment and in a moment more the heavy footsteps of himself and his companion were heard descending the staircase who is that man said my friend turning towards me a sporting gentleman well known in the place from which i come he appeared to know you i have occasionally put on the gloves with him what is his name chapter xxv doubtswise king of jerusalemlet me seea thousand yearsnothing newthe crowdthe hymnfaith charles wesleythere he stoodfarewell brotherdeathsun moon and starswind on the heath there was one question which i was continually asking myself at this period and which has more than once met the eyes of the reader who has followed me through the last chapter what is truth i had involved myself imperceptibly in a dreary labyrinth of doubt and whichever way i turned no reasonable prospect of extricating myself appeared the means by which i had brought myself into this situation may be very briefly told i had inquired into many matters in order that i might become wise and i had read and pondered over the words of the wise so called till i had made myself master of the sum of human wisdom namely that every thing is enigmatical and that man is an enigma to himself thence the cry of what is truth i had ceased to believe in the truth of that in which i had hitherto trusted and yet could find nothing in which i could put any fixed or deliberate beliefi was indeed in a labyrinth in what did i not doubt with respect to crime and virtue i was in doubt i doubted that the one was blamable and the other praiseworthy are not all things subjected to the law of necessity assuredly time and chance govern all things yet how can this be alas then there was myself for what was i born are not all things born to be forgotten thats incomprehensible yet is it not so those butterflies fall and are forgotten in what is man better than a butterfly all then is born to be forgotten ah that was a pang indeed tis at such a moment that a man wishes to die the wise king of jerusalem who sat in his shady arbours beside his sunny fishpools saying so many fine things wished to die when he saw that not only all was vanity but that he himself was vanity will a time come when all will be forgotten that now is beneath the sun if so of what profit is life in truth it was a sore vexation of spirit to me when i saw as the wise man saw of old that whatever i could hope to perform must necessarily be of very temporary duration and if so why do it i said to myself whatever name i can acquire will it endure for eternity scarcely so a thousand years let me see what have i done already i have learnt welsh and have translated the songs of ab gwilym some ten thousand lines into english rhyme i have also learnt danish and have rendered the old book of ballads cast by the tempest upon the beach into corresponding english metre good have i done enough already to secure myself a reputation of a thousand years no no certainly not i have not the slightest ground for hoping that my translations from the welsh and danish will be read at the end of a thousand years well but i am only eighteen and i have not stated all that i have done i have learnt many other tongues and have acquired some knowledge even of hebrew and arabic should i go on in this way till i am forty i must then be very learned and perhaps among other things may have translated the talmud and some of the great works of the arabians pooh all this is mere learning and translation and such will never secure immortality translation is at best an echo and it must be a wonderful echo to be heard after the lapse of a thousand years no all i have already done and all i may yet do in the same way i may reckon as nothingmere pastime something else must be done i must either write some grand original work or conquer an empire the one just as easy as the other but am i competent to do either yes i think i am under favourable circumstances yes i think i may promise myself a reputation of a thousand years if i do but give myself the necessary trouble well but whats a thousand years after all or twice a thousand years woe is me i may just as well sit still would i had never been born i said to myself and a thought would occasionally intrude but was i ever born is not all that i see a liea deceitful phantom is there a world and earth and sky berkeleys doctrinespinosas doctrine dear reader i had at that time never read either berkeley or spinosa i have still never read them who are they men of yesterday all is a lieall a deceitful phantom are old cries they come naturally from the mouths of those who casting aside that choicest shield against madness simplicity would fain be wise as god and can only know that they are naked this doubting in the universal all is almost coeval with the human race wisdom so called was early sought after all is a liea deceitful phantomwas said when the world was yet young its surface save a scanty portion yet untrodden by human foot and when the great tortoise yet crawled about all is a lie was the doctrine of buddh and buddh lived thirty centuries before the wise king of jerusalem who sat in his arbours beside his sunny fishpools saying many fine things and amongst others there is nothing new under the sun one day whilst i bent my way to the heath of which i have spoken on a former occasion at the foot of the hills which formed it i came to a place where a wagon was standing but without horses the shafts resting on the ground there was a crowd about it which extended halfway up the side of the neighbouring hill the wagon was occupied by some half a dozen mensome sitting others standing they were dressed in sobercoloured habiliments of black or brown cut in a plain and rather uncouth fashion and partially white with dust their hair was short and seemed to have been smoothed down by the application of the hand all were bareheadedsitting or standing all were bareheaded one of them a tall man was speaking as i arrived ere however i could distinguish what he was saying he left off and then there was a cry for a hymn to the glory of godthat was the word it was a strange sounding hymn as well it might be for everybody joined in it there were voices of all kinds of men of women and of childrenof those who could sing and ofthose who could nota thousand voices all joined and all joined heartily no voice of all the multitude was silent save mine the crowd consisted entirely of the lower classes labourers and mechanics and their wives and childrendusty people unwashed people people of no account whatever and yet they did not look a mob and when that hymn was overand here let me observe that strange as it sounded i have recalled that hymn to mind and it has seemed to tingle in my ears on occasions when all that pomp and art could do to enhance religious solemnity was being donein the sistine chapel what time the papal band was in full play and the choicest choristers of italy poured forth their mellowest tones in presence of batuschca and his cardinalson the ice of the neva what time the long train of stately priests with their noble beards and their flowing robes of crimson and gold with their ebony and ivory staves stalked along chanting their sclavonian litanies in advance of the mighty emperor of the north and his priberjensky guard of giants towards the orifice through which the river running below in its swiftness is to receive the baptismal lymphwhen the hymn was over another man in the wagon proceeded to address the people he was a much younger man than the last speaker somewhat square built and about the middle height his face was rather broad but expressive of much intelligence and with a peculiar calm and serious look the accent in which he spoke indicated that he was not of these parts but from some distant district the subject of his address was faith and how it could remove mountains it was a plain address without any attempt at ornament and delivered in a tone which was neither loud nor vehement the speaker was evidently not a practised oneonce or twice he hesitated as if for words to express his meaning but still he held on talking of faith and how it could remove mountains it is the only thing we want brethren in this world if we have that we are indeed rich as it will enable us to do our duty under all circumstances and to bear our lot however hard it may beand the lot of all mankind is hardthe lot of the poor is hard brethrenand who knows more of the poor than ia poor man myself and the son of a poor man but are the rich better off not so brethren for god is just the rich have their trials too i am not rich myself but i have seen the rich with careworn countenances i have also seen them in madhouses from which you may learn brethren that the lot of all mankind is hard that is till we lay hold of faith which makes us comfortable under all circumstances whether we ride in gilded chariots or walk barefooted in quest of bread whether we be ignorant whether we be wisefor riches and poverty ignorance and wisdom brethren each brings with it its peculiar temptations well under all these troubles the thing which i would recommend you to seek is one and the samefaith faith in our lord jesus christ who made us and allotted to each his station each has something to do brethren do it therefore but always in faith without faith we shall find ourselves sometimes at fault but with faith never for faith can remove the difficulty it will teach us to love life brethren when life is becoming bitter and to prize the blessings around us for as every man has his cares brethren so has each man his blessings it will likewise teach us not to love life over much seeing that we must one day part with it it will teach us to face death with resignation and will preserve us from sinking amidst the swelling of the river jordan and when he had concluded his address he said let us sing a hymn one composed by master charles wesleyhe was my countryman brethren jesus i cast my soul on thee mighty and merciful to save thou shalt to death go down with me and lay me gently in the grave this body then shall rest in hope this body which the worms destroy for thou shalt surely raise me up to glorious life and endless joy farewell preacher with the plain coat and the calm serious look i saw thee once again and that was latelyonly the other day it was near a fishing hamlet by the seaside that i saw the preacher again he stood on the top of a steep monticle used by pilots as a lookout for vessels approaching that coast a dangerous one abounding in rocks and quicksands there he stood on the monticle preaching to weatherworn fishermen and mariners gathered below upon the sand who is he said i to an old fisherman who stood beside me with a book of hymns in his hand but the old man put his hand to his lips and that was the only answer i received not a sound was heard but the voice of the preacher and the roaring of the waves but the voice was heard loud above the roaring of the sea for the preacher now spoke with power and his voice was not that of one who hesitates there he stoodno longer a young man for his black locks were become grey even like my own but there was the intelligent face and the calm serious look which had struck me of yore there stood the preacher one of those menand thank god their number is not fewwho animated by the spirit of christ amidst much poverty and alas much contempt persist in carrying the light of the gospel amidst the dark parishes of what but for their instrumentality would scarcely be christian england i would have waited till he had concluded in order that i might speak to him and endeavour to bring back the ancient scene to his recollection but suddenly a man came hurrying towards the monticle mounted on a speedy horse and holding by the bridle one yet more speedy and he whispered to me why loiterest thou hereknowest thou not all that is to be done before midnight and he flung me the bridle and i mounted on the horse of great speed and i followed the other who had already galloped off and as i departed i waved my hand to him on the monticle and i shouted farewell brother the seed came up at last after a long period and then i gave the speedy horse his way and leaning over the shoulder of the galloping horse i said would that my life had been like hiseven like that mansi now wandered along the heath till i came to a place where beside a thick furze sat a man his eyes fixed intently on the red ball of the setting sun thats not you jasper indeed brother ive not seen you for years how should you brother what

barouchethe rain gushes how for everything there is a time and a season and then how does the glory of a thing pass from it even like the flower of the grass this is a truism but it is one of those which are continually forcing themselves upon the mind many years have not passed over my head yet during those which i can recall to remembrance how many things have i seen flourish pass away and become forgotten except by myself who in spite of all my endeavours never can forget anything i have known the time when a pugilistic encounter between two noted champions was almost considered in the light of a national affair when tens of thousands of individuals high and low meditated and brooded upon it the first thing in the morning and the last at night until the great event was decided but the time is past and many people will say thank god that it is all i have to say is that the french still live on the other side of the water and are still casting their eyes hitherwardand that in the days of pugilism it was no vain boast to say that one englishman was a match for two of tother race at present it would be a vain boast to say so for these are not the days of pugilism but those to which the course of my narrative has carried me were the days of pugilism it was then at its height and consequently near its decline for corruption had crept into the ring and how many things states and sects among the rest owe their decline to this cause but what a bold and vigorous aspect pugilism wore at that time and the great battle was just then coming off the day had been decided upon and the spota convenient distance from the old town and to the old town were now flocking the bruisers of england men of tremendous renown let no one sneer at the bruisers of englandwhat were the gladiators of rome or the bullfighters of spain in its palmiest days compared to englands bruisers pity that ever corruption should have crept in amongst thembut of that i wish not to talk let us still hope that a spark of the old religion of which they were the priests still lingers in the breasts of englishmen there they come the bruisers from far london or from wherever else they might chance to be at the time to the great rendezvous in the old city some came one way some another some of tiptop reputation came with peers in their chariots for glory and fame are such fair things that even peers are proud to have those invested therewith by their sides others came in their own gigs driving their own bits of blood and i heard one say i have driven through at a heat the whole hundred and eleven miles and only stopped to bait twice oh the bloodhorses of old england but they too have had their dayfor everything beneath the sun there is a season and a time but the greater number come just as they can contrive on the tops of coaches for example and amongst these there are fellows with dark sallow faces and sharp shining eyes and it is these that have planted rottenness in the core of pugilism for they are jews and true to their kind have only base lucre in view it was fierce old cobbett i think who first said that the jews first introduced bad faith amongst pugilists he did not always speak the truth but at any rate he spoke it when he made that observation strange people the jewsendowed with every gift but one and that the highest genius divinegenius which can alone make of men demigods and elevate them above earth and what is earthy and grovelling without which a clever nationand who more clever than the jews may have rambams in plenty but never a fielding nor a shakespeare a rothschild and a mendoza yesbut never a kean nor a belcher so the bruisers of england are come to be present at the grand fight speedily coming off there they are met in the precincts of the old town near the field of the chapel planted with tender saplings at the restoration of sporting charles which are now become venerable elms as high as many a steeple there they are met at a fitting rendezvous where a retired coachman with one leg keeps an hotel and a bowlinggreen i think i now see them upon the bowlinggreen the men of renown amidst hundreds of people with no renown at all who gaze upon them with timid wonder fame after all is a glorious thing though it lasts only for a day theres cribb the champion of england and perhaps the best man in england there he is with his huge massive figure and face wonderfully like that of a lion there is belcher the younger not the mighty one who is gone to his place but the teucer belcher the most scientific pugilist that ever entered a ring only wanting strength to be i wont say what he appears to walk before me now as he did that evening with his white hat white greatcoat thin genteel figure springy step and keen determined eye crosses him what a contrast grim savage shelton who has a civil word for nobody and a hard blow for anybodyhard one blow given with the proper play of his athletic arm will unsense a giant yonder individual who strolls about with his hands behind him supporting his brown coat lappets undersized and who looks anything but what he is is the king of the light weights so called randall the terrible randall who has irish blood in his veins not the better for that nor the worse and not far from him is his last antagonist ned turner who though beaten by him still thinks himself as good a man in which he is perhaps right for it was a near thing and a better shentleman in which he is quite right for he is a welshman but how shall i name them all they were there by dozens and all tremendous in their way there was bulldog hudson and fearless scroggins who beat the conqueror of sam the jew there was black richmondno he was not there but i knew him well he was the most dangerous of blacks even with a broken thigh there was purcell who could never conquer till all seemed over with him there waswhat shall i name thee last ay why not i believe that thou art the last of all thatstrong family still above the sod where mayst thou long continuetrue piece of english stuff tom of bedfordsharp as winter kind as spring hail to thee tom of bedford or by whatever name it may please thee to be called spring or winter hail to thee sixfoot englishman of the brown eye worthy to have carried a sixfoot bow at flodden where englands yeomen triumphed over scotlands king his clans and chivalry hail to thee last of englands bruisers after all the many victories which thou hast achievedtrue english victories unbought by yellow gold need i recount them nay nay they are already well known to famesufficient to say that bristols bull and irelands champion were vanquished by thee and one mightier still gold itself thou didst overcome for gold itself strove in vain to deaden the power of thy arm and thus thou didst proceed till men left off challenging thee the unvanquishable the incorruptible tis a treat to see thee tom of bedford in thy public in holborn way whither thou hast retired with thy wellearned bays tis friday night and nine by holborn clock there sits the yeoman at the end of his long room surrounded by his friends glasses are filled and a song is the cry and a song is sung well suited to the place it finds an echo in every heartfists are clenched arms are waved and the portraits of the mighty fighting men of yore broughton and slack and ben which adorn the walls appear to smile grim approbation whilst many a manly voice joins in the bold chorus heres a health to old honest john bull when hes gone we shant find such another and with hearts and with glasses brim full we will drink to old england his mother but the fight with respect to the fight what shall i say little can be said about itit was soon over some said that the brave from town who was reputed the best man of the two and whose form was a perfect model of athletic beauty allowed himself for lucre vile to be vanquished by the massive champion with the flattened nose one thing is certain that the former was suddenly seen to sink to the earth before a blow of by no means extraordinary power time time was called but there he lay upon the ground apparently senseless and from thence he did not lift his head till several seconds after the umpires had declared his adversary victor there were shouts indeed theres never a lack of shouts to celebrate a victory however acquired but there was also much grinding of teeth especially amongst the fighting men from town tom has sold us said they sold us to the yokels who would have thought it then there was fresh grinding of teeth and scowling brows were turned to the heaven but what is this is it possible does the heaven scowl too why only a quarter of an hour ago but what may not happen in a quarter of an hour for many weeks the weather had been of the most glorious description the eventful day too had dawned gloriously and so it had continued till some two hours after noon the fight was then over and about that time i looked upwhat a glorious sky of deep blue and what a big fierce sun swimming high above in the midst of that blue not a cloudthere had not been one for weeksnot a cloud to be seen only in the far west just on the horizon something like the extremity of a black wing that was only a quarter of an hour ago and now the whole northern side of the heaven is occupied by a huge black cloud and the sun is only occasionally seen amidst masses of driving vapour what a change but another fight is at hand and the pugilists are clearing the outer ringhow their huge whips come crashing upon the heads of the yokels blood flows more blood than in the fight those blows are given with right goodwill those are not sham blows whether of whip or fist it is with fist that grim shelton strikes down the big yokel he is always dangerous grim shelton but now particularly so for he has lost ten pounds betted on the brave who sold himself to the yokels but the outer ring is cleared and now the second fight commences it is between two champions of less renown than the others but is perhaps not the worse on that account a tall thin boy is fighting in the ring with a man somewhat under the middle size with a frame of adamant thats a gallant boy hes a yokel but he comes from brummagem and he does credit to his extraction but his adversary has a frame of adamant in what a strange light they fight but who can wonder on looking at that frightful cloud usurping now onehalf of heaven and at the sun struggling with sulphurous vapour the face of the boy which is turned towards me looks horrible in that light but he is a brave boy he strikes his foe on the forehead and the report of the blow is like the sound of a hammer against a rock but there is a rush and a roar overhead a wild commotion the tempest is beginning to break loose theres wind and dust a crash rain and hail is it possible to fight amidst such a commotion yes the fight goes on again the boy strikes the man full on the brow but it is of no use striking that man his frame is of adamant boy thy strength is beginning to give way and thou art becoming confused the man now goes to work amidst rain and hail boy thou wilt not hold out ten minutes longer against rain hail and the blows of such an antagonist and now the storm was at its height the black thundercloud had broken into many which assumed the wildest shapes and the strangest colours some of them unspeakably glorious the rain poured in a deluge and more than one waterspout was seen at no great distance an immense rabble is hurrying in one direction a multitude of men of all ranks peers and yokels prizefighters and jews and the last came to plunder and are now plundering amidst that wild confusion of hail and rain men and horses carts and carriages but all hurry in one direction through mud and mire theres a town only three miles distant which is soon reached and soon filled it will not contain onethird of that mighty rabble but theres another town farther onthe good old city is farther on only twelve miles whats that who will stay here onward to the old townhurryskurry a mixed multitude of men and horses carts and carriages all in the direction of the old town and in the midst of all that mad throng at a moment when the rain gushes were coming down with particular fury and the artillery of the sky was pealing as i had never heard it peal before i felt some one seize me by the armi turned round and beheld mr petulengro i cant hear you mr petulengro said i for the thunder drowned the words which he appeared to be uttering dearginni i heard mr petulengro say it thundereth i was asking brother whether you believe in dukkeripens i do not mr petulengro but this is strange weather to be asking me whether i believe in fortunes grondinni said mr petulengro it haileth i believe in dukkeripens brother and who has more right said i seeing that you live by them but this tempest is truly horrible dearginni grondinni ta villaminni it thundereth it haileth and also flameth said mr petulengro look up there brother i looked up connected with this tempest there was one feature to which i have already alludedthe wonderful colours of the clouds some were of vivid green others of the brightest orange others as black as pitch the gypsys finger was pointed to a particular part of the sky what do you see there brother a strange kind of cloud what does it look like brother something like a stream of blood that cloud foreshoweth a bloody dukkeripen a bloody fortune said i and whom may it betide who knows said the gypsy down the way dashing and splashing and scattering man horse and cart to the left and right came an open barouche drawn by four smoking steeds with postillions in scarlet jackets and leather skullcaps two forms were conspicuous in it that of the successful bruiser and of his friend and backer the sporting gentleman of my acquaintance his said the gypsy pointing to the latter whose stern features wore a smile of triumph as probably recognising me in the crowd he nodded in the direction of where i stood as the barouche hurried by there went the barouche dashing through the rain gushes and in it one whose boast it was that he was equal to either fortune many have heard of that manmany may be desirous of knowing yet more of him i have nothing to do with that mans after lifehe fulfilled his dukkeripen a bad violent man softly friend when thou wouldst speak harshly of the dead remember that thou hast not yet fulfilled thy own dukkeripenchapter xxvii my fatherpremature decaythe easy chaira few questionsso you told mea difficult languagethey call it haikmisused opportunitiessaulwant of candourdont weepheaven forgive medated from parisi wish he were herea fathers reminiscencesfarewell to vanities my father as i have already informed the reader had been endowed by nature with great corporeal strength indeed i have been assured that at the period of his prime his figure had denoted the possession of almost herculean powers the strongest forms however do not always endure the longest the very excess of the noble and generous juices which they contain being the cause of their premature decay but be that as it may the health of my father some few years after his retirement from the service to the quiet of domestic life underwent a considerable change his constitution appeared to be breaking up and he was subject to severe attacks from various disorders with which till then he had been utterly unacquainted he was however wont to rally more or less after his illnesses and might still occasionally be seen taking his walk with his cane in his hand and accompanied by his dog who sympathised entirely with him pining as he pined improving as he improved and never leaving the house save in his company and in this manner matters went on for a considerable time no very great apprehension with respect to my fathers state being raised either in my mothers breast or my own but about six months after the period at which i have arrived in my last chapter it came to pass that my father experienced a severer attack than on any previous occasion he had the best medical advice but it was easy to see from the looks of his doctors that they entertained but slight hopes of his recovery his sufferings were great yet he invariably bore them with unshaken fortitude there was one thing remarkable connected with his illness notwithstanding its severity it never confined him to his bed he was wont to sit in his little parlour in his easy chair dressed in a faded regimental coat his dog at his feet who would occasionally lift his head from the hearthrug on which he lay and look his master wistfully in the face and thus my father spent the greater part of his time sometimes in prayer sometimes in meditation and sometimes in reading the scriptures i frequently sat with him though as i entertained a great awe for my father i used to feel rather ill at ease when as sometimes happened i found myself alone with him i wish to ask you a few questions said he to me one day after my mother had left the room i will answer anything you may please to ask me my dear father what have you been about lately i have been occupied as usual attending at the office at the appointed hours and what do you there whatever i am ordered and nothing else oh yes sometimes i read a book connected with your profession not always i have been lately reading armenian whats that the language of a people whose country is a region on the other side of asia minor well a region abounding with mountains well amongst which is mount ararat well upon which as the bible informs us the ark rested wellit is the language of the people of those regions so you told me and i have been reading the bible in their language well or rather i should say in the ancient language of these people from which i am told the modern armenian differs considerably well as much as the italian from the latin well so i have been reading the bible in ancient armenian you told me so before i found it a highly difficult language yes differing widely from the languages in general with which i am acquainted yes exhibiting however some features in common with them yes and sometimes agreeing remarkably in words with a certain strange wild speech with which i became acquainted irish no father not irishwith which i became acquainted by the greatest chance in the world yes but of which i need say nothing farther at present and which i should not have mentioned but for that fact well which i consider remarkable yes the armenian is copious is it with an alphabet of thirtynine letters but it is harsh and guttural yes like the language of most mountainous peoplethe armenians call it haik do they and themselves haik also they are a remarkable people and though their original habitation is the mountain of ararat they are to be found like the jews all over the world wellwell father thats all i can tell you about the haiks or armenians and what does it all amount to very little father indeed there is very little known about the armenians their early history in particular is involved in considerable mystery and if you knew all that it was possible to know about them to what would it amount to what earthly purpose could you turn it have you acquired any knowledge of your profession very little father very little have you acquired all in your power i cant say that i have father and yet it was your duty to have done so but i see how it is you have shamefully misused your opportunities you are like one who sent into the field to labour passes his time in flinging stones at the birds of heaven i would scorn to fling a stone at a bird father you know what i mean and all too well and this attempt to evade deserved reproof by feigned simplicity is quite in character with your general behaviour i have ever observed about you a want of frankness which has distressed me you never speak of what you are about your hopes or your projects but cover yourself with mystery i never knew till the present moment that you were acquainted with armenian because you never asked me father theres nothing to conceal in the matteri will tell you in a moment how i came to learn armenian a lady whom i met at one of mrs s parties took a fancy to me and has done me the honour to allow me to go and see her sometimes she is the widow of a rich clergyman and on her husbands death came to this place to live bringing her husbands library with her i soon found my way to it and examined every book her husband must have been a learned man for amongst much greek and hebrew i found several volumes in armenian or relating to the language and why did you not tell me of this before because you never questioned me but i repeat there is nothing to conceal in the matter the lady took a fancy to me and being fond of the arts drew my portrait she said the expression of my countenance put her in mind of alfieris saul and do you still visit her no she soon grew tired of me and told people that she found me very stupid she gave me the armenian books however saul said my father musingly saul i am afraid she was only too right there he disobeyed the commands of his master and brought down on his head the vengeance of heavenhe became a maniac prophesied and flung weapons about him he was indeed an awful characteri hope i shant turn out like him god forbid said my father solemnly but in many respects you are headstrong and disobedient like him i placed you in a profession and besought you to make yourself master of it by giving it your undivided attention this however you did not do you know nothing of it but tell me that you are acquainted with armenian but what i dislike most is your want of candouryou are my son but i know little of your real history you may know fifty things for what i am aware you may know how to shoe a horse for what i am aware not only to shoe a horse father but to make horseshoes perhaps so said my father and it only serves to prove what i was just saying that i know little about you but you easily may my dear father i will tell you anything that you may wish to knowshall i inform you how i learnt to make horseshoes no said my father as you kept it a secret so long it may as well continue so still had you been a frank openhearted boy like one i could name you would have told me all about it of your own accord but i now wish to ask you a serious questionwhat do you propose to doto do father yes the time for which you were articled to your profession will soon be expired and i shall be no more do not talk so my dear father i have no doubt that you will soon be better do not flatter yourself i feel that my days are numbered i am soon going to my rest and i have need of rest for i am weary there there dont weep tears will help me as little as they will you you have not yet answered my question tell me what you intend to do i really do not know what i shall do the military pension which i enjoy will cease with my life the property which i shall leave behind me will be barely sufficient for the maintenance of your mother respectably i again ask you what you intend to do do you think you can support yourself by your armenian or your other acquirements alas i think little at all about it but i suppose i must push into the world and make a good fight as becomes the son of him who fought big ben if i cant succeed and am driven to the worst it is but dying what do you mean by dying leaving the world my loss would scarcely be felt i have never held life in much value and every one has a right to dispose as he thinks best of that which is his own ah now i understand you and well i know how and where you imbibed that horrible doctrine and many similar ones which i have heard from your mouth but i wish not to reproach youi view in your conduct a punishment for my own sins and i bow to the will of god few and evil have been my days upon the earth little have i done to which i can look back with satisfaction it is true i have served my king fifty years and i have fought withheaven forgive me what was i about to saybut you mentioned the mans name and our minds willingly recall our ancient follies few and evil have been my days upon earth i may say with jacob of old though i do not mean to say that my case is so hard as his he had many undutiful children whilst i have only but i will not reproach you i have also like him a son to whom i can look with hope who may yet preserve my name when i am gone so let me be thankful perhaps after all i have not lived in vain boy when i am gone look up to your brother and may god bless you both there dont weep but take the bible and read me something about the old man and his children my brother had now been absent for the space of three years at first his letters had been frequent and from them it appeared that he was following his profession in london with industry they then became rather rare and my father did not always communicate their contents his last letter however had filled him and our whole little family with joy it was dated from paris and the writer was evidently in high spirits after describing in eloquent terms the beauties and gaieties of the french capital he informed us how he had plenty of money having copied a celebrated picture of one of the italian masters for a hungarian nobleman for which he had received a large sum he wishes me to go with him to italy added he but i am fond of independence and if ever i visit old rome i will have no patrons near me to distract my attention but six months had now elapsed from the date of this letter and we had heard no farther intelligence of my brother my fathers complaint increased the gout his principal enemy occasionally mounted high up in his system and we had considerable difficulty in keeping it from the stomach where it generally proves fatal i now devoted almost the whole of my time to my father on whom his faithful partner also lavished every attention and care i read the bible to him which was his chief delight and also occasionally such other books as i thought might prove entertaining to him his spirits were generally rather depressed the absence of my brother appeared to prey upon his mind i wish he were here he would frequently exclaim i cant imagine what can have become of him i trust however he will arrive in time he still sometimes rallied and i took advantage of those moments of comparative ease to question him upon the events of his early life my attentions to him had not passed unnoticed and he was kind fatherly and unreserved i had never known my father so entertaining as at these moments when his life was but too evidently drawing to a close i had no idea that he knew and had seen so much my respect for him increased and i looked upon him almost with admiration his anecdotes were in general highly curious some of them related to people in the highest stations and to men whose names were closely connected with some of the brightest glories of our native land he had frequently conversed almost on terms of familiaritywith good old george he had known the conqueror of tippoo saib and was the friend of townshend who when wolfe fell led the british grenadiers against the shrinking regiments of montcalm pity he added that when oldold as i am nowhe should have driven his own son mad by robbing him of his plighted bride but so it was he married his sons bride i saw him lead her to the altar if ever there was an angelic countenance it was that girls she was almost too fair to be one of the daughters of women is there anything boy that you would wish to ask me now is the time yes father there is one about whom i would fain question youwho is it shall i tell you about elliot no father not about elliot but pray dont be angry i should like to know something about big ben you are a strange lad said my father and though of late i have begun to entertain a more favourable opinion than heretofore there is still much about you that i do not understand why do you bring up that name dont you know that it is one of my temptations you wish to know something about him well i will oblige you this once and then farewell to such vanitiessomething about him i will tell youhis skin when he flung off his clothesand he had a particular knack in doing sohis skin when he bared his mighty chest and back for combatand when he fought he stood so if i remember righthis skin i say was brown and dusky as that of a toad oh me i wish my elder son was herechapter xxviii my brothers arrivalthe interviewnighta dying fatherchrist at last my brother arrived he looked pale and unwell i met him at the door you have been long absent said i yes said he perhaps too long but how is my father very poorly said i he has had a fresh attack but where have you been of late far and wide said my brother but i cant tell you anything now i must go to my father it was only by chance that i heard of his illness stay a moment said i is the world such a fine place as you supposed it to be before you went away not quite said my brother not quite indeed i wishbut ask me no questions now i must hasten to my father there was another question on my tongue but i forbore for the eyes of the young man were full of tears i pointed with my finger and the young man hastened past me to the arms of his father i forbore to ask my brother whether he had been to old rome what passed between my father and brother i do not know the interview no doubt was tender enough for they tenderly loved each other but my brothers arrival did not produce the beneficial effect upon my father which i at first hoped it would it did not even appear to have raised his spirits he was composed enough however i ought to be grateful said he i wished to see my son and god has granted me my wish what more have i to do now than to bless my little family and go my fathers end was evidently at hand and did i shed no tears did i breathe no sighs did i never wring my hands at this period the reader will perhaps be asking whatever i did and thought is best known to god and myself but it will be as well to observe that it is possible to feel deeply and yet make no outward sign and now for the closing scene at the dead hour of night it might be about two i was awakened from sleep by a cry which sounded from the room immediately below that in which i slept i knew the cry it was the cry of my mother and i also knew its import yet i made no effort to rise for i was for the moment paralysed again the cry sounded yet still i lay motionlessthe stupidity of horror was upon me a third time and it was then that by a violent effort bursting the spell which appeared to bind me i sprang from the bed and rushed downstairs my mother was running wildly about the room she had awoke and found my father senseless in the bed by her side i essayed to raise him and after a few efforts supported him in the bed in a sitting posture my brother now rushed in and snatching up a light that was burning he held it to my fathers face the surgeon the surgeon he cried then dropping the light he ran out of the room followed by my mother i remained alone supporting the senseless form of my father the light had been extinguished by the fall and an almost total darkness reigned in the room the form pressed heavily against my bosomat last methought it moved yes i was right there was a heaving of the breast and then a gasping were those words which i heard yes they were words low and indistinct at first and then audible the mind of the dying man was reverting to former scenes i heard him mention names which i had often heard him mention before it was an awful moment i felt stupefied but i still contrived to support my dying father there was a pause again my father spoke i heard him speak of minden and of meredith the old minden sergeant and then he uttered another name which at one period of his life was much in his lips the name of but this is a solemn moment there was a deep gasp i shook and thought all was over but i was mistakenmy father moved and revived for a moment he supported himself in bed without my assistance i make no doubt that for a moment he was perfectly sensible and it was then that clasping his hands he uttered another name clearly distinctlyit was the name of christ with that name upon his lips the brave old soldier sank back upon my bosom and with his hands still clasped yielded up his soulchapter xxix the greetingqueer figurecheer upthe cheerful fireit will dothe sally forthtrepidationlet him come in oneandninepence sir or the things which you have brought with you will be taken away from you such were the first words which greeted my ears one damp misty morning in march as i dismounted from the top of a coach in the yard of a london inn i turned round for i felt that the words were addressed to myself plenty of people were in the yardporters passengers coachmen ostlers and others who appeared to be intent on anything but myself with the exception of one individual whose business appeared to lie with me and who now confronted me at the distance of about two yards i looked hard at the manand a queer kind of individual he was to look ata rakish figure about thirty and of the middle size dressed in a coat smartly cut but threadbare very tight pantaloons of blue stuff tied at the ankles dirty white stockings and thin shoes like those of a dancingmaster his features were not ugly but rather haggard and he appeared to owe his complexion less to nature than carmine in fact in every respect a very queer figure oneandninepence sir or your things will be taken away from you he said in a kind of lisping tone coming yet nearer to me i still remained staring fixedly at him but never a word answered our eyes met whereupon he suddenly lost the easy impudent air which he before wore he glanced for a moment at my fist which i had by this time clenched and his features became yet more haggard he faltered a fresh oneandninepence which he was about to utter died on his lips he shrank back disappeared behind a coach and i saw no more of him oneandninepence or my things will be taken away from me said i to myself musingly as i followed the porter to whom i had delivered my scanty baggage am i to expect many of these greetings in the big world well never mind i think i know the countersign and i clenched my fist yet harder than before so i followed the porter through the streets of london to a lodging which had been prepared for me by an acquaintance the morning as i have before said was gloomy and the streets through which i passed were dank and filthy the people also looked dank and filthy and so probably did i for the night had been rainy and i had come upwards of a hundred miles on the top of a coach my heart had sunk within me by the time we reached a dark narrow street in which was the lodging cheer up young man said the porter we shall have a fine afternoon and presently i found myself in the lodging which had been prepared for me it consisted of a small room up two pair of stairs in which i was to sit and another still smaller above it in which i was to sleep i remember that i sat down and looked disconsolate about meeverything seemed so cold and dingy yet how little is required to make a situation however cheerless at first sightcheerful and comfortable the people of the house who looked kindly upon me lighted a fire in the dingy grate and then what a changethe dingy room seemed dingy no more oh the luxury of a cheerful fire after a chill nights journey i drew near to the blazing grate rubbed my hands and felt glad and when i had warmed myself i turned to the table on which by this time the people of the house had placed my breakfast and i ate and i drank and as i ate and drank i mused within myself and my eyes were frequently directed to a small green box which constituted part of my luggage and which with the rest of my things stood in one corner of the room till at last leaving my breakfast unfinished i rose and going to the box unlocked it and took out two or three bundles of papers tied with red tape and placing them on the table i resumed my seat and my breakfast my eyes intently fixed upon the bundles of papers all the time and when i had drained the last cup of tea out of a dingy teapot and ate the last slice of the dingy loaf i untied one of the bundles and proceeded to look over the papers which were closely written over in a singular hand and i read for some time till at last i said to myself it will do and then i looked at the other bundle for some time without untying it and at last i said it will do also and then i turned to the fire and putting my feet against the sides of the grate i leaned back on my chair and with my eyes upon the fire fell into deep thought and there i continued in thought before the fire until my eyes closed and i fell asleep which was not to be wondered at after the fatigue and cold which i had lately undergone on the coachtop and in my sleep i imagined myself still there amidst darkness and rain hurrying now over wild heaths and now along roads overhung with thick and umbrageous trees and sometimes methought i heard the horn of the guard and sometimes the voice of the coachman now chiding now encouraging his horses as they toiled through the deep and miry ways at length a tremendous crack of a whipsaluted the tympanum of my ear and i started up broad awake nearly oversetting the chair on which i reclinedand lo i was in the dingy room before the fire which was by this time half extinguished in my dream i had confounded the noise of the street with those of my nightjourney the crack which had aroused me i soon found proceeded from the whip of a carter who with many oaths was flogging his team below the window looking at a clock which stood upon the mantelpiece i perceived that it was past eleven whereupon i said to myself i am wasting my time foolishly and unprofitably forgetting that i am now in the big world without anything to depend upon save my own exertions and then i adjusted my dress and locking up the bundle of papers which i had not read i tied up the other and taking it under my arm i went downstairs and after asking a question or two of the people of the house i sallied forth into the street with a determined look though at heart i felt somewhat timorous at the idea of venturing out alone into the mazes of the mighty city of which i had heard much but of which of my own knowledge i knew nothing i had however no great cause for anxiety in the present instance i easily found my way to the place which i was in quest ofone of the many new squares on the northern side of the metropolis and which was scarcely ten minutes walk from the street in which i had taken up my abode arriving before the door of a tolerably large house which bore a certain number i stood still for a moment in a kind of trepidation looking anxiously at the door i then slowly passed on till i came to the end of the square where i stood still and pondered for a while suddenly however like one who has formed a resolution i clenched my right hand flinging my hat somewhat on one side and turning back with haste to the door before which i had stopped i sprang up the steps and gave a loud rap ringing at the same time the bell of the area after the lapse of a minute the door was opened by a maidservant of no very cleanly or prepossessing appearance of whom i demanded in a tone of some hauteur whether the master of the house was at home glancing for a moment at the white paper bundle beneath my arm the handmaid made no reply in words but with a kind of toss of her head flung the door open standing on one side as if to let me enter i did enter and the handmaid having opened another door on the right hand went in and said something which i could not hear after a considerable pause however i heard the voice of a man say let him come in whereupon the handmaid coming out motioned me to enter and on my obeying instantly closed the door behind mechapter xxx the sinister glanceexcellent correspondentquite originalmy systema losing trademeritstarting a reviewwhat have you gotstopdairymans daughteroxford principlesmore conversationhow is this there were two individuals in the room in which i now found myself it was a small study surrounded with bookcases the window looking out upon the square of these individuals he who appeared to be the principal stood with his back to the fireplace he was a tall stout man about sixty dressed in a loose morning gown the expression of his countenance would have been bluff but for a certain sinister glance and his complexion might have been called rubicund but for a considerable tinge of bilious yellow he eyed me askance as i entered the other a pale shrivelledlooking person sat at a table apparently engaged with an accountbook he took no manner of notice of me never once lifting his eyes from the page before him well sir what is your pleasure said the big man in a rough tone as i stood there looking at him wistfullyas well i mightfor upon that man at the time of which i am speaking my principal i may say my only hopes rested sir said i my name is soandso and i am the bearer of a letter to you from mr soandso an old friend and correspondent of yours the countenance of the big man instantly lost the suspicious and lowering expression which it had hitherto exhibited he strode forward and seizing me by the hand gave me a violent squeeze my dear sir said he i am rejoiced to see you in london i have been long anxious for the pleasurewe are old friends though we have never before met taggart said he to the man who sat at the desk this is our excellent correspondent the friend and pupil of our other excellent correspondent the pale shrivelledlooking man slowly and deliberately raised his head from the accountbook and surveyed me for a moment or two not the slightest emotion was observable in his countenance it appeared to me however that i could detect a droll twinkle in his eye his curiosity if he had any was soon gratified he made me a kind of bow pulled out a snuffbox took a pinch of snuff and again bent his head over the page and now my dear sir said the big man pray sit down and tell me the cause of your visit i hope you intend to remain here a day or two more than that said i i am come to take up my abode in london glad to hear it and what have you been about of late got anything which will suit me sir i admire your style of writing and your manner of thinking and i am much obliged to my good friend and correspondent for sending me some of your productions i inserted them all and wished there had been more of themquite original sir quite took with the public especially the essay about the nonexistence of anything i dont exactly agree with you though i have my own peculiar ideas about matteras you know of course from the book i have published nevertheless a very pretty piece of speculative philosophyno such thing as matterimpossible that there should beex nihilowhat is the greek i have forgotvery pretty indeed very original i am afraid sir it was very wrong to write such trash and yet more to allow it to be published trash not at all a very pretty piece of speculative philosophy of course you were wrong in saying there is no world the world must exist to have the shape of a pear and that the world is shaped like a pear and not like an apple as the fools of oxford say i have satisfactorily proved in my book now if there were no world what would become of my system but what do you propose to do in london here is the letter sir said i of our good friend which i have not yet given to you i believe it will explain to you the circumstances under which i come he took the letter and perused it with attention hem said he with a somewhat altered manner my friend tells me that you are come up to london with the view of turning your literary talents to account and desires me to assist you in my capacity of publisher in bringing forth two or three works which you have prepared my good friend is perhaps not aware that for some time past i have given up publishingwas obliged to do sohad many severe lossesdo nothing at present in that line save sending out the magazine once a month and between ourselves am thinking of disposing of thatwish to retirehigh time at my ageso you see i am very sorry sir to hear that you cannot assist me and i remember that i felt very nervous i had hoped a losing trade i assure you sir literature is a drug taggart what oclock is itwell sir said i rising as you cannot assist me i will now take my leave i thank you sincerely for your kind reception and will trouble you no longer oh dont go i wish to have some farther conversation with you and perhaps i may hit upon some plan to benefit you i honour merit and always make a point to encourage it when i can but taggart go to the bank and tell them to dishonour the bill twelve months after date for thirty pounds which becomes due tomorrow i am dissatisfied with that fellow who wrote the fairy tales and intend to give him all the trouble in my power make haste taggart did not appear to be in any particular haste first of all he took a pinch of snuff then rising from his chair slowly and deliberately drew his wig for he wore a wig of a brown colour rather more over his forehead than it had previously been buttoned his coat and taking his hat and an umbrella which stood in a corner made me a low bow and quitted the room well sir where were we oh i remember we were talking about merit sir i always wish to encourage merit especially when it comes so highly recommended as in the present instance sir my good friend and correspondent speaks of you in the highest terms sir i honour my good friend and have the highest respect for his opinion in all matters connected with literaturerather eccentric though sir my good friend has done my periodical more good and more harm than all the rest of my correspondents sir i shall never forget the sensation caused by the appearance of his article about a certain personage whom he provedand i think satisfactorilyto have been a legionary soldierrather startling was it not the s of the world a common soldier in a marching regimentoriginal but startling sir i honour my good friend so you have renounced publishing sir said i with the exception of the magazine why yes except now and then under the rose the old coachman you know likes to hear the whip indeed at the present moment i am thinking of starting a review on an entirely new and original principle and it just struck me that you might be of high utility in the undertakingwhat do you think of the matter i should be happy sir to render you any assistance but i am afraid the employment you propose requires other qualifications than i possess however i can make the essay my chief intention in coming to london was to lay before the world what i had prepared and i had hoped by your assistance ah i see ambition ambition is a very pretty thing but sir we must walk before we run according to the old saying what is that you have got under your arm one of the works to which i was alluding the one indeed which i am most anxious to lay before the world as i hope to derive from it both profit and reputation indeed what do you call it ancient songs of denmark heroic and romantic translated by myself with notes philological critical and historical then sir i assure you that your time and labour have been entirely flung away nobody would read your ballads if you were to give them to the world tomorrow i am sure sir that you would say otherwise if you would permit me to read one to you and without waiting for the answer of the big man nor indeed so much as looking at him to see whether he was inclined or not to hear me i undid my manuscript and with a voice trembling with eagerness i read to the following effect buckshank bold and elfinstone and more than i can mention here they caused to be built so stout a ship and unto iceland they would steer they launched the ship upon the main which bellowed like a wrathful bear down to the bottom the vessel sank a laidly trold has dragged it there down to the bottom sank young roland and round about he groped awhile until he found the path which led unto the bower of ellenlyle stop said the publisher very pretty indeed and very original beats scott hollow and percy too but sir the day forthese things is gone by nobody at present cares for percy nor for scott either save as a novelist sorry to discourage merit sir but what can i do what else have you got the songs of ab gwilym the welsh bard also translated by myself with notes critical philological and historical pass onwhat else nothing else said i folding up my manuscript with a sigh unless it be a romance in the german style on which i confess i set very little value wild yes sir very wild like the miller of the black valley yes sir very much like the miller of the black valley well thats better said the publisher and yet i dont know i question whether any one at present cares for the miller himself no sir the time for those things is also gone by german at present is a drug and between ourselves nobody has contributed to make it so more than my good friend and correspondentbut sir i see you are a young gentleman of infinite merit and i always wish to encourage merit dont you think you could write a series of evangelical tales evangelical tales sir yes sir evangelical novels something in the style of herder herder is a drug sir nobody cares for herderthanks to my good friend sir i have in yon drawer a hundred pages about herder which i dare not insert in my periodical it would sink it sir no sir something in the style of the dairymans daughter i never heard of the work till the present moment then sir procure it by all means sir i could afford as much as ten pounds for a wellwritten tale in the style of the dairymans daughter that is the kind of literature sir that sells at the present day it is not the miller of the black valley no sir nor herder either that will suit the present taste the evangelical body is becoming very strong sir the canting scoundrels but sir surely you would not pander to a scoundrelly taste then sir i must give up business altogether sir i have a great respect for the goddess reasonan infinite respect sir indeed in my time i have made a great many sacrifices for her but sir i cannot altogether ruin myself for the goddess reason sir i am a friend to liberty as is well known but i must also be a friend to my own family it is with the view of providing for a son of mine that i am about to start the review of which i was speaking he has taken into his head to marry sir and i must do something for him for he can do but little for himself well sir i am a friend to liberty as i said before and likewise a friend to reason but i tell you frankly that the review which i intend to get up under the rose and present him with when it is established will be conducted on oxford principles orthodox principles i suppose you mean sir i do sir i am no linguist but i believe the words are synonymous much more conversation passed between us and it was agreed that i should become a contributor to the oxford review i stipulated however that as i knew little of politics and cared less no other articles should be required from me than such as were connected with belleslettres and philology to this the big man readily assented nothing will be required from you said he but what you mention and now and then perhaps a paper on metaphysics you understand german and perhaps it would be desirable that you should review kant and in a review of kant sir you could introduce to advantage your peculiar notions about ex nihilo he then reverted to the subject of the dairymans daughter which i promised to take into consideration as i was going away he invited me to dine with him on the ensuing sunday thats a strange man said i to myself after i had left the house he is evidently very clever but i cannot say that i like him much with his oxford reviews and dairymans daughters but what can i do i am almost without a friend in theworld i wish i could find some one who would publish my ballads or my songs of ab gwilym in spite of what the big man says i am convinced that once published they would bring me much fame and profit but how is thiswhat a beautiful sunthe porter was right in saying that the day would clear upi will now go to my dingy lodging lock up my manuscripts and then take a stroll about the big citychapter xxxi the walklondons cheapestreet of the lombardsstrange bridgemain archthe roaring gulfthe boat clyfakinga comfortthe bookthe blessed womanno trap so i set out on my walk to see the wonders of the big city and as chance would have it i directed my course to the east the day as i have already said had become very fine so that i saw the great city to advantage and the wonders thereof and much i admired all i saw and amongst other things the huge cathedral standing so proudly on the most commanding ground in the big city and i looked up to the mighty dome surmounted by a golden cross and i said within myself that dome must needs be the finest in the world and i gazed upon it till my eyes reeled and my brain became dizzy and i thought that the dome would fall and crush me and i shrank within myself and struck yet deeper into the heart of the big city o cheapside cheapside said i as i advanced up that mighty thoroughfare truly thou art a wonderful place for hurry noise and riches men talk of the bazaars of the easti have never seen thembut i dare say that compared with thee they are poor places silent places abounding with empty boxes o thou pride of londons eastmighty mart of old renownfor thou art not a place of yesterdaylong before the roses red and white battled in fair england thou didst exista place of throng and bustlea place of gold and silver perfumes and fine linen centuries ago thou couldst extort the praises even of the fiercest foes of england fierce bards of wales sworn foes of england sang thy praises centuries ago and even the fiercest of them all red julius himself wild glendowers bard had a word of praise for londons cheape for so the bards of wales styled thee in their flowing odes then if those who were not english and hated england and all connected therewith had yet much to say in thy praise when thou wast far inferior to what thou art now why should trueborn englishmen or those who call themselves so turn up their noses at thee and scoff thee at the present day as i believe they do but let others do as they will i at least who am not only an englishman but an east englishman will not turn up my nose at thee but will praise and extol thee calling thee mart of the worlda place of wonder and astonishmentand were it right and fitting to wish that anything should endure for ever i would say prosperity to cheapside throughout all agesmay it be the worlds resort for merchandise world without end and when i had passed through the cheape i entered another street which led up a kind of ascent and which proved to be the street of the lombards called so from the name of its first founders and i walked rapidly up the street of the lombards neither looking to the right nor left for it had no interest for me though i had a kind of consciousness that mighty things were being transacted behind its walls but it wanted the throng bustle and outward magnificence of the cheape and it had never been spoken of by ruddy bards and when i had got to the end of the street of the lombards i stood still for some time deliberating within myself whether i should turn to the right or the left or go straight forward and at last i turned to the right down a street of rapid descent and presently found myself upon a bridge which traversed the river which runs by the big city a strange kind of bridge it was huge and massive and seemingly of great antiquity it had an arched back like that of a hog a high balustrade and at either side at intervals were stone bowers bulking over the river but open on the other side and furnished with a semicircular bench though the bridge was widevery wideit was all too narrow for the concourse upon it thousands of human beings were pouring over the bridge but what chiefly struck my attention was a double row of carts and wagons the generality drawn by horses as large as elephants each row striving hard in a different direction and not unfrequently brought to a standstill oh the cracking of whips the shouts and oaths of the carters and the grating of wheels upon the enormous stones that formed the pavement in fact there was a wild hurlyburly upon the bridge which nearly deafened me but if upon the bridge there was a confusion below it there was a confusion ten times confounded the tide which was fast ebbing obstructed by the immense piers of the old bridge poured beneath the arches with a fall of several feet forming in the river below as many whirlpools as there were arches truly tremendous was the roar of the descending waters and the bellow of the tremendous gulfs which swallowed them for a time and then cast them forth foaming and frothing from their horrid wombs slowly advancing along the bridge i came to the highest point and there i stood still close beside one of the stone bowers in which beside a fruitstall sat an old woman with a pan of charcoal at her feet and a book in her hand in which she appeared to be reading intently there i stood just above the principal arch looking through the balustrade at the scene that presented itselfand such a scene towards the left bank of the river a forest of masts thick and close as far as the eye could reach spacious wharfs surmounted with gigantic edifices and far away cæsars castle with its white tower to the right another forest of masts and a maze of buildings from which here and there shot up to the sky chimneys taller than cleopatras needle vomiting forth huge wreaths of that black smoke which forms the canopyoccasionally a gorgeous oneof the more than babel city stretching before me the troubled breast of the mighty river and immediately below the main whirlpool of the thamesthe maëlstrom of the bulwarks of the middle archa grisly pool which with its superabundance of horror fascinated me who knows but i should have leapt into its depthsi have heard of such thingsbut for a rather startling occurrence which broke the spell as i stood upon the bridge gazing into the jaws of the pool a small boat shot suddenly through the arch beneath my feet there were three persons in it an oarsman in the middle whilst a man and woman sat at the stern i shall never forget the thrill of horror which went through me at thissudden apparition whata boata small boatpassing beneath that arch into yonder roaring gulf yes yes down through that awful waterway with more than the swiftness of an arrow shot the boat or skiff right into the jaws of the pool a monstrous breaker curls over the prowthere is no hope the boat is swamped and all drowned in that strangling vortex no the boat which appeared to have the buoyancy of a feather skipped over the threatening horror and the next moment was out of danger the boatmana true boatman of cockaigne thatelevating one of his sculls in sign of triumph the man hallooing and the woman a true englishwoman thatof a certain classwaving her shawl whether any one observed them save myself or whether the feat was a common one i know not but nobody appeared to take any notice of them as for myself i was so excited that i strove to clamber up the balustrade of the bridge in order to obtain a better view of the daring adventurers before i could accomplish my design however i felt myself seized by the body and turning my head perceived the old fruitwoman who was clinging to me nay dear dontdont said she dont fling yourself overperhaps you may have better luck next time i was not going to fling myself over said i dropping from the balustrade how came you to think of such a thing why seeing you clamber up so fiercely i thought you might have had ill luck and that you wished to make away with yourself ill luck said i going into the stone bower and sitting down what do you mean ill luck in what why no great harm dear clyfaking perhaps are you coming over me with dialects said i speaking unto me in fashions i wot nothing of nay dear dont look so strange with those eyes of yourn nor talk so strangely i dont understand you nor i you what do you mean by clyfaking lor dear no harm only taking a handkerchief now and then do you take me for a thief nay dear dont make use of bad language we never calls them thieves here but prigs and fakers to tell you the truth dear seeing you spring at that railing put me in mind of my own dear son who is now at botny when he had bad luck he always used to talk of flinging himself over the bridge and sure enough when the traps were after him he did fling himself into the river but that was off the bank nevertheless the traps pulled him out and he is now suffering his sentence so you see you may speak out if you have done anything in the harmless line for i am my sons own mother i assure you so you think theres no harm in stealing no harm in the world dear do you think my own child would have been transported for it if there had been any harm in it and whats more would the blessed woman in the book here have written her life as she has done and given it to the world if there had been any harm in faking she too was what they call a thief and a cutpurse ay and was transported for it like my dear son and do you think she would have told the world so if there had been any harm in the thing oh it is a comfort to me that the blessed woman was transported and came backfor come back she did and rich toofor it is an assurance to me that my dear son who was transported too will come back like her what was her name her name blessed mary flanders will you let me look at the book yes dear that i will if you promise me not to run away with it i took the book from her hand a short thick volume at least a century old bound with greasy black leather i turned the yellow and dogseared pages reading here and there a sentence yes and no mistake his pen his style his spirit might be observed in every line of the uncouthlooking old volumethe air the style the spirit of the writer of the book which first taught me to read i covered my face with my hand and thought of my childhood this is a singular book said i at last but it does not appear to have been written to prove that thieving is no harm but rather to show the terrible consequences of crime it contains a deep moral a deep what deara but no matter i will give you a crown for this volume no dear i will not sell the volume for a crown i am poor said i but i will give you two silver crowns for your volume no dear i will not sell my volume for two silver crowns no nor for the golden one in the kings tower down there without my book i should mope and pine and perhaps fling myself into the river but i am glad you like it which shows that i was right about you after all you are one of our party and you have a flash about that eye of yours which puts me just in mind of my dear son no dear i wont sell you my book but if you like you may have a peep into it whenever you come this way i shall be glad to see you you are one of the right sort for if you had been a common one you would have run away with the thing but you scorn such behaviour and as you are so flash of your money though you say you are poor you may give me a tanner to buy a little baccy with i love baccy dear more by token that it comes from the plantations to which the blessed woman was sent whats a tanner said i lor dont you know dear why a tanner is sixpence and as you were talking just now about crowns it will be as well to tell you that those of our trade never calls them crowns but bulls but i am talking nonsense just as if you did not know all that already as well as myself you are only shammingim no trap dear nor more was the blessed woman in the book thank you dearthank you for the tanner if i dont spend it ill keep it in remembrance of your sweet face what you are goingwell first let me whisper a word to you if you have any clies to sell at any time ill buy them of you all safe with me i never peach and scorns a trap so now dear god bless you and give you good luck thank you for your pleasant company and thank you for the tannerchapter xxxii the tannerthe hoteldrinking claretlondon journalnew fieldcommonplacenessthe three individuals botherationfrank and ardent tanner said i musingly as i left the bridge tanner what can the man who cures raw skins by means of a preparation of oak bark and other materials have to do with the name which these fakers as they call themselves bestow on the smallest silver coin in these dominions tanner i cant trace the connection between the man of bark and the silver coin unless journeymen tanners are in the habit of working for sixpence a day but i have it i continued flourishing my hat over my head tanner in this instance is not an english word is it not surprising that the language of mr petulengro and of tawno chikno is continually coming to my assistance whenever i appear to be at a nonplus with respect to the derivation of crabbed words i have made out crabbed words in æschylus by means of the speech of chikno and petulengro and even in my biblical researches i have derived no slight assistance from it it appears to be a kind of picklock an open sesame tannertawno the one is but a modification of the other they were originally identical and have still much the same signification tanner in the language of the applewoman meaneth the smallest of english silver coins and tawno in the language of the petulengres though bestowed upon the biggest of the romans according to strict interpretation signifieth a little child so i left the bridge retracing my steps for a considerable way as i thought i had seen enough in the direction in which i had hitherto been wandering i should say that i scarcely walked less than thirty miles about the big city on the day of my first arrival night came on but still i was walking about my eyes wide open and admiring everything that presented itself to them everything was new to me for everything is different in london from what it is elsewherethe people their language the horses the tout ensembleeven the stones of london are different from othersat least it appeared to me that i had never walked with the same ease and facility on the flagstones of a country town as on those of london so i continued roving about till night came on and then the splendour of some of the shops particularly struck me a regular arabian nights entertainment said i as i looked into one on cornhill gorgeous with precious merchandise and lighted up with lustres the rays of which were reflected from a hundred mirrors but notwithstanding the excellence of the london pavement i began about nine oclock to feel myself thoroughly tired painfully and slowly did i drag my feet along i also felt very much in want of some refreshment and i remembered that since breakfast i had taken nothing i was now in the strand and glancing about i perceived that i was close by an hotel which bore over the door the somewhat remarkable name of holy lands without a moments hesitation i entered a welllighted passage and turning to the left i found myself in a welllighted coffeeroom with a welldressed and frizzled waiter before me bring me some claret said i for i was rather faint than hungry and i felt ashamed to give a humbler order to so welldressed an individual the waiter looked at me for a moment then making a low bow he bustled off and i sat myself down in the box nearest to the window presently the waiter returned bearing beneath his left arm a long bottle and between the fingers of his right hand two large purple glasses placing the latter on the table he produced a corkscrew drew the cork in a twinkling set the bottle down before me with a bang and then standing still appeared to watch my movements you think i dont know how to drink a glass of claret thought i to myself ill soon show you how we drink claret where i come from and filling one of the glasses to the brim i flickered it for a moment between my eyes and the lustre and then held it to my nose having given that organ full time to test the bouquet of the wine i applied the glass to my lips taking a large mouthful of the wine which i swallowed slowly and by degrees that the palate might likewise have an opportunity of performing its functions a second mouthful i disposed of more summarily then placing the empty glass upon the table i fixed my eyes upon the bottle and saidnothing whereupon the waiter who had been observing the whole process with considerable attention made me a bow yet more low than before and turning on his heel retired with a smart chuck of his head as much as to say it is all right the young man is used to claret and when the waiter had retired i took a second glass of the wine which i found excellent and observing a newspaper lying near me i took it up and began perusing it it has been observed somewhere that people who are in the habit of reading newspapers every day are not unfrequently struck with the excellence of style and general talent which they display now if that be the case how must i have been surprised who was reading a newspaper for the first time and that one of the best of the london journals yes strange as it may seem it was nevertheless true that up to the moment of which i am speaking i had never read a newspaper of any description i of course had frequently seen journals and even handled them but as for reading them what were they to mei cared not for news but here i was now with my claret before me perusing perhaps the best of all the london journalsit was not the and i was astonished an entirely new field of literature appeared to be opened to my view it was a discovery but i confess rather an unpleasant one for i said to myself if literary talent is so very common in london that the journals things which as their very name denotes are ephemeral are written in a style like the article i have been perusing how can i hope to distinguish myself in this big town when for the life of me i dont think i could write anything half so clever as what i have been reading and then i laid down the paper and fell into deep musing rousing myself from which i took a glass of wine and pouring out another began musing again what i have been reading thought i is certainly very clever and very talented but talent and cleverness i think i have heard some one say are very commonplace things only fitted for everydayoccasions i question whether the man who wrote the book i saw this day on the bridge was a clever man but after all was he not something much better i dont think he could have written this article but then he wrote the book which i saw on the bridge then if he could not have written the article on which i now hold my forefingerand i do not believe he couldwhy should i feel discouraged at the consciousness that i too could not write it i certainly could no more have written the article than he could but then like him though i would not compare myself to the man who wrote the book i saw upon the bridge i think i couldand here i emptied the glass of claretwrite something better thereupon i resumed the newspaper and as i was before struck with the fluency of style and the general talent which it displayed i was now equally so with its commonplaceness and want of originality on every subject and it was evident to me that whatever advantage these newspaperwriters might have over me in some points they had never studied the welsh bards translated kœmpe viser or been under the pupilage of mr petulengro and tawno chikno and as i sat conning the newspaper three individuals entered the room and seated themselves in the box at the farther end of which i was they were all three very well dressed two of them elderly gentlemen the third a young man about my own age or perhaps a year or two older they called for coffee and after two or three observations the two eldest commenced a conversation in french which however though they spoke it fluently enough i perceived at once was not their native language the young man however took no part in their conversation and when they addressed a portion to him which indeed was but rarely merely replied by a monosyllable i have never been a listener and i paid but little heed to their discourse nor indeed to themselves as i occasionally looked up however i could perceive that the features of the young man who chanced to be seated exactly opposite to me wore an air of constraint and vexation this circumstance caused me to observe him more particularly than i otherwise should have done his features were handsome and prepossessing he had dark brown hair and a higharched forehead after the lapse of half an hour the two elder individuals having finished their coffee called for the waiter and then rose as if to depart the young man however still remaining seated in the box the others having reached the door turned round and finding that the youth did not follow them one of them called to him with a tone of some authority whereupon the young man rose and pronouncing half audibly the word botheration rose and followed them i now observed that he was remarkably tall all three left the house in about ten minutes finding nothing more worth reading in the newspaper i laid it down and though the claret was not yet exhausted i was thinking of betaking myself to my lodgings and was about to call the waiter when i heard a step in the passage and in another moment the tall young man entered the room advanced to the same box and sitting down nearly opposite to me again pronounced to himself but more audibly than before the same word a troublesome world this sir said i looking at him yes said the young man looking fixedly at me but i am afraid we bring most of our troubles on our own headsat least i can say so of myself he added laughing then after a pause i beg pardon he said but am i not addressing one of my own country of what country are you said i ireland i am not of your country sir but i have an infinite veneration for your country as strap said to the french soldier will you take a glass of wine ah de tout mon cœur as the parasite said to gil blas cried the young man laughing heres to our better acquaintance and better acquainted we soon became and i found that in making the acquaintance of the young man i had indeed made a valuable acquisition he was accomplished highly connected and bore the name of francis ardry frank and ardent he was and in a very little time had told me much that related to himself and in return i communicated a general outline of my own history he listened with profound attention but laughed heartily when i told him some particulars of my visit in the morning to the publisher whom he had frequently heard of we left the house together we shall soon see each other again said he as we separated at the door of my lodgingchapter xxxiii dine with the publisherreligionsno animal foodunprofitable discussionsprinciples of criticismthe book marketnewgate livesgoethe a druggerman acquirementsmoral dignity on the sunday i was punctual to my appointment to dine with the publisher as i hurried along the square in which his house stood my thoughts were fixed so intently on the great man that i passed by him without seeing him he had observed me however and joined me just as i was about to knock at the door let us take a turn in the square said he we shall not dine for half an hour well said he as we were walking in the square what have you been doing since i last saw you i have been looking about london said i and i have bought the dairymans daughter here it is pray put it up said the publisher i dont want to look at such trash well do you think you could write anything like it i do not said i how is that said the publisher looking at me because said i the man who wrote it seems to be perfectly well acquainted with his subject and moreover to write from the heart by the subject you mean religion and ant you acquainted with religion very little i am sorry for that said the publisher seriously for he who sets up for an author ought to be acquainted not only with religion but religions and indeed with all subjects like my good friend in the country it is well that i have changed my mind about the dairymans daughter or i really dont know whom i could apply to on the subject at the present moment unless to himself and after all i question whether his style is exactly suited for an evangelical novel then you do not wish for an imitation of the dairymans daughter i do not sir i have changed my mind as i told you before i wish to employ you in another line but will communicate to you my intentions after dinner at dinner beside the publisher and myself were present his wife and son with his newly married bride the wife appeared a quiet respectable woman and the young people looked very happy and goodnatured not so the publisher who occasionally eyed both with contempt and dislike connected with this dinner there was one thing remarkable the publisher took no animal food but contented himself with feeding voraciously on rice and vegetables prepared in various ways you eat no animal food sir said i i do not sir said he i have forsworn it upwards of twenty years in one respect sir i am a brahmin i abhor taking away lifethe brutes have as much right to live as ourselves but said i if the brutes were not killed there would be such a superabundance of them that the land would be overrun with them i do not think so sir few are killed in india and yet there is plenty of room but said i nature intended that they should be destroyed and the brutes themselves prey upon one another and it is well for themselves and the world that they do so what would be the state of things if every insect bird and worm were left to perish of old age we will change the subject said the publisher i have never been a friend of unprofitable discussions i looked at the publisher with some surprise i had not been accustomed to be spoken to so magisterially his countenance was dressed in a portentous frown and his eye looked more sinister than ever at that moment he put me inmind of some of those despots of whom i had read in the history of morocco whose word was law he merely wants power thought i to myself to be a regular muley mehemet and then i sighed for i remembered how very much i was in the power of that man the dinner over the publisher nodded to his wife who departed followed by her daughterinlaw the son looked as if he would willingly have attended them he however remained seated and a small decanter of wine being placed on the table the publisher filled two glasses one of which he handed to myself and the other to his son saying suppose you two drink to the success of the review i would join you said he addressing himself to me but i drink no wine if i am a brahmin with respect to meat i am a mahometan with respect to wine so the son and i drank success to the review and then the young man asked me various questions for examplehow i liked londonwhether i did not think it a very fine placewhether i was at the play the night beforeand whether i was in the park that afternoon he seemed preparing to ask me some more questions but receiving a furious look from his father he became silent filled himself a glass of wine drank it off looked at the table for about a minute then got up pushed back his chair made me a bow and left the room is that young gentleman sir said i well versed in the principles of criticism he is not sir said the publisher and if i place him at the head of the review ostensibly i do it merely in the hope of procuring him a maintenance of the principle of a thing he knows nothing except that the principle of bread is wheat and that the principle of that wine is grape will you take another glass i looked at the decanter but not feeling altogether so sure as the publishers son with respect to the principle of what it contained i declined taking any more no sir said the publisher adjusting himself in his chair he knows nothing about criticism and will have nothing more to do with the reviewals than carrying about the books to those who have to review them the real conductor of the review will be a widely different person to whom i will when convenient introduce you and now we will talk of the matter which we touched upon before dinner i told you then that i had changed my mind with respect to you i have been considering the state of the market sir the book market and i have come to the conclusion that though you might be profitably employed upon evangelical novels you could earn more money for me sir and consequently for yourself by a compilation of newgate lives and trials newgate lives and trials yes sir said the publisher newgate lives and trials and now sir i will briefly state to you the services which i expect you to perform and the terms which i am willing to grant i expect you sir to compile six volumes of newgate lives and trials each volume to contain by no manner of means less than one thousand pages the remuneration which you will receive when the work is completed will be fifty pounds which is likewise intended to cover any expenses you may incur in procuring books papers and manuscripts necessary for the compilation such will be one of your employments sir such the terms in the second place you will be expected to make yourself useful in the reviewgenerally useful sir doing whatever is required of you for it is not customary at least with me to permit writers especially young writers to choose their subjects in these two departments sir namely compilation and reviewing i had yesterday after due consideration determined upon employing you i had intended to employ you no farther sirat least for the present but sir this morning i received a letter from my valued friend in the country in which he speaks in terms of strong admiration i dont overstate of your german acquirements sir he says that it would be a thousand pities if your knowledge of the german language should be lost to the world or even permitted to sleep and he entreats me to think of some plan by which it may be turned to account sir i am at all times willing if possible to oblige my worthy friend and likewise to encourage merit and talent i have therefore determined to employ you in german sir said i rubbing my hands you are very kind and so is our mutual friend i shall be happy to make myself useful in german and if you think a good translation from goethehis sorrows for example or more particularly his faust sir said the publisher goethe is a drug his sorrows are a drug so is his faustus more especially the last since that fool rendered him into english no sir i do not want you to translate goethe or anything belonging to him nor do i want you to translate anything from the german what i want you to do is to translate into german i am willing to encourage merit sir and as my good friend in his last letter has spoken very highly of your german acquirements i have determined that you shall translate my book of philosophy into german your book of philosophy into german sir yes sir my book of philosophy into german i am not a drug sir in germany as goethe is here no more is my book i intend to print the translation at leipzig sir and if it turns out a profitable speculation as i make no doubt it will provided the translation be well executed i will make you some remuneration sir your remuneration will be determined by thesuccess of your translation but sir sir said the publisher interrupting me you have heard my intentions i consider that you ought to feel yourself highly gratified by my intentions towards you it is not frequently that i deal with a writer especially a young writer as i have done with you and now sir permit me to inform you that i wish to be alone this is sunday afternoon sir i never go to church but i am in the habit of spending part of every sunday afternoon aloneprofitably i hope sirin musing on the magnificence of nature and the moral dignity of manchapter xxxiv the two volumesa young authorintended editorquintilianloose money what cant be cured must be endured and it is hard to kick against the pricks at the period to which i have brought my history i bethought me of the proverbs with which i have headed this chapter and determined to act up to their spirit i determined not to fly in the face of the publisher and to bearwhat i could not curehis arrogance and vanity at present at the conclusion of nearly a quarter of a century i am glad that i came to that determination which i did my best to carry into effect two or three days after our last interview the publisher made his appearance in my apartment he bore two tattered volumes under his arm which he placed on the table i have brought you two volumes of lives sir said he which i yesterday found in my garret you will find them of service for your compilation as i always wish to behave liberally and encourage talent especially youthful talent i shall make no charge for them though i should be justified in so doing as you are aware that by our agreement you are to provide any books and materials which may be necessary have you been in quest of any no said i not yet then sir i would advise you to lose no time in doing so you must visit all the bookstalls sir especially those in the bystreets and blind alleys it is in such places that you will find the description of literature you are in want of you must be up and doing sir it will not do for an author especially a young author to be idle in this town tonight you will receive my book of philosophy and likewise books for the review and by the bye sir it will be as well for you to review my book of philosophy for the review the other reviews not having noticed it sir before translating it i wish you to review my book of philosophy for the review i shall be happy to do my best sir very good sir i should be unreasonable to expect anything beyond a persons best and now sir if you please i will conduct you to the future editor of the review as you are to cooperate sir i deem it right to make you acquainted the intended editor was a little old man who sat in a kind of wooden pavilion in a small garden behind a house in one of the purlieus of the city composing tunes upon a piano the walls of the pavilion were covered with fiddles of various sizes and appearances and a considerable portion of the floor occupied by a pile of books all of one size the publisher introduced him to me as a gentleman scarcely less eminent in literature than in music and me to him as an aspirant critic a young gentleman scarcely less eminent in philosophy than in philology the conversation consisted entirely of compliments till just before we separated when the future editor inquired of me whether i had ever read quintilian and on my replying in the negative expressed his surprise that any gentleman should aspire to become a critic who had never read quintilian with the comfortable information however that he could supply me with a quintilian at halfprice that is a translation made by himself some years previously of which he had pointing to the heap on the floor still a few copies remaining unsold for some reason or other perhaps a poor one i did not purchase the editors translation of quintilian sir said the publisher as we were returning from our visit to the editor you did right in not purchasing a drug i am not prepared sir to say that quintilian is a drug never having seen him but i am prepared to say that mans translation is a drug judging from the heap of rubbish on the floor besides sir you will want any loose money you may have to purchase the description of literature which is required for your compilation the publisher presently paused before the entrance of a very forlornlooking street sir said he after looking down it with attention i should not wonder if in that street you find works connected with the description of literature which is required for your compilation it is in streets of this description sir and blind alleys where such works are to be found you had better search that street sir whilst i continue my way i searched the street to which the publisher had pointed and in the course of the three succeeding days many others of a similar kind i did not find the description of literature alluded to by the publisher to be a drug but on the contrary both scarce and dear i had expended much more than my loose money long before i could procure materials even for the first volume of my compilationchapter xxxv francis ardrycertain sharpersbrave and eloquentoppositesflinging the bonesstrange placesdogfightinglearning and lettersbatch of dogsredoubled application one evening i was visited by the tall young gentleman francis ardry whose acquaintance i had formed at the coffeehouse as it is necessary that the reader should know something more about this young man who will frequently appear in the course of these pages i will state in a few words who and what he was he was born of an ancient roman catholic family in ireland his parents whose only child he was had long been dead his father who had survived his mother several years had been a spendthrift and at his death had left the family property considerably embarrassed happily however the son and the estate fell into the hands of careful guardians near relations of the family by whom the property was managed to the best advantage and every means taken to educate the young man in a manner suitable to his expectations at the age of sixteen he was taken from a celebrated school in england at which he had been placed and sent to a small french university in order that he might form an intimate and accurate acquaintance with the grand language of the continent there he continued three years at the end of which he went under the care of a french abbé to germany and italy it was in this latter country that he first began to cause his guardians serious uneasiness he was in the heyday of youth when he visited italy and he entered wildly into the various delights of that fascinating region and what was worse falling into the hands of certain sharpers not italian but english he was fleeced of considerable sums of money the abbé who it seems was an excellent individual of the old french school remonstrated with his pupil on his dissipation and extravagance but finding his remonstrances vain very properly informed the guardians of the manner of life of his charge they were not slow in commanding francis ardry home and as he was entirely in their power he was forced to comply he had been about three months in london when i met him in the coffeeroom and the two elderly gentlemen in his company were his guardians at this time they were very solicitous that he should choose for himself a profession offering to his choice either the army or lawhe was calculated to shine in either of these professionsfor like many others of his countrymen he was brave and eloquent but he did not wish to shackle himself with a profession as however his minority did not terminate till he was threeandtwenty of which age he wanted nearly two years during which he would be entirely dependent on his guardians he deemed it expedient to conceal to a certain degree his sentiments temporising with the old gentlemen with whom notwithstanding his many irregularities he was a great favourite and at whose death he expected to come into a yet greater property than that which he inherited from his parents such is a brief account of francis ardryof my friend francis ardry for the acquaintance commenced in the singular manner with which the reader is acquainted speedily ripened into a friendship which endured through many long years of separation and which still endures certainly on my part and on hisif he lives but it is many years since i have heard from francis ardry and yet many people would have thought it impossible for our friendship to have lasted a weekfor in many respects no two people could be more dissimilar he was an irishmani an englishmanhe fiery enthusiastic and openhearted i neither fiery enthusiastic nor openheartedhe fond of pleasure and dissipationi of study and reflection yet it is of such dissimilar elements that the most lasting friendships are formed we do not like counterparts of ourselves two great talkers will not travel far together is a spanish saying i will add nor two silent people we naturally love our opposites so francis ardry came to see me and right glad i was to see him for i had just flung my books and papers aside and was wishing for a little social converse and when we had conversed for some little time together francis ardry proposed that we should go to the play to see kean so we went to the play and sawnot kean who at that time was ashamed to show himself buta man who was not ashamed to show himself and who people said was a much better man than keanas i have no doubt he wasthough whether he was a better actor i cannot say for i never saw kean two or three evenings after francis ardry came to see me again and again we went out together and francis ardry took me toshall i saywhy nota gaming house where i saw people playing and where i saw francis ardry play and lose five guineas and where i lost nothing because i did not play though i felt somewhat inclined for a man with a white hat and a sparkling eye held up a box which contained something which rattled and asked me to fling the bones there is nothing like flinging the bones said he and then i thought i should like to know what kind of thing flinging the bones was i however restrained myself there is nothing like flinging the bones shouted the man as my friend and myself left the room long life and prosperity to francis ardry but for him i should not have obtained knowledge which i did of the strange and eccentric places of london some of the places to which he took me were very strange places indeed but however strange the places were i observed that the inhabitants thought there were no places like their several places and no occupations like their several occupations and among other strange places to which francis ardry conducted me was a place not far from the abbey church of westminsterbefore we entered this place our ears were greeted by a confused hubbub of human voices squealing of rats barking of dogs and the cries of various other animals here we beheld a kind of cockpit around which a great many people seeming of all ranks but chiefly of the lower were gathered and in it we saw a dog destroy a great many rats in a very small period and when the dog had destroyed the rats we saw a fight between a dog and a bear then a fight between two dogs then after the diversions of the day were over my friend introduced me to the genius of the place a small man of about five feet high with a very sharp countenance and dressed in a brown jockey coat and topboots joey said he this is a friend of mine joey nodded to me with a patronising air glad to see you sirwant a dog no said i you have got one thenwant to match him we have a dog at home said i in the country but i cant say i should like to match him indeed i do not like dogfighting not like dogfighting said the man staring the truth is joe that he is just come to town so i should think he looks rather greennot like dogfighting nothing like it is there joey i should think not what is like it a time will come and that speedily when folks will give up everything else and follow dogfighting do you think so said i think so let me ask what there is that a man wouldnt give up for it why said i modestly theres religion religion how you talk why theres myself bred and born an independent and intended to be a preacher didnt i give up religion for dogfighting religion indeed if it were not for the rascally law my pit would fill better on sundays than any other time who would go to church when they could come to my pit religion why the parsons themselves come to my pit and i have now a letter in my pocket from one of them asking me to send him a dog well then politics said i politics why the gemmen in the house would leave pitt himself if he were alive to come to my pit there were three of the best of them here tonight all great horatorsget on with you what comes next why theres learning and letters pretty things truly to keep people from dogfighting why theres the young gentlemen from the abbey school comes here in shoals leaving books and letters and masters too to tell you the truth i rather wish they would mind their letters for a more precious set of young blackguards i never seed it was only the other day i was thinking of calling in a constable for my own protection for i thought my pit would have been torn down by them scarcely knowing what to say i made an observation at random you show by your own conduct said i that there are other things worth following besides dogfighting you practise ratcatching and badgerbaiting as well the dogfancier eyed me with supreme contempt your friend here said he might well call you a new one when i talks of dogfighting i of course means ratcatching and badgerbaiting ay and bullbaiting too just as when i speaks religiously when i says one i means not one but three and talking of religion puts me in mind that i have something else to do besides chaffing here having a batch of dogs to send off by this nights packet to the pope of rome but at last i had seen enough of what london had to show whether strange or commonplace so at least i thought and i ceased to accompany my friend in his rambles about town and to partake of his adventures our friendship however still continued unabated though i saw in consequence less of him i reflected that time was passing onthat the little money i had brought to town was fast consuming and that i had nothing to depend upon but my own exertions for a freshsupply and i returned with redoubled application to my pursuitschapter xxxvi occupationstraduttore traditoreode to the mistapple and pearreviewingcurrent literatureoxfordlike mannera plain storyillregulated mindunsnuffed candlestrange dreams i compiled the chronicles of newgate a i reviewed books for the review b established on an entirely new principle and i occasionally tried my best to translate into german portions of the publishers philosophy in this last task i experienced more than one difficulty i was a tolerable german scholar it is true and i had long been able to translate from german into english with considerable facility but to translate from a foreign language into your own is a widely different thing from translating from your own into a foreign language and in my first attempt to render the publisher into german i was conscious of making miserable failures from pure ignorance of german grammar however by the assistance of grammars and dictionaries and by extreme perseverance i at length overcame all the difficulties connected with the german language but alas another difficulty remained far greater than any connected with german a difficulty connected with the language of the publisherthe language which the great man employed in his writings was very hard to understand i say in his writingsfor his colloquial english was plain enough though not professing to be a scholar he was much addicted when writing to the use of greek and latin terms not as other people used them but in a manner of his own which set the authority of dictionaries at defiance the consequence was that i was sometimes utterly at a loss to understand the meaning of the publisher many a quarter of an hour did i pass at this period staring at periods of the publisher and wondering what he could mean but in vain till at last with a shake of the head i would snatch up the pen and render the publisher literally into german sometimes i was almost tempted to substitute something of my own for what the publisher had written but my conscience interposed the awful words traduttore traditore commenced ringing in my ears and i asked myself whether i should be acting honourably towards the publisher who had committed to me the delicate task of translating him into german should i be acting honourably towards him in making him speak in german in a manner different from that in which he expressed himself in english no i could not reconcile such conduct with any principle of honour by substituting something of my own in lieu of these mysterious passages of the publisher i might be giving a fatal blow to his whole system of philosophy besides when translating into english had i treated foreign authors in this manner had i treated the minstrels of the kœmpe viser in this mannerno had i treated ab gwilym in this manner even when translating his ode to the mist in which he is misty enough had i attempted to make ab gwilym less misty no on referring to my translation i found that ab gwilym in my hands was quite as misty as in his own then seeing that i had not ventured to take liberties with people who had never put themselves into my hands for the purpose of being rendered how could i venture to substitute my own thoughts and ideas for the publishers who had put himself into my hands for that purpose forbid it every proper feelingso i told the germans in the publishers own way the publishers tale of an apple and a pear i at first felt much inclined to be of the publishers opinion with respect to the theory of the pear after all why should the earth be shaped like an apple and not like a pearit would certainly gain in appearance by being shaped like a pear a pear being a handsomer fruit than an apple the publisher is probably right thought i and i will say that he is right on this point in the notice which i am about to write of his publication for the review and yet i dont knowsaid i after a long fit of musingi dont know but what there is more to be said for the oxford theory the world may be shaped like a pear but i dont know that it is but one thing i know which is that it does not taste like a pear i have always liked pears but i dont like the world the world to me tastes much more like an apple and i have never liked apples i will uphold the oxford theorybesides i am writing in an oxford reviewand am in duty bound to uphold the oxford theory so in my notice i asserted that the world was round i quoted scripture and endeavoured to prove that the world was typified by the apple in scripture both as to shape and properties an apple is round said i and the world is roundthe apple is a sour disagreeable fruit and who has tasted much of the world without having his teeth set on edge i however treated the publisher upon the whole in the most urbane and oxfordlike manner complimenting him upon his style acknowledging the general soundness of his views and only differing with him in the affair of the apple and pear i did not like reviewing at allit was not to my taste it was not in my way i liked it far less than translating the publishers philosophy for that was something in the line of one whom a competent judge had surnamed lavengro i never could understand why reviews were instituted works of merit do not require to be reviewed they can speak for themselves and require no praising works of no merit at all will die of themselves they require no killing the review to which i was attached was as has been already intimated established on an entirely new plan it professed to review all new publications which certainly no review had ever professed to do before other reviews never pretending to review more than onetenth of the current literature of the day when i say it professed to review all new publications i should add which should be sent to it for of course the review would not acknowledge the existence of publications the authors of which did not acknowledge the existence of the review i dont think however that the review had much cause to complain of being neglected i have reason to believe that at least ninetenths of the publications of the day were sent to the review and in due time reviewed i had good opportunity of judgingi was connected with several departments of the review though more particularly with the poetical and philosophic ones an english translation of kants philosophy made its appearance on my table the day before its publication in my notice of this work i said that the english shortly hoped to give the germans a quid pro quo i believe at that time authors were much in the habit of publishing at their ownexpense all the poetry which i reviewed appeared to be published at the expense of the authors if i am asked how i comported myself under all circumstances as a revieweri answeri did not forget that i was connected with a review established on oxford principles the editor of which had translated quintilian all the publications which fell under my notice i treated in a gentlemanly and oxfordlike manner no personalitiesno vituperationno shabby insinuations decorum decorum was the order of the day occasionally a word of admonition but gently expressed as an oxford undergraduate might have expressed it or master of arts how the authors whose publications were consigned to my colleagues were treated by them i know not i suppose they were treated in an urbane and oxfordlike manner but i cannot say i did not read the reviewals of my colleagues i did not read my own after they were printed i did not like reviewing of all my occupations at this period i am free to confess i liked that of compiling the newgate lives and trials the best that is after i had surmounted a kind of prejudice which i originally entertained the trials were entertaining enough but the liveshow full were they of wild and racy adventures and in what racy genuine language were they told what struck me most with respect to these lives was the art which the writers whoever they were possessed of telling a plain story it is no easy thing to tell a story plainly and distinctly by mouth but to tell one on paper is difficult indeed so many snares lie in the way people are afraid to put down what is common on paper they seek to embellish their narratives as they think by philosophic speculations and reflections they are anxious to shine and people who are anxious to shine can never tell a plain story so i went with them to a music booth where they made me almost drunk with gin and began to talk their flash language which i did not understand says or is made to say henry simms executed at tyburn some seventy years before the time of which i am speaking i have always looked upon this sentence as a masterpiece of the narrative style it is so concise and yet so very clear as i gazed on passages like this and there were many nearly as good in the newgate lives i often sighed that it was not my fortune to have to render these lives into german rather than the publishers philosophyhis tale of an apple and pear mine was an illregulated mind at this period as i read over the lives of these robbers and pickpockets strange doubts began to arise in my mind about virtue and crime years before when quite a boy as in one of the early chapters i have hinted i had been a necessitarian i had even written an essay on crime i have it now before me penned in a round boyish hand in which i attempted to prove that there is no such thing as crime or virtue all our actions being the result of circumstances or necessity these doubts were now again reviving in my mind i could not for the life of me imagine how taking all circumstances into consideration these highwaymen these pickpockets should have been anything else than highwaymen and pickpockets any more than how taking all circumstances into consideration bishop latimer the reader is aware that i had read foxs book of martyrs should have been anything else than bishop latimer i had a very illregulated mind at that period my own peculiar ideas with respect to everything being a lying dream began also to revive sometimes at midnight after having toiled for hours at my occupations i would fling myself back on my chair look about the poor apartment dimly lighted by an unsnuffed candle or upon the heaps of books and papers before me and exclaimdo i exist do these things which i think i see about me exist or do they not is not every thing a dreama deceitful dream is not this apartment a dreamthe furniture a dream the publisher a dreamhis philosophy a dream am i not myself a dream dreaming about translating a dream i cant see why all should not be a dream whats the use of the reality and then i would pinch myself and snuff the burdened smoky light i cant see for the life of me the use of all this therefore why should i think that it exists if there was a chance a probability of all this tending to anything i might believe but and then i would stare and think and after some time shake my head and return again to my occupations for an hour or two and then i would perhaps shake and shiver and yawn and look wistfully in the direction of my sleeping apartment and then but not wistfully at the papers and books before me and sometimes i would return to my papers and books but oftener i would arise and after another yawn and shiver take my light and proceed to my sleeping chamber they say that light fare begets light dreams my fare at that time was light enough but i had anything but light dreams for at that period i had all kind of strange and extravagant dreams and amongst other things i dreamt that the whole world had taken to dogfighting and that i myself had taken to dogfighting and that in a vast circus i backed an english bulldog against the bloodhound of the pope of romechapter xxxvii my brotherfits of cryingmayor electthe committeethe norman archa word of greekchurch and state at my own expenseif you please one morning i arose somewhat later than usual having been occupied during the greater part of the night with my literary toil on descending from my chamber into the sittingroom i found a person seated by the fire whose glance was directed sideways to the table on which were the usual preparations for my mornings meal forthwith i gave a cry and sprang forward to embrace the person for the person by the fire whose glance was directed to the table was no one else than my brother and how are things going on at home said i to my brother after we had kissed and embraced how is my mother and how is the dog my mother thank god is tolerably well said my brother but very much given to fits of crying as for the dog he is not so well but we will talk more of these matters anon said my brother again glancing at the breakfast things i am very hungry as you may suppose after having travelled all night thereupon i exerted myself to the best of my ability to perform the duties of hospitality and i made my brother welcome i may say more than welcome and when the rage of my brothers hunger was somewhat abated we recommenced talking about the matters of our little family and my brother told me much about my mother he spoke of her fits of crying but said that of late the said fits of crying had much diminished and she appeared to be taking comfort and if i am not much mistaken my brother told me that my mother had of late the prayerbook frequently in her hand and yet oftener the bible we were silent for a timeat last i opened my mouth and mentioned the dog the dog said my brother is i am afraid in a very poor way ever since the death he has done nothing but pine and take on a few months ago you remember he was as plump and fine as any dog in the town but at present he is little more than skin and bone once we lost him for two days and never expected to see him again imagining that some mischance had befallen him at length i found himwhere do you think chancing to pass by the churchyard i found him seated on the grave very strange said i but let us talk of something else it was very kind of you to come and see me oh as for that matter i did not come up to see you though of course i am very glad to see you having been rather anxious about you like my mother who has received only one letter from you since your departure no i did not come up on purpose to see you but on a quite different account you must know that the corporation of our town have lately elected a new mayor a person of many qualificationsbig and portly with a voice like boanerges a religious man the possessor of an immense pew loyal so much so that i once heard him say that he would at any time go three miles to hear any one sing god save the king moreover a giver of excellent dinners such is our present mayor who owing to his loyalty his religion and a little perhaps to his dinners is a mighty favourite so much so that the town is anxious to have his portrait painted in a superior style so that remote posterity may know what kind of man he was the colour of his hair his air and gait so a committee was formed some time ago which is still sitting that is they dine with the mayor every day to talk over the subject a few days since to my great surprise they made their appearance in my poor studio and desired to be favoured with a sight of some of my paintings well i showed them some and after looking at them with great attention they went aside and whispered hell do i heard one say yes hell do said another and then they came to me and one of them a little man with a hump on his back who is a watchmaker assumed the office of spokesman and made a long speechthe old town has been always celebrated for oratorsin which he told me how much they had been pleased with my productionsthe old town has been always celebrated for its artistic tasteand what do you think offered me the painting of the mayors portrait and a hundred pounds for my trouble well of course i was much surprised and for a minute or two could scarcely speak recovering myself however i made a speech not so eloquent as that of the watchmaker of course being not so accustomed to speaking but not so bad either taking everything into consideration telling them how flattered i felt by the honour which they had conferred in proposing to me such an undertaking expressing however my fears that i was not competent to the task and concluding by saying what a pity it was that crome was dead crome said the little man crome yes he was a clever man a very clever man in his way he was good at painting landscapes and farmhouses but he would not do in the present instance were he alive he had no conception of the heroic sir we want some person capable of representing our mayor striding under the norman arch out of the cathedral at the mention of the heroic an idea came at once into my head oh said i if you are in quest of the heroic i am glad that you came to me dont mistake me i continued i do not mean to say that i could do justice to your subject though i am fond of the heroic but i can introduce you to a great master of the heroic fully competent to do justice to your mayor not to me therefore be the painting of the picture given but to a friend of mine the great master of the heroic to the best the strongest τω κρατιστω i added for beingamongst orators i thought a word of greek would tell well said i and what did the orators say they gazed dubiously at me and at one another said my brother at last the watchmaker asked me who this mr christo was adding that he had never heard of such a person that from my recommendation of him he had no doubt that he was a very clever man but that they should like to know something more about him before giving the commission to him that he had heard of christie the great auctioneer who was considered to be an excellent judge of pictures but he supposed that i scarcelywhereupon interrupting the watchmaker i told him that i alluded neither to christo nor to christie but to the painter of lazarus rising from the grave a painter under whom i had myself studied during some months that i had spent in london and to whom i was indebted for much connected with the heroic i have heard of him said the watchmaker and his paintings too but i am afraid that he is not exactly the gentleman by whom our mayor would wish to be painted i have heard say that he is not a very good friend to church and state come young man he added it appears to me that you are too modest i like your style of painting so do we all andwhy should i mince the matterthe money is to be collected in the town why should it go into a strangers pocket and be spent in london thereupon i made them a speech in which i said that art had nothing to do with church and state at least with english church and state which had never encouraged it and that though church and state were doubtless very fine things a man might be a very good artist who cared not a straw for either i then made use of some more greek words and told them how painting was one of the nine muses and one of the most independent creatures alive inspiring whom she pleased and asking leave of nobody that i should be quite unworthy of the favours of the muse if on the present occasion i did not recommend them a man whom i considered to be a much greater master of the heroic than myself and that with regard to the money being spent in the city i had no doubt that they would not weigh for a moment such a consideration against the chance of getting a true heroic picture for the city i never talked so well in my life and said so many flattering things to the hunchback and his friends that at last they said that i should have my own way and that if i pleased to go up to london and bring down the painter of lazarus to paint the mayor i might so they then bade me farewell and i have come up to london to put a hundred pounds into the hands of a better man than myself said my brother of course and have you come up at your own expense yes said my brother i have come up at my own expense i made no answer but looked in my brothers face we then returned to the former subjects of conversation talking of the dead my mother and the dog after some time my brother said i will now go to the painter and communicate to him the business which has brought me to town and if you please i will take you with me and introduce you to him having expressed my willingness we descended into the streetchapter xxxviii painter of the heroicill goa modest peepwho is thisa capital pharaohdisproportionably shortimaginary pictureenglish figures the painter of the heroic resided a great way off at the western end of the town we had some difficulty in obtaining admission to him a maidservant who opened the door eyeing us somewhat suspiciously it was not until my brother had said that he was a friend of the painter that we were permitted to pass the threshold at length we were shown into the studio where we found the painter with an easel and brush standing before a huge piece of canvas on which he had lately commenced painting a heroic picture the painter might be about thirtyfive years old he had a clever intelligent countenance with a sharp grey eyehis hair was dark brown and cut àlarafael as i was subsequently told that is there was little before and much behindhe did not wear a neckcloth but in its stead a black riband so that his neck which was rather fine was somewhat exposedhe had a broad muscular breast and i make no doubt that he would have been a very fine figure but unfortunately his legs and thighs were somewhat short he recognised my brother and appeared glad to see him what brings you to london said he whereupon my brother gave him a brief account of his commission at the mention of the hundred pounds i observed the eyes of the painter glisten really said he when my brother had concluded it was very kind to think of me i am not very fond of painting portraits but a mayor is a mayor and there is something grand in that idea of the norman arch ill go moreover i am just at this moment confoundedly in need of money and when you knocked at the door i dont mind telling you i thought it was some dun i dont know how it is but in the capital they have no taste for the heroic they will scarce look at a heroic picture i am glad to hear that they have better taste in the provinces ill go when shall we set off thereupon it was arranged between the painter and my brother that they should depart the next day but one they then began to talk of art ill stick to the heroic said the painter i now and then dabble in the comic but what i do gives me no pleasure the comic is so low there is nothing like the heroic i am engaged here on a heroic picture said he pointing to the canvas the subject is pharaoh dismissing moses from egypt after the last plaguethe death of the firstbornit is not far advancedthat finished figure is moses they both looked at the canvas and i standing behind took a modest peep the picture as the painter said was not far advanced the pharaoh was merely in outline my eye was of course attracted by the finished figure or rather what the painter had called the finished figure but as i gazed upon it it appeared to me that there was something defectivesomething unsatisfactory in the figure i concluded however that the painter notwithstanding what he had said had omitted to give it the finishing touch i intend this to be my best picture said the painter what i want now is a face for pharaoh i have long been meditating on a face for pharaoh here chancing to cast his eye upon my countenance of whom he had scarcely taken any manner of notice he remained with his mouth open for some time who is this said he at last oh this is my brother i forgot to introduce him we presently afterwards departed my brother talked much about the painter he is a noble fellow said my brother but like many other noble fellows has a great many enemies he is hated by his brethren of the brushall the land and waterscape painters hate himbut above all the race of portrait painters who are ten times more numerous than the other two sorts detest him for his heroic tendencies it will be a kind of triumph to the last i fear when they hear he has condescended to paint a portrait however that norman arch will enable him to escape from their malicethat is a capital idea of the watchmaker that norman arch i spent a happy day with my brother on the morrow he went again to the painter with whom he dined i did not go with him on his return he said the painter has been asking a great many questions about you and expressed a wish that you would sit to him as pharaoh he thinks you would make a capital pharaoh i have no wish to appear on canvas said i moreover he can find much better pharaohs than myself and if he wants a real pharaoh there is a certain mr petulengro petulengro said my brother a strange kind of fellow came up to me some time ago in our town and asked me about you when i inquired his name he told me petulengro no he will not do he is too short by the bye do you not think that figure of moses is somewhat short and then it appeared to me that i had thought the figure of moses somewhat short and i told my brother so ah said my brother on the morrow my brother departed with the painter for the old town and there the painter painted the mayor i did not see the picture for a great many years when chancing to be at the old town i beheld it the original mayor was a mighty portly man with a bulls head black hair body like that of a dray horse and legs and thighs corresponding a man six foot high at the least to his bulls head black hair and body the painter had done justice there was one point however in which the portrait did not correspond with the originalthe legs were disproportionably short the painter having substituted his own legs for those of the mayor which when i perceived irejoiced that i had not consented to be painted as pharaoh for if i had the chances are that he would have served me in exactly a similar way as he had served moses and the mayor short legs in a heroic picture will never do and upon the whole i think the painters attempt at the heroic in painting the mayor of the old town a decided failure if i am now asked whether the picture would have been a heroic one provided the painter had not substituted his own legs for those of the mayori must say i am afraid not i have no idea of making heroic pictures out of english mayors even with the assistance of norman arches yet i am sure that capital pictures might be made out of english mayors not issuing from norman arches but rather from the door of the checquers or the brewers three the painter in question had great comic power which he scarcely ever cultivated he would fain be a rafael which he never could be when he might have been something quite as goodanother hogarth the only comic piece which he ever presented to the world being something little inferior to the best of that illustrious master i have often thought what a capital picture might have been made by my brothers friend if instead of making the mayor issue out of the norman arch he had painted him moving under the sign of the checquers or the three brewers with maceyes with macethe mace appears in the picture issuing out of the norman arch behind the mayorbut likewise with snap and with whiffler quart pot and frying pan billy blind and owlenglass mr petulengro and pakomovnathen had he clapped his own legs upon the mayor or any one else in the concourse what matter but i repeat that i have no hope of making heroic pictures out of english mayors or indeed out of english figures in general england may be a land of heroic hearts but it is not properly a land of heroic figures or heroic posturemakingitaly what was i going to say about italy chapter xxxix no authority whateverinterferencewondrous farragobrandt and struenseewhat a lifethe hearsemortal relicsgreat poetfashion and famewhat a differenceoh beautifulgood for nothing and now once more to my pursuits to my lives and trials however partial at first i might be to these lives and trials it was not long before they became regular trials to me owing to the whims and caprices of the publisher i had not been long connected with him before i discovered that he was wonderfully fond of interfering with other peoples businessat least with the business of those who were under his control what a life did his unfortunate authors lead he had many in his employ toiling at all kinds of subjectsi call them authors because there is something respectable in the term author though they had little authorship in and no authority whatever over the works on which they were engaged it is true the publisher interfered with some colour of reason the plan of all and every of the works alluded to having originated with himself and be it observed many of his plans were highly clever and promising for as i have already had occasion to say the publisher in many points was a highly clever and sagacious person but he ought to have been contented with planning the works originally and have left to other people the task of executing them instead of which he marred everything by his rage for interference if a book of fairy tales was being compiled he was sure to introduce some of his philosophy explaining the fairy tale by some theory of his own was a book of anecdotes on hand it was sure to be half filled with sayings and doings of himself during the time that he was common councilman of the city of london now however fond the public might be of fairy tales it by no means relished them in conjunction with the publishers philosophy and however fond of anecdotes in general or even of the publisher in particularfor indeed there were a great many anecdotes in circulation about him which the public both read and listened to very readilyit took no pleasure in such anecdotes as he was disposed to relate about himself in the compilation of my lives and trials i was exposed to incredible mortification and ceaseless trouble from this same rage for interference it is true he could not introduce his philosophy into the work nor was it possible for him to introduce anecdotes of himself having never had the good or evil fortune to be tried at the bar but he was continually introducingwhat under a less apathetic government than the one then being would have infallibly subjected him and perhaps myself to a trialhis politics not his oxford or pseudo politics but the politics which he really entertained and which were of the most republican and violent kind but this was not all when about a moiety of the first volume had been printed he materially altered the plan of the work it was no longer to be a collection of mere newgate lives and trials but of lives and trials of criminals in general foreign as well as domestic in a little time the work became a wondrous farrago in which königsmark the robber figured by the side of sam lynn and the marchioness de brinvilliers was placed in contact with a chinese outlaw what gave me the most trouble and annoyance was the publishers remembering some life or trial foreign or domestic which he wished to be inserted and which i was forthwith to go in quest of and purchase at my own expense some of those lives and trials were by no means easy to find where is brandt and struensee cries the publisher i am sure i dont know i replied whereupon the publisher falls to squealing like one of joeys rats find me up brandt and struensee by next morning or have you found brandt and struensee cried the publisher on my appearing before him next morning no i reply i can hear nothing about them whereupon the publisher falls to bellowing like joeys bull by dint of incredible diligence i at length discover the dingy volume containing the lives and trials of the celebrated two who had brooded treason dangerous to the state of denmark i purchase the dingy volume and bring it in triumph to the publisher the perspiration running down my brow the publisher takes the dingy volume in his hand he examines it attentively then puts it down his countenance is calm for a moment almost benign another moment and there is a gleam in the publishers sinister eye he snatches up the paper containing the names of the worthies which i have intended shall figure in the forthcoming volumeshe glances rapidly over it and his countenance once more assumes a terrific expression how is this he exclaims i can scarcely believe my eyesthe most important life and trial omitted to be found in the whole criminal recordwhat gross what utter negligence wheres the life of farmer patch wheres the trial of yeoman patch what a life what a dogs life i would frequently exclaim after escaping from the presence of the publisher one day after a scene with the publisher similar to that which i have described above i found myself about noon at the bottom of oxford street where it forms a right angle with the road which leads or did lead to tottenham court happening to cast my eyes around it suddenly occurred to me that something uncommon was expected people were standing in groups on the pavementthe upstair windows of the houses were thronged with faces especially those of women and many of the shops were partly and not a few entirely closed what could be the reason of all this all at once i bethought me that this street of oxford was no other than the farfamed tyburn way oh oh thought i an execution some handsome young robber is about to be executed at the farther end just so see how earnestly the women are peering perhaps another harry symmsgentleman harry as they called himis about to be carted along this street to tyburn tree but then i remembered that tyburn tree had long since been cut down and that criminals whether young or old goodlooking or ugly were executed before the big stone gaol which i had looked at with a kind of shudder during my short rambles in the city what could be the matter just then i heard various voices cry there it comes and all heads were turned up oxford street down which a hearse was slowly coming nearer and nearer it drew presently it was just opposite the place where i was standing when turning to the left it proceeded slowly alongtottenham road immediately behind the hearse were three or four mourning coaches full of people some of which from the partial glimpse which i caught of them appeared to be foreigners behind these came a very long train of splendid carriages all of which without one exception were empty whose body is in that hearse said i to a dapperlooking individual seemingly a shopkeeper who stood beside me on the pavement looking at the procession the mortal relics of lord byron said the dapperlooking individual mouthing his words and smirkingthe illustrious poet which have been just brought from greece and are being conveyed to the family vault in shire an illustrious poet was he said i beyond all criticism said the dapper man all we of the rising generation are under incalculable obligation to byron i myself in particular have reason to say so in all my correspondence my style is formed on the byronic model i looked at the individual for a moment who smiled and smirked to himself applause and then i turned my eyes upon the hearse proceeding slowly up the almost endless street this man this byron had for many years past been the demigod of england and his verses the daily food of those who read from the peer to the drapers assistant all were admirers or rather worshippers of byron and all doated on his verses and then i thought of those who with genius as high as his or higher had lived and died neglected i thought of milton abandoned to poverty and blindness of witty and ingenious butler consigned to the tender mercies of bailiffs and starving otway they had lived neglected and despised and when they died a few poor mourners only had followed them to the grave but this byron had been made a half god of when living and now that he was dead he was followed by worshipping crowds and the very sun seemed to come out on purpose to grace his funeral and indeed the sun which for many days past had hidden its face in clouds shone out that morn with wonderful brilliancy flaming upon the black hearse and its tall ostrich plumes the mourning coaches and the long train of aristocratic carriages which followed behind great poet sir said the dapperlooking man great poet but unhappy unhappy yes i had heard that he had been unhappy that he had roamed about a fevered distempered man taking pleasure in nothingthat i had heard but was it true was he really unhappy was not this unhappiness assumed with the view of increasing the interest which the world took in him and yet who could say he might be unhappy and with reason was he a real poet after all might he not doubt himself might he not have a lurking consciousness that he was undeserving of the homage which he was receiving that it could not last that he was rather at the top of fashion than of fame he was a lordling a glittering gorgeous lordling and he might have had a consciousness that he owed much of his celebrity to being so he might have felt that he was rather at the top of fashion than of fame fashion soon changes thought i eagerly to myselfa time will come and that speedily when he will be no longer in the fashion when this idiotic admirer of his who is still grinning at my side shall have ceased to mould his style on byrons and this aristocracy squirearchy and what not who now send their empty carriages to pay respect to the fashionable corpse shall have transferred their empty worship to some other animate or inanimate thing well perhaps after all it was better to have been mighty milton

no said i i am good for nothing i think i shall stroll to london bridge thats too far for mefarewell chapter xl london bridgewhy notevery heart has its bitterswicked boysgive me my booksuch a frighthonour bright so i went to london bridge and again took my station on the spot by the booth where i had stood on the former occasion the booth however was empty neither the applewoman nor her stall was to be seen i looked over the balustrade upon the river the tide was now as before rolling beneath the arch with frightful impetuosity as i gazed upon the eddies of the whirlpool i thought within myself how soon human life would become extinct there a plunge a convulsive flounder and all would be over when i last stood over that abyss i had felt a kind of impulsea fascination i had resisted iti did not plunge into it at present i felt a kind of impulse to plunge but the impulse was of a different kind it proceeded from a loathing of life i looked wistfully at the eddieswhat had i to live forwhat indeed i thought of brandt and struensee and yeoman patchshould i yield to the impulsewhy not my eyes were fixed on the eddies all of a sudden i shuddered i thought i saw heads in the pool human bodies wallowing confusedly eyes turned up to heaven with hopeless horror was that water or where was the impulse now i raised my eyes from the pool i looked no more upon iti looked forward far down the stream in the far distance ha what is that i thought i saw a kind of fata morgana green meadows waving groves a rustic home but in the far distancei staredi stareda fata morganait was gone i left the balustrade and walked to the farther end of the bridge where i stood for some time contemplating the crowd i then passed over to the other side with an intention of returning home just half way over the bridge in a booth immediately opposite to the one in which i had formerly beheld her sat my friend the old applewoman huddled up behind her stall well mother said i how are you the old woman lifted her head with a startled look dont you know me said i yes i think i do ah yes said she as her features beamed with recollection i know you dear you are the young lad that gave me

about that book the book yes they wanted to take it from me who did why some wicked boys ill tell you all about it eight or ten days ago i sat behind my stall reading my book all of a sudden i felt it snatched from my hand up i started and see three rascals of boys grinning at me one of them held the book in his hand what book is this said he grinning at it what do you want with my book said i clutching at it over my stall give me my book what do you want a book for said he holding it back i have a good mind to fling it into the thames give me my book i shrieked and snatching at it i fell over my stall and all my fruit was scattered about off ran the boysoff ran the rascal with my book oh dear i thought i should have died up i got however and ran after them as well as i could i thought of my fruit but i thought more of my book i left my fruit and ran after my book my book my book i shrieked murder theft robbery i was near being crushed under the wheels of a cart but i didnt care i followed the rascals stop them stop them i ran nearly as fast as theythey couldnt run very fast on account of the crowd at last some one stopped the rascal whereupon he turned round and flinging the book at me it fell into the mud well i picked it up and kissed it all muddy as it was has he robbed you said the man robbed me indeed why he had got my book oh your book said the man and laughed and let the rascal go ah he might laugh but well go on my heart beats so well i went back to my booth and picked up my stall and my fruits what i could find of them i couldnt keep my stall for two days i got such a fright and when i got round i couldnt bide the booth where the thing had happened so i came over to the other side oh the rascals if i could but see them hanged for what why for stealing my book i thought you didnt dislike stealingthat you were ready to buy thingsthere was your son you know yes to be sure he took things to be sure he did but you dont like a thing of yours to be taken no

said she taking it from under her cloak read it as long as you like only get a little farther into the booth dont sit so near the edge you might i went deep into the booth and the applewoman bringing her chair round almost confronted me i commenced reading the book and was soon engrossed by it hours passed away once or twice i lifted up my eyes the applewoman was still confronting me at last my eyes began to ache whereupon i returned the book to the applewoman and giving her another tanner walked awaychapter xli decease of the reviewhomer himselfbread and cheesefinger and thumbimpossible to findsomething granduniversal mixturesome other publisher time passed away and with it the review which contrary to the publishers expectation did not prove a successful speculation about four months after the period of its birth it expired as all reviews must for which there is no demand authors had ceased to send their publications to it and consequently to purchase it for i have already hinted that it was almost entirely supported by authors of a particular class who expected to see their publications foredoomed to immortality in its pages the behaviour of these authors towards this unfortunate publication i can attribute to no other cause than to a report which was industriously circulated namely that the review was low and that to be reviewed in it was an infallible sign that one was a low person who could be reviewed nowhere else so authors took fright and no wonder for it will never do for an author to be considered low homer himself has never yet entirely recovered from the injury he received by lord chesterfields remark that the speeches of his heroes were frequently exceedingly low so the review ceased and the reviewing corps no longer existed as such they forthwith returned to their proper avocationsthe editor to compose tunes on his piano and to the task of disposing of the remaining copies of his quintilianthe inferior members to working for the publisher being to a man dependants of his one to composing fairy tales another to collecting miracles of popish saints and a third newgate lives and trials owing to the bad success of the review the publisher became more furious than ever my money was growing short and i one day asked him to pay me for my labours in the deceased publication sir said the publisher what do you want the money for merely to live on i replied it is very difficult to live in this town without money how much money did you bring with you to town demanded the publisher some twenty or thirty pounds i replied and you have spent it already no said i not entirely but it is fast disappearing sir said the publisher i believe you to be extravagant yes sir extravagant on what grounds do you suppose me to be so sir said the publisher you eat meat yes said i i eat meat sometimes what should i eat bread sir said the publisher bread and cheese so i do sir when i am disposed to indulge but i cannot often afford itit is very expensive to dine on bread and cheese especially when one is fond of cheese as i am my last bread and cheese dinner cost me fourteenpence there is drink sir with bread and cheese one must drink porter sir then sir eat breadbread alone as good men as yourself have eaten bread alone they have been glad to get it sir if with bread and cheese you must drink porter sir with bread alone you can perhaps drink water sir however i got paid at last for my writings in the review not it is true in the current coin of the realm but in certain bills there were two of them one payable at twelve and the other at eighteen months after date it was a long time before i could turn these bills to any account at last i found a person who at a discount of only thirty per cent consented to cash them not however without sundry grimaces and what was still more galling holding more than once the unfortunate papers high in air between his forefinger and thumb so ill indeed did i like this last action that i felt much inclined to snatch them away i restrained myself however for i remembered that it was very difficult to live without money and that if the present person did not discount the bills i should probably find no one else that would but if the treatment which i had experienced from the publisher previous to making this demand upon him was difficult to bear that which i subsequently underwent was far more so his great delight seemed to consist in causing me misery and mortification if on former occasions he was continually sending me in quest of lives and trials difficult to find he now was continually demanding lives and trials which it was impossible to find the personages whom he mentioned never having lived nor consequently been tried moreover some of my best lives and trials which i had corrected andedited with particular care and on which i prided myself no little he caused to be cancelled after they had passed through the press amongst these was the life of gentleman harry they are drugs sir said the publisher drugs that life of harry simms has long been the greatest drug in the calendarhas it not taggart taggart made no answer save by taking a pinch of snuff the reader has i hope not forgotten taggart whom i mentioned whilst giving an account of my first mornings visit to the publisher i beg taggarts pardon for having been so long silent about him but he was a very silent manyet there was much in taggartand taggart had always been civil and kind to me in his peculiar way well young gentleman said taggart to me one morning when we chanced to be alone a few days after the affair of the cancelling how do you like authorship i scarcely call authorship the drudgery i am engaged in said i what do you call authorship said taggart i scarcely know said i that is i can scarcely express what i think it shall i help you out said taggart turning round his chair and looking at me if you like said i to write something grand said taggart taking snuff to be stared atlifted on peoples shoulders well said i that is something like it taggart took snuff well said he why dont you write something grand i have said i what said taggart why said i there are those ballads taggart took snuff and those wonderful versions from ab gwilym taggart took snuff again you seem to be very fond of snuff said i looking at him angrily taggart tapped his box have you taken it long threeandtwenty years what snuff do you take universal mixture and you find it of use taggart tapped his box in what respect said i in manythere is nothing like it to get a man through but for snuff i should scarcely be where i am now have you been long here threeandtwenty years dear me said i and snuff brought you through give me a pinchpah i dont like it and i sneezed take another pinch said taggartno said i i dont like snuff then you will never do for authorship at least for this kind so i begin to thinkwhat shall i do taggart took snuff you were talking of a great workwhat shall it be taggart took snuff do you think i could write one taggart uplifted his two forefingers as if to taphe did not however it would require time said i with a half sigh taggart tapped his box a great deal of time i really think that my ballads taggart took snuff if published would do me credit ill make an effort and offer them to some other publisher taggart took a double quantity of snuffchapter xlii francis ardrythat wont do sirobserve my gesturesi think you improvebetter than politicsdelightful young frenchwomana burning shamemagnificent impudencepaunchvoltairelump of sugar occasionally i called on francis ardry this young gentleman resided in handsome apartments in the neighbourhood of a fashionable square kept a livery servant and upon the whole lived in very good style going to see him one day between one and two i was informed by the servant that his master was engaged for the moment but that if i pleased to wait a few minutes i should find him at liberty having told the man that i had no objection he conducted me into a small apartment which served as antechamber to a drawingroom the door of this last being half open i could see francis ardry at the farther end speechifying and gesticulating in a very impressive manner the servant in some confusion was hastening to close the door but ere he could effect his purpose francis ardry who had caught a glimpse of me exclaimed come income in by all means and then proceeded as before speechifying and gesticulating filled with some surprise i obeyed his summons on entering the room i perceived another individual to whom francis ardry appeared to be addressing himself this other was a short spare man of about sixty his hair was of badger grey and his face was covered with wrinkleswithout vouchsafing me a look he kept his eye which was black and lustrous fixed full on francis ardry as if paying the deepest attention to his discourse all of a sudden however he cried with a sharp cracked voice that wont do sir that wont domore vehemenceyour argument is at present particularly weak therefore more vehemenceyou must confuse them stun them stultify them sir and at each of these injunctions he struck the back of his right hand sharply against the palm of the left good sirgood he occasionally uttered in the same sharp cracked tone as the voice of francis ardry became more and more vehement infinitely good he exclaimed as francis ardry raised his voice to the highest pitch and now sir abate let the tempest of vehemence declinegradually sir not too fast good sirvery good as the voice of francis ardry declined gradually in vehemence and now a little pathos sirtry them with a little pathos that wont do sirthat wont doas francis ardry made an attempt to become patheticthat will never pass for pathoswith tones and gesture of that description you will never redress the wrongs of your country now sir observe my gestures and pay attention to the tone of my voice sir thereupon making use of nearly the same terms which francis ardry had employed the individual in black uttered several sentences in tones and with gestures which were intended to express a considerable degree of pathos though it is possible that some people would have thought both the one and the other highly ludicrous after a pause francis ardry recommenced imitating the tones and the gesture of his monitor in the most admirable manner before he had proceeded far however he burst into a fit of laughter in which i should perhaps have joined provided it were ever my wont to laugh ha ha said the other goodhumouredly you are laughing at me well well i merely wished to give you a hint but you saw very well what i meant upon the whole i think you improve but i must now go having two other pupils to visit before four then taking from the table a kind of threecornered hat and a cane headed with amber he shook francis ardry by the hand and after glancing at me for a moment made me a half bow attended with a strange grimace and departed who is that gentleman said i to francis ardry as soon as we were alone oh that is said frank smiling the gentleman who gives me lessons in elocution and what need have you of elocution oh i merely obey the commands of my guardians said francis who insist that i should with the assistance of qualify myself for parliament for which they do me the honour to suppose that i have some natural talent i dare not disobey them for at the present moment i have particular reasons for wishing to keep on good terms with them but said i you are a roman catholic and i thought that persons of your religion were excluded from parliament why upon that very thing the whole matter hinges people of our religion are determined to be no longer excluded from parliament but to have a share in the government of the nation not that i care anything about the matter i merely obey the will of my guardians my thoughts are fixed on something better than politics i understand you said i dogfightingwell i can easily conceive that to some minds dogfighting i was not thinking of dogfighting said francis ardry interrupting me not thinking of dogfighting i ejaculated no said francis ardry something higher and much more rational than dogfighting at present occupies my thoughtsdear me said i i thought i had heard you say that there was nothing like it like what said francis ardry dogfighting to be sure said i pooh said francis ardry who but the gross and unrefined care anything for dogfighting that which at present engages my waking and sleeping thoughts is lovedivine lovethere is nothing like that listen to me i have a secret to confide to you and then francis ardry proceeded to make me his confidant it appeared that he had had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of the most delightful young frenchwoman imaginable annette la noire by name who had just arrived from her native country with the intention of obtaining the situation of governess in some english family a position which on account of her many accomplishments she was eminently qualified to fill francis ardry had however persuaded her to relinquish her intention for the present on the ground that until she had become acclimated in england her health would probably suffer from the confinement inseparable from the occupation in which she was desirous of engaging he had moreoverfor it appeared that she was the most frank and confiding creature in the worldsucceeded in persuading her to permit him to hire for her a very handsome first floor in his own neighbourhood and to accept a few inconsiderable presents in money and jewellery i am looking out for a handsome gig and horse said francis ardry at the conclusion of his narration it were a burning shame that so divine a creature should have to go about a place like london on foot or in a paltry hackney coach but said i will not the pursuit of politics prevent your devoting much time to this fair lady it will prevent me devoting all my time said francis ardry as i gladly would but what can i do my guardians wish me to qualify myself for a political orator and i dare not offend them by a refusal if i offend my guardians i should find it impossibleunless i have recourse to jews and moneylendersto support annette present her with articles of dress and jewellery and purchase a horse and cabriolet worthy of conveying her angelic person through the streets of london after a pause in which francis ardry appeared lost in thought his mind being probably occupied with the subject of annette i broke silence by observing so your fellowreligionists are really going to make a serious attempt to procure their emancipation yes said francis ardry starting from his reverie everything has been arranged even a leader has been chosen at least for us of ireland upon the whole the most suitable man in the world for the occasiona barrister of considerable talent mighty voice and magnificent impudence with emancipation liberty and redress for the wrongs of ireland in his mouth he is to force his way into the british house of commons dragging myself and others behind himhe will succeed and when he is in he will cut a figure i have heard himself who has heard him speak say that he will cut a figure and is competent to judge i demanded who but he said francis ardry no one questions his judgment concerning what relates to elocution his fame on that point is so well established that the greatest orators do not disdain occasionally to consult him c himself as i have been told when anxious to produce any particular effect in the house is in the habit of calling in for a consultation as to matter or manner said i chiefly the latter said francis ardry though he is competent to give advice as to both for he has been an orator in his day and a leader of the people though he confessed to me that he was not exactly qualified to play the latter parti want paunch said he it is not always indispensable said i there is an orator in my town a hunchback and watchmaker without it who not only leads the people but the mayor too perhaps he has a succedaneum in his hunch but tell me is the leader of your movement in possession of that which wants no more deficient in it than in brass said francis ardry well said i whatever his qualifications may be i wish him success in the cause which he has taken upi love religious liberty we shall succeed said francis ardry john bull upon the whole is rather indifferent on the subject and then we are sure to be backed by the radical party who to gratify their political prejudices would join with satan himselfthere is one thing said i connected with this matter which surprises meyour own lukewarmness yes making every allowance for your natural predilection for dogfighting and your present enamoured state of mind your apathy at the commencement of such a movement is to me unaccountable you would not have cause to complain of my indifference said frank provided i thought my country would be benefited by this movement but i happen to know the origin of it the priests are the originators and what country was ever benefited by a movement which owed its origin to them so says voltaire a page of whom i occasionally read by the present move they hope to increase their influence and to further certain designs which they entertain both with regard to this country and ireland i do not speak rashly or unadvisedly a strange fellowa half italian half english priestwho was recommended to me by my guardians partly as a spiritual partly as a temporal guide has let me into a secret or two he is fond of a glass of gin and waterand over a glass of gin and water cold with a lump of sugar in it he has been more communicative perhaps than was altogether prudent were i my own master i would kick him politics and religious movements to a considerable distance and now if you are going away do so quickly i have an appointment with annette and must make myself fit to appear before herchapter xliii progressglorious johnutterly unintelligiblewhat a difference by the month of october i had in spite of all difficulties and obstacles accomplished about twothirds of the principal task which i had undertaken the compiling of the newgate lives i had also made some progress in translating the publishers philosophy into german but about this time i began to see very clearly that it was impossible that our connection should prove of long duration yet in the event of my leaving the big man what other resource had ianother publisher but what had i to offer there were my ballads my ab gwilym but then i thought of taggart and his snuff his pinch of snuff however i determined to see what could be done so i took my ballads under my arm and went to various publishers some took snuff others did not but none took my ballads or ab gwilym they would not even look at them one asked me if i had anything elsehe was a snufftakeri said yes and going home returned with my translation of the german novel to which i have before alluded after keeping it for a fortnight he returned it to me on my visiting him and taking a pinch of snuff told me it would not do there were marks of snuff on the outside of the manuscript which was a roll of paper bound with red tape but there were no marks of snuff on the interior of the manuscript from which i concluded that he had never opened it i had often heard of one glorious john who lived at the western end of the town on consulting taggart he told me that it was possible that glorious john would publish my ballads and ab gwilym that is said he taking a pinch of snuff provided you can see him so i went to the house where glorious john resided and a glorious house it was but i could not see glorious johni called a dozen times but i never could see glorious john twenty years after by the greatest chance in the world i saw glorious john and sure enough glorious john published my books but they were different books from the first i never offered my ballads or ab gwilym to glorious john glorious john was no snufftaker he asked me to dinner and treated me with superb rhenish wine glorious john is now gone to his rest but iwhat was i going to saythe world will never forget glorious john so i returned to my last resource for the time then beingto the publisher persevering doggedly in my labour one day on visiting the publisher i found him stamping with fury upon certain fragments of paper sir said he you know nothing of german i have shown your translation of the first chapter of my philosophy to several germans it is utterly unintelligible to them did they see the philosophy i replied they did sir but they did not profess to understand english no more do i i replied if that philosophy be english the publisher was furiousi was silent for want of a pinch of snuff i had recourse to something which is no bad substitute for a pinch of snuff to those who cant take it silent contempt at first it made the publisher more furious as perhaps a pinch of snuff would it however eventually calmed him and he ordered me back to my occupations in other words the compilation to be brief the compilation was completed i got paid in the usual manner and forthwith left him he was a clever man but what a difference in clever menchapter xliv the old spota long historythou shalt not stealno harmeducationnecessityfoam on your lipapples and pearswhat will you readmetaphorthe fur capi dont know him it was past midwinter and i sat on london bridge in company with the old applewoman she had just returned to the other side of the bridge to her place in the booth where i had originally found her this she had done after frequent conversations with me she liked the old place best she said which she would never have left but for the terror which she experienced when the boys ran away with her book so i sat with her at the old spot one afternoon past midwinter reading the book of which i had by this time come to the last pages i had observed that the old woman for some time past had shown much less anxiety about the book than she had been in the habit of doing i was however not quite prepared for her offering to make me a present of it which she did that afternoon when having finished it i returned it to her with many thanks for the pleasure and instruction i had derived from its perusal you may keep it dear said the old woman with a sigh you may carry it to your lodging and keep it for your own looking at the old woman with surprise i exclaimed is it possible that you are willing to part with the book which has been your source of comfort so long whereupon the old woman entered into a long history from which i gathered that the book had become distasteful to her she hardly ever opened it of late she said or if she did it was only to shut it again also that other things which she had been fond of though of a widely different kind were now distasteful to her porter and beefsteaks were no longer grateful to her palate her present diet chiefly consisting of tea and bread and butter ah said i you have been ill and when people are ill they seldom like the things which give them pleasure when they are in health i learned moreover that she slept little at night and had all kinds of strange thoughts that as she lay awake many things connected with her youth which she had quite forgotten came into her mind there were certain words that came into her mind the night before the last which were continually humming in her ears i found that the words were thou shalt not steal on inquiring where she had first heard these words i learned that she had read them at school in a book called the primer to this school she had been sent by her mother who was a poor widow and followed the trade of appleselling in the very spot where her daughter followed it now it seems that the mother was a very good kind of woman but quite ignorant of letters the benefit of which she was willing to procure for her child and at the school the daughter learned to read and subsequently experienced the pleasure and benefit of letters in being able to read the book which she found in an obscure closet of her mothers house and which had been her principal companion and comfort for many years of her life but as i have said before she was now dissatisfied with the book and with most other things in which she had taken pleasure she dwelt much on the words thou shalt not steal she had never stolen things herself but then she had bought things which other people had stolen and which she knew had been stolen and her dear son had been a thief which he perhaps would not have been but for the example which she set him in buying things from characters as she called them who associated with her on inquiring how she had become acquainted with these characters i learned that times had gone hard with her that she had married but her husband had died after a long sickness which had reduced them to great distress that her fruit trade was not a profitable one and that she had bought and sold things which had been stolen to support herself and her son that for a long time she supposed there was no harm in doing so as her book was full of entertaining tales of stealing but she now thought that the book was a bad book and that learning to read was a bad thing her mother had never been able to read but had died in peace though poor so here was a woman who attributed the vices and follies of her life to being able to read her mother she said who could not read lived respectably and died in peace and what was the essential difference between the mother and daughter save that the latter could read but for her literature she might in all probability have lived respectably and honestly like her mother and might eventually have died in peace which at present she could scarcely hope to do education had failed to produce any good in this poor woman on the contrary there could be little doubt that she had been injured by it then was education a bad thing rousseau was of opinion that it was but rousseau was a frenchman at least wrote in french and i cared not the snap of my fingers for rousseau but education has certainly been of benefit in some instances well what did that prove but that partiality existed in the management of the affairs of the worldif education was a benefit to some why was it not a benefit to others could some avoid abusing it any more than others could avoid turning it to a profitable account i did not see how they could this poor simple woman found a book in her mothers closet a book which was a capital book for those who could turn it to the account for which it was intended a book from the perusal of which i felt myself wiser and better but which was by no means suited to the intellect of this poor simple woman who thought that it was written in praise of thieving yet she found it she read it andandi felt myself getting into a maze what is right thought i what is wrong do i exist does the world exist if it does every action is bound up with necessity necessity i exclaimed and cracked my finger joints ah it is a bad thing said the old woman what is a bad thing said i why to be poor dear you talk like a fool said i riches and poverty are only different forms of necessity you should not call me a fool dear you should not call your own mother a fool you are not my mother said i not your mother dearno no more i am but your calling me fool put me in mind of my dear son who often used to call me fooland you just now looked as he sometimes did with a blob of foam on your lip after all i dont know that you are not my mother dont you dear im glad of it i wish you would make it out how should i make it out who can speak from his own knowledge as to the circumstances of his birth besides before attempting to establish our relationship it would be necessary to prove that such people exist what people dear you and i lord child you are mad that book has made you so dont abuse it said i the book is an excellent one that is provided it exists i wish it did not said the old woman but it shant long ill burn it or fling it into the riverthe voices at night tell me to do so tell the voices said i that they talk nonsense the book if it exists is a good book it contains a deep moral have you read it all all the funny parts dear all about taking things and the manner it was done as for the rest i could not exactly make it out then the book is not to blame i repeat that the book is a good book and contains deep morality always supposing that there is such a thing as morality which is the same thing as supposing that there is anything at all anything at all why ant we here on this bridge in my booth with my stall and my apples and pears baked hot you would sayi dont know all is a mystery a deep question it is a question and probably always will be whether there is a world and consequently apples and pears and provided there be a world whether that world be like an apple or a pear dont talk so dear i wont we will suppose that we all existworld ourselves apples and pears so you wish to get rid of the book yes dear i wish you would take it i have read it and have no farther use for it i do not need books in a little time perhaps i shall not have a place wherein to deposit myself far less books then i will fling it into the river dont do that here give it me now what shall i do with it you were so fond of iti am so no longer but how will you pass your time what will you read i wish i had never learned to read or if i had that i had only read the books i saw at school the primer or the other what was the other i think they called it the bible all about god and job and jesus ah i know it you have read it is it a nice bookall true true truei dont know what to say but if the world be true and not all a lie a fiction i dont see why the bible as they call it should not be true by the bye what do you call bible in your tongue or indeed book of any kind as bible merely means a book what do i call the bible in my language dear yes the language of those who bring you things the language of those who did dear they bring them now no longer they call me fool as you did dear just now they call kissing the bible which means taking a false oath smacking calfskin thats metaphor said i english but metaphorical what an odd language so you would like to have a bibleshall i buy you one i am poor dearno money since i left off the other trade well then ill buy you one no dear no you are poor and may soon want the money but if you can take me one conveniently on the sly you knowi think you may for as it is a good book i suppose there can be no harm in taking it that will never do said i more especially as i should be sure to be caught not having made taking of things my trade but ill tell you what ill dotry and exchange this book of yours for a bible who knows for what great things this same book of yours may serve well dear said the old woman do as you please i should like to see thewhat do you call itbible and to read it as you seem to think it true yes said i seem that is the way to express yourself in this maze of doubti seem to thinkthese apples and pears seem to beand here seems to be a gentleman who wants to purchase either one or the other a person had stopped before the applewomans stall and was glancing now at the fruit now at the old woman and myself he wore a blue mantle and had a kind of fur cap on his head he was somewhat above the middle stature his features were keen but rather hard there was a slight obliquity in his vision selecting a small apple he gave the old woman a penny then after looking at me scrutinisingly for a moment he moved from the booth in the direction of southwark do you know who that man is said i to the old woman no said she except that he is one of my best customers he frequently stops takes an apple and gives me a penny his is the only piece of money i have taken this blessed day i dont know him but he has once or twice sat down in the booth with two strangelooking menmulattos or lascars i think they call themchapter xlv bought and exchangedquite emptya new firmbiblescountenance of a lionclap of thundera truce with thisi have lost itclearly a rightgoddess of the mint in pursuance of my promise to the old woman i set about procuring her a bible with all convenient speed placing the book which she had entrusted to me for the purpose of exchange in my pocket i went to several shops and asked if bibles were to be had i found that there were plenty when however i informed the people that i came to barter they looked blank and declined treating with me saying that they did not do business in that way at last i went into a shop over the window of which i saw written books bought and exchanged there was a smartish young fellow in the shop with black hair and whiskers you exchange said i yes said he sometimes but we prefer selling what book do you want a bible said i ah said he theres a great demand for bibles just now all kinds of people are become very pious of late he added grinning at me i am afraid i cant do business with you more especially as the master is not at home what book have you brought taking the book out of my pocket i placed it on the counter the young fellow opened the book and inspecting the titlepage burst into a loud laugh what do you laugh for said i angrily and half clenching my fist laugh said the young fellow laugh who could help laughing i could said i i see nothing to laugh at i want to exchange this book for a bible you do said the young fellow well i dare say there are plenty who would be willing to exchange that is if they dared i wish master were at home but that would never do either masters a family man the bibles are not mine and master being a family man is sharp and knows all his stock id buy it of you but to tell you the truth i am quite empty here said he pointing to his pocket so i am afraid we cant deal whereupon looking anxiously at the young man what am i to do said i i really want a bible cant you buy one said the young man have you no money yes said i i have some but i am merely the agent of another i came to exchange not to buy what am i to do i dont know said the young man thoughtfully laying down the book on the counter i dont know what you can do i think you will find some difficulty in this bartering job the trade are rather precise all at once he laughed louder than before suddenly stopping however he put on a very grave look take my advice said he there is a firm established in this neighbourhood which scarcely sells any books but bibles they are very rich and pride themselves on selling their books at the lowest possible price apply to them who knows but what they will exchange with you thereupon i demanded with some eagerness of the young man the direction to the place where he thought it possible that i might effect the exchangewhich direction the young fellow cheerfully gave me and as i turned away had the civility to wish me success i had no difficulty in finding the house to which the young fellow directed me it was a very large house situated in a square and upon the side of the house was written in large letters bibles and other religious books at the door of the house were two or three tumbrils in the act of being loaded with chests very much resembling teachests one of the chests falling down burst and out flew not tea but various books in a neat small size and in neat leather covers bibles said ibibles doubtless i was not quite right nor quite wrong picking up one of the books i looked at it for a moment and found it to be the new testament come young lad said a man who stood by in the dress of a porter put that book down it is none of yours if you want a book go in and deal for one deal thought i dealthe man seems to know what i am coming aboutand going in i presently found myself in a very large room behind a counter two men stood with their backs to a splendid fire warming themselves for the weather was cold of these men one was dressed in brown and the other was dressed in black both were tall menhe who was dressed in brown was thin and had a particularly illnatured countenance the man dressed in black was bulky his features were noble but they were those of a lion what is your business young man said the precise personage as i stood staring at him and his companion i want a bible said i what price what size said the preciselooking man as to size said i i should like to have a large onethat is if you can afford me onei do not come to buy oh friend said the preciselooking man if you come here expecting to have a bible for nothing you are mistakenwe i would scorn to have a bible for nothing said i or anything else i came not to beg but to barter there is no shame in that especially in a country like this where all folks barter oh we dont barter said the precise man at least bibles you had better depart stay brother said the man with the countenance of a lion let us ask a few questions this may be a very important case perhaps the young man has had convictions not i i exclaimed i am convinced of nothing and with regard to the biblei dont believe hey said the man with the lion countenance and there he stopped but with that hey the walls of the house seemed to shake the windows rattled and the porter whom i had seen in front of the house came running up the steps and looked into the apartment through the glass of the door there was silence for about a minutethe same kind of silence which succeeds a clap of thunder at last the man with the lion countenance who had kept his eyes fixed upon me said calmly were you about to say that you dont believe in the bible young man no more than in anything else said i you were talking of convictionsi have no convictions it is not easy to believe in the bible till one is convinced that there is a bible he seems to be insane said the primlooking man we had better order the porter to turn him out i am by no means certain said i that the porter could turn me out always provided there is a porter and this system of ours be not a lie and a dream come said the lionlooking man impatiently a truce with this nonsense if the porter cannot turn you out perhaps some other person can but to the pointyou want a bible i do said i but not for myself i was sent by another person to offer something in exchange for one and who is that person a poor old woman who has had what you call convictionsheard voices or thought she heard themi forgot to ask her whether they were loud ones what has she sent to offer in exchange said the man without taking any notice of the concluding part of my speech a book said i let me see it nay brother said the precise man this will never do if we once adopt the system of barter we shall have all the holders of useless rubbish in the town applying to us i wish to see what he has brought said the other perhaps baxter or jewells apology either of which would make a valuable addition to our collection well young man whats the matter with you i stood like one petrified i had put my hand into my pocketthe book was gone whats the matter repeated the man with the lion countenance in a voice very much resembling thunder i have it noti have lost it a pretty story truly said the preciselooking man lost it you had better retire said the other how shall i appear before the party who entrusted me with the book she will certainly think that i have purloined it notwithstanding all i can say nor indeed can i blame herappearances are certainly against me they are soyou had better retire i moved towards the door stay young man one word more there is only one way of proceeding which would induceme to believe that you are sincere what is that said i stopping and looking at him anxiously the purchase of a bible purchase said i purchase i came not to purchase but to barter such was my instruction and how can i barter if i have lost the book the other made no answer and turning away i made for the door all of a sudden i started and turning round dear me said i it has just come into my head that if the book was lost by my negligence as it must have been i have clearly a right to make it good no answer yes i repeated i have clearly a right to make it good how glad i am see the effect of a little reflection i will purchase a bible instantly that is if i have not lost and with considerable agitation i felt in my pocket the primlooking man smiled i suppose said he that he has lost his money as well as book no said i i have not and pulling out my hand i displayed no less a sum than three halfcrowns o noble goddess of the mint as dame charlotta nordenflycht the swede said a hundred and fifty years ago great is thy power how energetically the possession of thee speaks in favour of mans character only half a crown for this bible said i putting down the money it is worth three and bowing to the man of the noble features i departed with my purchase queer customer said the primlooking man as i was about to close the doordont like him why as to that i scarcely know what to say said he of the countenance of a lionchapter xlvi the pickpocketstrange rencounterdrag him alonga great servicethings of importancephilological matters mother of languageszhats a few days after the occurrence of what is recorded in the last chapter as i was wandering in the city chance directed my footsteps to an alley leading from one narrow street to another in the neighbourhood of cheapside just before i reached the mouth of the alley a man in a greatcoat closely followed by another passed it and at the moment in which they were passing i observed the man behind snatch something from the pocket of the other whereupon darting into the street i seized the hindermost man by the collar crying at the same time to the other my good friend this person has just picked your pocket the individual whom i addressed turning round with a start glanced at me and then at the person whom i held london is the place for strange rencounters it appeared to me that i recognised both individualsthe man whose pocket had been picked and the other the latter now began to struggle violently i have picked no ones pocket said he rascal said the other you have got my pocketbook in your bosom no i have not said the other and struggling more violently than before the pocketbook dropped from his bosom upon the ground the other was now about to lay hands upon the fellow who was still struggling you had better take up your book said i i can hold him he followed my advice and taking up his pocketbook surveyed my prisoner with a ferocious look occasionally glaring at me yes i had seen him beforeit was the stranger whom i had observed on london bridge by the stall of the old applewoman with the cap and cloak but instead of these he now wore a hat and greatcoat well said i at last what am i to do with this gentleman of ours nodding to the prisoner who had now left off struggling shall i let him go go said the other go the knavethe rascal let him go indeed not so he shall go before the lord mayor bring him along oh let me go said the other let me go this is the first offence i assure yethe first time i ever thought to do anything wrong hold your tongue said i or i shall be angry with you if i am not very much mistaken you once attempted to cheat me i never saw you before in all my life said the fellow though his countenance seemed to belie his words that is not true said i you are the man who attempted to cheat me of oneandninepence in the coachyard on the first morning of my arrival in london i dont doubt it said the other a confirmed thief and here his tones became peculiarly sharp i would fain see him hangedcrucified drag him along i am no constable said i you have got your pocketbooki would rather you would bid me let him go bid you let him go said the other almost furiously i commandstay what was i going to say i was forgetting myself he observed more gently but he stole my pocketbookif you did but know what it contained well said i if it contains anything valuable be the more thankful that you have recovered it as for the man i will help you to take him where you please but i wish you would let him go the stranger hesitated and there was an extraordinary play of emotion in his features he looked ferociously at the pickpocket and more than once somewhat suspiciously at myself at last his countenance cleared and with a good grace he said well you have done me a great service and you have my consent to let him go but the rascal shall not escape with impunity he exclaimed suddenly as i let the man go and starting forward before the fellow could escape he struck him a violent blow on the face the man staggered and had nearly fallen recovering himself however he said i tell you what my fellow if i ever meet you in this street in a dark night and i have a knife about me it shall be the worse for you as for you young man said he to me but observing that the other was making towards him he left whatever he was about to say unfinished and taking to his heels was out of sight in a moment the stranger and myself walked in the direction of cheapside the way in which he had been originally proceeding he was silent for a few moments at length he said you have really done me a great service and i should be ungrateful not to acknowledge it i am a merchant and a merchants pocketbook as you perhaps know contains many things of importance but young man he exclaimed i think i have seen you before i thought so at first but where i cannot exactly say where was it i mentioned london bridge and the old applewoman oh said he and smiled and there was something peculiar in his smile i remember now do you frequently sit on london bridge occasionally said ithat old woman is an old friend of mine friend said the stranger i am glad of it for i shall know where to find you at present i am going to change time you know is precious to a merchant we were by this time close to cheapside farewell said he i shall not forget this service i trust we shall soon meet again he then shook me by the hand and went his way the next day as i was seated beside the old woman in the booth the stranger again made his appearance and after a word or two sat down beside me the old woman was sometimes reading the bible which she had already had two or three days in her possession and sometimes discoursing with me our discourse rolled chiefly on philological matters what do you call bread in your language said i you mean the language of those who bring me things to buy or who did for as i told you before i shant buy any more its no language of mine dearthey call bread pannam in their language pannam said i pannam evidently connected with if not derived from the latin panis even as the word tanner which signifieth a sixpence is connected with if not derived from the latin tener which is itself connected with if not derived from tawno or tawner which in the language of mr petulengro signifieth a sucking child let me see what is the term for bread in the language of mr petulengro morro or manro as i have sometimes heard it called is there not some connection between these words and panis yes i think there is and i should not wonder if morro manro and panis were connected perhaps derived from the same root but what is that root i dont knowi wish i did though perhaps i should not be the happier morromanro i rather think morro is the oldest form it is easier to say morro than manro morro irish aran welsh bara english bread i can see a resemblance between all the words and pannam too and i rather think that the petulengrian word is the elder how odd it would be if the language of mr petulengro should eventually turn out to be the mother of all the languages in the world yet it is certain that there are some languages in which the terms for bread have no connection with the word used by mr petulengro notwithstanding that those languages in many other points exhibit a close affinity to the language of the horseshoe master for example bread in hebrew is laham which assuredly exhibits little similitude to the word used by the aforesaid petulengro in armenian it is zhats said the stranger starting up by the patriarch and the three holy churches this is wonderful how came you to know aught of armenianchapter xlvii new acquaintancewired casesbread and winearmenian colonieslearning without moneywhat a language the tideyour foiblelearning of the haiksold proverbpressing invitation just as i was about to reply to the interrogation of my newformed acquaintance a man with a dusky countenance probably one of the lascars or mulattos of whom the old woman had spoken came up and whispered to him and with this man he presently departednot however before he had told me the place of his abode and requested me to visit him after the lapse of a few days i called at the house which he had indicated it was situated in a dark and narrow street in the heart of the city at no great distance from the bank i entered a countingroom in which a solitary clerk with a foreign look was writing the stranger was not at home returning the next day however i met him at the door as he was about to enter he shook me warmly by the hand i am glad to see you said he follow me i was just thinking of you he led me through the countingroom to an apartment up a flight of stairs before ascending however he looked into the book in which the foreignvisaged clerk was writing and seemingly not satisfied with the manner in which he was executing his task he gave him two or three cuffs telling him at the same time that he deserved crucifixion the apartment above stairs to which he led me was large with three windows which opened upon the street the walls were hung with wired cases apparently containing books there was a table and two or three chairs but the principal article of furniture was a long sofa extending from the door by which we entered to the farther end of the apartment seating himself upon the sofa my new acquaintance motioned to me to sit beside him and then looking me full in the face repeated his former inquiry in the name of all that is wonderful how came you to know aught of my language there is nothing wonderful in that said i we are at the commencement of a philological age every one studies languages that is every one who is fit for nothing else philology being the last resource of dulness and ennui i have got a little in advance of the throng by mastering the armenian alphabet but i foresee the time when every unmarriageable miss and desperate blockhead will likewise have acquired the letters of mesroub and will know the term for bread in armenian and perhaps that for wine kini said my companion and that and the other word put me in mind of the duties of hospitality will you eat bread and drink wine with me willingly said i whereupon my companion unlocking a closet produced on a silver salver a loaf of bread with a silverhandled knife and wine in a silver flask with cups of the same metal i hope you like my fare said he after we had both eaten and drunk i like your bread said i for it is stale i like not your wine it is sweet and i hate sweet wine it is wine of cyprus said my entertainer and when i found that it was wine of cyprus i tasted it again and the second taste pleased me much better than the first notwithstanding that i still thought it somewhat sweet so said i after a pause looking at my companion you are an armenian yes said he an armenian born in london but not less an armenian on that account my father was a native of ispahan one of the celebrated armenian colony which was established there shortly after the time of the dreadful hunger which drove the children of haik in swarms from their original country and scattered them over most parts of the eastern and western world in ispahan he passed the greater portion of his life following mercantile pursuits with considerable success certain enemies however having accused him to the despot of the place of using seditious language he was compelled to flee leaving most of his property behind travelling in the direction of the west he came at last to london where he established himself and where he eventually died leaving behind a large property and myself his only child the fruit of a marriage with an armenian english woman who did not survive my birth more than three months the armenian then proceeded to tell me that he had carried on the business of his father which seemed to embrace most matters from buying silks of lascars to speculating in the funds and that he had considerably increased the property which his father had left him he candidly confessed that he was wonderfully fond of gold and said there was nothing like it for giving a person respectability and consideration in the world to which assertion i made no answer being not exactly prepared to contradict it and when he had related to me his history he expressed a desire to know something more of myself whereupon i gave him the outline of my history concluding with saying i am now a poor author or rather philologist upon the streets of london possessed of many tongues which i find of no use in the worldlearning without money is anything but desirable said the armenian as it unfits a man for humble occupations it is true that it may occasionally beget him friends i confess to you that your understanding something of my language weighs more with me than the service you rendered me in rescuing my pocketbook the other day from the claws of that scoundrel whom i yet hope to see hanged if not crucified notwithstanding there were in that pocketbook papers and documents of considerable value yes that circumstance makes my heart warm towards you for i am proud of my languageas i indeed well may bewhat a language noble and energetic quite original differing from all others both in words and structure you are mistaken said i many languages resemble the armenian both in structure and words for example said the armenian for example said i the english the english said the armenian show me one word in which the english resembles the armenian you walk on london bridge said i yes said the armenian i saw you look over the balustrade the other morning true said the armenian well what did you see rushing up through the arches with noise and foam what was it said the armenian what was ityou dont mean the tide do i not said i well what has the tide to do with the matter much said i what is the tide the ebb and flow of the sea said the armenian the sea itself what is the haik word for sea the armenian gave a strong gasp then nodding his head thrice you are right said he the english word tide is the armenian for sea and now i begin to perceive that there are many english words which are armenian there is and and there again in french there is and derived from the armenian how strange how singulari thank you it is a proud thing to see that the language of my race has had so much influence over the languages of the world i saw that all that related to his race was the weak point of the armenian i did not flatter the armenian with respect to his race or language an inconsiderable people said i shrewd and industrious but still an inconsiderable people a language bold and expressive and of some antiquity derived though perhaps not immediately from some much older tongue i do not think that the armenian has had any influence over the formation of the languages of the world i am not much indebted to the armenian for the solution of any doubts whereas to the language of mr petulengro i have heard you mention that name before said the armenian who is mr petulengro and then i told the armenian who mr petulengro was the armenian spoke contemptuously of mr petulengro and his race dont speak contemptuously of mr petulengro said i nor of anything belonging to him he is a dark mysterious personage all connected with him is a mystery especially his language but i believe that his language is doomed to solve a great philological problemmr petulengro you appear agitated said the armenian take another glass of wine you possess a great deal of philological knowledge but it appears to me that the language of this petulengro is your foible but let us change the subject i feel much interested in you and would fain be of service to you can you cast accounts i shook my head keep books i have an idea that i could write books said i but as to keeping them and here again i shook my headthe armenian was silent some time all at once glancing at one of the wire cases with which as i have already said the walls of the room were hung he asked me if i was well acquainted with the learning of the haiks the books in these cases said he contain the masterpieces of haik learning no said i all i know of the learning of the haiks is their translation of the bible you have never read z no said i i have never read z i have a plan said the armenian i think i can employ you agreeably and profitably i should like to see z in an english dress you shall translate z if you can read the scriptures in armenian you can translate z he is our esop the most acute and clever of all our moral writershis philosophy i will have nothing to do with him said i wherefore said the armenian there is an old proverb said i that a burnt child avoids the fire i have burnt my hands sufficiently with attempting to translate philosophy to make me cautious of venturing upon it again and then i told the armenian how i had been persuaded by the publisher to translate his philosophy into german and what sorry thanks i had received and who knows said i but the attempt to translate armenian philosophy into english might be attended with yet more disagreeable consequences the armenian smiled you would find me very different from the publisher in many points i have no doubt i should i replied but at the present moment i feel like a bird which has escaped from a cage and though hungry feels no disposition to return of what nation is the dark man below stairs whom i saw writing at the desk he is a moldave said the armenian the dog and here his eyes sparkled deserves to be crucified he is continually making mistakes the armenian again renewed his proposition about z which i again refused as i felt but little inclination to place myself beneath the jurisdiction of a person who was in the habit of cuffing those whom he employed when they made mistakes i presently took my departure not however before i had received from the armenian a pressing invitation to call upon him whenever i should feel disposedchapter xlviii what to dostrong enoughfame and profitalliterative euphonyexcellent fellowlisten to mea plan bagnigge wells anxious thoughts frequently disturbed me at this time with respect to what i was to do and how support myself in the great city my future prospects were gloomy enough and i looked forward and feared sometimes i felt half disposed to accept the offer of the armenian and to commence forthwith under his superintendence the translation of the haik esop but the remembrance of the cuffs which i had seen him bestow upon the moldavian when glancing over his shoulder into the ledger or whatever it was on which he was employed immediately drove the inclination from my mind i could not support the idea of the possibility of his staring over my shoulder upon my translation of the haik esop and dissatisfied with my attempts treating me as he had treated the moldavian clerk placing myself in a position which exposed me to such treatment would indeed be plunging into the fire after escaping from the fryingpan the publisher insolent and overbearing as he was whatever he might have wished or thought had never lifted his hand against me or told me that i merited crucifixion what was i to do turn porter i was strong but there was something besides strength required to ply the trade of a portera mind of a particularly phlegmatic temperament which i did not possess what should i doenlist as a soldier i was tall enough but something besides height is required to make a man play with credit the part of soldier i mean a private onea spirit if spirit it can be called which will not only enable a man to submit with patience to insolence and abuse and even to cuffs and kicks but occasionally to the lash i felt that i was not qualified to be a soldier at least a private one far better be a drudge to the most ferocious of publishers editing newgate lives and writing in eighteenpenny reviewsbetter to translate the haik esop under the superintendence of ten armenians than be a private soldier in the english service i did not decide rashlyi knew something of soldiering what should i do i thought that i would make a last and desperate attempt to dispose of the ballads and of ab gwilym i had still an idea that provided i could persuade any spirited publisher to give these translations to the world i should acquire both considerable fame and profit not perhaps a worldembracing fame such as byrons but a fame not to be sneered at which would last me a considerable time and would keep my heart from breakingprofit not equal to that which scott had made by his wondrous novels but which would prevent me from starving and enable me to achieve some other literary enterprise i read and reread my ballads and the more i read them the more i was convinced that the public in the event of their being published would freely purchase and hail them with the merited applause were not the deeds and adventures wonderful and heartstirring from which it is true i could claim no merit being but the translator but had i not rendered them into english with all their original fire yes i was confident i had and i had no doubt that the public would say so and then with respect to ab gwilym had i not done as much justice to him as to the danish ballads not only rendering faithfully his thoughts imagery and phraseology but even preserving in my translation the alliterative euphony which constitutes one of the most remarkable features of welsh prosody yes i had accomplished all this and i doubted not that the public would receive my translations from ab gwilym with quite as much eagerness as my version of the danish ballads but i found the publishers as untractable as ever and to this day the public has never had an opportunity of doing justice to the glowing fire of my ballad versification and the alliterative euphony of my imitations of ab gwilym i had not seen francis ardry since the day i had seen him taking lessons in elocution one afternoon as i was seated at my table my head resting on my hands he entered my apartment sitting down he inquired of me why i had not been to see him i might ask the same question of you i replied wherefore have you not been to see me whereupon francis ardry told me that he had been much engaged in his oratorical exercises also in escorting the young frenchwoman about to places of public amusement he then again questioned me as to the reason of my not having been to see him i returned an evasive answer the truth was that for some time past my appearance owing to the state of my finances had been rather shabby and i did not wish to expose a fashionable young man like francis ardry who lived in a fashionable neighbourhood to the imputation of having a shabby acquaintance i was aware that francis ardry was an excellent fellow but on that very account i felt under existing circumstances a delicacy in visiting him it is very possible that he had an inkling of how matters stood as he presently began to talk of my affairs and prospects i told him of my late ill success with the booksellers and inveighed against their blindness to their own interest in refusing to publish my translations the last that i addressed myself to said i told me not to trouble him again unless i could bring him a decent novel or a tale well said frank and why did you not carry him a decent novel or a tale because i have neither said i and to write them is i believe above my capacity at present i feel divested of allenergyheartless and almost hopeless i see how it is said francis ardry you have overworked yourself and worst of all to no purpose take my advice cast all care aside and only think of diverting yourself for a month at least divert myself said i and where am i to find the means be that care on my shoulders said francis ardry listen to memy uncles have been so delighted with the favourable accounts which they have lately received from t of my progress in oratory that in the warmth of their hearts they made me a present yesterday of two hundred pounds this is more money than i want at least for the present do me the favour to take half of it as a loanhear me said he observing that i was about to interrupt him i have a plan in my headone of the prettiest in the world the sister of my charmer is just arrived from france she cannot speak a word of english and as annette and myself are much engaged in our own matters we cannot pay her the attention which we should wish and which she deserves for she is a truly fascinating creature although somewhat differing from my charmer having blue eyes and flaxen hair whilst annette on the contrary but i hope you will shortly see annette now my plan is thistake the money dress yourself fashionably and conduct annettes sister to bagnigge wells and what should we do at bagnigge wells do said francis ardry dance but said i i scarcely know anything of dancing then heres an excellent opportunity of improving yourself like most frenchwomen she dances divinely however if you object to bagnigge wells and dancing go to brighton and remain there a month or two at the end of which time you can return with your mind refreshed and invigorated and materials perhaps for a tale or novel i never heard a more foolish plan said i or one less likely to terminate profitably or satisfactorily i thank you however for your offer which is i dare say well meant if i am to escape from my cares and troubles and find my mind refreshed and invigorated i must adopt other means than conducting a french demoiselle to brighton or bagnigge wells defraying the expense by borrowing from a friend
