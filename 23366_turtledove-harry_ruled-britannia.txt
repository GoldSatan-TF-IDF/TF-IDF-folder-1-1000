harry turtledove ruled britannia i two spanish soldiers swaggered up tower street toward william shakespeare their boots squelched in the mud one wore a rusty corselet with his highcrowned morion the other a similar helmet with a jacket of quilted cotton rapiers swung at their hips the fellow with the corselet carried a pike longer than he was tall the other shouldered an arquebus their lean swarthy faces wore what looked like permanent sneers people scrambled out of their way apprentices without ruffs and in plain wool caps a pipesmoking sailor wearing white trousers with spiral stripes of blue a merchants wife in a red wool doublet spotted with whitealmost a mans stylewho lifted her long black skirt to keep it out of puddles a ragged farmer in from the countryside with a donkey weighted down with sacks of beans shakespeare flattened himself against the rough weatherfaded timbers of a shop along with everybody else the spaniards had held londonheld it down for queen isabella daughter of philip of spain and her husband albert of austriafor more than nine years now everyone knew what happened to men rash enough to show them disrespect to their faces a cold nasty autumn drizzle began sifting down from the gray sky shakespeare tugged his hat down lower on his forehead to keep the rain out of his eyesand to keep the world from seeing how thin his hair was getting in front though he was only thirtythree he scratched at the little chin beard he wore where was the justice in that on went the spaniards one of them kicked at a skinny gingercolored dog gnawing a dead rat the dog skittered away the soldier almost measured himself full length in the sloppy street his friend grabbed his arm to steady him behind them the englishmen and women got back to their business a pockmarked tavern tout took shakespeares hand try the red bear friend the fellow said breathing beer fumes and the stink of rotting teeth into his face the drink is good the wenches friendly away with you shakespeare twisted free the mans dirty hand he noted with annoyance had smudged the sleeve of his limegreen doublet away with me away with me the tout squeaked am i a blackbeetle for you to squash blackbeetle or no ill spurn you with my foot if you trouble me more shakespeare said he was a tall man on the lean side but solidly made and well fed the touts skin stretched drumhead tight over cheekbones and jaw he slunk off to earn his pennieshis farthings more likelysomewhere else a few doors down stood the tailors shop to which shakespeare had been going the man working inside peered at him through spectacles that magnified his redtracked eyes good morrow to you master will he said by god i am glad to see you in health and i you master jenkins shakespeare replied your good wife is well i hope and your son very well the both of them the tailor said i thank you for asking peter would be here to greet you as well but he is taking to the head of the fishmongers a cloak i but now finished to their hall in thames street in bridge ward may the fishmongers chief have joy in it shakespeare said and have you also finished the kingly robe you promised for the players behind those thick lenses jenkins eyes grew bigger and wider yet was that to be done today shakespeare clapped a hand to his forehead almost knocking off his hat as he grabbed for it he said sblood master jenkins how many times did i tell you it was wanted on all saints day and is that not today it is it is and i can only cry your pardon jenkins said mournfully that doth me no good nor my fellow players shakespeare said shall burbage swagger forth in his shirt tomorrow hell kill me when he hears this and i you afterwards he shook his head at thatfury outrunning sense to the tailor fury counted for more its near done he said if youll but bide i can finish it within an hour or may my head answer for it he made a placating gesture and even more to the point shoved aside the doublet on which hed been sewing an hour shakespeare sighed heavily while jenkins gave an eager nod drumming his fingers on his arm shakespeare nodded too let it be as you say then were it not that the royal robe in our tiring room looks more like a vagabonds rags and tatters id show you less patience truly master will you are a great gentleman jenkins quavered as he took the robe of scarlet velvet from under the counter i trust youll note this unseemly delay in your price shakespeare said by the tailors expression he found that not in the least gentlemanly while shakespeare kept on drumming his fingers jenkins sewed in the last gaudy bits of golden thread and hemmed the robe you could wear it in the street master will and have the commonality bow and scrape before you as if in sooth you were a great lord he said chuckling i could wear it in the street and be seized and flung in the counter for dressing above my station shakespeare retorted tis a thing forbidden actors save when on the stage jenkins only chuckled again he knew that perfectly well he was finished almost as soon as hed promised and held up the robe to shakespeare as if he were the tireman about to dress him in it you did but jest as to the scot i am sure he said steeth master jenkins i did not is mine own time a worthless thing that i should spend it freely for the sake of your broken promise broken it was not for i promised the robe today and here it is and had i come at eventide and not of the morning you had been forsworn then you may have mended your promise but that means not it was unbroken they argued a while longer more or less goodnaturedly at last the tailor took five shillings off the price hed set before more than you deserve but for the sake of your future custom i shall dot he told shakespeare which still leaves you owing fourteen pounds five shillings sixpence the stuffs you use are dear indeed shakespeare grumbled as he gave jenkins the money some of the silver and copper coins he set on the counter bore the images of isabella and albert othersthe older more worn onesthat of the deposed elizabeth who still languished in the tower of london only a furlong or so from where shakespeare stood he looked outside it was still drizzling can you give me somewhat wherewith to cover this robe master jenkins i am not fain to have the weeping heavens smirch it i believe i may let me see jenkins rummaged under the counter and came up with a piece of coarse canvas that had seen better days here will this serve at shakespeares brusque nod the tailor wrapped the cloth around the robe and tied it with some twine he bobbed his head to shakespeare as he passed him the bundle here you are master will and i am sorry for the inconvenience i put you to shakespeare sighed no help for it now i needs must horns blared and drums thudded out in the street he jumped whats that did you not recall the tailors face twisted by decree of the spaniards tis the day of the great auto de fe oh a pox you are right and it had gone out of my head altogether shakespeare looked out into the street as horn calls and drums came again in response to that music people swarmed from all directions to gape at the spectacle a lucky man who can forget the inquisitors jenkins said a month gone by as is their custom they came down tower street making proclamation that this ceremony would be held he might have been about to offer some comment on the auto de fe but he didnt shakespeare couldnt blame him for watching his tongue in london these days a word that reached the wrong ears could mean disaster for a man he felt disaster of a different smaller sort brushing against him in this swarm of mankind i shall be an age making my way back to my lodgings why not go with the parade to tower hill and see whats to be seen jenkins said after all when in rome and we are all romans now ist not so he chuckled once more so did shakespeare sourly how could it be otherwise he returned in elizabeths day catholic recusants had had to pay a fine for refusing to attend protestant services now with their catholic majesties ruling england with the inquisition and the jesuits zealously bringing the country back under the dominion of the pope not going to mass could and often did mean worse than fines like most people shakespeare conformed as hed conformed under elizabeth some folk went to church simply because it was the safe thing to do some after nine years and more of catholic rule because theyd come to believe but almost everyone did go why not what jenkins repeated think what you will of the dons and the monks but they do make a brave show mayhap youll spy some bit of business you can filch for one of your dramas shakespeare had thought nothing could make him want to watch an auto de fe now he discovered he was wrong he nodded to the tailor i thank you master jenkins i had not thought of that perhaps i shall he tucked the robe under his arm settled his hat more firmly on his head and went out into tower street spanish soldiersand some blondbearded englishmen loyal to isabella and albertin helmets and corselets held pikes horizontally in front of their bodies to keep back the crowd and let the procession move toward tower hill they looked as if they would use those spears and the swords hanging from their belts at the slightest excuse perhaps because of that no one gave them any such excuse two or three rows of people stood in front of shakespeare but he had no trouble seeing over any of them save one woman whose steeplecrowned hat came up to the level of his eyes he looked east toward the church of st margaret in pattens lane from which the procession was coming at its head strode the trumpeters and drummers who blasted out another fanfare even as he turned to look at them more grimfaced soldiers marched at their heels again spaniards and englishmen mixed some bore pikes others carried arquebuses or longer heavier muskets tiny wisps of smoke rose from the lengths of slow match the men with firearms bore to discharge their pieces the drizzle had almost stopped while shakespeare waited for the tailor to finish the robe in wetter weather the matchlocks would have been useless as anything but clubs as they marched they talked with one another in an argot that had grown up since the armadas men came ashore with spanish lisps and trills mingling with the slow sonorities of english behind the soldiers tramped a hundred woodmongers in the gaudy livery of their company one of those robes would do as well to play the king in as that which i have here shakespeare thought but the woodmongers whose goods would feed the fires that burned heretics today seemed to be playing soldiers themselves like the armored men ahead of them they too marched with arquebuses and pikes from a secondstory window across the street from shakespeare a woman shouted shame on you jack scrope one of the woodmongers carrying a pike whipped his head around to see who had cried out but no faces showed at that window a dull flush stained the fellows cheeks as he strode on next came a party of blackrobed dominican friarsmostly spaniards by their looksbefore whom a white cross was carried they chanted psalms in latin as they paraded up tower street after them marched charles neville the earl of westmorland the protector of the english inquisition the northerners face was hard and closed and proud he had risen against elizabeth a generation before spent years in exile in the netherlands and surely relished every chance he got for revenge against the protestants the old man carried the standard of the inquisition and held it high for a moment shakespeares gaze swung to the left to the gray bulk of the tower though the church of allhallows barking hid part of the fortress from view he wondered if from one of those towers elizabeth were watching the auto de fe what would the imprisoned queen be thinking if she were did she thank king philip for sparing her life after the duke of parmas professional soldiers swept aside her english levies though she herself slew a queen i shall not stoop to do likewise philip had said was that generosity or did elizabeth with all shed labored so long to build torn to pieces around her reckon her confinement more like hell on earth i would make a splendid tragedy shakespeare thought were setting so little as a single line oft to paper not worth my lifeand a hard cruel death id have too written or not though those scenes began to shape themselves in his mind he shook his head like a flybedeviled horse trying to clear it more than a little to his relief a murmur in the crowd brought his attention back to the parade behind the protector of the inquisition stalked robert parsons the archbishop of canterbury his cold thin features made nevilles look genial hed spent a generation in exile struggling from afar against english protestantism after the prelate marched another company of guardsmen these were wild irishmen brought over to help the spaniards hold england down most spoke only irish the few who used some english had brogues so thick it was hard to tell from the other tongue the crowd stirred and buzzed a couple of men pointed a woman exclaimed after the sallet comes the main course shakespeare thought a couple of dozen men exhibited lifesized pasteboard images of those convicted by the inquisition who had either died in gaol or had escaped its clutches and were being outlawed more servitors carried trunks that bore the bones of the former the sides and tops of the trunks were painted with hellfires flames then came the prisoners themselves first was a group of about a dozen men and women with conical pasteboard caps fully a yard high on their heads most of the caps had heretic written on them in large letters in english and latin one said alchemist another sodomite in the first years after the triumph of the duke of parmas men shakespeare remembered the words had been written in spanish as well these days though the english inquisition operated on its own with little help from its former teachers each of the condemned had a rope around his neck and carried a torch in his right hand more prisoners also carrying torches followed the first lot they wore sanbenitoscoarse yellow penitential tunics without sleeveswith the cross of st andrew painted on the back in red some of them after their condemnation at the ceremony would return to imprisonment others would be released but sentenced to wear the sanbenito forever as a mark of their crimes more ignoble and more humiliating than death itself a fat man near shakespeare said two familiars of the inquisition accompanied each of them and after them tramped the dozen or so who had been condemned to the flames they wore not only sanbenitos but also pasteboard caps all of which were painted with flames and devils along with the familiars of the inquisition four or five monks accompanied them to prepare their souls for death one prisoner a big burly man shook off all attempts at consolation i go gladly to my death he declared knowing i shall soon see god face to face and rejoice in his glory for ever and ever you are wrong philip stubbes a monk said urgently if you confess your sins you may yet win free of hell to purgatory purgatorys a dream a lie one of the myriad lies the pope farts forth from his mouth the puritan said the monk crossed himself you will also win an easier death for yourself for the executioner will throttle you ere the flames bite stubbes shook his head elizabeth cut off my brothers hand for speaking the truth torment me as you will as the romans tormented the martyrs of old the flames will have me for but a little while but you and all your villainous kind for an eternity another man a redbearded fellow with a clever frightened face and cropped ears spoke urgently to a somber monk ill say anything you want ill do anything you want only spare me from the fire a vagrant drop of rain landed on the monks tonsured pate he wiped it away with his hand before answering kelley your confessions your renunciations are worthless as you have proved time and again you will return to your alchemy as a dog returneth to its vomit did not the heretic queens men petition you for gold wherewith to oppose the cleansing armada i gave them none kelley said quickly and did you not die for this the monk went on inexorable as an avalanche you surely would for coining counterfeit money in base metal i did no such thing kelley insisted each lie you tell but makes the flames of hell hotter compose your spirit now and pray for mercy from a just god whose judgments are true and righteous altogether and then to shakespeares horror kelleys eyesgreen as a cats and showing white all around the irisfound his in the crowd and locked on them will will for the love of god will tell em im true and trusty shakespeare wondered if he turned white or red he felt dipped in ice and dire both together hed met edward kelley perhaps half a dozen times over as many years enough to know hed lost his ears for making and passing false coins the alchemist moved in some of the same circles as christopher marlowe and some of marlowes circles were also shakespeareswheels within wheels as in the epicycles of master ptolemy but for kelley to point him out to the inquisition before he could speak either to curse kelleywhich was what he wanted to door to praise him the monk said where your own words will not save you why think you any other mans might go on wretch and die as well as you may but he looked in the same direction the alchemist had and his eyes too met shakespeares he nodded thoughtfully to himself he knows my face shakespeare thought with something not far from despair other people saw as much too and moved away from him so that he stood on a little island of open space in the ocean of the crowd hed come down with a disease as deadly as smallpox or the black plague suspicion devils roast you black kelley and use your guts for garters on went the procession other voices drowned out edward kelleys whining claims of innocence behind the condemned prisoners rode the grand inquisitor somber in a purple habit and several members of the house of commons their faces smug and fat and selfsatisfied another company of soldiersspaniards and englishmen mixed againand the parade was done as it went past the pikemen whod been holding back the crowd shouldered their weapons some folk went on about their business more streamed after the procession to tower hill to watch the burnings that would follow shakespeare stepped out into the muddy street along with the rest of the somber spectacle he wanted to see edward kelley die say what you will about the spaniards but theyve brought us a fine show said a man at his elbow the fellows friend nodded better than a bearbaiting or a cockfight and i never thought id say that of any sport tower hill north and west of the tower itself had been an execution ground since the days of edward iv more than a hundred years before things were more elaborate now than they had been stakes with oilsoaked wood piled high around them waited for the condemned prisoners iron cages waited for them too in which they would listen to the charges that had brought them here more iron cages small ones awaited the pasteboard effigies of the folk who had died in gaol or escaped the inquisitions clutches at a safe distance from the stakes stood a wooden grandstand queen isabella and king albert sat on upholstered thrones surrounded by grandees both english and spanish on benches the archbishop of canterbury the grand inquisitor and the other dignitaries from the procession joined them the first group of soldiers fanned out to protect the grandstand along with the men already there the rest kept back the crowd after philip stubbes was locked in his cage he began singing hymns and shouting vanity and lies beware of popish vanity and lies a monk spoke to him he defiantly shook his head and kept on shouting the monk unlocked the cage he and several of his fellows went in they bound stubbes hands and gagged him to keep him from disrupting the last part of the ceremony that worked less well than they must have hoped when the charge of heresy was read out against him he made a leg like a courtier as if it were praise more than a few people in the crowd laughed and clapped their hands shakespeare didnt no way to know whose eyes may be upon me and all the more so after that kelleydamnation take him called out my name he nervously fingered his little chin beard a hard business living in a kingdom where the rulers sit uneasy on the throne and their minions course after foes as hounds course after stags he plucked out a hair the small brief pain turned his thoughts to a new channelin a play could i place a man of stubbes courage he wondered or would the groundlings find him impossible to credit one by one the captives sentenced to more imprisonment or to wear the sanbenito were led away only those who would die remained they were led out of their cages and chained to the stakes as monks made the sign of the cross executioners strangled a couple of them men who had repented of their errors whether sincerely or to gain an easier death edward kelley cried me me in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti me but his latin his learning did him no good at all the inquisitors looked toward the queen isabella was in her early thirties a couple of years younger than shakespeare and swarthy even for a spaniardto english eyes she seemed not far from a moor the enormous snowywhite ruff she wore only accented her dark skin swarthy or not though she was the queen albert held the throne through his marriage to her she raised her hand then let it fall and as it fell the executioners hurled torches into the waiting fagots they caught at once the roar of the flames almost drowned out the screams from the burning men the roar of the crowd came closer still that baying had a heavy almost lustful undertone to it watching others die while one still lived better him than me shakespeare thought as fire swallowed edward kelley the mixture of shame and relief churning inside him made him want to spew oh dear god better him than me he turned away from the stakes from the reek of charred flesh and hurried back into the city lope felix de vega carpio had been in london for more than nine years and in all that time he didnt think hed been warm outdoors even once the english boasted of their springtime it came two months later here than in madrid where it would have been reckoned a mild winter as for summer he rolled his eyes as best he could tell there was no such thing as an english summer still and all there were compensations he snuggled down deeper under the featherfilled comforter and kissed the woman he kept company there ah maude he said i understand why you english women are so fair he had a gift for language and languages his english though accented was fluent whats that love maude fuller asked lazy and sleepy after love she was in her middle twenties around ten years younger than he and not merely a blondeblondes were known in spainbut with hair the color of fire and a skin paler than milk even her nipples held barely a tinge of color idly lope teased one between his thumb and forefinger i know why thou art so fair he repeated how couldst thou be otherwise when the sun never touches thee he let his hand stray lower sliding along the smooth soft skin of her belly toward the joining of her legs the hair there was as astonishingly red as that on her head just thinking about it inflamed him since the weather here will never warm me as well the women do he thought of course the women back in spain had warmed him too had he sailed off to america instead of joining the armada and coming to england aboard the san juan no doubt he would have become enamored of one or two or six of the copperskinned blackhaired indian women there loving women was in his blood what again my sweet maude said around a yawn but his caresses heated her better than the embers in the hearth could before long they began once more he wondered if he would manage the second round so soon after the first and knew no little pride when he did ten years ago id have taken it for granted he thought as his thudding heart slowed ten years from now he shook his head he didnt care to think about that god and the virgin but time is cruel to hold such thoughts at bay he kissed the englishwoman again ah queridabeloved seest thou what thou dost to me he said but lots of women did that to him he had two other mistresses in london though maude a recent conquest knew about neither of them and she had secrets from him as he discovered the worst way possible downstairs a door opened then slammed shut oh dear god she exclaimed sitting bolt upright my husband thine husband despite his horror de vega had the sense to keep his voice to a whisper lying minx thou saidst thou wert a widow well i would be if he were dead she answered her tone absurdly reasonable in a play a line like that would have got a laugh lope de vega mentally filed it away hed tried his hand at a few comedies to entertain his fellows on occupation duty in london and he went to the english theatres whenever he found the chance but what was funny in a play could prove fatal in real life he sprang from the bed and threw on his clothes by the dim light those embers gave drawers upperstocks netherstocks shirt doublet with slops he didnt bother fastening itthat could wait hat cloak boots too cursed many clothes when he was in a hurry footsteps on the stairs heavy footstepsthese beefeating englishmen were ridiculously large men a quick kiss for maude not that she deserved it not when shed tried to get him killed lope threw open the shutters cold damp air streamed into the bedchamber adios he whispered hasta la vista he scrambled out the window hung by his hands from the sill for a moment and then let go and dropped to the street below he landed lightly and didnt get hurt but his left foot came down with a splash in a puddle of something that stank to high heaven a rough male voice floated out the window hed just vacated what the devil was that and why are these shutters open maude art mad thoult catch thy death much as lope would have liked to he didnt stay to listen to maudes excuses he didnt fear fighting her husband but an adulterer had no honor win or lose instead of using the rapier at his hip he hurried round a corner behind him the englishman said whats that again and then swounds woman play you the strumpet with me oh no ned maudes voice dripped honey oh yes ned de vega thought he didnt hear whatever else she said but he would have bet she talked her way out of it by all the signs she had practice whatever lope had landed in it still clung to his boot he wrinkled his nose had the englishwomans husband chosen to come after him the man could have tracked him by scent as if he were a polecat when he stepped on a stone in the roadway he scraped his heel and sole against it that helped a little but only a little he looked around hed gone only a couple of blocks from maudes house but in the fog and the darkness hed got turned around how am i supposed to find my way back to the london barracks let alone to westminster when i dont think i could find my way back to the bedroom i just left madrid boasted far more torches of nights lope shrugged and laughed softly he had a long bony face that seemed illsuited to humor but his sparkling eyes gave those bones the lie one way or another i expect ill manage to make sure he did manage he drew his rapier london had a curfew and he was out well after it that wouldnt matter if he came across a squad of spanish soldiers patrolling the streets the only englishmen likely to be out and about though were curbers and flicks and nips and high lawyers thieves and robbers who might have a professional interest as it were in making his acquaintance if they also made the acquaintance of his blade they wouldnt bother him down an alley a dog growled and then started to bark the rapier would also keep him safe against animals that went on four legs but a chain clanked and the dog yelped in frustration lope nodded to himself he wouldnt have to worry about that anyhow he picked his way westward or hoped he did if he was going in the right direction he was heading toward the barracks which lay not far from st swithins church who st swithin was he had no idea he wondered if rome did he heard footsteps from a side street his right hand tightened on the leatherwrapped hilt of the rapier whoever was going along that street must have heard him too for those other footsteps stopped lope paused listened muttered the devil take him whoever he is and went on after a few strides he paused to listen again a womans sigh of relief came to his ear he smiled tempted to go back and see who she was and of what quality after a moment he shook his head another time he thought a few blocks farther westhe thought it was west anyhowhe heard noise he couldnt ignore half a dozen men maybe more came toward him without bothering in the least about stealth he shrank back into a doorway maybe that was a patrol on the other hand maybe the men were english bandits numerous and bold enough to take on a patrol if they ran into one they turned a corner the fog couldnt hide their torches though it tried lope tensed as those pale beams cast a shadow across his boot then he recognized the sweet lisping sounds of castilian gracias a dios he exclaimed and stepped out into the roadway the soldiers had had no notion he was there they jerked in surprise and alarm one of them swung an arquebus his way another pointed a pistol at him who are you and what are you doing out after curfew their leader growled advance and be recognizedslowly if you know whats good for you before advancing before becoming plainly visible de vega slid the rapier back into its sheath he didnt want anyone to start shooting or do anything else he might regret out of surprise or fear when he drew near he bowed low as if the sergeant leading the patrol were a duke rather thanprobablya pigkeepers son good evening he said i have the honor to be senior lieutenant lope de vega carpio christ on his cross one of the troopers muttered another stinking officer who thinks the rules dont matter for him lope pretended not to hear that he couldnt ignore the reproach in the sergeants voice sir we might have taken you for an englishman and blown your head off im very glad you didnt lope de vega replied yes sir the sergeant said you still havent said sir what youre doing out so long after curfew we have the authority to arrest officers sir he might have had it but he didnt sound delighted at the prospect of using it an officer with connections and a bad temper could make him sorry hed been born no matter how right he was lope didnt have such connections but how could the sergeant know that what was i doing out so late he echoed well she had red hair and blue eyes and his hands described what else maude had he went on while i was with her i didnt care what time it was you should have spent the night sir the sergeant said i would have liked that she would have liked that too her husband alas no lope shook his head her husband eh the sergeants laugh showed a missing tooth a couple of his men let out loud bawdy guffaws an englishman he asked and answered his own question yes of course a heretic dog of an englishman well good for you by god and so she was de vega said which got him another laugh or two with the easy charm that made women open their heartsand their legsto him he went on and now my friends if you would be so kind as to point me back to the barracks i would count myself forever in your debt certainly sir the sergeant gestured with his torch that way not too far that way lope said in surprise i thought that way led south down toward the thames the soldiers shook their heads as one man hed seen it done worse on stage he gave them a melodramatic sigh plainly i am mistaken im glad i ran into you men then i got lost in this fog the devil take english weather the sergeant said and his men nodded with as much unity as theyd shown before yes the devil take the cold and the rain and the fogand hes welcome to the englishmen while hes at it theyre all heretics at heart no matter how many of them we burn the rest of the patrol nodded yet again amen de vega said well now that i know where im going ill be off i thank you for your help he bowed once more returning the bow the sergeant said sir im afraid youll only get lost again and the streets arent safe for a lone gentleman i wouldnt want anything to happen to you if anything does happen to you ill get blamed for itlope knew how to translate what he said into what he meant the underofficer turned to his men rodrigo fernan take the lieutenant back to the barracks yes sergeant the troopers chorused one of them made a splendid flourish with his torch you come along with us sir well get you where youre going thats right the other agreed we know this miserable fleabitten town wed betterweve tramped all through it night and day i throw myself on your mercy then lope said they wouldnt be sorry to take him back not when it got them out of the rest of the patrol he didnt know how long that was hed lost track of time they proved as good as their word too guiding him back to the big wooden building by the london stone some englishmen swore the great stone with its iron bars was magical some spaniards believed them lope de vega didnt care one way or the other he was just glad to see it looming out of the mist a sentry called out a challenge the soldiers answered it what are you bastards doing back here the sentry demanded you only went out an hour ago weve got a lost gentleman a lieutenant with us the trooper named fernan replied sergeant diaz sent us back with himcouldnt very well leave him running around loose for some english cabran to knock him over the head i may be a lieutenant but i am not a child lope said as he advanced fernan and rodrigo and the sentry all found that very funny what sort of lieutenants have they dealt with he wondered or am i better off not knowing the sentry did salute him in proper fashion and let him go in a sergeant inside should have taken his name but the fellow was dozing in front of a charcoal brazier lope slipped past him and into his room where he pulled off his hat and boots and sword belt and went to bed diego his servant already lay there snoring diego from everything lope had seen would sleep through the last judgment i might as well have no servant at all de vega thought drifting toward sleep but a gentleman without a servant would be unimaginable was the word that should have formed in his mind what did occur to him was better off he yawned stretched and stopped worrying about it when he woke it was still dark outside he felt rested enough though in fall and winter english nights stretched ungodly long and the hours of july sunshine never seemed enough to make up for them diego didnt seemed to have moved his snores certainly hadnt changed rhythm if he ever felt rested enough hed given no sign of it leaving him in his dormouselike hibernation lope put on what hed taken off the night before adjusting the bright pheasant plume in his braidedleather hatband to the proper jaunty angle he resisted the temptation to slam the door as he went out to get breakfast my virtue surely piles up in heaven he thought he joined a line of soldiers who yawned and knuckled their red eyes breakfast was wine and a cruet of olive oilboth imported from spain as neither the grape nor the olive flourished in this northern climeand half a loaf of brown bread the bread was local and at least as good as he would have had back in madrid he was just finishing when his superiors servant came up to him captain guzmans enrique was the opposite of his own diego in every way tall thin smarter than a servant had any business being and alarmingly diligent good day lieutenant enrique said my principal requests the honor of your company at your earliest convenience gulping down the last of the wine lope got to his feet i am at his excellencys service of course no matter how flowery a servant made an order an order it remained no matter how much lope hurried enrique got to guzmans office ahead of him heres de vega he told guzman in dismissive tones as a captains man he naturally looked down his nose at a creature so lowly as a lieutenant even a senior lieutenant buenos dias your excellency lope said as he walked in he swept off his hat and bowed good day captain baltasar guzman replied nodding without rising from his seat he was a dapper little man whose mustaches and chin beard remained wispy with youth though lopes superior he was a good fifteen years younger he had some sort of connection with the great noble house of guzmanthe house of among others the duke of medina sidonia commander of the armadawhich explained his rank he wasnt a bad officer though in spite of that enrique wouldnt let him be a bad officer lope thought and how may i serve you today your excellency he asked captain guzman wagged a forefinger at him i hear you were out late last night she was very pretty de vega replied with dignity very friendly too no doubt guzman said dryly our job though is to hunt down the english who are not friendly to king philip god bless him not to seek out those who are i wasnt on duty then lope tried to change the subject is there any new word on his majestys health hes dying baltasar guzman said and crossed himself the gout the sores last i heard those are getting worse he may go before the lord tomorrow he may last a year he may even last two but dying he is lope crossed himself too surely his son will prove as illustrious as he has himself surely guzman said and would not meet his eyes philip ii was no great captain no warrior whom men would follow into battle with a song on their lips and in their hearts but such captains did his bidding in his more than forty years of gray competent rule he had beaten back the turks in the mediterranean and brought england and holland out of heresy and back into the embrace of the catholic church more flamboyant men had accomplished far less his son the prince who would be philip iii also was not flamboyant but from everything lope de vega had heardfrom everything everyone had heardhe was not particularly competent either lope said god will protect us as he has till now guzman crossed himself again may it be so now he did look de vega full in the face and of course our duty is to help god as best we can what are your plans for today lieutenant leaving englishwomen out of the bargain i mean there is to be a play this afternoon at the theatre lope replied i shall go there and stand among the groundlings listen to them see the play and chat with the actors afterwards if i have the chance a duty you hate im sure captain guzman said i do wonder whether your attendance is for the benefit of queen isabella and king albert god bless them for the benefit of king philip god bless him and keep him or for the benefit of one lope falix de vega carpio and may god bless me as well de vega said guzmans nod looked grudging but it was a nod lope went on when i stand among the ordinary english i hear their grumbles and when i mingle with the actors i may hear more some of them are more than actors some of them have connections with the english nobles who are their patrons some of them now and again do their patrons bidding someof them indeed have connections with their patrons guzman gave the word an obscene twist but then he sighed still i cant say youre wrong some of them are spies and so and so lieutenant i know you are mixing pleasure with your business but i cannot tell you not to do it i want a full report in writing when you get back just as you say your excellency so shall it be lope promised doing his best to hide his relief he turned to leave baltasar guzman let him take one step toward the door then raised a finger and stopped him in his tracks ohone other thing de vega your excellency i want a report that deals with matters political literary criticism has its place i do not argue with that its place however is not here understand me yes your excellency youre a philistine your excellency its gods own miracle you can read and write at all your excellency but guzman was the man with the rank guzman was the man with the family guzman was also the man with the literate intelligent curious servant as de vega left the office enrique said sir your english is much better than mine i would be glad to hear what these playwrights are doing to compare them to our own keeping enrique sweet might help keep captain guzman sweet and lope was passionate about the theatre he wished his useless diego were passionate about anything but slumber of course enrique when i get back the theatre stood in shoreditch beyond the walls of london and in fact beyond the jurisdiction of the city before the catholic restoration the grim protestants who called themselves puritans had kept theatres out of london proper many of the same men still governed the capital of england they had made a peace of sorts with the church but not with gaiety there still were no theatres within the bounds of the city lopes cloak and hat shielded him from the endless autumn drizzle as he made his way out through bishopsgate and up shoreditch high street leaving the wall behind didnt mean leaving behind what still seemed like a city even if it was no longer exactly london stinking tenements lined narrow streets and leaned toward one another above them here a man might be murdered without even the excuse of sleeping with another mans wife lope kept a hand on the hilt of his rapier and strode on with a determination that warned all and sundry he would be hard to bring down instead of troubling him people scrambled out of his way better to be bold he thought stews flourished beyond the reach of the london city government too a skinny dirty barebreasted woman leaned out a window and called to de vega how about it handsome what went through his mind was god grant i never grow so desperate he swept off his hat bowed and kept walking cheap bugger she shouted after him marican did she know him for a spaniard or was that just another insult one new here since the coming of the armada he never found out buildings ended fields orchards and garden plots began plenty of people were making their way toward the theatre lope tremendously admired it and the other theatres on the outskirts of london no such places in which to put on plays existed in spain there actors performed in a square in front of a tavern with the audience looking down from the buildings on the other three sides of that square real playhouses did the englishmen know how lucky they were he doubted it from all hed seen they seldom did though brightened with paint the theatres timbers were themselves old and faded the threestory polygonal building had been standing for more than twenty years gay banners on the roof helped draw a crowd so did a big colorful signboard above the entrance advertising the days show if you like it a new comedy by william shakespeare dissolutelooking men were making pennies for drink by goingstaggeringthrough the streets bawling out the name of the play lope paid his penny at the door groundling called the man who took the coin another man directed de vega to the standing room around the brightly painted stage where he jostled his way forward had he paid tuppence or threepence he could have had a seat in one of the galleries looking down on the action here among the poorer folk though he would likely find more of interest hawkers fought through the press selling sausages and pasties and cider and beer lope bought a sausage and a cup of cider he stood there chewing and sipping guarding his place with his elbows as he listened to the men and women around him nasty way to die burning a whitebearded fellow remarked you ever see anybody braver nor parsons stubbes the other day a woman said couldnt be nobody braver gods bound to love a man like thatonly stands to reason i expect hes up in heaven right now how about them what burned him another man asked oh i dont know anything about that the woman answered quickly shed already said too much and realized it but she wouldnt say any more nine years of the inquisition had taught these talkative people something at least of holding their tongues and before that theyd had a generation of stern heresy under elizabeth and before that catholicism under mary and philip and before that more heresy under henry viii theyd swung back and forth so many times it was a marvel they hadnt looked toward the turks and had a go at being mahometans for a while then such thoughts left him for two actors appeared on stage and the play began lope had to give all his attention to it his english was good but not so good that he could follow the language when quickly spoken without listening hard and shakespeare as was his habit had cooked up a more complicated plot than any spanish playwright would have thought of using squabbling noble brothers the younger having usurped the elders place as duke the quarreling sons of a knight loyal to the exiled rightful duke and the daughters of the rightful duke and his brother those daughters rosalind and celia almost took lope out of the play for a moment as was the english practice they were played by beardless boys with unbroken voices women didnt act on stage here as theyd begun to do in spain one of the boys playing the daughters was noticeably better at giving the impression of femininity than the other had the company had real actresses to work with the problem wouldnt have arisen but shakespeare as de vega had seen him do in other plays used english conventions to advantage rosalind disguised herself as a boy to escape the court of her wicked uncle a boy playing a girl playing a boy and then a minor character playing a feminine role fell for him a boy playing a girl in love with a boy playing a girl playing a boy lope couldnt help howling laughter he was tempted to count on his fingers to keep track of who was who or of who was supposed to be who spanish plays ran to three acts shakespeare following english custom had five actsabout two hoursin which to wrap up all the loose ends hed introduced and all the hares hed started he did it too getting the daughters of the two noblemen married to the sons of the knight and having the usurping duke retire to a monastery so his older brother could reclaim the throne how would the englishman have managed that if his kingdom were still protestant lope wondered as the boy playing rosalind the better actor delivered an epilogue asking the audience for applause that struck lope as almost as unnatural as not employing actresses hed used the last couple of lines in his plays to say farewell but he never would have written in a whole speech but it didnt bother the people around him they clapped their hands and stamped their feet and shouted till his ears rang the actors came out to take their bows richard burbage whod played the usurping duke made a leg in a robe king philip wouldnt have been ashamed to wear his crown was surely polished brass not gold but it gleamed brightly shakespeare whod played his older brother also had on a royal robe but one that was much less splendid as befit his forest exile a nice touch lope thought when shakespeare doffed his brass crown his own crown gleamed brightly too lope who had all his hair noted that with smug amusement one further advantage of a stagefrom the companys point of viewwas that they could sell a few seats right up on the edge of it and charge more for those than for any others in the house the men and women who rose from those seats to applaud showed more velvet and lace and threadwork of gold and silver than all the groundlings put together pearls and precious stones glittered in the womens hair gold gleamed on the mens belts and on their scabbards and on the hilts of their rapiers despite those visible signs of wealth and power the groundlings behind the rich folk werent shy about making their views known sit you down they shouted and we came to see the players not your arses and god sees through you but we cant one of the grandees half turned and set a beringed hand on the fancy hilt of his sword a flying chunk of sausage smirched his orange doublet with grease safe in the anonymity of the crowd another groundling threw something else which flew past the nobleman and bounced halfway across the stage the poor folk in their frowzy wool raised a cheer just as a spanish noble would have done the englishman purpled with fury but the woman beside him whose neckline was even more striking than her pile of blond curls set a hand on his sleeve and said something in a low voice his reply was anything but low and thoroughly sulfurous she spoke again as if to say what can you do you cant kill them all grudgingly he turned away from the groundlings though his back still radiated fury they jeered louder than ever after the last bow the players went back into the tiring room behind the stage to change into their everyday clothes once more most of the crowd filed out through the narrow doorways by which theyd entered friends and sweethearts of the company pressed forward to join the actors backstage so did the stagestruck wouldbe actors wouldbe writers wouldbe friends and sweethearts the tiremans assistantsa couple of big burly men who kept cudgels close bystood in front of the doors leading to the tiring room lope de vega though had no trouble he went backstage after every performance he attended god give you good day master lope one of the assistants said doffing his cap and standing aside to let the spaniard pass and to you also edward de vega replied what thought you of the show today we had us a good house edward saidthe first worry of any man in an acting company then he blinked oh dyou mean the play indeed yes the play lope said so much going on there almost all at once master will dont write em simple the tiremans assistant agreed but he hath the knack of helping folk recall whos who and meseems the crowd followed tolerably well nodding de vega passed by edward glowered at the englishman behind him and who are you friend chaos reigned in the tiring room some of the players were still in costume some had already returned to the drabber wear normal to men and boys of their class and some between the one stage and the other wore very little they took near nudity in stride as spanish actors would have done the room was close with the reek of sweat and perfume and torch smoke lope moved through as best he could shaking hands bowing when he had the space and congratulating the players someonehe didnt see whohanded him a leather drinking jack sipping he found it full of sweet strong spanish wine the english were even fonder of it than his own folk perhaps because they had to import it and couldnt take it for granted he bumped into a womansomeones wife he couldnt remember whose so sorry my lady he said with your permission he bowed over her hand and kissed it she smiled back in a manner that might have been encouraging watch out for master lope roundfaced will kemp said behind him lope the loup lope the lobo the company clown howled wolfishly raucous laughter rose lope joined it the easiest way he knew to deflect suspicion the woman turned to talk to an englishman so there was no suspicion to deflect anyhow aes la vida de vega thought and sighed he congratulated burbage and the boy whod played rosalind i thank you kindly sir the youth replied in his powder and paint he still looked quite feminineeven temptingbut his natural voice though not yet a mans was deeper than the one hed used on stage he wouldnt be able to pretend to womanhood much longer at last de vega made his way to shakespeare the actor and playwright stood off in a corner talking shop with darkly handsome christopher marlowe lope bowed in delight my two favorites of the english stage here together he cried good dayor should i say good even master de vega shakespeare replied have you met master marlowe here to marlowe he added lieutenant de vega writes plays in spanish and more than once hath trodden the boards with lord westmorlands men as extra indeed marlowe murmured his cool dark eyes measured lope how versatile of him he nodded and bowed a pleasure to make your acquaintance sir we have met once or twice sir but how can i be surprised if you recall it not de vega said by the way marlowe eyed him though he wondered if the englishman ever forgot anything enrique captain guzmans servant had that same toocleverbyhalf look and he never did but then lope started talking shop with the english playwrights and forgot everything else for a while he didnt worry about spying he didnt even worry about the pretty women in the room what did any of that matter next to the passion for the word for the play the three men shared a torch guttered out sending shadows swooping through the tiring room filling a quarter of it with darkness and adding the reek of hot fat to the crowded air christopher marlowe clapped a hand to his forehead in one of the melodramatic gestures he used so naturally struth he burst out would the poxy spaniard never leave shakespeare stood several inches taller he set a hand on the other playwrights shoulder however long he lingered hes gone now kit hes harmless or as harmless as a man of his kingdom can be mad for the stage as you heard think you so marlowe said and shakespeare nodded marlowe rolled his eyes and think you babes are hid neath cabbage leaves for their mothers to find the tireman coughed he wanted the room empty so he could lock up the precious costumes and go home only a few people were left now still hashing over what theyd done what they might have done what they would do the next time they put on if you like it even will kemp a law unto himself took the tireman seriously with a mocking bow to those who remained he swept out the door irked shakespeare stayed where he was he snapped i know whence babes comei know better than you by god even in the dim uncertain light left in the tiring room he saw marlowe flush the other poet chased boys as avidly as prickproud lope went after other mens wives all right will marlowe visibly held in his anger youre no blushing maidbe it so stipulated but he loves us not for ourselves alone were we wenches then yes mayhap things being as they are he shook his head what you reckon lope stagestruck an intelligencer shakespeare almost laughed in his face wheres the reason behind that imprimis hes a spaniard secundus hes a man tertius an you suspect a man not hell ever prove the viper who ups and stings you he meant every word shakespeare saw as much he let out a sigh as exasperated as the tiremans cough a pretty world wherein you must live kit there within the fortress of your skull i do live marlowe said and i purpose living some while longer too were i so careless as you i had died ten times over ere now quarrels are easy enough to frame a swaggering bravo imagining an insult in the street peradventure or over the reckoning in a little room youre a better man than i am see to it your goodness harms you not gentlemen please the tireman said something close to despair in his voice shakespeare walked out of the theatre marlowe in his wake autumn twilight came early and was falling fast before long the gray clouds overhead would turn black with the play over the streets around the theatre were almost empty as he started back toward london and his lodgings shakespeare said well the spaniards not about what would you say to me you could not say within the spying rascals hearing you make a mock of it marlowe said one day youll be sorrygod grant it be not soon what would i say ive said already more than i would say then say no more and have done shakespeare lengthened his stride marlowe had to half trot to try to keep up over his shoulder shakespeare added enough real worries in the worldaye enough and to sparewithout the hobgoblins bubbling from the too fertile cauldron of your fears damn you will you listen to me marlowe shouted a limping old woman carrying a pail of water stared at him listen how when you will not speak save only in riddles but shakespeare stopped marlowe took a deep breath slowly deliberately he let it out hear me plain then he said and gave shakespeare a mocking bow i should like you to meet a friend of mine a friend shakespeare said in surprise as far as he knewas far as anyone in london knewchristopher marlowe neither had nor particularly wanted friends he did have a great many acquaintances of one degree of intimacy or another that being defined by how useful they proved to him he was almost as aware of the lack as were other folk he hesitated before nodding and added a man with whom ive been yoked in harness some little while yoked in harness of what sort shakespeare asked side by side vileminded lecher not fore and aft marlowe said tis a matter of business on which hes fain to make your acquaintance his shoulders hunched he glared down at the ground he was furious and not trying hard at all to hide it shakespeare judged he would burst like the hellburner of antwerp if not humored marlowe in a temper was nothing to take lightly so shakespeare said ill meet him and right gladly too whosoever he may be bring him to my ordinary while i dine or sup ant please you ill dot marlowe said though he sounded far from pleased if anything he seemed angrier than ever in gods name what now shakespeare wondered now instead of hastening on toward bishopsgate he stopped in his tracks marlowe was the one who kept striding on before also halting a few paces farther on i have said i will do as you would have me do kit shakespeare said wherefore then wax you wroth with me still i do not marlowe flung the three words at him and started on again what then now shakespeare had to hurry after himeither that or shout after him and make their talk a public matter for any who cared to hear it he asked the only question that occurred to him if not for me is your anger for your afriend it is two more words bitten off short heres a tangled coil shakespeare exclaimed why such fury for him because hes fain to see you in this business marlowe said sullenly by then with the darkness coming on fast with a few drops of drizzle falling cold on his hand shakespeare was beginning to lose his temper too enough of riddles of puzzles of conundrums he said do me the honor do me the courtesy of speaking plain i could speak no plainerbecause hes fain to see you in this business but then unwillingly marlowe made it a great deal plainer because hes fain to see you and not me damn you he hurried off leaning forward as if into a heavy wind oh kit now shakespeare knew exactly where the trouble lay what he did not know was whether he could mend it marlowe had been a success in london before shakespeare rose from performing in plays to trying to write them some of shakespeares early dramas bore marlowes stamp heavily upon them if a man imitate let him imitate the best shakespeare thought marlowe remained popular even now he made a living by his pen as few could but those who had given him first place now rated him second for a proud man as he surely was that had to grate if the business had to do with the theatre if his friend wanted shakespeare and not him no wonder he was scowling wait shakespeare called and loped after him shall i tell this cullion that if he be your friend the business should be yours to his surprise the other playwright shook his head nay he hath reason for what he purposes you were the better choice i would twere otherwise but the world is as it is not as we would have it you intrigue me mightily and perplex me too shakespeare said marlowes laugh held more bile than mirth and i might say the same of you will did you tender me this plum id not offer it back again you may be sure of that shakespeare was in a cutthroat business marlowe owned sharper knives than most unlike some he seldom bothered pretending otherwise after a moments thought shakespeare said god be praised i am not so hungry i needs must take bread from another mans mouth ah dear will an there be a god he might do worse than hear praises from such as you youre a blockhead but an honest blockhead marlowe stood up on tiptoe to kiss him on the cheek ill bring the fellow to your ordinary at eventide tomorrowi know the place you favor till then he hurried toward bishopsgate this time the set of his shoulders said shakespeare would have been unwelcome had he tried to stay up with him with a sigh shakespeare trudged down shoreditch high street after him just when a man looked like understanding marlowe he would do something like that he could not praise without putting a poison sting in amongst the honey but the kiss had been or at least had seemed real hurry up hurry up guards at the gate called get on in the lot of you they were a mixed lot englishmen and rawboned irish mercenaries the irish soldiers looked achingly eager to kill someone anyone rumor said they ate human flesh shakespeare didnt care to find out if rumor were true not meeting their fierce falconlike gazes he scuttled into the city his lodgings were in bishopsgate ward not far from the wall in a house owned by a widow who made her living by letting out most of the space he had his own bed but two others crowded the room where he slept one of the men who shared the chamber a glazier named jack street had a snore that sounded like a lions roar the other a lively little fellow called peter foster called himself a tinker shakespeare suspected he was a sneakthief he didnt foul his own nest though nothing had ever gone missing at the lodging house youre late today master william said jane kendall shakespeares landlady by our lady i hope all went well at the theatre she made the sign of the cross from things shed said over the couple of years hed lived there shed been a catholic even before the armada restored englands allegiance to rome well enough i thank you he replied sometimes when talking amongst ourselves after the play we do lose track of time with so many people living so close together secrets were hard to keep telling a piece of the truth often proved the best way to keep all of it from coming out and the house was full widow kendall persisted near enough shakespeare smiled and made a leg at her as if she were a pretty young noblewoman not a frowzy grayhaired tallowchandlers widow never fear ill have no trouble with the months rent she giggled and simpered like a young girl too but when she said that im glad to hear her voice held nothing but truth a lodger without his rent became in short order a former lodger out on the street still hed pleased her for she went on theres newbrewed ale in the kitchen take a mug if you care to that i will and right gladly shakespeare fitted action to word the widow made good ale hopped beer these days was commoner than the older drink for it soured much more slowly he savored the mug and when his landlady continued to look benign took another nicely warmed he said now im to the ordinary for supper she nodded dont forget the hour and keep scribbling till past curfew she warned i shant i hope i shant shakespeare thought or do i the eatery made a better place to work than the lodging house on nights when ideas seemed to flow straight from his mind onto the page he could and sometimes did lose track of time hed ducked home past patrols more than once from the chest by his bed he took his secondbest spoonpewtera couple of quills a knife to trim them ink and three sheets of paper he sometimes wished he followed a less expensive calling each sheet cost more than a loaf of bread he locked the chest once more then hurried off to the ordinary around the corner he sat down at the table with the biggest fattest candle on it he wanted the best light he could find for writing a serving woman came up to him good even master will whatll you have hello kate whats the threepenny tonight kidney pie and monstrous good she said he nodded she brought it to him with a mug of beer he dug in with the spoon eating quickly when he was through he spread out his papers and got to work loves labours won wasnt going so well as he wished it would he couldnt lose himself in it and had no trouble recalling when curfew neared after he went back to the lodging house he got a candle of his own from his trunkjack street was already snoring in the bed next to hislit it at the hearth and set it on a table then he started writing again and kept at it till he could hold his eyes open no more he had his story from boccaccio but this labor won or lost reminded him of the difference between a story and a finished play the next day he performed again at the theatre he almost forgot he had a supper engagement that evening and had to grab his best spoonsilverand rush from his lodging house to his relief christopher marlowe and his mysterious friend hadnt got there yet shakespeare ordered a mug of beer and waited for them they came in perhaps a quarter of an hour later the other man was no one shakespeare had seen before a skinny little fellow in his forties with dark blond hair going gray and a lighter beard that didnt cover all his pockmarks he wore spectacles but still squinted nearsightedly marlowe introduced him as thomas phelippes shakespeare got up from his stool and bowed your servant sir no yours phelippes had a high thin fussily precise voice they all shared a roast capon and bread and butter phelippes had little small talk he seemed content to listen to shakespeare and marlowes theatre gossip after a while once no one sat close enough to overhear shakespeare spoke directly to him kit says you may have somewhat of business for me of what sort ist why the business of englands salvation of course thomas phelippes told him ii well enrique what does captain guzman want to see me about today lope de vega asked ithink it has something to do with your report on if you like it guzmans servant answered just what though i cannot tell you lo siento mucho he spread his hands in apology adding myself i thought the report very interesting this shakespeare is a remarkable man is he not no lope spoke with a writers precision as a man he is anything but remarkable he drinks beer he makes foolish jokes he looks at pretty girlshe has a wife out in the provinces somewhere and children but i do not think it troubles him much here in london ordinary as i say but put a pen in his hand and all at once it is as though god and half the saints were whispering in his ear as a playwright remarkable is too small a word for him guzmans door was open enrique went in first to let him know de vega had arrived lope waited in the hallway till enrique called his excellency will see you now lieutenant lope strode into his superiors office he and baltasar guzman exchanged bows and pleasantries his report on his latest trip to the theatre lay on his superiors desk he saw that guzman in the style of king philip had written comments in the margins he gave a small silent sigh he enjoyed being edited no more than most writers presently the captain nodded to enrique and said you may go now shut the door on the way out por favor as you say your excellency guzmans servant sounded reproachful which as usual did him no good lope wondered if he would slam the door to show his annoyance but enrique had more subtlety than that he shut it with exaggerated care so it made no noise at all captain guzman noticed that too chuckling he said hes got his nose out of joint again because hes clever he thinks he ought to be important too better a clever servant than a dolt like my diego whod forget his own name if people didnt shout it at him all the time de vega said oh no doubt no doubt but enrique will make too much of himself tapping the report with his forefinger guzman got down to business overall this is a good piece of work lieutenant still i need to remind you again that you visit the theatre as his majestys spy not as his drama critic im very sorry your excellency lope lied guzman laughed again a likely story youre a lucky man to be able to enjoy yourself so much at your work i would enjoy myself even more if the benighted english let women take the stage lope said indeed it frightens me lieutenant to think how much you might enjoy yourself then baltasar guzman tapped the report again his fingernails were elegantly manicured he looked across the desk at de vega i note that you met this marlowe back in the tiring room after the presentation yes your excellency lope nodded he was talking shop with shakespeare a good bit of the time he was telling him how he would have done things differentlyand in his opinion better this is you understand sir something playwrights do no doubt you would know better than i guzman said but christopher marlowe is a dangerous character he knows too many of the wrong people knowing so many rogues makes him likely a rogue himself i am given to understand the inquisition has taken several long hard looks at him they do not investigate a man merely for their amusement while i was there he and shakespeare spoke of nothing but their craft guzman ticked off points on his fingers first lieutenant you do not know this for a fact they could have hidden any number of coded meanings in their talk and you would have been none the wiser second who knows what they said after you left the theatre they do and god does and no one else you do not that he was right made his supercilious manner no less annoying more so if anything lope protested say what you will of marlowe but shakespeare has always stayed with the stage and fought shy of politics but his superior shook his head not necessarily at the recent auto de fe one of the men relaxed to the inquisition for punishmenta notorious sorcerer and counterfeitersaw shakespeare in the crowd and called out for him to testify to his good character this fellow a certain kelley was also an intimate of christopher marlowes so shakespeare is not above suspicion no man is above suspicion he added sounding as certain as if he were reciting the athanasian creed though the news shook lope he did his best not to show it he said a drowning man will clutch at any straw true captain guzman agreed or it may be true but i find it interesting that this kelley should reckon shakespeare a straw worth clutching without giving de vega a chance to answer he rolled up the report wrote something on the outside and tied it with a green ribbon holding it out he said i want you to take this to westminster to an englishman there who has worked closely with us for a long time he already knows of the business with the sorcerer and he is well suited to judge just how important this meeting between shakespeare and marlowe may be very well your excellency lope took the report an englishman you say am i going to have to translate my work here i would want a secretarys help with that i speak english well enough but i cannot say i write it captain guzman shook his head no need for that hes fluent in spanish as i say hes been with us since isabella became queen all right good that makes things simpler this is the fellows name here thats right get a horse from the stables and take it over to him right away vaya con dios the farewell was also a dismissal a wan english sun amazingly low in the southern sky dodged in and out from behind rolling clouds as lope de vega rode through london toward westminster when he went past st pauls cathedral he scratched his head wondering as he always did why the otherwise magnificent edifice should be spoiled by the strange square flattopped steeple not so much as a cross up there he thought and clucked reproachfully at the folly of the english the horse a bay gelding was no more energetic than it had to be it ambled up ludgate hill and out through the wall at ludgate london proper didnt stop at the wall de vega rode west along fleet street past st bridgets st dunstans in the west and the new temple the church of the knights templars before the crusading order was suppressed they all lay in the ward of farringdon without the wall lope couldnt tell exactly where that ward ended and the suburbs of the city began he had thought madrid a grand place and so it was but london dwarfed it he wouldnt have been surprised if the english capital held a quarter of a million people if that didnt make it the biggest city in the world it surely came close westminster which lay at a bend in the thames was a separate though much smaller city in its own right divided into twelve wards the apparatus of government dominated it much more than london proper isabella and albert dwelt in one of the several castles there parliamentlope thought of it as the equivalent of the cortes of castile though it was even fussier about its privileges than the cortes of navarremet there westminster abbey was an ecclesiastical center though the senior archbishop of england for no good reason de vega could see presided at canterbury fifty miles away and the clerks and secretaries and scribes who served the higher functionaries also performed their offices in westminster by the time he finally found the man he was looking for lope felt as if hed navigated the labyrinth of the minotaur hed spent most of an hour and most of his temper making his way through the maze before he knocked on the right door one in the offices of the men who served don diego flores de valdas the commandant of the spanish soldiers stationed in england come in a voice called in english lope de vega did the fellow behind the desk was unprepossessing small thin pale pockmarked bespectacled as de vega walked in he flipped a paper over so the newcomer wouldnt be able to read it lope caught a brief glimpse of pothooks and hieroglyphssome sort of cipher maybe the man made up in brains what he lacked in looks peering down at the report lope said you are thomas phelippes hed never seen the name spelled that way beforebut then the vagaries of english spelling could drive any spaniard mad i am phelippes said in english and then switched to good spanish you have the advantage of me senor would you sooner use your own tongue or mine either will do lope replied speaking english himself after giving his name he went on my superior captain baltasar guzman ordered me to bring you my report on possible suspicious business at the theatre the other day and so i give it you he held it out as if it were a baton phelippes took it i thank you i am acquainted with captain guzman a good man sly as a serpent lope wouldnt have used that as praise but the englishman plainly intended it so he also spoke of the spanish nobleman as an equal or an inferior how important are you lope knew he couldnt ask phelippes went on is there anything he desires me to look for in especial yeshe desires your opinion of the trustiness of the two poets marlowe and shakespeare de vega said i had liefer put my hand in the wolf his jaws than put my trust in christopher marlowe phelippes said at once he companies with all manner of cozeners and knaves and revels in the doing oft i fear me hell come to a bad end and never know why though boys throw stones at frogs in sport the frogs die in earnest lope smiled you are a man of learning i see to bring plutarch forth at need now what of shakespeare feature for feature thomas phelippes face was in no way remarkable somehow though he managed a sneer any aristocrat might have envied shakespeare he knows no more than a puling babe of great affairs and cares no more either all that matters to him is his company of players and the plays he writes for em this was also my thought lope did his best not to show his relief and id not have mentioned his name save only that captain guzman noted a certain edward kelley had called out to him on his way to the inquisitions cleansing fire ah kelley there was rubbish that wanted burning in sooth phelippes said with another fine sneer but he was no intimate of shakespeares that i know for a fact only a wretch seeking succor with none to be had the englishman proved to own a nasty chuckle too i misdoubt he affrighted master will like to stop his heart i should say so de vega wouldnt have wanted an inquisitor noting his connection to a man about to die he inclined his head to phelippes you do set my mind at ease for which i thank you ill take your word back to captain guzman your servant sir phelippes tapped the report with a fingernail much as guzman had done and ill put this in brief for don diego you know the tale im sure the greater the man the less time hath he wherein to read not always lope said there is the king what albert i would not disagree with a new acquaintance senor but no not albert de vega said impatiently philip the king god preserve him he crossed himself so did phelippes the way he did it told lope he hadnt been doing it all his life amen he said but what hear you of his health the last news i had was not good nor mine lope admitted he hath now his threescore and ten he is in gods hands he made the sign of the cross again he always was and so are we all phelippes signed himself again too no more smoothly than he had before lope nodded approval he hadnt thought the englishman so pious im for london then he said i hope to see you again sir and my thanks once more for setting my mind at rest my pleasure sir even before lope was out the door phelippes returned to the ciphered message on which hed been working when rehearsals went well they were a joy shakespeare took more pleasure in few things than in watching what had been only pictures and words in his mind take shape on the stage before his eyes when things went not so well as they did this morning he clapped a hand to his forehead sdeath he shouted mechanical saltbutter rogues boys apes braggarts jacks milksops you are not worth another word else id call you knaves richard burbage looked down his long nose at shakespeare he was the only player in lord westmorlands men tall enough to do it now see here will youve poor cause to blame us when you were the worst of the lot he boomed turning his big sonorous voice on shakespeare alone instead of an audience he was right too as shakespeare knew only too well the poet gave the best defense he could my parts but a small one ha will kemp broke in i never thought to hear a man admit as much devils take you shakespeare scowled at the clown not recalling your own lines you aim to step on mine he gathered himself if we play as we rehearsed theyll pelt us with cabbages and turnips enough to make soup for a year well be better come the afternoon we always are burbage had a wealthy mans confidence the theatre and the ground on which it stood belonged to his family though several years younger than shakespeare he had a prosperous mans double chinpartly concealed by his pointed beardand the beginnings of an imposing belly not always shakespeare said remembering calamities he wished he could forget often enough burbage said placidly theres no better company than ours and all london knows it he eyes deepset under thick eyebrows flashed but you will youre the steadiest trouper we have and you always know your lines he chuckled and so you ought you having writ so many of em but today never have i seen you so unapt as if the very words were strange out on it what hobgoblins prey on your mind shakespeare looked around the theatre along with the company the tireman and his assistants the prompter and the stagehands a couple of dozen friends and wives and lovers milled about where the groundlings would throng in a few hours musicians peered down from their place a story above the tiring room he had to talk to burbage but not before so many people all he could do now was sigh and say when troubles come they come not single spies but in battalions burbage tossed his head like a horse troubled by flies pretty it tells naught of course but pretty nonetheless give over if you please shakespeare said wearily im not bound to unburden myself before any but god and you are not he kemps eyes widened in wellmimed astonishment hes not dont tell him that for i warrant he did not knowt a flush mounted to burbages cheeks and broad high forehead blaspheming toad your servant sir kemp gave him a courtiers bow burbage snorted so did shakespeare the clown would mock anyone and refused to let any insults stick to him shakespeare said shall we try once more the scene that vexed us in especial that in which romeo comes between mercutio and tybalt fighting weve given this tragedy often enough ere now these past several years we should dot better than we showed too many lines from too many plays all spinning round in our heads kemp said tis a wonder we can speak a word some scribbling wretch did not pen for us shakespeare had rarely felt more wretched as mercutio he crossed swords with burbages tybalt the other player had fought against the invading spaniards and actually used a blade shakespeares swordplay belonged only to the stage and burbage fenced now as if out for blood when the time came for him to run mercutio through under romeos arm he almost really did it by god shakespeare said arising after hed crumpled my death scene there came near to being my death scene in sooth burbage grinned a predatory grin nothing less than you deserve for havering at us before satisfies you now this scene it will serve shakespeare said still i have somewhat to say to you on the subject of your swordplay and on other things as well he thought those though would have to wait the other player chose to misunderstand him setting a hand on the hilt of his rapier he said i am at your service if they fought with swords in earnest shakespeare knew he was a dead man what had marlowe said about fanning quarrels surely not burbage shakespeare thought not when weve worked together so long that such a thing could even occur to him was the measure of how many new worries he carried ill be like kit soon seeing danger in every face let it go dick kemp said an you spit him like a chine of beef what are you then why naught but a ghosta pretty ghost ill not deny but nonetheless a ghostleft suddenly dumb for having slain the one who gave you words to speak there are other scribblers burbage rumbled ominously but then he must have decided hed gone too far for he added we being the best of companies do deserve that which we have to wit the best of poets he turned toward shakespeare and clapped his big scarred hands when the afternoon came the play went well thinking about it afterwards shakespeare shook his head the performance had gone well but there was more to it than that a couple of the gentlemen sitting at the side of the stage smoked their pipes so furiously the thick tobacco fumes spoiled the view for the groundlings behind them the rowdies having paid their pennies were convinced they were men as good as any others and pelted the offenders with nuts and pebblesone of them flying high incidentally hitting the boy playing juliet just as he was about to wonder where romeo was they didnt quite have a riot but shakespeare had trouble figuring out why not ofttimes strange but never dull he said in the tiring room pass me that basin dick if youd be so kind ill dot burbage said shakespeare splashed water on his face and scrubbed hard with a towel to get rid of powder and rouge and paint he looked in a mirror then scrubbed some more after the second try he nodded there better i have my own seeming once again i shouldnt be so proud of it were i you kemp said slyly were you i youd have a better seeming than you do shakespeare retorted people laughed louder than the joke deserved the biter bit was always funny shakespeare had used the device to good effect in more than one play will kemp bared his teeth in what might have been a smile he found the joke hard to see magnificent master will there stood lieutenant lope de vega a broad smile on his face truly magnificent is something wrong hed seen shakespeare start then no nothing really shakespeare answered glad his actors training gave his voice a property of easiness for his was without a doubt a guilty start you did surprise me coming up so sudden i am sorry for it the spaniard said but this playthis play sir is splendid this play is also closer to what someonea man of genius of coursemight write in spain than was if you like it though that too was most excellent i haste to add you praise me past my deserts shakespeare said modestly though the compliments warmed him hed never known a writer who disliked having others tell him how good he was some had trouble going on without hearing kind words at frequent intervals marlowe for instance bloomed like honeysuckles ripened by the sun at praise but the icy fang of winter seemed to pierce his heart when his work met a sour receptionor worse still when it was ignored he fed on plaudits even more than most players shakespeare knew he had the same disease himself but a milder case and lope shook his head not at all sir you deserve more praises for this work than i have english to give you he gave shakespeare several sentences of impassioned spanish hearing that language in the tiring room made several people turn and mutterthe last thing shakespeare wanted i say again sir you are too generous he murmured lieutenant de vega shook his head once more he did at least return to english though he kept talking about plays hed seen in madrid before the armada sailed this work of mine likes him well for its nearness to that which he knew beforetime shakespeare realized that took some of the pleasure from the praise what woman would want a man to say she was beautiful because she reminded him of his mother after some considerable time de vega said but i do go on ist not so by no means shakespeare lied he couldnt quite leave that alone though did you write with celerity to match your speech master lope youd astound the world with the plays that poured from your pen youd make yourself a very prodigy of words were my duties less my time to write were more the spaniard answered and shakespeare thought hed got away with it but then de vega reminded him that he was in fact senior lieutenant de vega in aid of my duties sir a questionwhat acquaintance had you with edward kelley that he should call to you when on his way to the fire i never saw him before in my life that was what shakespeare wanted to say but a lie that at once declared itself a lie was worse than useless marlowe was right damn him de vega is a spaniard first a groundling and player and poet only second picking his words with great care the englishman said i shared tavern talk with him a handful of times over a handful of years no more though the tiring room was chilly sweat trickled down his sides from under his arms but lope de vega only nodded so i would have guessed whom would kelley have known better think you marlowe shakespeare thought and damned his fellow poet again aloud though he said only not having known him well myself i fear i cannot tell you he spread his hands in carefully simulated regret yes i see lope remained as polite as ever even so he asked another question well in whose company were you with this rogue then i pray your pardon but i cant recall shakespeare used his players training to hold his voice steady i had not seen him for more than a year perhaps for two before we chanced to spy each the other in tower street the spaniard let it drop there he went off to pay his respects to a pretty girl shakespeare hadnt seen before one whod likely got past the tiremans assistants because she was so pretty whoever she was de vegas attentions made her giggle and simper and blush shakespeare could tell which actor shed come to seeone of the hired men who played small parts not a sharerby the fellows ever more unhappy expression but the hired man had no weapon on his belt while lieutenant de vega not only wore a rapier but by the set of his body knew what to do with it not my concern shakespeare thought he felt a moments shamesurely the levite whod passed by on the other side of the road must have had some similar notion go through his mindbut strangled it in its cradle catching burbages eye he asked shall we away lets the other big man answered with a theatrical swirl burbage wrapped his cloak around him it had looked like rain all through the play and with day drawing to a close the heavens were bound to start weeping soon a drunken groundling snored against the inner wall of the theatre theyll need to drag him without ere closing for the night shakespeare said as the two players walked past him richard burbage shrugged hes past reeling ripebelike hes pickled enough to sleep there till the morrow and save himself his penny for the new days play but the idea of the mans getting off without paying that penny was enough to make him tell one of the gatekeepers outside the theatre about the drunk the man nodded and went off to deal with him shakespeare skirted a puddle burbage in stout boots splashed through it did begin to rain then a hard cold nasty rain that made shakespeare shiver this is the sort of weather that turns to sleet he said early in the year burbage said but then he shrugged again i shouldnt wonder if you have reason they walked on as the rain came down harder more puddles formed in the mud of shoreditch high street a woman lost her footing and flailing her arms fell on her backside she screeched curses as she struggled to her feet dripping and filthy would that kemp had seen her there shakespeare said hed filch her fall for his own turns clowns burbage packed a world of scorn into the word the lackwits who watch em do laugh wherefore they reckon themselves grander than the play theyre in shakespeare nodded kemp in particular had a habit of extemporizing on stage sometimes his brand of wit drew more mirth than shakespeares that was galling enough but whether he got his laughs or not his stepping away from the written part never failed to pull the play out of shape shakespeare said whether he know it or no hes not the earth with other players sun and moon and planets spinning round his weighty self or the earth and all round the sun as copernicus doth assert burbage said he being dead may assert what pleases him shakespeare looked around nervously to make sure no one had overheard his holiness the pope holding opinion contrary we enjoy not the like privilege burbage frowned if a thing be true it is true with the popes assent or in his despite here is a true thing dick shakespeare said an you speak such words where the wrong ears hear youll explicate em to the inquisition this for the inquisition burbage hawked and spat easy for him to be brave shakespeare thought he lies under no suspicion yet as edward kelleys frantic plea had the questions from lieutenant de vega reminded him of the sovereign power of fear the spaniard still seemed friendly enough and to spare but shakespeare knew he would never think of him as silly and harmless again by the time this ends ill see foes and spies everywhere as marlowe does hed had that thought before but burbages scorn let shakespeare ask the question he knew he would have to ask sooner or later would you then we lived still under elizabeth a field lay by the left side of the street when he turned his head that way he could see the looming bulk of the tower in the distance what was elizabeth doing there what was she thinking a pretty problem for a playwright burbage walked on for several strides without answering taking the chance to ponder it at last though the player said a man will do what he needs must do that he may live and prosper if prosperings in him so we know did we not these past nine years had schooled us but when you ask what would i im an englishman will if you be otherwise run tell your lithping friend he mocked de vegas castilian accent hes no friend of mine shakespeare started to say it but it wasnt true or hadnt been true till de vega asked questions about kelley the spaniard was clever amusing company he knew everything there was to know about his own countrys theatre and had learned a great deal about englands if he ever settled down to write instead of talking endlessly he might make a name for himself you were an idiot to speak your mind to me did you reckon id turn traitor shakespeare replied after some small silence of his own treason doth never prosper whats the reason for if it prosper none dare call it treason burbage quoted and then cocked his head to one side i misrememberis that yours shakespeare shook his head nay some other mans i thank you i am answered and had i cried hurrah for queen isabella many who cry so prosper shakespeare said the dons are here and here to stay by all the signs burbage said a man must live as i said just now and to live live with em so far will i go so far and no further a fellow who sniffs and tongues the spaniards bums like some scabby whining curdog with a pack of mastiffs this for him he spat again they separated not far inside the wall shakespeare went off to his lodgings burbage had a home of his own in a more prosperous part of town farther west i could go back to stratford shakespeare thought i have a home there and my wife and my children he cursed softly under his breath his son hamnet had died the year before of some childhood fever and had gone into the ground before shakespeare could make his way back to warwickshire a terrier proudly trotted by a dead rat clamped in its jaws shakespeare sighed and clicked his tongue between his teeth when hed gone back to stratford anne had wanted him to stay there had he stayed he wouldnt have had to worry about swaggering spaniards hardly a one had ever been seen in the west midlands but how could i stay he asked himself now the same question hed asked his wife then he was making a far better living in london than he could have in stratford enough to send money off to anne and their daughters susanna and judith and anne wasnt always easy to get along with he was happier and freer admiring her virtues from a distance than having them ever before his eyes when he walked into the house where he lodged jane kendall greeted him with a man was asking after you today master will a man shakespeare said in surprise and no small alarm his landlady nodded fighting for calm he found another question what sort of man one of the dons the tallowchandlers widow shook his head shakespeare hoped he didnt show how relieved he was he was about your own age the widow said not a big man not small illfavored ill say he was but with a look to him did he ask me to play at dice with him id not throw any he brought forth shakespeare frowned and scratched his head meseems that is no man i ken he said slowly gave he a name to stand beside this his illfavored visage before his landlady could answer peter foster laughed raucously wast the name of his wife or his sweetheart or his daughter go to shakespeare said his ears heating he didnt live a monks life in london but he hadnt or didnt think he had given anyone cause to come after him for that kind of reason lieutenant de vega boasted about the horns he put on husbands shakespeare by contrast reckoned discretion the better part of pleasure again widow kendall shook her head he said naught of any such thing and he did leave a name could i but recall it im more forgetful with each passing year i am it quite scares me but then she suddenly grinned and snapped her fingers skeres she exclaimed in delight your pardon shakespeare said thinking shed repeated herself and wondering why skeres she said once more nick skeres he called himself oh the poet smiled at having his confusion cleared away even so he may know me or know of me but i ken him not said he when he might again come hither not a word oft the widow replied i told him seek master will at the theatre of days i said hes surely a ninny and a fond ninny at that to know where you lodge but not where you earn your bread my thanks for speaking so shakespeare wasnt at all sure he should thank her he would have wondered at any time why a stranger was sniffing around him now he exhaled through his nose a silent sigh no help for it peter foster sounded sly and clever and most experienced saying have a care master will do this rogue could be a catchpole come for to carry you off to the clink or some other gaol ive done naught contrarious to lawshakespeare said yet fosters smile pitied a man capable of such naivete if so be hes paid hell care not a fig for that a few shillings weigh more than a mans good name again his tone was that of one who knew whereof he spoke his eyes flicked to shakespeares belt you havent even a sword twould do me but little good shakespeare said sadly even for a player a man of makebelieve im a creamfaced loon with blade in hand and i give proof thereof whenever we practice our parts for a show with swordplay you know that and now i know that but will this nick whatshisname knowt give me leave to doubt foster winked an he see you with rapier on hip what will he think belike heres a hulking brute could run me through or summat o the sort the porpentine need not cast his quills to make the other beasts afeard he need only have em again the tinkerif that was what he wasmade good sense shakespeare bowed gramercy master foster ill take your advice methinks he got his writing tools from his trunk and went off to the ordinary to eat and work the threepenny supper the serving woman said was a fine mess of eels all stewed with leeks master humphrey went down to fish wharf and fetched back a whole great tun of em eels spit flooded into shakespeares mouth bring em on kate and a cup of sack to go with em beer comes with the threepenny supperthe wines a hapenny extra kate warned shakespeare nodded he wanted it anyhow when the eels arrived he dug in with gusto savoring the rich fatty flesh and pausing every now and then to spit fish bones onto the rushstrewn rammedearth floor then he got out his paper and pens and ink and settled down to write he made slow going of it every time someone came into the ordinary he looked up to see if it were the fellow whod asked widow kendall about him but there were no illfavored strangers only people who like him supped here often some of them exchanged a word or two with him most seeing him at work left him to it he sometimes got testya couple of times hed got furiouswhen interrupted tonight though his own misgivings were what kept interrupting him it was not a night when he had to worry about forgetting curfew that he got anything at all done on loves labours won struck him as a minor miracle the two actorsactually the two spanish soldiersplaying liseo and his servant turan appeared at what was supposed to be an inn in the spanish town of illescas which lay about twenty miles south of madrid the one playing liseo hesitated bit his lip and looked blank lope de vega hissed his line at him qu lindas posadas what lovely inns the soldierhis real name was pablorepeated obediently he might have been a slightlya very slightlyanimated wooden statue painted to look lifelike but wooden nonetheless frescas agreed the fellow playing his servant his real name was francisco he knew he was supposed to say fresh air to suggest a hole in the imaginary roof but sounded even deader doing it than pablo did before they could go on to complain about the likelihood of bedbugs and lice lope threw his hands in the air stop he shouted god and all the saints stop whats the matter seaor lieutenant the soldier playing turan asked i remembered my line and pablo here he looked like he was going to remember his next one too whats the matter whats the matter lopes volume rose with each repetition ill tell you whats the matter whats the name of this play of mine la dama boba francisco answered thats whats the matter sir god give me strength de vega muttered he turned back to the soldiers thats right the lady finea is supposed to be a boob you two arent supposed to be boobs so why are you acting like boobs he started roaring again we werent pablo said in injured tones we were just giving our lines if you give them like that whod want to take them lope demanded you couldnt be any stiffer if you were embalmed this is supposed to be a comedy not a show of mourning for he started to say for king philip but broke off the king of spain wasnt dead yet for julius caesar he finished were doing the best we can sir francisco said that might have been true it probably was true but it wasnt excuse enough especially not in lopes present excited condition but you cant act he howled you ought to go to a play here and see how these englishmen do it theyre actors by god notnotso many tailors dummies devil take these englishmen pablo said we came up to this miserable country to make sure the buggers behave themselves not to make fools of ourselves in stage plays if you dont like how we do it we quit thats right francisco said you cant do that lope exclaimed youre supposed to start performing in a week so what ive had a bellyful i have pablo said this isnt part of my duty if you think the damned englishmen make such good actors seaor lieutenant get them to put on your play for you hasta la vista he stomped away the soldier playing his servant followed slamming the door behind them lope swore he sprang to his feet and kicked the bench on which hed been sitting which toppled the bench and almost ruined one of his toes as he hopped around still cursing he wondered how in gods name he was going to put on la dama boba without two of his leading characters if he could have got men from shakespeares acting company to recite spanish verse he would have done it except when they swore englishmen didnt want to learn spanish cautiously he put weight on the foot hed hurt it wasnt too bad he didnt think hed broken anything id like to break their thick stupid heads he muttered he was an officer they were only soldiers he could order them to perform but he couldnt order them to be good not and make it stick for one thing they werent very good to begin with for another they were only too likely to be bad out of spite had he been a common soldier ordered to do something he didnt really want to do he would have tried his best to pour grit in the gears oh he understood the impulse all right suddenly he snapped his fingers in delight he hurried off to captain baltasar guzmans office guzman was sanding something hed just written to soak up the extra ink buenos dias lieutenant de vega he said in some surprise i didnt expect to see you this morning i thought youd be busy with your theatricals does this mean a brand new devotion to duty your excellency i am always devoted to duty lope said it wasnt strictly true but it sounded good he added and the powers that be have been kind enough to encourage my plays they say they keep the men happy by giving them a taste of what they might have at home yes so they say captain guzman seemed unconvinced but he went on since they say so i can hardly disagree what do you require then your servant enrique lope answered guzman blinked lope explained how hed just lost two actors finishing god must have put the idea into my head your excellency enrique loves the theatre hes bright he would perform welland since hes a servant and not a soldier he wouldnt get huffy the way pablo and francisco did if you can spare him long enough to let him learn liseos part im sure hed do you credit when he performs one of captain guzmans expressive eyebrows rose did he bribe you to suggest this to me no sir he did not i only wish i would have thought of using him sooner very well senior lieutenant you may have him and i will pray i ever get him back again guzman said now whom did you have in mind for the other vacant partliseos servant is it not i was going to use my own man diego guzmans eyebrow rose again this time to convey an altogether different expression are you sure can you make him bestir himself if he doesnt do as i need i can make his life a hell on earth and i will lope said as a matter of fact i rather look forward to getting some real work out of him however much he tries to sleep through everything he is my servant after all i may not own him so absolutely as i would a black from guinea but im entitled to more than hes ever given me youre certainly entitled to it whether you can get it may prove a different question still thats your worry and none of mine guzmans chuckle sounded more as if he were laughing at lope than with him i wish you good fortune i also tell you i think you will need more than i can wish you well see de vega said though he feared his superior was right hes supposed to be blacking my boots right now he hates that maybe hed rather act than do something he hates he sighed of course what he wants to do most of all is nothing when he strode into his chamber in the spanish barracks diego wasnt blacking his boots that wasnt because hed already finished the job either the boots stood by the side of the bed scuffed and dirty and diego lay in the bed blissfully unconscious and snoring lope shook him his eyes flew open mother of god he exclaimed around a yawn whats going on then intelligenceor as much as he hadreturned to his face oh buenos dias seaor i thought you were gone for the day so you could spend the rest of it asleep eh de vega said no such luck congratulations diego you are about to become a star of the stage what me an actor diego shook his head id rather die he made as if to disappear under the blankets the wheep of lopes blade sliding out of its scabbard arrested the motion before it was well begun believe me you lazy goodfornothing that can be arranged he said if you think i am joking you are welcome to try me he didnt know that he would run his servant through but he didnt know that he wouldnt either nor did diego seem quite sure eyeing lope with sleepy resentment he said what do you want senor his gaze kept flicking nervously to the rapier get up get dressed you willby god diego you willlearn the role of turan hes a servant and a bit of a sneak so it ought to suit you well yawning again diego deigned to sit up and if i dont he asked lope kept the rapiers point just in front of his servants nose so that diegos eyes crossed as he watched it if you dont lope said if you dont the first thing that will happen is that you will be dismissed from my service i see diego had no great guile de vega could read his face if i am dismissed i will attach myself to some other spaniard and cling to him as a limpet clings to a rock whoever he is he wont want me to act either sadly lope shook his head ive already discussed this with captain guzman you know how short of mengood strong bold spanish menwe are in england any servant dismissed by his master goes straight into the army as a pikeman and off to the frontier with scotland the north of england is a nasty place the weather is so bad it makes london seem like andalusialike moroccoby comparison the scots are big and fierce and swing twohanded swords they call i think claymores they take heads they do not eat human flesh as the irish are said to do but they take heads i think you would make a poor trophy myself but who knows how fussy a scotsman would be he was lying at least in part not about the north of englandit did have an evil reputation and scotland a worse one but servants sacked by their masters didnt automatically become cannon fodder diego of course didnt know that and lope sounded convincing he wasnt a burbage or an edward alleyn but he could act put that silly sword away senor diego said i am your man if i have to be your actor i will be your actor as if to prove it he got out of bed ah many thanks diego lope said sweetly and sheathed the rapier i knew you would see reason the servant still in his nightshirt muttered something pungent under his breath as anyone with a servant needed to do lope had learned when not to hear this seemed one of those times william shakespeare came out of a poulterers on grass street with a couple of fine new goose quills to shape into pens come again sir any time the poulterer called after him as often as not the feathers go to waste and im glad to make a couple of pennies for em tis not as it was in my greatgrandsires day when the fletchers bought em for arrows by the bale the pens mightier than the sword tis said shakespeare answered but i know not whether that be true for the arrow as well certes the pen hath lasted longer pleased with himself he started back towards his bishopsgate lodgings hed just turned a corner when a man coming his way stopped in the middle of the narrow muddy street pointed at him and said your pardon sir but are you not master shakespeare the player and poet he did get recognized away from the theatre every so often usually that pleased him today today he wished he were wearing a rapier as peter foster had suggested even if it were one made for the stage without proper edge or temper instead of nodding he asked who seeks him as if he might be someone else im nicholas skeres sir the other man made a leg he lived up toor down towidow kendalls unflattering description of him but spoke politely enough and his next words riveted shakespeares attention to him master phelippes hath sent me forth for to find you indeed shakespeare said skeres nodded shakespeare asked and what would you what would he why only that you come to a certain house with me and meet a certain man nick skeres replied what could be easier what could be safer his smile showed crooked teeth one of them black by the glint in his eye hed sold a lot of worthless horses for high prices in his day show me some token of master phelippes that i may know you speak sooth shakespeare said ill not only show it ill give it you skeres took something from a pouch at his belt and handed it to shakespeare keep it sir in the hope that its like new minted may again be seen in the land it was a broad copper penny with elizabeth looking up from it at shakespeare plenty of the old coins still circulated so it was no sure token but skeres had also said the right things and so abruptly shakespeare nodded lead on sir ill follow i am your servant skeres said which shakespeare doubted with all his heart he seemed a man out for himself first last and always he hurried away at a brisk pace shakespeare a step behind hed expected to go up into the tenements north of the wall or perhaps to southwark on the far bank of the thames to some mean house surely there to meet a cozener or a ruffian a man who dared not show his face in polite company and nicholas skeres did lead him out of london but to the west all the way to westminster at the somerset house and the church of stmarylestrand skeres turned north up into drury lane grandees dwelt in these great homes half of brick half of timber one of them could have housed a couple of tenements worth of poor folk shakespeare felt certain skeres would go on to and past st giles in the field which lay ahead but he stopped and walked up to one of the houses nor did he go round to the servants entrance but boldly knocked at the front door lives your man here shakespeare said in something close to disbelief skeres shook his head naythat were too dangerous but he dwells not far off he he broke off for the door opened the man who stood there was plainly a servant but better dressed than shakespeare nick skeres said we are expected and murmured something too low for the poet to catch whatever it was it served its purpose the servant bowed and said come with me then he waits ill lead ye to him carpets were soft under shakespeares feet as he went up one corridor and down another he was more used to the crunch of rushes underfoot indoors the house was very large he wondered if he could find his way out again without help like theseus of athens in the labyrinth i should play out thread behind me here we are good sirs the servant said at last opening a door and now ill leave ye tot god keep ye smooth and silent as a snake he withdrew come on nick skeres said as soon as shakespeare entered the room skeres shut the door behind them then he bowed low to the old man sitting in an upholstered chair close by the hearth in the far wall a book rested on the arm of the chair god give you good day lord burghley i present master shakespeare the poet whom i was bidden to bring hither to you shakespeare made haste to bow too youryour grace he stammered had skeres told him he would meet queen elizabeths longtime lord high treasurer he would have called the man a liar to his face and gone about his business but there without a doubt sat sir william cecil first baron burghley after the duke of parmas soldiers conquered england most of elizabeths privy councilors had either fled to protestant principalities on the continent or met the headsmans axe but burghley at king philips specific order had been spared he had to be closer to fourscore than the bibles threescore and ten his beard was white as milk whiter than his ruff and growing thin and scanty his flesh was pale too and looked softer and puffier than it should havealmost dropsical dark sagging pouches lay under his eyes but those blue eyes were still alert and clever though a cataract had begun to cloud one of them the order of the garter with st george slaying a dragon hung from a massy gold chain around his shoulders well met master shakespeare he said his voice a deep rumble without much force behind it i have for some while now thought well of your plays and poems you are generous beyond my deserts your grace shakespeare said still bemused surely he hadnt been summoned for pretty compliments alone he shook his head annoyed at himself for being so foolish as even to think such a thing thomas phelippes hand lay somewhere behind this phelippes whatever else he was was not one to waste time on inessentials sit sit lord burghley waved shakespeare and nicholas skeres to a pair of plain wooden stools in front of his chair he coughed wetly a couple of times as they perchedshakespeare nervouslythen went on now is the winter of our discontent shakespeare stirred burghleys smile showed several missing teeth and another one broken ay i heard burbage as richard mouth your words they hold here truer than they did for the plantagenet know you that king philip fails ive heard somewhat oft shakespeare answered cautiously thinking sir william cecil himself did likewise no sooner had that crossed his mind than the nobleman let out a rheumy chuckle we race each other into the grave he and i but when the worms take us mine the victory for my son is greater than his sire his far less belike youll treat with robert ere this business endbut for now with me i am your servant my lord shakespeare said as nick skeres had before him but skeres had only been greasily polite shakespeare could not imagine disobeying lord burghleyand did not want to imagine what would happen to him if he did my servant sir william cecil shook his head the flesh of his cheeks wobbled like gelatin as no healthy mans would have done nay you shall be my good right arm and the sword in the hand thereof to strike a blow for england no other man might match shakespeare thought of christopher marlowe and of kits fury at being excluded from this plot he also thought he would gladly have given marlowe his role but if it were to be done the best man had to do it shakespeare and marlowe both knew who that was by your leave sir shakespeare said i tell you the chance of all going as we would desire his voice trailed off he could not make himself tell burghley how bad he thought the odds were the gesture served well enough lord burghley chuckled againand then coughed again and had trouble stopping when at last he did he said think you not that on hearing of philip the tyrants passing our bold englishmen will recall they are free and brave think you not they will dot if someone remind them of what they were and of what they are and of what they may be shakespeare bared his teeth in a grimace that was anything but a smile am i atlas your grace to bear upon my shoulders the burthen of the whole world his weight ill lighten somewhat the said burthen an i may lord burghley picked up the book even though he set a pair of spectacles on his nose he still had to hold the volume at arms length to read he flipped through it rapidly then more slowly till at last he grunted in satisfaction then to shakespeares surprise he switched from english to latin know you the tongue of the romans magister guglielmus remembering thomas jenkins the schoolmaster whod made sure with a switch that his latin lessons stuck in his mind shakespeare nodded yes sir though it is some while since i used it aloud you would do me a courtesy by speaking slowly nicholas skeres looked from one of them to the other a slow flush rose in his cheeks sir william cecil said he understands us not having no latin of his own are you certain shakespeare asked he seems a man who shows less than he knows burghley nodded heavily in that you are not deceived beware of him in a brawl for he will always have a knife up a sleeve or in a boot but you must believe me when i say latin is not among the things he conceals very well sir it wasnt very well shakespeare trusted nick skeres not at all but hed taken his protest as far as he could what would you say to me that you will not say in his understanding if you were a scholar of latin you must surely have gone through the annals of tacitus so i did shakespeare nodded too i made heavy going of it i confess for he is a difficult author recall you the passage beginning with the twentyninth chapter of the fourteenth book of the said work your pardon sir but i recollect it not did you tell me to what it pertains my memory might be stirred i shall do better than that attend peering down at the book now on his lap burghley began to read the sonorous latin text after a couple of sentences he glanced at shakespeare over the tops of his spectacles do you follow i take the meaning yes though i should not care to have to construe the text meaning suffices lord burghley told him you are a scholar no longer and i am not your master i will not whip you if you mistake an ablative for a dative shall i continue if you please sir sir william cecil read on to the end of the passage to shakespeares relief he went more slowly after the poet admitted having some trouble following the grammar when hed finished he eyed shakespeare once more see you the dramatic possibilities inhering to that section i do indeed shakespeare had to pause and go slowly and put his thoughts into latin the possibilities burghley had mentioned boiled inside his head he wanted to talk about them in the plain english in which he wrote even more than that he wanted to flee this fancy house in drury lane get paper and pen and ink and sit down in his ordinary or some other tolerably quiet place and get to work maybe lord burghley saw as much for he smiled and see you how i would have the drama springing from this passage be shaped yes shakespeare nodded you would have the audience construe the romans here as shall we say some more recent folk speaking a tongue sprung from latin from this it would follow burghley held up a hand you need say no more magister guglielmus i see you have nicely divined my purpose therefore to my next question can you do it shakespeare fell back into english for he wanted to be sure he made himself clear my lord i can dot of that theres no doubt but may i dot there lies the difficulty for even the first scratch of pen on paper were treason let alone any performance based thereon you can say that in english sure enough for i already know it nick skeres said william cecil also returned to his native tongue saying one performance is all i expect or hope for by jesu christ god his son i do hope so shakespeare said for after the first never would there benever could there bea second but burghley shook his head not so if the first shape events as we hope think you not that your works will endure not of an age but for all time theres a weighty thought nick skeres bright little eyes glittered id give a ballock to be famed forever beshrew me if i wouldnt that such fame might be his had never crossed shakespeares mind any player who dreamt of such things had to be mad by the nature of things his turns on stage were written in the wind the youngest boy who saw him would grow old and die and then what was he a ghost worsea forgotten ghost he dared hope his plays would last longer than memories of his performances but hope was only hope the one playwright he knew who expected to be famous was marlowe and kit owned arrogance for an army and to spare lord burghley had a point though no doubt about it if he could bring this off or help to bring it off his own eyes must have gleamed as skeres had a moment before for burghley said youll dot then youll bring it to the stage at the appointed time my lordshakespeare spread his hands helplesslyyou will i trust be persuaded i bear you naught but good will and bearing you good will i needs must tell you this presentation you so earnestly desire is less easy to bring to fruition in the proper season than your grace supposes sir william cecils frown put shakespeare in mind of black clouds piling up before a storm here plainly was a man unused to hearing qualms or doubts but after a long exhalation the noblemans only words were say on gramercy my lord hear me then shakespeare took a long breath of his own before continuing i can write the play with what you have given me i can shape it into the weapon you desire i can put the groundlings to choler straight being once chafed they shall not be reined again to temperance well then burghley folded his velvetsleeved arms across his chest covering the order of the garter he wore what more is wanted here a wise man shows himself a fool shakespeare reminded himself the theatre was not burghleys trade look you my lord you must bethink yourself a play is more than words set down on paper its men and boys up on the stage making the words and scenes seem true to those that see em and so burghley remained at sea but nick skeres stirred on his stool i know his meaning my lord he exclaimed we can trust himwe think we can trust him anyway he spoke quickly confidently he was at ease in the world of plots and counterplots as shakespeare was while treading the boards of the theatre but the play engrosses the whole company any one man learning whats afoot can discover it to the spaniards at which he drew his finger across his throat ah now william cecil nodded swinging back toward shakespeare he asked think you your troupe of players holds such proditors as eden held the serpent i know not i would noti could notsay ay nor nay or ever i sounded them and in the sounding i might myself betray a point baron burghley admitted a distinct point he seemed anything but happy yet did not reject shakespeares words because they werent what he wanted to hear shakespeare admired him for that he asked whats to be done then a moment first ant please you shakespeare said for i had not rehearsed all the troubles hereto pertaining he waited for burghley to nod again before continuing this secret as master skeres hath said must be held by the several men of the company that alone were no easy matter true enough another nod from burghley what else not only must they keep it close sir they must keep it close over some long stretch of time wherein they learn their parts and learn to play em all this of course in secret and we shall have to contrive costumes for the romans and the wait lord burghley held up a hand how much of this might you scant why as much as you like my lord shakespeare answered the nobleman looked pleased till he went on if it suit you to have presented a clumsy aborted botch of a show well dispense with rehearsal altogether but such a play wherein were hissed and pelted from the stage meseems would serve your ends less well than you desire a wordless rumble came from deep within lord burghleys chest you show me a sea of troubles master shakespeare how arm we against them here you must be my guide you not i are the votary of this mystery i see no sure way shakespeare told him wishing he could say something different what seems best is this to sound the players one by one in such wise that i give not the game away should a man prefer the spaniardsor even simple quietto daring the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and if one of them be a cozener or an intelligencer nick skeres asked sure enough he took conspiracy and betrayal for granted how shall you hinder him from sending the lot of you to the block or the gallows or such delightsome toys as only a spaniard would think to devise such is the risk inherent in the exercise lord burghley remarked you can say that shakespeare thought resentfully youll likely be dead ere were well begun and the nobleman would die in his own time having lived a long life but if the players were found out skeres had the right of it such delightsome toys he shuddered he was not a particularly brave man counterfeiting courage on the stage hed seldom needed it in humdrum everyday life would you see england free again burghley asked softly ay theres the rub shakespeare thought every hamlet in the land dreamt of england free again he found himself nodding he could do nothing else then well find ways and means find them or make them the baron sounded perfectly confident again shakespeare silently fumed but what can i do save go forward hed already heard enough to make him a dead man if he didnt sing to the spaniards and if things miscarry he reminded himself if all go well theyll make of you a hero he had trouble believing it sir william cecil briskly rubbed his hands together we are in accord thenist not so shakespeare nodded still rather less than happily the nobleman smiled at him commence as quickly as may be the sooner the play is done the sooner the players have their parts by heart the better only god knows how long philipand elizabethwill live we must be ready shakespeare didnt scream but he came close my lord he said carefully i am now engaged upon preparing a new play for the company and this hath greater weight behind it burghley said again screams bubbled just below the surface your grace if i cease work upon a play half done who will not wonder why were it not best that i draw no questions to myself you quibble burghley said ominously by god sir i do not shakespeare answered and heres the rest oft lord westmorlands men will pay me for loves labours won and pay me well wholl pay me for this roman tragedy a poet lives not upon sweet breezes and moonbeams he needs must eat and drink like any man ah burghley nodded taking from his belt a small leather sack he tossed it to shakespeare who caught it out of the air it was heavier than hed expected when he undid the drawstring gold glinted within his eyes must have widened for william cecil let loose another of his wet chuckles theres fifty pound he said carelessly an you require more nick skeres will havet for you ggramercy shakespeare choked out hed never made anywhere near so much for a play most of his income came from his share of the theatres takings he also eyed skeres any sum of money that came through the sharp little man would probably be abridged before reaching its intended destination skeres stared back bland as butter have we finished here baron burghley asked numbly shakespeare nodded when he got to his feet his legs at first didnt want to hold him up burghley said get you gone master shakespeare ill away anon we should not be seen entering or leaving together nor should you come to my house though it be nigh i am here on pretense of waiting on my nephews anthony and francis bacon do i meet them on repairing hither another time know they of this our enterprise shakespeare inquired sir william cecil looked through him as if he hadnt asked the question chuckling nick skeres said any cokes can see youre new to the game what you know not een the bastinado cant squeeze from you shakespeare made a noise down deep in his throat nothing close to a word urrr skeres might call it a game but games didnt kill some do shakespeare corrected himself baiting the bear or the bull he could almost feel fangs tearing into him still shaking his head he left the house in drury lane he was halfway home before realizing no one had said anything about how nick skeres would return to london he shrugged skeres he was sure would prove as slippery and evasive as a blackbeetle or a rat he wished he could say the same for himself iii lope de vega waved to a tall scrawny englishman in ragged clothes who stood as hopefully as he could by a rowboat you there sirrah he said sharply how much to row us across to southwark he pointed to the far bank of the thames tuppence sir the fellow answered making a clumsy botch of his bow a penny each for you and your lady here then lope gave him two bronze coins put us ashore as near to the bearbaiting garden as you may to the old one or the new the boatman asked to the new de vega replied yes sir ill dot the englishman smiled at his companion mind your step as you get in my lady have no fear my dear my sweet lope said grandly and gave nell lumley his arm she smiled as she took it she was as tall as he blond and buxom and called herself a widow for politeness sake though de vega doubted shed ever wed but she was fond of him and he always enjoyed squiring a pretty woman around he expected to enjoy lying with her afterwards too cold country hot blood he thought englishwomen had pleasantly surprised him and he enjoyed the feeling of being half or a little more than half in love it heated his own blood as a cup of wine would as often as not he discarded one mistress and chose another for no more reason but also he told himself for no less reasonthan to have that sweet intoxication singing through his veins so now he swept off his cloak folded it a couple of times and set it on the bench for nell she wagged a finger at him ah lope my sweetheart thou needst not do that i dot not for that i need to he answered i dot for that i want to sit sit sit sit he clucked like a mother hen laughing she sat the boatman pushed the rowboat into the thames then scrambled aboard himself his boots dripping he knew how to handle the oars feathering them so next to no water dripped from the blades they hadnt gone far when nell lumley wrinkled her short pert nose by jesu the river stinks a dead dog all puffy and bloated chose that moment to float past them heading downstream how can it help stinking lope replied it is londons sewer and london stinks what city stinks not the city of heaven mayhap proving angels dwell therein of course folk downstream drank the water into which folk farther upstream poured their shit and piss and offal lope knew that hed always known it how could he how could anyone help knowing it but it wasnt anything he usually thought about he took it for granted as anyone did now bobbing on the stinking stream he couldnt he gulped steeth lean over the side or ever you cast the boatman exclaimed and put more filth in the river de vega thought he clamped his teeth together in a little while the sick spell passed nell said if passage over the thames makes thee like to sick up thy dinner what of coming here in the invincible armada remembering the passage from lisbon to dover almost did make him lose his last meal he patted his mistress hand and gave her the prettiest lie he could come up with the company i keep here makes me forget all that chanced before i set foot on englands shore nell lumley blushed and stammered the boatman sweat starting out under his arms despite the chilly weather made a distinct retching noise lope shot him a hard look he stared back only effort on his face nell didnt seem to have noticed lope let it passfor the moment englishmen were rude by nature the boats keel grated on mud less than a furlong west of london bridge southwark sir the boatman said as smoothly as if he hadnt been insolent a moment before he pointed theres the new bearbaiting gardenyou can see it past the roofs of the stews yes thank you de vega handed nell out of the boat he tipped the boatman only a farthing true the fellow had rowed well but he didnt intend to forget the way the man had mocked his compliment without a word the boatman pocketed the small coin without a word he shoved his boat into the thames and started rowing back toward london and then out of range of lopes rapier he let fly leatherjerkin crystalbutton knotpated agatering pukestocking caddisgarter smoothtongue spanish pouch no matter how useless it was lopes hand flew to the hilt of his sword nell giggled which did nothing to improve his temper she said fret not hes jealous nothing more and so he hath good reason to be lope answered mollified for am i not the luckiest man alive in christendom ah nell said softly and dropped her eyes they had to walk down a street of stews to get to the bearbaiting even though de vega went arm in arm with his companion the lewd women called out invitations that made his ears burn pretending he didnt hear he kept walking he wants you not one of the women called to another for see you he hath already a whore of his own where lope had been angry at the boatman nell was furious at the prostitute stinking poxy callet she yelled i bite the thumb at thee that was the thee of insult not of intimacy the contents of a chamber pot came flying out of a thirdstory window and splashed in the street just in front of them fortunately most of the splash went the other way lope and nell werent badly fouled nell was still fuming henry viii closed the stews she said nor did they open again until the coming of queen isabella and king albert in different company she might have said something hot about the spaniards lope thought but he said only king henry may have closed these stews but surely in a town the size of london others flourished that they dared cast whoredom in my face but nell didnt directly answer lopes comment from which he concluded she couldnt very well disagree with him they hurried on toward the bear garden a long queue of englishmen and women of all estates leavened by a sprinkling of spaniards advanced toward the entry the building was an oval that put de vega in mind of a roman amphitheater though built of wood and not enduring stone inside dogs were already barking and growling furiously at the entryway lope gave the fellow taking money a pair of pennies the englishman waved him forward at the stairs farther on most people went up he handed fourpence to the man waiting there with another cash box the man gave him a professionally courteous nod want to be in at the death eh he said go on down then and find places for yourselves as close to the pit as ye may there nell pointed a few spaces remained in the very lowest row of benches if we hurry now she led lope not the other way round she went so fast she tripped on the hem of her skirt as she hurried down the stairs she might have fallen had he not held her up gramercy she said and kissed him on the cheek an englishman and his wife and their young son were making for the same seats they gave lope and nell sour looks when they found themselves edged out the man a big burly fellow muttered something into his beard nay hush said his wife whose pinched face bore what looked to be a perpetually worried expression beshrew me if he be not a don hes a thief thats what he is the man rumbled hed steal an egg out of a cloister he would like all his breed but he went off and found seats for himself and his family a good distance away from de vega lope looked back over his shoulder and bared his teeth in what was as much a challenge as a smile the englishman would not meet his eye lope nodded to himself proud as a fighting cock that hadnt had to use his spurs to beat a rival down in the pit the first bear was already chained to the stout iron stake in the center of the earthen floor he was a goodsized beast and didnt look too badly starved his hot rank odor filled lopes nostrils the mastiffs still caged smelled him too their barking grew more frantic by the moment the englishman sitting next to lope nudged him and said half a crown on old bruin there to slay before they kill him six dogs or more if you like a crown lope eyed him he wasnt all that well dressed five shillingseven two and sixpencewould be a lot of money for him and he looked a little too eager a little too confident men who knew too much about bears and dogs were the bane of the garden cheating those without inside information i thank you but no de vega said im here for to watch the fight no more the englishman looked disappointed but lope had declined too politely for him to make anything of it a cozener nell asked in a low voice without a doubt lope answered a wineseller moved through the crowd nell waved to him lope bought a cup for her and one for himself he looked around the arena it was almost full now before long they would he couldnt even finish the thought before they did one man with a lever could lift the movable sides of all the mastiffs cages at once baying like the wolves their cousins the great dogs swarmed into the baiting pit one died almost at once his neck broken by a shrewd buffet from the bears great paw the rest of the mastiffs more furious than ever leaped at the bear clamping their jaws to his leg his haunch his belly his ear roaring almost like a lion he rolled in the dirt crushing another animal beneath him a couple of other mastiffs sprang free before his weight fell on them muzzles already red with blood they sprang back into the fight oh bravely done nell lumley cried from behind lope she clapped her hands her eyes glistened tear him to pieces nor was hers the only voice raised in the bear garden shouts of kill him and bite him rose from all three levels so did yells of rend the dogs and rip em to rags some of those surely came from folk whod put money on the bear but the english seeing one animal chained and attacked by ten were perversely likely to take him into their hearts at least for a little while as if by accident de vega let his hand rest on nells thigh she stared at him in surprise she might have forgotten he was there her cheeks were flushed her lips slightly swollen she set her hand on his he smiled and kissed her the noise she made at the back of her throat was almost as fierce as the ones coming from the pit lope laughed a little when they finally broke apart bear and bullbaitings always made her wanton three dogs were dead now and a couple of others badly hurt but blood dripped and poured from the bear everywhere he wobbled on his feet a pink loop of gut protruded from his belly his grunts and bellows came slower and weaker hell not last lope said nell nodded without looking at himshe had eyes only for the pit as if directed by a single will all the mastiffs left alive even the injured ones sprang at the bear as their teeth pierced him nell groaned as if lope were piercing her the bear fought back for a moment but then sank beneath the dogs the din in the arena all but deafened de vega the shabby englishman sitting next to him nudged him again see you youd have won he slew but four unless that fifth be too much hurt to live lope said such is life a remark that gave the other man no room to comment dog handlers in thick leather jerkins and breeches came out to drive the mastiffs back into their cages they needed the bludgeons they carried to get the big dogs off the bears carcass once the dogs were out of the pit an ass that rolled its eyes at the stink of blood dragged away the body it would be butchered and the meat sold hast thou eaten of bears flesh lope asked nell she nodded seldom but yes mighty fine it was too sweet as pork tender as lamb i thought the same lope said i ate it once or twice in spain were bears common as cattle who would look at beef more attendants raked the ground and spread sand and fresh dirt over the pools of blood the first bearbaiting might never have happened so lopes senses said at any rate but when the handlers brought the next bear out to the stake the lingering scent of blood in the air made him so wild he almost broke free of them a fresh pack of mastiffs assailed the bear he was smaller than the one that had fought before but seemed wilier he rolled again and again and hunched himself so the dogs had trouble reaching his belly and privates mastiff after mastiff went down another one dragged itself out of the fight on stiff forelegs its back broken a handler smashed in its head with a club hell kill them all nell was as happy to cheer for the bear as she had been to clap for the dogs in the first fight and the new bear did kill them all as the last mastiff its throat torn out staggered off and fell down to die lope thought most of the bettors want to hang themselvesthat hardly ever happens and the dog breeders too with so many expensive animals dead a whole new pack of mastiffs had to be loosed against the bear since it had taken so many wounds from the earlier pack the baiting ended in a hurry that was as well londons short day was drawing to a close lope rose and gave nell lumley his arm shall we away to the city and find a place for the two of us her answering smile had nothing coy in it yes lets she said sure enough after a bearbaiting her own animal spirits were in the ascendant lope and nell had just left the bearbaiting garden when someone called his name from behind it was a womans voice as if in the grip of nightmare lope slowly turned out of the arena came his other mistress martha brock walking with a man who looked enough like her to be her brother and probably was he would be lope thought in helpless horror if she were betraying me she couldnt get in much of a temper but if shes not oh by the virgin if shes not too late he realized the virgin was the wrong one to ask for intercession here whos that martha brock demanded pointing at nell whos that nell lumley demanded pointing at martha dear ladies i can explain lope began hopelessly he never got the chance he hadnt thought he would you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun nell cried and i loved you impersevant thing martha added a truant disposition lope tried again i can expl again no good they both screamed at him they both slapped him they didnt even quarrel with each other which might have saved him when they both burst into tears and cried on each others shoulders marthas brother said sirrah thourt a recreant blackguard get thee hence he didnt even touch his sword with de vega so plainly in the wrong he didnt need it jeered by the englishmen whod watched his discomfiture lope walked back toward the thames all alone when pizarros men conquered the incas one of them got as his share of the loot a great golden sun and gambled it away before morning hed made himself a spanish proverb too but here ive outdone him lope thought glumly i lost not one mistress but two and both in the wink of an eye will kemp leered at shakespeare the clowns features were soft as clay and could twist into any shape what lay behind his mugging shakespeare couldnt tell the first thing we do kemp exclaimed lets kill all the spaniards he didnt even try to keep his voice down they were alone in the tiring room but the tireman or his assistants or the theatre watchmen might overhear god mend your voice shakespeare hissed you but offend your lungs to speak so loud not my lungs alone kemp said innocently are you not offended offended no shakespeare shook his head afeard yes i am afeard and wherefore the clown asked ist not the desired outcome of that which you broached to me just now of course it is shakespeare answered but would the fountain of your mind were clear again you prancing ninny that i might water an ass at it do you broadcast it to the general before the day our heads go up on london bridge and curdogs fatten on our bodies ah well ah well maybe kemp hadnt thought of that at all maybe too hed done his best to give shakespeare an apoplexy his best was much too good he went on an you write the play ill act int there he beamed at shakespeare are you happy now my pet he might have been soothing a fractious child why could you not have said that before shakespeare did his best to hold his temper but couldnt help adding another why you want everything all in its place again will kemp might have beenlikely washumoring him i can see how that might be so for youafter all youd want act first done or ever you went on to act second eh i should hope so shakespeare said between his teeth what was the clown prattling about now kemp deigned to explain but youre a poet and so having all in order likes you well but for a clown he shook his head as like as not ive no notion what next ill do on stage ive noticed that weve all of us noticed that shakespeare said good kemp twisted what had been meant for a reproach into a compliment if i know not nor can the groundlings guess the more theyre surprised the harder they laugh regardless of how your twisted turn mars the fabric o the play shakespeare said kemp only shrugged shakespeare would have been angrier had he expected anything else the clown said i know not what ill do tomorrow nor care if i play then i play if i choose instead to morrisdance from london to norwich by god ill do that ill do well by it too he seemed to fancy the ridiculous idea folk would pay to watch me on the way and i might write a book afterwards kemps nine days wonder id call it no man could in nine days dance thither shakespeare said interested in spite of himself ive ten pound to say youre a liar by the gleam in kemps eye he was ready to strap bells on his legs and set off with a man to play the flute and drums hed meant what he told shakespearehe didnt know what hed do next on stage or anywhere else come on poet will you match me the mans a weathervane blowing now this way now that in the wind of his appetites shakespeare thought he held up a placating hand i havent the money to set against you he lied let it be ven as you claim fly not to norwich nor to any other place he realized he was pleading you perform this afternoon you know and on the morrow as well theres no more valor in you than in a wild duck kemp said scornfully you are as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse he told the truth shakespeare knew too well how little courage he held but he wagged a finger at will kemp and said if youd bandy insults think somewhat before you speak you twice running used valor it might better in the first instance have been courage woe upon you and all such false professors kemp retorted o judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts shakespeare threw his hands in the air enough and so however maddening it was kemp had in his own way said hed do what needed doing shakespeare didnt think the clown would betray him to the spaniards after thatnot on purpose anyhow not a word now on your life he warned on my life too not that kemp cares a farthing for it what gone without a word the clown said oh very well for your joy when shakespeare came out of the tiring room he felt hed aged ten years the tireman gave him a curious glance whats toward he asked that kemp is more stubbornhard than hammered iron shakespeare said disdainfully telling the truth and acting at the same time at last meseems he hath been brought towards reason towards doing what youd have him do you mean the tireman said his name was jack hungerford his beard which once had been red was now white that only made his eyes seem bluer hed had charge of costumes and props for decades before marlowes tamberlane made blank verse the standard for plays and he had all the shrewdness of his years here though he played into shakespeares hands ill not say youre mistaken the poet replied and hungerford looked smug but keeping the tireman happy wasnt enough as much as the players he would be a part of what followed shakespeare picked his words with care how now master jack youve seen more than is to most men given and if i have hungerford asked his eyes were suddenly intent while the rest of his face showed nothing whatever shakespeare had seen that blank vizard more times than he could count these years since the armada landed indeed hed worn that blank vizard more times than he could count it was an englishmans shield against discovery against treachery in a land no longer his own having it raised against him saddened shakespeare but he understood why hungerford showed so little the safest answer to the question whom to trust was no one hell make me discover myself to him shakespeare thought unhappily then the risk is mine not his well no help fort he said you well recall the days before isabella and albert took the throne twas not so long ago master will hungerford replied his tone studiously neutral you recall em yourself though youve only half my years good days i thought shakespeare said some were some not so good the tireman revealed nothing nothing at all behind shakespeares back one of his hands folded into a fist i might have known it would be like this but then hungerford went on better days i will allow than some of those we live in i say as muchi hope i say as muchnot only for that a mans youth doth naturally seem sweeter in the years of his age think you those good days might come again i know not hungerford said and shakespeare wanted to hit him would it were so but i know not was that enough encouragement to go on shakespeare didnt think so damn you jack hungerford he raged but only to himself he stalked away from the tireman as if hungerford had offered him some deadly insult behind him hungerford called for one of his assistants if he knew where shakespeare had been heading he gave no sign of it that day lord westmorlands men put on marlowes the cid shakespeare had only a small part one of the moorish princes whom the cid first befriended and then in the name of christianity betrayed he unwound his turban shed his bright green robe and left the theatre early hoping to take advantage of what little daylight was left in the sky booksellers hawked their wares in the shadow of st pauls most of them sold pamphlets denouncing protestantism and hairraising accounts of witches out in the countryside some others offered the texts of playsas often as not pirated editions printed up from actors memories of their lines the volumes usually proved actors memories less than they might have been shakespeare ground his teeth as he walked past a stall full of such plays hed suffered from stolen and surreptitious publications himself that he got nothing for them was bad enough that they mangled his words was worse what theyd done to his prince of denmark hed added injury to insult by buying his own copy of that one to see if it were as bad as everyone told him it wasnt it was worse when he thought about the princes socalled soliloquy to be or not to be aye theres the point to die to sleep is that all aye all no to sleep to dream aye marry there it goes hed seen that burned it into his memory so he could quote it as readily as what hed really written he couldbut he didnt have the stomach to get past the third line splendid in his red robes a bishop came out of st pauls and down the steps surrounded by a retinue of more plainly dressed priests and laymen the soldiers on guard at the bottom of the stairs stiffened to attention one of themby his fair hair surely an englishmanknelt to kiss the clerics ring as he went past the spaniards enslaved some of us shakespeare thought others thoughothers enslaved themselves no one had made that soldier bend the knee to the bishop no one would have thought less of him had he not done it but he had by all appearances hed been proud to do it even if i go on with this madcap scheme will it have the issue lord burghley desires shakespeare shrugged hed come too far to back away now unless he inclined to treason that might save you it might make you rich he shrugged again some things were bought too dear motion up at the top of st pauls caught his eye a man in artisans plain hose and jerkin was walking about on the flatroofed steeple now and then stooping as if to measure we have a catholic queen and king once more will they order the spire finished at last shakespeare shrugged one more time it would be yet another sign we are not what we were what we once set out to be but how many even care gloom threatened to choke him gloom also made him inattentive so that he almost walked past the stall he sought it wasnt the sight of the books that made him pause but the sight of the bookseller good den master seymour he said why master shakespeare god give you good den as well harry seymour replied he was a tall lean man who would have been goodlooking had he not had a large hairy wen on the end of his nose do you but pass the time of day or can i find summat for you im always pleased to pass the time of day with you shakespeare answered which was true hed never known seymour to print or sell pirated plays he went on but if youve the annals of tacitus done into english id be pleased to buy it of you as my head lives master shakespeare i do indeed and ill take oath i fetched hither some few of that title this morning seymour came around to the front of the stall now where did i put em ah here we are he handed shakespeare a copy will you want it for a play i might but my latin doth stale with disuse wherefore im fain to take the short road to reminding me what he treats of shakespeare admired the ornate first page illustrated with a woodcut of swaggering togaclad romans a handsome volume ill not deny twould be handsomer still cased in buckram or fine morocco like any book dealer seymour sold his wares unbound what boards they eventually wore depended on the customers taste and purse no doubt shakespeare said politely by which he meant he didnt intend to bind the book at all not even baron burghleys gold could tempt him to such extravagance as a player and a poet he knew too well how money could rain down one day and dry up the next he would cling to as many of those coins as he could in aid of which he held up the translation whats the scot six shillings harry seymour answered my good fellow you are a thief professed shakespeare exclaimed but your theft is too open your filching is like an unskilful singer you keep not time say what you will will but ill have my price or youll not have your book seymour said i give thanks to the holy mother of god that i can stay at my trade at all times are hard and grow no easier i am not some wanderer staggering half drunk past your stall i do regularly give you my custom when i seek some work of scholarshipor so i have done up till now shakespeares indignation was part perfectly real part feigned if he gave in too easily the bookseller might wonder whyand seymours oath had proved him a catholic i must seem as i always was shakespeare thought the deeper into this exercise he got the harder that would grow you know not what i had to pay master daniels the which rendered into our tongue the noble romans words seymour protested sensing weakness shakespeare pressed him that youre a subtle knave a villain with a smiling cheek makes you no less a knave and a villain he made as if to thrust the annals back at seymour the bookseller had grit save your players tricks for the stage he said i gave you my price and i give you my farewell if you use me so shakespeare didnt want to have to search for a different translation elsewhere not when he had this one in his hands but he didnt want to pay six shillings either nine days wages for a soldier on one book harry seymour made a rumbling unhappy noise down deep in his throat five and sixpence then he said as if wounded unto death and for no other man alive would i lessen the price even a farthing his honor salved shakespeare paid at once saying there you see i knew you for the gentleman you are exceedingly well read and wondrous affable stuffed as they say with honorable parts you reckon him a gentleman who doth as you list seymour said sourly go your way master shakespeare i am yet out of temper with you may you have joy of the sixpence you prised from me his joy in that sixpence quite quenched shakespeare strode north and east back towards his bishopsgate lodgings light faded from the sky with every step he took the winter solstice was coming soon with christmas hard on its heels they were both coming sooner indeed than he reckoned right after their coronation isabella and albert had imposed on england pope gregorys newfangled calendar cutting ten days out of june in to bring the kingdom into conformity with spain and the rest of catholic europe when shakespeare looked at things logically he understood those ten days werent really stolen when he didntwhich was mankind being what it was more oftenhe still felt as if hed had his pocket picked of time some stubborn souls still celebrated the feast of the nativity on what gregorys calendar insisted was january they did so in secret they had to do so in secret for the english inquisition prowled hardest at this season of the year sniffing after those who showed affection for the old calendar and thus for the protestant faith adhering to it along with darkness fog began filling the streets here and there men lit cressets in front of their homes and shops but the flickering flames did little to pierce the gloom shakespeare hurried up cheapside to the poultry past the smaller churches of st peter and st mildred and up onto threadneedle street which boasted on the west side churches dedicated to st christopherlestock and st bartholomew he let out a sigh of relief when threadneedle street opened on to bishopsgate a moment later he let out a gasp for a squad of spaniards tramped toward him but their leader only gave him a brusque jerk of the thumb as if to tell him to hurry home i thank our worship he murmured and touched his hand to the brim of his hat as he ducked down the side street that would take him to the widow kendalls the spaniard nodded in return and led his men south and west along threadneedle a decent man doing well the task to which he was set shakespeare thought more than a few of the occupiers were decent men still the task to which philip had set them was the subjugation of england and on nine years evidence they did it well oh master will tis good to see you jane kendall said when shakespeare came into her house as he went over to stand by the fire she continued i was sore afeard them spanish devils had took you not so as you see im here shakespeare looked around the parlor but wheres master foster most days he is before me and having somewhat to do betwixt close of theatre and my coming hither i know i am later than i might be later than you ought to be the widow kendall said in reproving tones and as for master peter before she could go on jack street broke in hes in the hole they nabbed him at last i wouldnt guess what his law was but outside the law certes shakespeare didnt know what his missing roommates illegal specialty was either but wasnt surprised to learn those in authority thought peter foster had one can we do aught for him he asked jack street gloomily shook his head not unless we want them bastards asking after us next the glazier said which struck shakespeare as altogether too likely hes paid till the end of the month widow kendall said an he bide yet in gaol then ill sell his goods for what they bring she thought more of what she might do for herself than for her lodger after warming himself by the fire shakespeare went off to the ordinary around the corner for supper a sizzling beefsteak and half a loaf to sop up the juices made him a happy man he took out his quill and his bottle of ink and set to work on loves labours won by god master will what is it like to have so many words in your head the serving woman asked so that they come forth kate alls well he answered but if my thoughts be dammed then im damned with them he pounded his forehead with the heel of his hand to try to show her the feeling he got when the words would not move from his mind to the page in front of him she laughed and nodded and said will another mug of beer loose the flow one other may he said and she poured his mug full from the pitcher she carried he went on ask me not again i pray you for with too much drink ive trouble knowing whether the words that come be worth the having ill leave you tot then kate said and she did but tonight the words whether worth the having or not did not want to come shakespeare stared into the candle flame and tried all the other tricks he knew to break the wall between his wit and his pen but had little luck while the upper part of his mind dutifully tried to get on with loves labours won the deeper wellspring the part from which inspiration sprang dwelt with the woes of the ancient iceni not with his present characters he smote his forehead again this time in good earnest the sudden pain did him no good either he looked around in frustration he had none but himself to blame for his troubles the hour grew late he was the only customer left in the place with everything quiet and serene he should have written as if fiends were after him he muttered a curse fiends were after him but not the sort that set his pen free when kate came by again he laid down the pen with a sigh she gave him a sympathetic smile saying i saw you troubled but did not like to speak for fear i might send flying the one word thatd free you that words nowhere to be found tonight or else already flown shakespeare answered ruefully were my pen a poniard it would not stab say not so for i know thy yard pierces kate said her smile this time was of a different kind ah sits the wind in that quarter then without waiting for an answer shakespeare got to his feet even at such a moment he was careful to gather up his precious manuscript and pens and ink before heading for the stairway with the serving woman thourt sweet kate to give of thyself to a spring gone dry like me springs a long way off and its cold outside she said and i doubt me thourt dry in all thy humors else after last we lay between the sheets why found i a wet spot there laughing he slipped an arm around her waist i own myself outargued he said she snuggled against him and sighed softly he held up his papers belike thou couldst outwrite me too art fain to try go to she said me that needs must make a mark to set down my name they came to the top of the stairs her door stood just to the right she opened it they went inside kate closed the door shakespeare took her in his arms kiss me he said she did when he left the ordinary hed come no further forward on loves labours won his head was high and he had a spring in his step even so he started to whistle a ballad then fell silent and shrank into a dark doorway when he heard other footsteps coming down the dark street if it wasnt curfew time it was close running into a patrol now was the last thing he wanted the men who walked by spoke in low voices and in english he would have bet they too didnt want to run into a patrol and he didnt want to run into them either and silently sighed with relief when they vanished into the fog he sat down at the table in the parlor once he got back to his lodgings hoping he could set a few words down on paper before he got too sleepy to work but he hadnt written above a line and a half before peter foster stuck his head into the room to see what was going on oh master will god give you good even he said give you good even shakespeare echoed automatically then he gaped they said you were in the hole why so i was foster laid a finger by the side of his nose god gave me a good even and a good set of gilks and a bit of charm besides he held up the skeleton keys for shakespeare to admire he looked like a man used to picking locks sure enough bravely done the poet said but will they not come after you again since when belike the turnkey knows not im gone peter foster said with fine contempt nay will ill couch a hogshead here tonight then budge a beak come morning i tell you true ill be glad to scape that sawmill who sleeps with us as you reckon best shakespeare said with a shrug me id not care to sleep here in my own bed before fleeing the sheriffs you fret more than i foster said not unkindly perhaps he was doing his best not to call shakespeare a coward may i turn turk if theyre here or ever im gone youve seen naught of me mind think what you will of me but im no delator shakespeare said and if they pull off my boots and give me the bastinado till i can bear no more he did his best not to think about that he was glad when peter foster nodded apparently satisfied and went off to bed but by the way loves labours won foundered it might have been aboard sir patrick spens ship on the luckless voyage to norway shakespeare went to bed himself jack street did indeed make the night hideous but his snores were the least of what kept shakespeare awake so long when he got up foster was gone no one had come after the clever little man with the interesting tools shakespeare went off to the theatre in a thoughtful mood his roommate knew crime as he himself knew poesy and might well have made a better living at his chosen trade buenos dias your excellency lope de vega said sweeping off his hat and bowing to captain baltasar guzman how may i serve you this morning buenos dias lieutenant guzman replied first of all let me compliment you on la dama boba your lady was a most delightful boob and i thoroughly enjoyed watching her antics yesterday lope bowed again this time almost double i am your servant sir he exclaimed in delight his superior had never before paid him such a compliment for his theatrical workor indeed for work of any other kind captain guzman went on and my compliments especially for wringing such a fine performance from your diego i know that cannot have been easy had i known i would have to use him i would have made the servant a sleepier man de vega said as things were he mimed cracking a whip over diegos back even so guzman nodded then he raised an elegant eyebrow and asked tell me after which of your mistresses was lady nisea modeled or should i say which of your former mistresses the story is they had it in mind to throw you into the bear pit for the mastiffs sport please believe me your excellency it was not so bad as that he asked captain guzman to believe him he didnt tell his superior that what he said was true guzmans eyebrows rose higher still no eh it certainly has been a mighty marvel hereabouts i suppose i should admire your energy if not your luck at the bear garden everyone who saw them says a man would be lucky to have one such woman let one two how can i answer that de vega wondered deciding he couldnt he didnt try instead he repeated how may i serve you sir rather than answering him directly baltasar guzman said your timing could have been better lieutenant in fact it could hardly have been worse sir have you forgotten you are to meet with cardinal parsons this morning guzman eyed him then assumed a severe expression i see you have what a pity it could be that the cardinal being an englishman and having just come from canterbury has not heard of your ah escapade it could be i hope it is but i would not count on it the man is devilishly well informed lope sighed yes sir i know he is he said glumly ill do the best i can splendid im sure you said the same to both your lady friends ears burning lope beat a hasty retreat from captain guzmans office as hed feared enrique waylaid him in the hall guzmans servant also bubbled with enthusiasm for la dama boba i especially admired niseas transformation from a boob to a woman with a mindand a good mindof her own he said since lope had worked especially hard to bring off that transformation enriques praise should have delighted him and in fact it did leave him pleased but he had no time for enrique now you will excuse me i hope he said but im on my way to st pauls oh yes of course for your meeting with the archbishop of canterbury enrique nodded wisely everyone knows my business better than i do de vega thought with a stab of resentment captain guzmans servant continued he is a very wise man and a very holy man too no doubt i know lope said desperate to be gone if you will excuse me retreating still he hurried out of the spanish barracks and west to the greatest cathedral in london the booksellers near the steps tempted him to linger but he resisted temptation and went up the stairs and into the great church if books came bound in skirts though annoyed at himself he shook his head to try to dislodge the vagrant thought a deacon came up to him as he stepped into the cool dim quiet and you would be sir the fellow asked in english lope proudly replied in his own castilian tongue i have the honor to call myself senior lieutenant lope de vega carpio he was not surprised to find the deacon spoke spanish too ah yes you will be here to meet the archbishop of canterbury come with me seaor quiet evaporated as the deacon led de vega through the cathedral masterless men dickered with merchants and artisans who might have work for them lawyers in rich robes traded gossip smiling bonarobas fragrant with sweet perfume and showing as much soft flesh as they dared lingered near the lawyers one of the women smiled at lope he ignored her which turned the smile to a scowl he didnt care to buy a tarts favors no matter how fancy and lovely she was he preferred to fall in love or at least to imagine hed fallen in love and whats the difference he wondered only how long the feeling lasts do have a care the deacon warned him picking pockets or slitting them is a sport here this too i suppose is christian charity lope said the deacon gave him an odd look away from the vast public spaces of st pauls were the chambers the clergy used for their own the deacon led de vega to one of those then like enrique going in to see captain guzman he said wait here for a moment please and ducked into the room by himself when he returned he beckoned his eminence awaits you with pleasure he is too kind lope murmured even in the rich regalia of a cardinal robert parsons looked like a monk his face was long and thin and pale his closecropped graying beard did nothing to hide the hollows under his cheekbones he held out his ring for de vega to kiss i am pleased to make your acquaintance senior lieutenant he said in latin thank you your eminence lope replied in the same language he switched to english i speak your tongue sir an you have no spanish i prefer latin it is more precise parsons said by his appearance he was nothing if not a precise man as you wish of course lope hoped his own latin would meet the test he read it well but he was no clergyman and so did not often speak it i am at your service in every way good cardinal parsons looked down at some notes on his desk and nodded to himself i am told you are the spanish officer most concerned with sniffing out treason in the english theatre yes your eminence i believe that to be true lope answered pleased hed remembered to use the infinitive this is becausethe archbishop of canterbury checked his notes againyou are yourself an aspiring dramatist yes your eminence de vega repeated wondering if the english churchman would take him to task for it but parsons only said i am glad to hear it lieutenant for treason is afoot in that sphere and you being familiar with its devices are less likely to let yourself be cozened than would someone uninitiated in its mysteries lope had to think before he answered the cardinals latin was so fluent so confident he might have been whisked by a sorcerer from the days of julius caesar to this modern age he made no concessions to lopes weaker latinity lope got the idea parsons made few concessions to anyone save possibly the pope your eminence i go to the theatre more to watch the audience than to watch the actors de vega said many of them i know well and they have not shown themselves disloyal to queen isabella and king albert robert parsons snorted like a horse lope needed a moment to realize that was intended for laughter parsons said and how likely is it that they would declare their treason before an officer of his most catholic majesty of spain you make me out to be a fool a child lope said angrily by no means lieutenant the archbishop of canterburys smile was cold as winter along the scottish border with your own words you make yourself out to be such without his intending it de vegas hand moved a couple of inches toward the hilt of his rapier he arrested the motion even if he was insulted drawing sword on a prelate would certainly send him to gaol and probably to hell he gave the cardinal a stiff bow if you will excuse me your eminence i will not parsons voice came sharp as a whipcrack i tell you there is treason amongst these men and you will be gods instrument in flensing it out but your eminencelope spread his handsif they do not show it to me how can i find it there is no treason in plays that are performed the master of the revels sees and approves them before a play reaches the stage sir edmund tilney is the one who will know if the poets plan seditionindeed he has arrested some for trying to say what must not be said like parsons face his fingers were long and thin and pale when he drummed them on the desktop they reminded de vega of a spiders legs again you speak of overt treason parsons said the enemies of god and spain like satan their patron are more subtle than that they skulk they conspire they with whom lope broke in i shall tell you with whom with the english nobles who still dream of setting at liberty that murderous heretic jade elizabeth their former queen parsons eyes flashed king philip was too merciful by half in not burning her when first she was seized and again in not slaying more of the men who served her and upheld her while she ruled he had lope remembered spent more than twenty years in exile from his native land when he spoke of skulking and conspiring he spoke of what he knew cautiously de vega asked have you anyone in particular in mind he expected the archbishop of canterbury to name christopher marloweeveryone seemed to put marlowe at the head of his list of troublemakersor george chapman or robert greene though greene hed heard was ill unto death after eating of a bad dish of pickled herring but parsons after an abrupt nod replied yes a slanderous villain by the name of william shakespeare shakespeare lope said in surprise i pray your eminence to forgive me but you must be mistaken i know shakespeare well he is a man of good temperof better temper than most poets i would say what of the friends of poets cardinal parsons asked lope needed a heartbeat to notice hed put the feminine ending on friends well baltasar guzman had warned not much got past the cardinal and he was right your eminence lope said reproachfully let it go let it go forget i said it parsons told him but i warn you lieutenant there is more to that man than meets the eye he has been seen in homes where a man of his station has no fit occasion to call and he keeps company no honest man would keep or want to keep he knows marlowe well lope said knowing marlowe he will also know marlowes acquaintances many of them i fear are men such as you describe there is more to it than that cardinal parsons insisted i do not know how much more that i charge you to uncover but i tell you lieutenant there is more to find his nostrils quivered like those of a hunting hound straining to take a scent captain guzman had dark suspicions about shakespeare too lope had dismissed those who ever thinks his immediate superior knows anything but if robert parsons and guzman had the same idea perhaps there was something to it i shall do everything i can to aid the cause of spain your eminence de vega said chill disapproval in his voice parsons answered it is not merely the cause of spain it is the cause of god but then he softened i do take your point lieutenant work hard and work quickly my latest news is that his most catholic majesty does not improve but draws closer day by day to his eternal reward with his crisis very likely will come the crisis of our holy catholic faith here in england no less than the inquisitors you defend against heresy go forth knowing god is with you yes your eminence thank you your eminence lope kissed cardinal parsons ring once more he left the cardinals study left st pauls as fast as his legs would take him no doubt parsons had intended a compliment in comparing him to an inquisitor but what hed intended and what lope felt were very different things the inquisition was necessary of that de vega had no doubt but there was also a difference between what was necessary and what was to be admired vultures and flies are necessary without them the ground would be littered with dead beasts he thought no one invites them to dinner though and no one ever will shakespeare knelt in the confessional bless me father for i have sinned he said the priest in the other side of the booth murmured a question he hardly heard he confessed his adultery with the serving woman at the ordinary his rage at will kemp though not all his reasons for it his jealousy over christopher marlowes latest tragedy and such other sins as came to mind and as could safely be told to a catholic priest as shakespeare had conformed to protestant worship during elizabeths reign so he conformed to romish ritual now that isabella and albert sat on the english throne and philip of spain stood behind them more often than not conforming came easy the catholic churchs rituals had a grandeur a glamour missing from protestantism had shakespeare been able to choose faiths on his own he might well have chosen romes his father had quietly stayed catholic all through elizabeths reign but having invaders impose his creed on him galled shakespeare as it galled many englishmen the priest gave him his penance and then with a lowvoiced go and sin no more sent him on his way he went up toward the altar in the small parish church of st ethelberge the virginthe church closest to his lodgingsknelt in a pew and began to say off the ave maria s and pater noster s the priest had assigned him by the time he finished he did feel cleansed of sin although being a man he knew he would soon stumble into it again nine years of conforming to catholic ways was also long enough to leave him full of guilt about what he hadnt confessed despite the sanctity of the confessional any mention of his meeting with lord burghley would have gone straight to the english inquisition and no doubt to the secular authorities as well he was as sure of that as he was of his own name even so he raised his eyes to the heavens as he finished his last ave maria the priest wouldnt know what he kept to himself but god would crossing himselfanother gesture that had grown close to automatic since the coming of the armadahe got to his feet to leave st ethelberges as he walked down the aisle toward the door kate came out of the confessional and started up toward the altar dull embarrassment made shakespeare look down at the stone floor shed probably confessed to the same passage of lovemaking as he had for her of course it was only fornication not adultery he forced himself to look her in the face god give you good day he said as if he knew her but not in the biblical sense and you master will she answered quietly shall we see you again at the ordinary this even belike he said she walked on by him her small secret smile said she might have confessed but hadnt fully repented he started back to the widow kendalls he wanted to get in what writing he could while some daylight lingered and before most of the other lodgers came home and made the place too noisy for him to think in the rhythms of blank verse he wished he were a rich man like the bacons in whose home hed met lord burghley being able to sit down in a room without half a dozen other people chattering in his ear is beyond your means so what point fretting yourself over it he hadnt gone far before an apprenticeeasy enough to recognize by his clothes for he wore a plain flat cap and only a small ruff at his throatpointed to him and said there goes master shakespeare being a man whose face many saw shakespeare had that happen fairly often he almost made a leg to the prentice to acknowledge he was who the young man thought he was but something in the fellows tone made him hold back the apprentice hadnt just recognized him by the way he sounded others were looking for shakespeare too he didnt care for that at all sure enough though another man and a woman pointed him out to their friends on his way back to his lodgings and when he got there jane kendall was in a swivet oh sweet jesu she exclaimed first master foster now you whatever shall i do what mean you madam he asked thinking what will you do find more lodgers what else but if they pursue me as they pursue peter foster whatever shall i do he doubted whether running to stratford would help him theyd track him down there could he get over the border to scotland have they got theatres in scotland might a player live there or would he slowly starve why master shakespeare the fellow asking after you he looked a right catchpole he did his landlady answered had a great gruff deep voice too enough to make anybody afeard oh master shakespeare what have you done naught shakespeare answered and that was true or something close to true hed set down not a word on paper the closest thing to evidence anyone might find among his possessions was the translation of tacitus annals but it wasnt the only work of history in his trunk and he hadnt so much as dogeared the relevant page as far as proof went theyd be on thin ice but how much would that matter the bastinado the rack thumbscrews the water torture the english inquisition favored if they hauled him away and began tormenting him how long could he hold out he shuddered sweat sprang out on his forehead he was no hero and knew it too well if they tortured him he would tell all he knew and quickly too doing his best not to think of such things he went to the ordinary for supper and for work all he knew about what he ate was that it cost threepence he did notice kates smile and absentmindedly gave it back after she took away his wooden trencher he got to work on loves labours won tonight the writing went well better than it had for a fortnight at least he dipped his quill in the bottle of ink again and again it raced across the page kate knew better than to talk to him when the words tumbled forth like the thames at flood when at last she came over to his table it was only to warn him curfews nigh oh he didnt want to stop but he didnt want to be caught out either not if they were looking for him anyway as he gathered up his pens and papers and ink he came back to the real world now the smile he gave the serving woman was sheepish another time i fear me she nodded not much put out when i saw you writing so i knew that would be the way oft her voice softened god keep thee and thee shakespeare pushed his stool back from the table he couldnt have gone on much longer anyhow the candle was burnt almost to the end with an awkward nodalmost the nod a youth might have given a pretty maid he was too shy to courthe hurried out of the ordinary he rose the next morning in darkness in december the sun stayed long abed porridge from the pot on the hearth and a mug of the widow kendalls ale broke his fast and he wasnt the first lodger up jack street went out the door while he was still eating when shakespeare followed the glazier out of the lodging house a big man stepped from the shadows and said you are master william shakespeare he had to be the fellow whod spoken to jane kendall his voice came rumbling forth from deep in his chest and if i be he shakespeare asked who are you and what business have you with me you are to come with me to westminster the man replied forthwith but im wanted at the theatre shakespeare said youre wanted in westminster and thither shall you go the big man said implacably the wind lies in the east comelets to the river for a wherry twill be quicker thus he made the sign of the cross god be my witness master shakespeare you are not arrested nor shall you be so that you do as you are bid now come soonest there soonest gone i am your servant shakespeare said ever so glad he was notor apparently was notthe other mans captive morning twilight had begun to chase the dark from the eastern sky when they got down to the thames even so early half a dozen boatmen shouted at them eager for a fare whither would you go my lord one of them asked after the fellow sent to fetch shakespeare set a silver groat in his hand westminster the big man answered ill hie you there right yarely sir the boatman said he proved good as his word using both sail and oars to fight his way west against the current the wind did indeed blow briskly from the east which helped speed the small boat to westminster they got there faster than shakespeare would have cared to walk especially when he still would have had trouble seeing where to put his feet hisguide took him through the maze of palaces and other state buildings he heard spanish in the lanes and hallways almost as often as english westminster was the beating heart of the spanish occupation of his country the mere word made him queasyit was often used of a mans lying with a woman and indeed through his soldiers king philip had thrown down queen elizabeth thrown down all of england and bide here a moment the englishman with the deep voice said and ducked into an office he soon came back to the doorway and beckoned come you in turning to the man behind the large ornate desk he spoke in spanish don diego i present to you seaor shakespeare the poet shakespeare had little spanish but followed him well enough to make sense of that the englishman gave his attention back to shakespeare and returned to his native tongue master shakespeare here is don diego flores de valdas shakespeare made a leg to the spaniard i am honored beyond my deserts your excellency he said in fact he was more nearly appalled diego flores commanded all of king philips soldiers in england what knows he instead of translating as shakespeare had expected his guide politely inclined his head to the spanish grandee and withdrew flores proved to speak good if accented english saying please seat yourself senor chakespeare he waved to a stool in front of the desk like most spaniards he made a hash of the sh sound at the start of shakespeares name and pronounced it as if it had three syllables thank you my lord shakespeare perched warily on the stool he would sooner have fled even knowing flight would doom him made it no less tempting he took a deep breath and forced some players counterfeit of calm on himself how may i serve you today don diego flores studied him before answering the spanish commandant was in his fifties his beard going gray his hooked nose sharper in his thin face than it might have seemed when he was young when he said i am told you are the best poet in england he sounded like a man not in the habit of believing what he was told again i say your excellency you do me too much honor who surpasseth you flores asked sharply the spanish lisp making his english sound oldfashioned when shakespeare did not reply the officer laughed there you see honor pricks you on more than you think this i understand this i admire if it be a sin to covet honor i myself am the most offending soul alive he jabbed a thumb at his own chest and sofor this were you summoned hither because you are the best what would you of me whatever sort of poet i be i am a poet of english i know not the spanish tongue claro que sa don diego said and then seeing shakespeares puzzled expression but of course you are desired because you write english so well shakespeare was sure he looked more puzzled than ever flores continued have you not heard that king philip god love him fails in regard to his health was that a trap ought i to claim ignorance shakespeare wondered after some thought he rejected the idea the king of spains decline was too widely known to make such knowledge dangerous cautiously the poet said ay your excellency i have heard somewhat oft muy bien very good the spaniard again translated for himself though this time shakespeare followed him perfectly well crossing himself flores went on soon the good lord will summon to his bosom the great king may king philip live and reign for many years shakespeare saw no way to say anything else not to philips commandant in england may it be so but philip is a mortal man being in that like any other flores sounded impatient perhaps he knew more of the state of philips health than was common gossip in london to make for him a memorial a monument it is for this i summoned you hither my lord shakespeare still felt at sea as i told you i am a poet a player not a stonecutter the spanish grandee snorted one unruly eyebrow rose for a moment he forced it down but still looked exasperated plainly shakespeare struck him as something of a dullard that suited shakespeare well enough he wished he struck flores as a mumbling drooling simpleton the officer gathered himself may the memorial the monument you make prove immortal as cut stone i would have from you seaor a drama on the subject of his most catholic majestys magnificence to be presented by your company of actors when word of the kings mortality comes to this northern land a show of his greatness for to awe the english people to make known to them they were conquered by the greatest and most christian prince who ever drew breath and to awe them thereby can you do this thing i promise you you shall be furnished with a great plenty of histories and chronicles wherefrom to draw your scenes and characters what say you do i laugh in his face hell hold me lunaticand stray not far from truth how can i dot another thought immediately followed that one how can i say him nay shakespeare did his best mayt please your excellency i find myself much engaged in press of business and don diego flores de valdas waved that aside with a dry chuckle for his most catholic majesty himself the best none save the best will serve we bind not the mouths of the kine who tread the grain your fee is an hundred pound i pay it now and desire you to set to work at once none of us knowing what gods plan for king philip may be he took from a drawer a fat leather sack and tossed it to shakespeare chuckling again he added and what say you now of this business of yours dizzily shakespeare caught the sack gold clinked sweetly nothing else could be so heavy in so small a space for flores would scarcely try to trick him with lead an i live i am rich but how can i live with burghley and the spaniard both desiring plays of me he had no answer to that i am your servant he murmured once more saes verdad don diego didnt bother translating that he pointed to the door you may go i look for the play in good time shakespeare rose he leftalmost staggered fromthe commandants chamber the big englishman with the deep voice waited outside to take charge of him as they walked down the hall shakespeare saw thomas phelippes writing in a nearby room did phelippes have anything to do with this if so did that make it better or worse again shakespeare had no answer iv shakespeare will write a play on the life of his most catholic majesty lope de vega dug a finger in his ear as if to make sure hed heard correctly shakespeare captain baltasar guzman nodded yes that is correct you seem surprised senior lieutenant no your excellency i seem astonished with the archbishop of canterbury and it appears to me everyone else in the world suspecting him of treason why give him such a plum he is without a doubt a fine writer and you are without a doubt naive guzman smiled lope made himself smile back in lieu of picking up his stool and braining his arrogant little superior with it that supercilious smile still on his face captain guzman continued if shakespeare is well paid he may be less inclined to treason this has been known to happen before if he writes a play praising king philip he may be too busy to get into mischief he ticked off points on his fingers as he made them but what sort of play will he write lope asked if he is a traitori dont believe it mind you but if he iswont he slander the king instead of praising him not with the master of the revels looking over his shoulder every moment guzman replied if the master finds even a speck of slander in the play it will not go on the stageand senor shakespeare will answer a great many pointed questions from the english inquisition from queen isabella and king alberts intelligencers and from don diego flores de valdas shakespeare may be a poet but i do not think him a fool he will know this and give us what we require lope didnt care for the way captain guzman eyed him you are a poet and i do think you a fool the nobleman might have said but what he had said made more than a little sense it could be de vega admitted reluctantly generous of you to agree i am sure don diego will be relieved guzman said lope stiffened he was more used to giving out sarcasm than to taking it guzman pointed at him and one more thing will help keep us safe against any danger from seaor shakespeare whats that your excellency you senior lieutenant your excellency you baltasar guzman repeated shakespeare is writing about king philip of spain you are a spaniard you are also mad for the english theatre what could be more natural than that you tell the englishman what he needs to know of his most catholic majesty and that you stay with his troupe to make sure all goes well he will be grateful for it dont you think what i think lope said is that you may be committing a sin under the eyes of god by making me enjoy myself so much captain guzman laughed i will mention it to the priest the next time i confess i think my penance will be light i hope youre right you order me to go to the theatre sir de vega asked his superior nodded lope wondered how much liberty hed just received this will be the whole of my duty till the play goes before an audience guzman nodded again the pleasure that shot through lope was so intense he thought he would have to add it to his next confession but then the nobleman said this is for the time being it may change later and if any emergency or uprising should occur god forbid it god forbid it indeed but if it should you will help meet it as i think best of course your excellency this goes without saying i am first of all a servant of his most catholic majesty as is every spanish man in this dark miserable land muy bien i did want to make sure we had everything clear something flickered in baltasar guzmans eyes amusement malice perhaps a bit of both and with you senior lieutenant i was not sure anything went without saying buenos dias buenos dias lope echoed he rose bowed himself almost double and left the captains chamber without showing hed felt or even noticed the gibe it was either that or draw his rapier and have at guzman he didnt want to fight for one thing the man was his superior and entitled to such jests for another although de vega did not despise his own skill with a sword captain guzman was something of a prodigy with a blade in his hand set against the requirements of honor that shouldnt have mattered the world being as it was it did when lope got back to his own chamber he found diego snoring away hed expected nothing less he didnt bother shaking his servant he booted him instead taking out some of the anger he couldnt spend on captain guzman shaking diego was often a waste of time anyway kicking him worked better a madre de dios he exclaimed and sat bolt upright he blinked at lope his eyes tracked with red veins get up you dormouse before i seethe you in honey de vega snarled you cant sleep away the whole day diego groaned not more playacting he said in face under lopes merciless direction he had performed well as turan the servant in la dama boba and why not he was a servant all he had to do was play himself remember his linesand stay awake but lope shook his head no not more playacting for you ignoring diegos sigh of relief de vega went on but i may be doing more of itand in english no less why has this got anything to do with me diego asked around a yawn i can read your mind you rascal lope glared at him youre thinking my master will be off acting i can lie here and sleep till the day of resurrection you had better think again wretch or youll sleep the sleep of a dead man im going to need you more than ever for what perhaps for more acting lope said and his lackey groaned again he took no notice of that perhaps to carry messages for me and perhaps for who knows what you are my servant diego you can work for me and do as i say or you can find out how you like things on the scottish border madre de dios diego said once more sadly this time being a servant is a hard life who would say otherwise i have to obey another mans orders my time is not my own oh what a pity de vega broke in you cannot sleep every blessed hour of every blessed day every so often you have to stand up and earn your bread instead of having it handed to you already dipped in olive oil and where have you seen olive oil in england senor save in what we bring here from spain for ourselves diego said the english they hate it if that doesnt prove theyre savages what does it prove it proves youre trying to change the subject lope answered that wont work though that wont work and you by god will life is hard for a servant with a cruel master diego sighed life is hard for any servant but especially for one so unlucky if i were a cruel master you would already be up on the scottish border or sent to ireland or else tied to the whipping post on account of your laziness lope said maybe that would wake you up nothing else seems to i do what i have to do senor diego said with dignity you do half of what you have to do and none of what a good servant ought to do de vega retorted maybe you should fall in love youd stay awake for your lady and you just might stay awake for me too fall in love with an englishwoman not me senor diego shook his head so vigorously his jowls wobbled back and forth he didnt seem to have slept through any meals with a sly smile he added look what englishwomen have given younothing but trouble and i dont need a woman to give me trouble not when ive got a master for a moment lope sympathized with his servant his own superior captain guzman had given him a good deal of trouble too but guzman had also just given him the freedom of the english theatre that made up for all the trouble hed ever had from the cocky little nobleman and then some and no matter what fat lumpish diego said women had their uses too richard burbage stared at shakespeare tell it me again the big burly player said the dons are fain to have you make a play on the life of philip even so shakespeare said unhappily the two stood alone on the outthrust stage of the theatre no applemunching beerswilling wenchpinching groundlings gaped at them from the open area around it no richer folk peered from the galleries it was still morningrehearsal time the afternoons play would be prince of denmark burbage would play the prince shakespeare his fathers ghost hed just emerged through the trap door from the damp chilly darkness under the stage hed written the lines they were practicing but burbage remembered them more readily than he did on the stage nothing fazed burbage he threw back his head and laughed now both hands on his comfortable belly a couple of the tiremans assistants and an earlyarriving vendor turned their heads his way hoping they might share the jest he waved to them as if to say it was none of their affair had shakespeare done that they would have ignored him burbage they took seriously and went back to whatever theyd been doing shakespeare sighed not by accident was burbage a leading man mirth still shining in his eyes burbage spoke for shakespeares ear alone well my duck one thing it shows beyond doubts shadow whats that the poet asked they suspect not your other commission but how am i to do both shakespeare demanded in an impassioned whisper marry how tis the most unkindest cut of all dick two plays at once that will drive me mad and madder till i see which be fated to journey from pen and paper tothis his wave encompassed the painted glory of the theatre a pretty gesture burbage remarked do you use it when appearing thus he crouched as if coming up through the trap door then stood with a broader more extravagant version of shakespeares wave twill help to draw the auditory into the business of the play ill dot shakespeare said but he refused to let the other man distract him ive not yet sounded the whole of the company on the other after this how can i theyll take me for the spaniards dog and think i purpose luring em to treason another haply but not you will burbage set a hand on his shoulder youre an honest man none honester which everybody knows and for which i do thank you shakespeares laugh rang wild enough to make curious eyes swing his way again he wished hed been able to hold it in but felt as if he would burst if he tried but honest were i honest to all here embroiled id die the death ithe next instant by no means burbage shook his head and looked somber in sooth youd die the death but as slow as those who had you could in their ingeniousness make it the devil damn thee black thou mooncalf scroyle shakespeare said which only made richard burbage laugh still furious shakespeare went on will kempd use me so from you i hoped for better write your play on philip the actor told him write it as well as ever you may for who knows what god list an we givet we givet an we put forth in its place some different spectaclewhy that toos gods will and theres an end to it he would play the one as gladly as the other reckoning the company would profit from either shakespeare realized that made him no happier than he had been if burbage didnt care whether he strode the boards as philip of spain or in toga and crested helm as gaius suetonius paulinus did he truly care who ruled england did he truly care about anything but his own role and how the playgoers would see him that was a question with any actor with one who enjoyedno reveled insuch general acclaim as richard burbage a question all the more pointed news of the play on king philips life raced through the company like wildfire who will stop the vent of hearing when loud rumor speaks shakespeare thought with sour amusement he from the orient to the drooping west doth unfold the acts commenced on this ball of earth stuffing the ears with false reports he wished this report were false will kemp sidled up to him still carrying the skull hed use while playing the gravedigger come the afternoon performance youll give me some words wherewith to make em laugh ist not so he said working the jawbone wired to the skull so that it seemed to do the talking be still old bones shakespeare said kemp tossed the skull in the air and caught it upside down that only made its emptyeyed leer more appalling philips such a pompous praying prating pig any play which hath him int will need somewhat of leavening lest it prove too heavy for digestion the clowns voice became a high wheedling whine here is the first ive heard you care a fig for the words i do give you shakespeare said tartly it were better that those who play own clowns speak no more than is set down for them kemps flexible face twisted into an expression so preposterous even shakespeare couldnt help smiling but master william my dove my pet my chick my poppet the clown cooed the pith oft it is as ive said aforetimes the groundlings laugh louder for my words than for yours i pith on you and the groundlings both shakespeare stood with his legs spraddled wide as if easing himself will kemp gaped at him forestalled by god shakespeare thought you were about to make your own pissy quibble and looked not for the like from me he added the devil take your laughs when they flaw the shape of my play as ive said before hear you me now i hear kemp looked angry angry and ugly he started to say something more then spun on his heel insteadfor a big bulky man he moved when he chose with astounding graceand stalked away another caring more for himself than aught else shakespeare sighed it was either sigh or weep from despair someone will sell us to the spaniards sure as pilates men nailed jesu to the rood someone will think first of thirty pieces of silver and not of all of england someonebut who he wouldnt be burned alive not for treason or most of him wouldnt they would haul him to tower hill on a hurdle and hang him till he was almost dead then theyd cut him down and draw him as if he were a sheep in a shambles theyd throw his guts into the fire while he watched if he was unlucky enough to keep life in him yet that done they would quarter him and display his head and severed limbs on london bridge and elsewhere around the city to dissuade others from such thoughts and deeds he shuddered that was english law elizabeth had used catholics who plotted against her thus for all he knew the spaniards had worse punishments for traitors somebody tapped him on the shoulder he jumped and almost screamed i humbly do beseech you of your pardon master shakespeare jack hungerford said i meant not to startle you my thoughts were elsewhere shakespeare said shakily and the tireman nodded shakespeare gathered himself what would you why id ready you for your turn on stage of course hungerford replied his eyes plainly asking how far off were your wits the hour draws nigh you know ill come with you shakespeare followed him as hed lately followed too many men from whom he sooner would have fled back in the tiring room hungerford was all brisk efficiency he powdered shakespeares face and hands with ground chalk then smeared black grease under his eyes for a skulllike effect here see yourself he said and pressed a glass into shakespeares hand shakespeare studied the streaky image the mirror gave back am i more haggard than i was before he murmured hungerford perhaps fortunately paid him no attention the tireman was rummaging through the companys robes to find a smokegray one shot through with silver thread youll have a care with this down under stage he said severely tis the sole habiliment we have fit for a royal spook smutch it and the cleaning costs us dear ill mind me oft good good youd better like any tireman worth his salt jack hungerford cared more for his clothes and other properties than for the players who wore them he thrust a polished pewter crown at shakespeare see howt glisters like silver theres not a ghost in all the world can match the princes father for finery ive no doubt youre right master hungerford shakespeare set the crown on his head it was too small hed been playing the ghost ever since he wrote the tragedy and had yet to persuade the tireman to get a crown that fit him hungerford handed him a bowl full of shredded crumpled paper do you remember to set this alight just afore the trap door opens twill make a fine smoke wherewith to amaze the groundlings i shall remember shakespeare promised gravely do you recall in turn i have played the role before do you further recall i am he who devised it the tireman only sniffed as a mother might when her son insisted he was a grown man however much he insisted she would never believe it not in her heart hungerford never believed players knew anything the more they said they did the less he believed it too a rising buzz came from out front the days audience hurrying into the theatre when shakespeare stood to go to his place under the stage and await his cue to rise through the trap door jack hungerford grabbed the bowl full of paper scraps and set it in his hand before he could reach for it see you you would have forgotten it hungerford said triumph in his voice what point to quarreling with him shakespeare had bigger worries swarms of them if youd have it so so it is for you he said wearily the tireman stirred about to speak again shakespeare spoke first by my halidom master jack ill not forget me the candle to light it with hungerford nodded by his expression he couldnt decide whether shakespeare had merely called him by his christian name or had called him a jack a saucy paltry silly fellow since shakespeare had intended that he wonder the poet was well enough pleased he did make a point of remembering the candle hungerford would never have let him live it down had he forgotten after their skirmish he also made a point of carrying it carefully so he didnt have to come back and start it burning again not out brief candle he thought light this fool the way through dusty gloom he had to walk doubled over had the stage been high enough to let him straighten up it would have been too high to let the standing groundlings see the action on it he peered out at the crowd through chinks and knotholes he couldnt see muchthe men and women in front blocked his view of those farther back his ears told him more than his eyes could it sounded like a full house or something close and it sounded like an enthusiastic one itll like thee well lucy said a man standing close enough to shakespeare for his voice to be distinct among the multitude the prince of denmark he feigns hes mad so go to hal lucy broke in ive not seen it afore and i shant thank thee for spoiling the devisings god bless you lucy youre a woman of sense shakespeare thought he knew too many playwrights who were too fond of boasting of their machinations he thought them fond in the other sense of the word for their plays seemed insipid to him when he knew ahead of time everything that happened footsteps on the boards above his head words heard dimly through thick wooden planks the sentinels bernardo and francisco talking of the night shakespeare hurried over to the little platform under the trap door he lit the papers they caught at once and began filling the space under the stage with smoke it tickled his nose and his throat he fought against a cough horatio and marcellus came on francisco left his boots thumping shakespeare cocked his head to one side listening for his cue his chalky fingers closed on the trapdoor latch bernardo raised his voice to make sure the waiting ghost heard where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one shakespeare loosed the latch down swung the trap door hed made sure the hinges were well oiled so they didnt squeal up he popped through the door with a fine cloud of smoke around him a woman shrieked which made two more cry out in sympathy if one screamed others always followed and he was good enough to make that first one scream he had no lines here or in his next couple of appearances he had but to stand looking ominous and menacing till his cue to stalk off and then go below once more one of the tiremans helpers crawled out to bring him another bowl full of bits of paper and a fresh candle you nigh gasted them out of their hose master shakespeare he whispered good shakespeare whispered back get thee gone the tiremans helper went back the way hed come shakespeare crouched in the smoke under the stage fuming a little himself id best know how to frighten them with the ghost he thought if not i then who he had failed once or twice hed been bad or the audience had been bad or who could say what had gone wrong he didnt dwell on the failures every player had them in every role but hed made the most of the part far more often and so i shall again today he hadnt long to brood the ghost appeared again in the first scene and again vanished without a word then he appeared once more in the fourth scene of the first act he was once more silent but he beckoned to burbage as the astonished prince of denmark the fifth scene was his he had to vanish once more at the end of the fourth then come back up on stage through a trap door closer to the tiring room and he had his lines urging the prince to action against his murderous uncle shakespeare spoke them in a rumbling echoing voice that might indeed have come from beyond the grave gasps and a couple of muffled squeals told him his words and looks were striking home he remembered to use the gesture burbage had liked during the rehearsal the other player beamed shakespeare wasnt sure it really added anything but it pleased burbage and it didnt hurt adieu adieu adieu shakespeare said remember me he stretched the words out into something close to a wail then sank through the trap door by that time the space under the stage was so full of smoke it wasnt far from the sulphurous and tormenting flames to which the ghost said he must render himself up he had a few lines from below later in the scene and then an appearance in the third act where the prince could see him but his mother could not after that eyes stinging he retreated to the tiring room have a care with the robe master will do jack hungerford said here sit you down ill get it off you once the robe was safe he added well played ive rarely seen you better in the part for which i thank you shakespeare rubbed his streaming eyes swounds give me a bowl of water that i may wash away the smoke he coughed now he could without marring the play youll take off the chalk with water but not the black the tireman warned i have a cake of soap for that give it me but plain water first shakespeare was drying his face on a grimy towel when burbage took advantage of a scene where he wasnt on stage to go back and clasp his hand pointing to shakespeare he started to laugh with your paint half off and all besmeared your aspect is more fearful now than ever before the groundlings i believet shakespeare turned to the tireman wheres that soap master hungerford he washed again then dried himself once more better burbage said and the specter was as fine as youve ever given him he imitated the gesture hed urged shakespeare to use saw you how the audience clung to your every word thereafter you having drawn them into the action thus shakespeare had seen no such thing but he didnt feel like arguing things had gone well no matter why that would do they did seem pleased he said as they had reason to be and now i needs must dashim before em again in a moment burbage clapped shakespeare on the shoulder then hurried back toward the stage in his shirt and hose shakespeare watched the rest of the prince of denmark from the wings in his present mood a scene just past pleased him most the one where the prince admonished the players to speak trippingly and warned the clowns against making up their own lines he stood for every poet ever born after the play ended shakespeare came out in his own person to take his bows he used the gesture hed made while playing opposite the prince to show the audience who he was and richard burbage always generous waved to him and called out to the crowd behold the man whose play you saw that got him more applause he bowed deeply the groundlings streamed out of the theatre by their buzz they liked what theyd seen shakespeare retreated to the tiring room to don shoes and doublet and hat and talk things over with the company and with the players and poets and other folk who got past the glower of the tiremans burly helpers in came christopher marlowe a pipe of tobacco in his mouth as soon as shakespeare caught the first whiff of smoke he started to cough marry kit put it by i prithee he said i will not by god marlowe said and took another puff his eye swung to the beardless youth whod played ophelia and who was now getting back into the clothes proper to his sex all they who love not tobacco and boys are fools why holy communion would have been much better being administered in a tobacco pipe he reveled in scandal and blasphemy knowing as much shakespeare didnt react with the horror his fellow poet tried to rouse instead he said put it by or ill break it and that gladly having spent the whole of the first act beneath the stage im smoked and to spare smoked as a warwickshire sausage ah then you have reason for asking ill dot and marlowe did knocking the pipe against the sole of his shoe and grinding out the coals with his foot he gave shakespeare a mocking bow your servant sir gramercy shakespeare returned the bow as if he hadnt noticed the mockery nothing could be better calculated to annoy marlowe or so he thought especially when marlowe gave him a sharks smile and said damn you again will what for speaking you soft an i huff and fume willt like you better no no no marlowe made as if to push him away i know the difference twixt small and great de minibus non curat lex no damn you for your prince of denmark this time shakespeare bowed in earnest praise from the masters praise indeed in this play you are my master and since i fancy not being mastered i aim tovercome you there are grecian pots tis said with figures limned in contortions wild and with the painters brag writ above em aas thusandso my rival never did after first seeing the prince of denmark last year i set to work on yseult and tristan afore which i shall not write aas shakespeare never did but when you watch it you may take the thought as there and then my turn will come round again to see how i may outmatch you shakespeares early tragedies owed a good deal to marlowe whod led the theatre when shakespeare came to london from his provincial home since then marlowe had chased him more often than the reverse we do spur each other on we do marlowe agreed but you have in your flanks for now different spurs of one sort and another he gave shakespeare a sly look youre to make the spaniards a king philip i am shakespeare wasnt surprised marlowe had heard about that he didnt need to keep it secret as he did the other piece of course marlowe knew about that or something about that too shakespeare wished he didnt the other poet did not know how to keep his mouth shut marlowe proved as much now saying but will they see it or will the players strut the stage in other parts shakespeare had been pondering the same question he didnt care to discuss it with anyone else especially in the crowded tiring room and most especially have a care he hissed the spaniard comes would you have had him hear you prattle of boys and tobacco and communion danger is my meat and drink marlowe answered blithely and shakespeare feared that was true making a leg like a courtier the other poet gave lope de vega his most charming smile even shakespeare for whom it was not intended felt its force master lope marlowe exclaimed always a pleasure and an honor no nothe pleasure is mine de vega returned the bow he looked dapper and dangerous the rapier on his hip seeming a part of him i hear your comedy on the foolish woman was a great success marlowe said shakespeare had heard nothing of the sort the less he heard of the spaniards doings the happier he was marlowe went on tis pity i have not spanish enough to follow comfortably else i had come to see how you wrought lope de vega bowed again you are too kind by no means sir yes when marlowe chose he could charm the birds from the trees as can any serpent shakespeare thought uneasily the spaniard turned to him you will tell me at once master shakespeare is the prince of denmark mad or doth he but feign his affliction marlowes eyes gleamed i have asked myself that very question so would any man of sense on seeing the play but here we have a man of better sense for he asks not himself but the poet he is but mad northnorthwest shakespeare answered when the wind is southerly he knows a hawk from a handsaw fie on you de vega said as marlowe burst out laughing lope went on you give back the princes words not your own but good my sir if the princes words be not my own whose then are they shakespeare said his voice as innocent as he could make it certes i purpose the question being asked and i purpose each hearer to answer in himself for himself men seek god and seeking find himso saith the grecian poet marlowe observed whod have thought the like held for madness he and shakespeare could if they chose hash it out over pint after pint of bitter beer if lope de vega reckoned himself insulted or trifled with that was a more serious matter but the spaniard seemed willing to let it pass he changed the subject you are to write a play on the life of his most catholic majesty i hear i have been given that privilege yes shakespeare said privilege striking him as a better word than cross you are fortunate in your subject his majesty in his poet de vega saidhe made no mean courtier himself marlowes glance was half rueful half scornful lope continued it will please me very much to help you in your enterprise however i may truly sir you are too kind the last thing shakespeare wanted was lopes help but theres no need for no no lope waved his protest aside i insist he grinned disarmingly for by helping you i help myself to coming to the theatre whenever i please should you desire a veritable hombre de espaaa to play a spaniard nothing would like me better shakespeare wanted to shriek he couldnt tell de vega everything he wanted to or even a fraction of it but tacite will marlowe said quickly in latin that meant be quiet in english it would have been good advice even in latin it was good advice but was it also something more was it an allusion to tacitus and to the annals how much did marlowe know how much did he want to show that he knew and how much did lope know and how much was marlowe liable to reveal to him for no more reason than that he could not take the good advice he so casually gave one of lieutenant de vegas eyebrows rose in slow latin of his own he asked and why should magister guglielmus keep silent i pray you damn you kit shakespeare thought but marlowe a university man as fluent in latin as in english kept right on in the ancient tongue why to keep from offering you the role of philip himself of course i doubt his company would stand for it and i am certain master burbages fury at being balked of the heros role would know no bounds he talked himself out of trouble almost as readily as he talked himself into it richard burbage had little latin but he did have the players ability to hear his name mentioned at a remarkable distance he came up to marlowe and asked what said you of me sir by the way he leaned forward and set his right hand on his belt near his sword he would make marlowe regret it if the answer were not to his liking but marlowe spoke in english as he had in latin i said you would mislike it did lieutenant de vega here take the part of king philip in the play will is to write he hath graciously offered to attempt some role in the drama but that meseems were a part too great just for a heartbeat burbages eyes flashed to shakespeare the poet gave back a bland blank face he knew he couldnt trust the spaniard and didnt know he could trust christopher marlowe if marlowe had hoped to learn more than he already knew from the actor he got little for burbage laughed slapped him on the back and said why kit no man can have a part too greatthus say the ladies any road shakespeares laugh was relieved marlowes somewhat forcedhe had scant interest in or experience of what the ladies said in such matters lope de vega scratched his head tis a jest he said i knowt must be but i apprehend it not after shakespeare explained it de vega laughed too and bowed to burbage you have a wit of your own sir and not just with anothers words in your mouth will kemp reckons otherwise shakespeare thought burbage bowed back to the spaniard you are too kind sir he purred meaning nothing else but im more clever than either of these two and if i but wrote he had a players vanity too in full measure it sometimes irked shakespeare today he gladly forgave it he would have forgiven anything that put the spaniard off the scent but how dear god am i to write lord burghleys play with de vega ever sniffing about and even if thou shouldst work a miracle for that i may write it how can we rehearse it how can we offer it forth he waited hopefully as hed feared though god gave no answers lope de vega couldnt have screamed louder or more painfully as a betrayed lover he knew that for a fact hed screamed such screams before this however but sir you promised me he cried i am sorry lieutenant said captain guzman who sounded not sorry in the least i warned that in an emergency i would shift your duty here we have an emergency and so i shall shift you a likely story lope was convinced his superior intended to drive him mad guzman knew how to make his intentions real too what kind of emergency a soothsayer prophesying against spain and against king philip guzman answered oh lope said in crestfallen tones unfortunately that was an emergency soothsayers and witches and what the english called cunning men caused no end of trouble but then he had a brighter more hopeful thought could not the holy inquisitors deal with this false prophet surely such a rogue breaks gods law before he breaks mans baltasar guzman shook his head they call it treason first and blasphemy only afterwards they have washed their hands of the fellow as pilate did with our lord de vega said bitterly senior lieutenant guzman drummed his fingers on the desk senior lieutenant i bear you no ill will you should thank god and the virgin and the saints that i bear you no ill will were it otherwise the inquisition would hear of that remark and then in short order you would hear from the inquisition you have your pen and some freedom in how you use it you would be wise to guard your tongue he was right that hurt worse than anything else i thank you your excellency lope mumbled hating to have to thank the man at whom he was furious he sighed well if theres no help for it id best get the business over with as fast as i can who is this soothsayer and where can i find him he is called john walsh captain guzman made heavy going of the english surname he dwells inthe officer checked his notesin the ward called billingsgate in pudding lane he is by trade a butcher of hogs but he is to be found more often in a tavern than anywhere else may i find him in a tavern lope exclaimed i know pudding lane too well and know its stinks they make so much offal there it goes in dung boats down to the thames wherever you find him seize him and clap him in gaol well try him and put him to death and be rid of him once for all guzman said as de vega turned to go his superior held up a hand wait dont hunt this ah walsh yourself take a squad of soldiers better take two when you catch him the englishmen he has fooled are liable to try a rescue you will want swords and pikes and guns at your back very well sir de vega wasnt sure whether it was very well or not alone he might slip in and get away with john walsh with no one else the wiser with a couple of squads at his back he had no hope of that but captain guzman had a point if he went after walsh by himself and got into trouble he wouldnt come out of billingsgate ward again how had shakespeare put it in alcibiades the better part of valor is discretionthat was the line that had stuck in lopes memory he had no trouble getting soldiers to come with him when he told the men eating in the refectory what his mission was they clamored to come along by st james sir one of them said crossing himself the sooner we get rid of troublemakers like that the better they stir the englishmen up against us and that gives us no end of grief lets go then lope said some of the spaniards paused to gulp down wine or beer or stuff a last bite or two into their mouths but for no more than that they buckled on swords picked up spears and arquebuses and backandbreasts set highcrowned morions on their heads and followed de vega south and east from the barracks towards noisome pudding lane london had been occupied long enough and grown peaceful enough to make a couple of dozen spaniards tramping through the streetsobviously on some business not merely patrollingsomething less than ordinary ware ware the cry rang out again and again so much for surprise lope thought from farther away he heard another cry clubs that was the shout london apprentices raised when they went into a brawl before long a pack of themsome armed with clubs others carrying daggers or stonescame up the street towards the men he led give way he shouted in english give way or you will be sorry for it he nodded to his own men they were better armed than the apprentices and armored to boot they also looked eager to take on the youngsters whod come up against them the prentices stopped wavered broke one of the soldiers laughed they havent got the cojones to stand up to real men he said we beat them when we first got ashore and we can beat them again if we have to thats right another soldier said but then he added id sooner not fight so long as we can hold em down without it that perfectly summed up lopes view of things he had wondered if his nose could guide him to pudding lane but london was a city of such multifarious stinks he had to ask his way he had to ask his way twice in fact the first englishman who gave him directions told him a lie and got him lost no they dont all love us he thought but he made a better choice with the second man he asked the fellow was sleek and prosperous with fur trim on his doublet he made a leg at lope and fawned on him like a dog hoping to be patted ay good my lord certes tis no small honor to enjoy the privilege of directing you thither he pointed south do you go to the church of st george in botolph lane and then one street the further and you have it god grant you catch whatever villain you seek too god grant it indeed lope crossed himself and was not surprised to see the englishman follow his lead folk who had clung to the roman faith before the armada came were likeliest to uphold the new queen and kingand the spaniards who kept them on their throne this man said we have seen too much of wars and strife let there be peace of whatever kind amen lope replied privately he thought that a cravens counsel but it worked to keep the kingdom quiet he would have had all the english so craven after more bows and a ceremonious leavetaking lope translated for his men what the sleek fellow had said lets find the church lets find the street lets find the son of a whore were after and then by god lets find something to drink one of them said several others nodded approval so did lope we may find this walsh and something to drink together he said for i hear he prophesies in taverns the soldier whod spoken before guffawed and after hes drunk enough hes one of these pissprophets he said which got a laugh from everyone else plenty of people made a living divining the futureor saying they didby examining their clients urine someone emptied a chamber pot from a secondstory window no way to be sure if the stinking contents were aimed at the spaniards a couple of menincluding the fellow whod made the jokegot splashed but most of the stuff just went into the mud of the street which already held more than its fair share of ordure and piss eh sancho now youre a pissprophet one of the other troopers said sanchos reply was almost as pungent as the air pudding lane was only a couple of blocks long but made up in stench what it lacked in length de vega marveled that he hadnt found it by scent along with all the usual london miasmas he smelled pig shit pig piss rotting swines flesh pig fear any man from this street must be a false prophet he said for not even god himself could stand getting close enough to him to tell him anything he started asking after john walsh i dont ken the man one hog butcher said never heard of him said a second an he be who i think he is he died o the french pox summer afore last a third said a went home to wales a did whence a came a fourth offered seek him in southwark he dwelleth there these days with a punk from a pickhatch a fifth declared patiently lope kept asking sooner or later he was bound to come on someone who either favored isabella and albert or simply craved peace and quiet and he did a lean man in a pigskin apron looked up from his work and said belike youll find him in the blue fox half a block toward the tower in east cheap again lope translated for his men a good thing we have you with us seaor irrepressible sancho said if we had to look for interpreters everything would take three times as long and like as not theyd tell us more lies than truth de vega wasnt sure the lean man hadnt told a lie but the tavern to his relief did prove easy to find a signboard with the silhouette of a running fox bright blue hung above the door you men stay here in the street lope said ill go in alone if god is kind ill hear the man speaking treason from his own lips then ill signal for you if nothe shruggedagain its gods will honor to your courage lieutenant a soldier said this for courage lope snapped his fingers i want to deal with this fellow as quickly as may be for i have business of my own to attend to some of the men winked and sniggered and made lewd jokes he only half heard thanks to his reputation they thought he meant business with a woman or with more than one but is not the muse a woman too he thought he sat down at a table near the door in the blue fox ale he said when a barmaid came up to him it was a word he could pronounce without revealing himself as a foreigner he set a penny on the table the woman snatched it up and came back with a mug of nasty sour stuff he wished hed taken a chance and asked for wine but he didnt have to drink much he nursed the mug and looked around he also wished someone had described john walsh to him the place was full of englishmen most of themby their talk and by the smellpig butchers was walsh here could he ask without giving himself away if that fellow in the pigskin apron had steered him away from the wanted man and not toward him ill make him sorry if he did ill make him worse than sorry hear me friends a squat homely pockmarked man said and the folk in the tavern did hear him something close to silence fell lope pretended to drink ale as the pockmarked manwho also had on a pigskin apron over his jerkin and hoseclambered up onto a table and went on you know god hath it in his mind for us to be free o the spaniard for doth he not say when you therefore shall see the abomination of the desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand and understand we not all too well who is the aforesaid abomination of the desolation and stand not his minions on the holy soil of england thats right john someone called tell us more someone else added right gladly will i said the pig butcher who had to be john walsh again in the selfsame book of matthew saith not the lord athen they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another saith he not that very thing and are we not afflicted yea sore afflicted and slain and betray we not one another and hate we not likewise one another but hark ye to what he saith next hark ye now aand because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved he switched from matthew to revelations but lope had heard enough setting down his mug he ducked out of the blue fox and beckoned to the soldiers with them behind him he stormed back into the tavern and shouted out a verse from matthew that john walsh had skipped and many false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many then he switched to spanish shouting arrest that man there on the table santiago and forward santiago the soldiers roared they rushed toward the preaching pig butcher limb of satan an englishman cried he hurled his mug at lope who ducked the mug shattered on the morion of the man behind him another flying mug hit a spaniard in the face he fell with a groan his nose smashed and bloody a moment later a spanish sword bit into the pig butcher whod thrown the mug that hurt the soldier the englishman shrieked more blood spurted improbably red let it begin here as st john the divine saith it shall begin at the end of days john walsh bellowed the star called wormwood and the smiting of the sun ay let it begin here wormwood the englishmen yelled lope wondered if they knew what the word meant not likely he judged but it made a fine rallying cry even so as for him he shouted we must take the false preacher now or london goes up in riot it had happened before though not for four or five years if it happened again the blame would land on him where would they send him then the scottish border the welsh mountains ireland which was supposed to be worse than either was any place worse than ireland if any was theyd send him there an arquebus bellowed deafeningly loud in the close tavern the lead ball buried itself in the wall after that the firearm was good for nothing but a clumsy club in a tavern brawl bludgeons and knives and swords counted for more than guns de vega wished for a firearm that shot more than one ball or at least for one that could be reloaded quickly wishing didnt help the spaniards armor did so did the extra distance at which they could do harm thanks to their swords but then an englishman an enormous fellow picked up a bench and swung it like a club the weapon was clumsy but potent the englishman felled two soldiers in quick succession another swing almost caved in lopes skull but he ducked stepped close and stabbed the big man in the stomach with his rapier the bench fell from the mans hands as he wailed and clutched at himself come on lope shouted only a small knot of stubborn defenders still protected john walsh lets away out the back door one of them said de vega cursed in sonorous spanish he hadnt known the blue fox had a back door he hurled himself at the englishmen doing his best to forestall their escape a couple of them tried to hustle walsh toward the back of the tavern they might have pulled him to safety but he didnt seem to want to go nay nay he cried struggling in their grasp as if they were arresting him let it begin here it must begin here sancho tackled him when he went down half a dozen spaniards leaped on him while the rest drove back or knocked down the englishmen still on their feet is he still alive lope asked yes senior lieutenant hell live to hang one of his troopers answered after this i think hangings too good for him lope said but tie him up and gag him gag him well by god or the filth he shouts out will bring the english down on us before we can get him to safety even as things were stones flew when they emerged from the blue fox but another arquebusier brought his match to the touchhole of his weapon it roared and belched forth a great cloud of pungent smoke and the ball as much by luck as anything else knocked an englishman kicking the others drew back naive enough to believe the spaniards likely to hit twice in a row knowing better than they what arquebuses could do lope silently thanked them for their caution back at the spanish barracks captain guzman asked you have the prisoner yes your excellency lope replied guzman ignored his draggled state and the wounds his men had taken hed given the right answer muy bien lieutenant guzman said you may now return to the theatre weariness fell from lope guzman had given the right answer too sam king stepped on william shakespeares foot ow shakespeare yelped the young man still wore muddy boots a little more calmly the poet added ware wheat master king ware wheat i pray pardon sir king said im yet unused to the confines of this room he spoke with a broad midlands accent shakespeare had sounded much the same when he first came to london but wanting to take the stage had had to learn in a hurry to sound like a londoner born by god youre used to the confines of my toe and to flatten it to flatter your fancy shakespeare grumbled but then he sighed i own theres no help fort and had the widow kendall taken in another lodger male in place of this cicely sellis hed trample me in your place ay belike sam king said tis monstrous strange mistress cicely should hire a whole room to herself of the old hag tis monstrous dear too his belly rumbled marry but im hungry he muttered more to himself than to shakespeare whatever he did in the citysome of this and a little of that shakespeare gatheredit got him little money his face had a pinched pale look and his clothes hung loosely on him the take at the theatre had been good as christmas neared people wanted to be gay shakespeare had gold not only from lord burghley but from the spaniards as well he took out three pennies and handed them to sam king here get yourself to an ordinary and eat your fill tonight to his amazement king began to blubber god bless you sir oh god bless you he said i tread on you and then you give me good for evil as our lord says a man ought to do his scrawny fingers closed over the coins ill pay you back sir marry i will ant please you an you can without pinching shakespeare said an it be otherwise he shrugged threepence meant less to him than to sam king the skinny young man blew his nose on the fingers of the hand that wasnt holding the money wiped them on his shabby doublet and hurried out of the lodging house shakespeare got out his writing tools and took them to the ordinary he favored he was relieved not to find his fellow lodger there king would have insisted on chattering at him when he wanted to work loves labours won was almost done he needed to finish it as fast as he could too for one thing the companys patience was wearing thin for another he didnt know how long he had till philip of spain died he would need to have both his special commissions ready by then whichever one actually saw the light of day kate the serving woman came up to him god give you good even master will she said the threepenny is barley porridge with boiled beef he nodded she went on theres lambswool if youd liefer have it than the common brewing i would and i thank you fort shakespeare answered on a chilly december evening warm spiced beer would go down well maybe the lambswool helped his thoughts flow freely whatever the cause he sat and wrote till he was the last man left in the ordinary only when his candle flame began to leap and gutter as the candle neared extinction did he reluctantly pick up his papers and quills and ink and go back to the lodging house its long past curfew master shakespeare jane kendall said severely when he came in i was afeard for you here i am shakespeare didnt want to talk to her he threw a pine log on the hearth before long it flared up hot and bright the widow kendall sent him a reproachful stare he never noticed it he sat down at the table in front of the fire to write a little more while the log gave such fine light his landlady threw her hands in the air and stalked off to bed he hardly noticed her go it was one of those magical evenings where nothing stood between his mind and the sheet of paper in front of him hed been writing for some timehow long by the clock he couldnt have said but twentyfive or thirty lines worth with scarcely a blotted wordbefore realizing he wasnt alone in the room the new lodger cicely sellis stood in the doorway watching him work give you good den she said when he looked up i misliked troubling you your pen scratching along so fast i do thank you for the courtesy shakespeare answered there are thosetoo many of em toowill break into a writing mans thoughts for no more reason than to see him stop and scuff the ground wondering what he meant next to say some folk able themselves to shape naught of beauty are fain to mar anothers work for that they may not find themselves outdone an youd back tot make as though i am not here youll offend me not cicely sellis was five or ten years older than shakespeare shed probably been a striking woman till smallpox scarred her face beneath the flawed skin her bones were very fine she wore no ring shakespeare didnt know whether she was spinster or widow again my thanks he said when he stretched something crunched in his back it felt good he twisted hoping he could get more relief he noticed his hand was cramped and wondered how long hed been writing all told i can pause here i have the way now and shall not wander from it when i resume right glad i am to hear you say so a gray tabby wandered in after cicely sellis it stropped itself against her ankles she bent and scratched it behind the ears it began to buzz it wasnt a big cat but purred very loudly there mommet there she murmured when she looked up again she asked youll soon have finished the play master shakespeare god willing yes he answered i hope to seet she told him ive seen some others of yours and they liked me well can i get free ill pay my penny again no poet can hope for higher praise he said which won a smile from her he went on have you a hard master then one who keeps you at it every minute she nodded and pointed to her chest i do sir the hardest mine own self she stroked the cat again it purred even louder its eyes were green so were hers she studied him if you would have questions answered haply i could help you ah hed wondered what she did no wonder shed wanted a room all to herself you are a cunning woman then he wouldnt say witch even if they amounted to the same thing and cicely sellis sensibly wouldnt answer straight out marry master shakespeare in this world of men a woman needs must be cunning mustnt she if shes to make her way now i hear something now i say something and the world turns round she nodded almost defiantly as if to say make of that what you will shakespeare didnt know what to make of it in london as elsewhere in england elsewhere all through christendom witches or people claiming to be witches were a fact of life they did at least as much good for the sick as fancy physicians as far as he could tell did they take their power from satan people said they did now here before him stood one of the breed he could ask her himself if he had the nerve he didnt i am content with my lot he said if she were truly a witch she would see he was lying he couldnt tell whether she did or not she gave him half a curtsy her eyes glinted as the cat mommets might have done no small thing have you said there nor no common thing neither she replied at last the richest man in the world be he never so healthy be he wed to a young and beautiful wife who loveth him past all reason hath he contentment not likely he will hunger for more gold or for more strength of body or for some other wench besides the one he hath or for all those things together ist not so master shakespeare before god mistress sellis i think you speak sooth shakespeare answered she stroked mommet again he was an uncommonly goodnatured cat as soon as she touched him his purr boomed out filling the room she said i have once or twice before been styled soothsayer i do not say i am such mind but i have been so styled shakespeare nodded i believe it if it be so belike you make a good one he intended no flattery but meant every word what shed said about a rich mans restless desire for more showed she could see a long way into the human heart that had to be as important for a soothsayer as for a poet crafting plays she studied him again he had rarely known such a measuring glance from a womanor indeed from a man marlowes gaze came close but it always held an undercurrent of mockery absent from her expression her eyes did shine like a cats he wondered what trick of witchcraft made them do that of nights a cats eyes or a dogs gave back torchlight a mans eyes or a womans did not but cicely sellis did mommet suddenly stopped purring his fur puffed out till he looked twice his proper size he hissed like a snake a freezing draught blew under the door making the hair on shakespeares arms prickle up too and sending a swarm of bright sparks up the chimney as the flames flared in a deep slow voice not quite her own cicely sellis said beware the man who brings good news and he who knows less than he seems what shakespeare said the one word might have broken the spell if spell there was the cats fur smoothed down on his back he sprawled on his side licked his belly and privates and began to purr once more the fire eased and the cunning woman her eyes merely human eyes again frowned a little and asked said you somewhat to me i did shakespeare went on to repeat as best he could what shed told him her frown deepened i said that she asked on my oath mistress sellis you did shakespeare crossed himself to show he meant it witches were supposed to fear the sign of the cross cicely sellis showed no such fear she only shrugged her shoulders and laughed a nervoussounding laugh i will believe you sir for that you have no cause to lie to me thus but as for the words she shook her head i recollect em not no shakespeare pressed it a little cicely sellis shook her head again and pressed a hand to one temple as if she knew pain there being a player himself shakespeare knew acting as best he could judge the cunning woman was sincere in her denial bemused he tugged at his little chin beard tis passing strange that so it is mistress sellis rubbed the side of her head once more she yawned your pardon but im fordone mommet come the cat followed her into the room shed hired from widow kendall as obediently as if it were a dog was it a cat or was it the cunning womansthe witchsfamiliar spirit shakespeare had trouble imagining a familiar spirit a demon surely reeking of brimstone purring with such content as it lay on the floor but then what know you of demons the poet asked himself as little as may be and wish it were less he tried to write a bit more that bothered him less than it would have the day before he yawned too he could go to bed with a clear conscience now he knew where loves labours won was going and knew he would finish it in a day or two then on to king philip and to the other play his bedroom was dark when he went in jack streets snores made the chamber hideous shakespeare knew he himself would have no trouble sleeping despite the racket hed had time to get used to it howindeed whethersam king could manage was a different question shakespeare didnt bother with a candle when he stowed his writing tools in the chest by his bed hed dealt with the lock so often in darkness he might almost have been a blind craftsman whose fingers saw as well as most mens eyes the click of the key in the lock made street the snoring glazier mumble and turn over though how he heard that click through his own thunderstorm was beyond shakespeare the poet sighedquietlyand yawned again as he slipped the bottle of ink back into the chest his fingers brushed a new and hence unfamiliar bulk the translation of the annals hed picked up in front of st pauls sdeath he whispered a curse that was at the same time at least half a prayer the translation itself was innocent but if anyone thought to search for it his death was likely whether it were found or not that would mean lord burghleys plot was betrayed he shut the chest locked it and pulled off his boots the wooden bed frame and its leather straps creaked as he lay down and burrowed under the covers despite yet another yawn sleep would not come his mind spun faster than the spinning hand of a clock how can burghleys plan hope to escape betrayal theres surely far more tot than one poor poet and a play that may never been seen can he do so much with so many under the spaniards very noses without their suspecting tis false we english breed no traitors would twere true but these past nine years have proved otherwise what did burghley purpose shakespeare shook his head ignorance here is bliss what i know not no spaniard can rip from me he wished he didnt know it was tied to word of philips death but the english nobleman had had to tell him that he needed some notion of how long he had to write the play and to train the actors of his company to perform it that thought made him shake his head he still didnt know whether all of lord westmorlands men would appear in a play that if lord burghleys rising failed could only be judged treason if he sounded a player and the man refused what could he do could he do anything would not the very act of doing something make a disaffected player more likely to go to the spaniards or to the lickspittle english who followed isabella and albert questions questions when questions come they come not single spies but in battalions all the questions were out in the open answers skulked and hid and would not show themselves either by light of day or in these miserable useless pointless nighttime reflections shakespeare shook his head again his bed let out another creak jack street grunted shifted and for a wonder stopped snoring in the third bed in the room sam king sighed softly had he been awake all this while poor devil shakespeare wouldnt have been surprised streets cacophony took getting used to after some more squirming shakespeare felt sleep at last draw near but then he thought of his curious meeting with cicely sellis and rest retreated once more she was a cunning woman indeed whoever called on her would get his moneys worth however much he paid she was probably even cunning enough to keep from falling foul of the church which took thou shalt not suffer a witch to live ever more seriously these days what had she meant when her voice changed there for a little while some sort of warning without a doubt but did it come from her alone from god or from satan shakespeare ground his teeth how could he know come to that did cicely sellis herself know one more yawn and sleep finally overmastered him he woke in darkness the next morning with the winter solstice at hand the sun wouldnt rise till after eight of the clock and would set before four in the afternoon in the kitchen porridge bubbled above the fire shakespeare filled a bowl with it it was bland and uninteresting barley and peas boiled to mush together with hardly even any salt to add savor he didnt care it filled the empty place in his belly for a while most of the lodgers were already gone before shakespeare rose regardless of whether it was light or dark they had their trades to follow cicely sellis by contrast came into the kitchen just as the poet was finishing the cunning woman nodded but said nothing she too had her own trade to follow but could follow it here at the lodging house by the way widow kendall beamed at her she was paying a pretty penny for that room of hers enough to make the widow raise the scot for the rest of us shakespeare wondered worriedly he doubted he could stand even one more vexation on top of so many when he went out into the street he found he would have no accurate notion of when the sun came up anyhow cold clammy fog clung everywhere it likely wouldnt lift till noon if then shakespeare sucked in a long damp breath when he exhaled he added fog of his own to that which had drifted up to bishopsgate from the thames he should have gone straight to the theatre he might have found some quiet time to write before the rest of the company came in and began rehearsing for the days play instead though he wandered south and east away from the suburbs beyond the wall and down towards the river he didnt knowor rather didnt care to admit to himselfwhere he was going till he got there by the time he neared the lowland by the thames the fog hung a little above the ground but even the thickest fog would have had a hard time concealing the tower of london its formidable gray stone wall and towers shouldered their way into the air people said julius caesar had first raised the tower shakespeare didnt know whether that was true or not though hed used the conceit in a couple of plays the tower surely seemed strong and indomitable enough to have stood since roman days however strong it seemed it hadnt kept the spaniards out of london and now somewhere in there queen elizabeth sat and brooded and waited fordeliverance can i help to give it her or give i but myself to death v after christmas mass lope de vega and baltasar guzman happened to come out of the church of st swithin together lope bowed to his superior feliz navidad your excellency he said guzman polite as a cat returned the bow and a happy christmas to you as well senior lieutenant he replied i have a duty for you de vega wished hed ignored courtesy on the holy day he asked dismayed yes on the holy day captain guzman nodded i am sorry but it is necessary and necessary that you do it today he didnt sound sorry he never sounded sorry he was stubborn as a cat too he went on i want you to take yourself to the church of st ethelbergeanother english name he massacredand ask the priest there if this poet friend of yours this shakespeare has come to partake of our lords body and blood on the anniversary of his birth ah however much lope wished otherwise captain guzman was right here as he had been with going after john walshthis was a necessary duty i shall attend to it directly and if he has not if he has not make note of it but do no more now guzman replied then we watch him closely ten days from now if he celebrates christmas by the old calendar the forbidden calendar we shall know him for a protestant heretic yes sir lope sighed heretic or not we surely know him for a splendid poet and if his splendid poetry serves satan and the foes of spain isnt he all the more dangerous for being splendid guzman said and he was right about that too again lope wished otherwise again he sighed but because captain guzman was right de vega asked how do i find this church of st ethelberge he had almost as much trouble with the name as his superior had done and added where do the english find such people to canonize swithin here ethelberge there and i hear there is also a st erkenwald in this kingdom truly i wonder if rome has ever heard of these socalled saints i have plenty of worries but not that one baltasar guzman said if the inquisition and the society of jesus found these saints were fraudulent the churches dedicated to their memories would not stay open hes right yet again lope thought surprised and a little resentful three times in a row all of a christmas morning hed better be careful if he keeps that up i may have to start taking him seriously he wouldnt like that and i wouldnt either since guzman hadnt answered him the first time he tried again how do i find st ethelberges church captain its shakespeares parish church shakespeare lives in bishopsgate go to bishopsgate you know the way there guzman waited for lope to respond he had to nod for he did know the way to and through that district it led out of london proper to the theatre all right then the captain told him go to bishopsgate if you find the church yourself fine if you dont ask someone who wouldnt tell a man how to get to a church on christmas morning he was of course right yet again i go lope said and hurried off toward bishopsgate as much to escape captain guzman and his alarmingly sharp wits as to find out whether shakespeare had been to mass even though the day was gloomy londons houses and public buildings made a brave show being decorated with wreaths and strands of holly and ivy now and then wound up with broom many of the ornaments had candles burning in them too in the first couple of years after the coming of the armada such signs of the season had been rare elizabeth and her heretic advisors discouraged them as theyd discouraged so many observances from the ritual year but with the return of catholicism the customs that had flourished before henry viii broke with rome were also coming back to life many doors stood open the rich odors of cookery wafting out warring with those of garbage and sewage from advent the fourth sunday before the nativity to christmas eve people restricted their diets on christmas eve itself meat cheese and eggs were all forbidden but christmas christmas was a day of release and also of sharing only skinflints closed their doors against visitors on christmas day a man in what looked like a beggars rags with a roast goose leg in one hand and a mug of wine in the other came up the street toward lope by the way he wobbled as he walked hed already downed several mugs but he gave lope an extravagant bow all the same god bless you on the day sir he said and you sir de vega replied returning the bow as if to an equal on christmas as on easter were not all men equal in christ lope did have to ask after st ethelberges church but people indeed proved eager to help him find it he got there just when a mass was ending and he got his answer without having to ask the priest for with his own eyes he saw shakespeare coming out of the church in a slashed doublet of black and crimson as fancy as anything christopher marlowe might wear lope thought about waving and calling out a greeting he thought about it for a heartbeat and then thought better of it he ducked around a corner instead before shakespeare spotted him what excuse could he offer for being in bishopsgate on christmas morning save that he was spying on the english poet none and he knew it he got back to the barracks in the center of town without asking anyone for directions that left him proud of himself he was strutting as he made his way to captain guzmans office and hed been right and guzman for once wrong that added to the strut he looked forward to rubbing his superiors nose in it whatever he looked for he didnt get it when he opened the door guzman wasnt there his servant enrique sat behind his desk frowning in concentration over a quarto edition of one of marlowes plays he read english better than he spoke it though still none too well he didnt notice the door opening lope had to cough oh enrique said in surprise blinking behind his spectacles good day senior lieutenant good day lope replied politely wheres your principal he was bidden to a feast sir guzmans servant replied he left me behind here to take your report did the priest at this church with the name no sane man could pronounce see senor shakespeare at mass today what do you do if i tell you no de vega asked trying not to show how angry he was guzman could send him off to bishopsgate on christmas morning but did the noble stay around to hear what hed found not likely he went off to have a good time and if id been here maybe someone would have invited me to this feast too i bring his excellency the news of course enrique said after that i suppose he sends out an order for shakespeares arrest do i need to go to him no lope shook his head then jabbed his chest with his thumb i myself saw shakespeare leaving the church of st ethelbergehe could pronounce it better than most spaniards anyway and didnt miss a chance to show offnot an hour ago so theres no need to disturb captain guzman at his revels im glad enrique said de vega wondered how he meant that glad he didnt have to go looking for guzman but then the servant went on from everything i can tell the englishman is too fine a poet for me to want him to burn in hell for opposing the true and holy catholic faith tienes razan enrique lope said i had the same thought myself and if enrique agrees with me he must be right do you have any other business with my master lieutenant the servant asked yes but not the sort you meanthis shabby treatment hes shown me comes close to touching my honor lope thought but he wouldnt tell that to guzmans lackey he would either take it up with the officer himself or more likely decide it wasnt a deliberate insult and stop worrying about it all he said to enrique was a happy christmas to you and to you senor as lope turned to go enrique picked up the play once more he read aloud o lente lente currite noctis equi the stars move still time runs the clock will strike the devil will come and faustus must be damned o ill leap up to my god who pulls me down this is very fine poetry i think and i de vega agreed even if he borrowed the slowly running horses of the night from ovid well yes of course said enrique who despite being a servant somewhere had acquired a formidable education but he uses the line in a way that makes it his own he doesnt just trot it out to show how learned he is a point lope said marlowe is a very clever manand if you dont believe me ask him guzmans servant grinned meaning no offense to you senor but conceit is a vice not unknown amongst poets i have no idea what youre talking about enrique de vega replied deadpan they both laughed lope closed the door behind him and headed for his own quarters he expected to discover diego there snoring up a storm christmas was a holy day too holy for almost all work not that diego felt like working on the most ordinary day of the year either but the servants bed was empty lope crossed himself truly this is a day of miracles he murmured in his own little inner room he found paper and pen and ink he opened the shutters to take such advantage of englands fleeting december daylight as he could and began to write maybe christmas was too holy for that too de vega had no intention of asking a priests opinion about it a ragged man on a street corner thrust a bowl of spiced wine at a pretty woman walking by wassail he called she looked him over smiled and nodded at him drinkhail she replied he handed her the bowl and kissed her on the cheek she drank then gave him back the bowl a happy new year to you sweetheart the ragged man called after her as she went on her way he sang in a surprisingly sweet surprisingly true baritone wassail wassail as white as my name wassail wassail in snow frost and hail wassail wassail that much doth avail wassail wassail that never will fail william shakespeare tossed the fellow a penny a happy new year to you as well sirrah the ragged man doffed his cap god bless you on the day sir he held the bowl out to shakespeare wassail drinkhail shakespeare replied and drank returning the bowl he added id as lief go without the kiss some grecian he couldnt remember who had said the like to alexander and paid for it marlowe would know the name with a chuckle the ragged man said and id as lief not give it you but by my troth sir full many a fair lady have i bussed and thanks to the wassail bowl i owe he lifted the cap from his head again give you joy of the coming year and you shakespeare walked past him a couple of blocks farther on another man used a wassail bowl to gather coins and kisses shakespeare gave him a penny too he got in return a different song one he hadnt heard before and did his best to remember it bits of it might show up in a play years from now all along the crowded street men and women wished one another happy new year theyd done that even back before the coming of the armada for the roman tradition of beginning the year in wintertime had lingered even though before the spaniards came it had formally started on march as with the calendar isabella and albert had changed that to conform to spanish practice people called the short year for it had begun on march and ended on december snow crunched under shakespeares shoes soot and dirt streaked it back in stratford snow stayed white some little while after it fell not here stratford was a little market town he would have been surprised had it held two thousand souls london had at least a hundred times as many and more than a hundred times as many fires belching smoke into the sky to smirch the snow sometimes even before it fell a snowball whizzed past his head from behind he whirled the urchin whod thrown it stuck out his tongue and scurried away with a shrug shakespeare went on walking hed thrown snowballs when he was a boy too and my aim was better he thought though that might have been the mans view of the boy hed been he strode past a cutlers shop then stopped turned and went back the widow kendall had broken the wooden handle on her best carving knife not so long before and had complained about it ever since she kept talking about taking the knife to a tinker for a new handle but she hadnt done it like as not she never would get around to doing it but would grumble about what a fine knife it had been for the rest of her days a replacement now a replacement would make her a fine new years present good morrow sir and a joyous new year to you the cutler said when shakespeare stepped inside what seek you an it have an edge youll find it here shakespeare explained what he wanted and why the cutler nodded i have the very thing he offered shakespeare a knife of about the same size as the one jane kendall had used certes tis a knife shakespeare tried the edge with his thumb it now seems sharp enough but willt stay so the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge the cutler replied but it hath a better blade than most and will serve for all ordinary work and surely she for whom you buyt hath a whetstone surely shakespeare had no idea whether jane kendall owned a whetstone he supposed she must how could she keep a kitchen in good order without one setting the knife down on the counter he asked the next important question whats your price when the cutler told him he flinched so much half that were robbery let alone the whole oft tis for a tallowchandlers widow not silver clad in parcel gilt for the kitchen of a duke they haggled amiably enough not for all his poets eloquence could shakespeare beat the cutler down very far at last still muttering under his breath he paid the cutler did give him a leather sheath for the knife the better your widow cares fort the better twill serve her dirt and wet breed rust as filth breeds maggots i understand shakespeare didnt intend to lecture his landlady on housewifery what the widow kendall would say to him if he showed such cheek did not bear thinking about he took the knife back to his lodgings on the way there he slipped a halfpenny into the sheath giving the widow kendall the knife without the propitiatory coin would have been inviting her to cut herself with it oh god bless you master will she exclaimed when he handed her the knife she gave him a muscular hug and stood on tiptoe to kiss him on the cheek that was another kiss he could have done without her breath stank with eating toasted cheese he did his best to smile as she said ive thought me of getting a new one since that handle broke but she shrugged but youd sooner have done without or gone on with the old marred one than have fared forth yourself to a tinkers or a cutlers he thought may you have good use of it he said im sure i shall she said come take a mug of ale ant please you that mug was the only new years gift he had from her since hed expected nothing more he wasnt disappointed but christopher marlowe came by the house later that day and gave him a copy of tacitus annalsin the original latin i dare hope you may find it inspiring the other poet murmured as was marlowes habit hed spent lavishly the book was bound in maroon leather and stamped with gold shakespeare wanted to hit him over the head with it with any luck it would smash in his skull how much did marlowe know how much did he want shakespeare to think he knew how badly did he want to drive shakespeare to distraction that more than the other two together shakespeare judged showing marlowe hed drawn blood only encouraged him to try to draw more with a smile shakespeare answered im sure i shall the treason trials under tiberius perchance ever so slightly he stressed the word treason marlowe bared his teeth in something that looked like a smile treason what word is that and in what tongue tartar i know it not perdie kit may that be so shakespeare said may the day come when that tartar words clean forgot in england laughing marlowe patted him on the cheek as an indulgent father might pat a son our lines will fail or ever that words routed from our he drew back sudden concern on his face will whats amiss you will find a better time to speak of failing lines than when my only sons but a little more than a year ins grave shakespeare said tightly his fists bunched he took a step towards the other poet whom he saw for a moment through a veil of unshed tears marlowe backed away pardon my witlessness i pray you he said i willone day shakespeare answered angry still marlowe left the lodging house moments later shakespeare wasnt sorry to see him go not only because of what hed said but also because he wouldnt linger to make more gibes about tacitus and treason that might stick in someones mind though it was snowing hard on sunday shakespeare made a point of going to mass at the church of st ethelberge the virgin it was by pope gregorys calendar the fourth of januaryby englands old reckoning december twentyfifth he wanted to be sure he was seen at catholic services that day if he were not he might be suspected of observing christmas on the day the spaniardsand the english inquisitiondeemed untimely since he truly deserved suspicion he had all the more reason not to want to see it fall on him the pews in the little church were more crowded than usual maybeprobablyhe wasnt the only soul there making a point of being seen he went to st ethelberges again two days later for the feast of epiphany the twelfth and last day of christmas a gilded brass star of bethlehem hung from the rood loft some of the parishioners put on a short drama about the recognition of the christ child by the three kings shakespeare found the performances frightful and the dialogue worse but the audience here wasnt inclined to be critical in the theatre the groundlings would have mewed and hissed such players off the stage and pelted them with fruit or worse till they fled after twelfth night passed the mundane world returned when shakespeare went off to the theatre the next day he carried with him the finished manuscript of loves labours won he flourished it in triumph when he saw richard burbage here dick behold the fatted calf burbage just jerked a thumb back toward the tiring room i care not a fig to seet not until master martin hath somewhat smoothed it with a sigh shakespeare went geoffrey martin the companys prompter and playbookkeeper would indeed dress the fatted calf he carried he had a habit of writing elaborate impractical stage directions and like any author in the throes of enthusiasm he sometimes made mistakes changing a characters name between appearances or giving a line or two to someone who happened not to be on stage at the moment martins job was to catch such things to have scribes prepare parts for all the principal actors in a play and to murmur their lines to them if they faltered during a performance martin also worked closely with sir edmund tilney the master of the revels who made sure nothing blasphemous or treasonous appeared on stage if lord burghleys plan was to go forward martin had to be part of the plot the prompter was about forty hed probably been handsome once but nasty scars from a fire stretched across his forehead one cheek and the back of his left hand the work he hadprecise important but out of the publics eyesuited him well good morrow to you master shakespeare he said looking up from a playbook here at last is it weve waited longer than we might have to see what flowed from your pen i know master martin shakespeare said humbly im sorry fort facing the prompter made him feel as if he were back in school again the only difference being that geoffrey martin wielded a pen of his own not a switch he read faster and more accurately than anyone else shakespeare knew that pen of his drank from the ink pot on the table in front of him then darted at the manuscript of loves labours won like a striking asp when will you learn to put stage directions in a form players can actually use he asked more in sorrow than in anger he said the same thing every time shakespeare handed him a manuscript your pardon master martin shakespeare said i do essay precision but you succeed too well the prompter told him also not for the first time with directions such as these you break the action like a man disjointing a roast fowl simplicity sirsimplicitys what wins the race shakespeare wasnt convinced martin was right like any playwright he wanted things just so with all the actors moving at his direction as copernicus and his followers said planets moved around the sun but the prompters word carried more weight in such matters than his as martin went from one page to the next shakespeare did presume to ask what think you aside from these wretched stage directions very pleasant very gay geoffrey martin answered without a doubt the company will buy the play of you and then youll put all your work towards the new king philip ist not so as much of it as i may yes shakespeare answered the prompters question gave him the opening he needed tell me master martin what think you of but before he could finish the question martin lifted a hand hold he said and such was the authority in his voice that shakespeare fell silent here in your second act you have entering three lords and three ladies i do shakespeare agreed looking down at what hed writtenthe second act seemed a long way off these days see you here though only two of these ladies speak the one rosaline the other katharine what point to the third one the one you style maria why for to balance the third lord of course shakespeare answered geoffrey martin shook his head it sufficeth not give her somewhat to do or else take her out oh very well shakespeare said testily lend me your pen then he scratched out a name and substituted another now hath she this passage once katharines good enough martin read on after a bit he looked up and said i am much taken with your signor adriano di armato your fantastical venetian some poets i need not name might have sought instead to make of him a spaniard the which the master of the revels would never countenance shakespeares first thought had been to make him a spaniard to get the extra laughs mocking the invaders would bring but he too had concluded sir edmund would never let him get away with it again though he had the chance to ask the question he wanted or one leading towards it what think you master martin of having to take such care to keep from rousing the spaniards ire working with the master would be simpler without such worries no doubt oft the prompter replied but youll not deny i trust that heresys strong gripd yet constrain us had they not come hither i have now the hope of heaven things being different hellfired surely hold me after i cast my mortal slough ay belike shakespeare said none too happily without a doubt geoffrey martin had given him an honest answer but he hadnt said what shakespeare wanted to hear why believe you otherwise martin askedhed heard how halfhearted shakespeares answer sounded which the poet hadnt wanted at all by my troth no shakespeare said this time using his experience on the stage to sound as he thought geoffrey martin would want him to i should hope not sir the prompter said king philip god keep him is a great man a very great man he hath from ourselves saved us and in our own despite of whom else might one say the like save only our lord himself even so shakespeare said and got away from martin as fast as he could the players hed sounded had all been willing even eager to help try to expel the spaniards from england the tireman had been noncommittal the prompter plainly took the spaniards part and if geoffrey martin suspected treason he knew important ears into which to whisperor shouthis suspicions why the long face will burbage called when shakespeare wandered out onto the stage again mislikes he the mouse your mountain at last delivered nay the jests seemed to please him well enough shakespeare answered but he hath misgivings in aid of certain other matters someone clapped him on the shoulder he jumped he hadnt heard anybody come up behind him will kemps elastic features leered at him cackling with mad glee the clown said what better time than the new year for a drawing and quartering or would you liefer rout out winters chill with a burning ill stake you would go to shakespeare exclaimed get hence and wherefore should i kemp replied i know as much as doth dick here before shakespeare could deny that the clown continued i know enough to hang us all than the which what could be more put so he had a point burbage said the object is not to let others know enough to hang us all others now including a certain gentleman marry a very certain gentleman he is too who all too easily can confound us knew you not that geoff martin hath his nose in the pope of romes arsehole kemp said with another mocking smile steeth willsoft soft shakespeare hissed the ice outside having nothing to do with the chill that ran through him he need but cock his head hither and hell hear you hes right man burbage said dyou want your neck stretched or your bowels cut out or the flesh roasted from your bones talk too free and youll win your hearts desire o ye of little faith kemp jeered dear geoffs prompter and bookkeeper he hath before him a new playso new belike the inks still damp whatll he do plunge his beak into its liver like the vulture with prometheus a cannon could sound beside him without his hearingt burbage looked thoughtful he may have reason he said to shakespeare he may be right shakespeare said right or wrong reason hath he none wheres the reason in a man who will hazard his life for nothing but to hear his own chatter god deliver me from being subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own fancies doth thy other mouth call me will kemp retorted he strode away then stopped bent and spoke loudly with his other mouth whoreson beetleheaded flapeared knave shakespeare burst outbut quietly he remembered all too well that if he angered kemp the clown could betray him too a baconfed knave very voluble burbage agreed but when have you known a clown who was otherwise he too spoke in a low voice after a moment he went on and what think you may we do about martin in sooth i know not shakespeare said miserably would we could just sack him but the companyd rise in revoltand with reason that word again did we try it without good cause burbage nodded true every word oft true but this business cannot go forward without him nor with him in opposition shakespeare said look you to your part oft burbage told him write the words that needs must be writ think on that for none else can dot as for the otherhaply you misread martins mind and purpose that i did not shakespeare declared well as may be burbage said with a shrug but i say this further we are embarked here on no small enterprise ist not so after waiting for shakespeare to nod he went on we may be sure then we are not alone embarked we need not unaided solve all conundrums attached hereto it could be shakespeare said after some thought ay it could be but an we solve them not who shall that is hidden from mine eyes and so should it be for what i know not no inquisitor can tear from me burbage said shakespeare nodded again a little more heartily hed had the same thought smiling burbage continued but to say it is hidden from mine eyes is not to say it hath no existence others knowing little of the parts we play will be charged with shifting such burthens as an oerstubborn prompter is that not so it is shakespeare said or rather it must be but would i knew it for a truth not for an article of faith as what priest or preacher hath not said burbage answered with a laugh write the words will when the time comes ill say em and what follows from thence tis in gods hands not ours he was right he was bound to be rightwhich went some way towards setting shakespeares mind at ease but not so far as he would have liked it did let him get through the day at the theatre without making a fool of himself which he might not have managed had burbage not calmed him a couple of evenings later as the poet was making his way down shoreditch high street towards bishopsgate after a performance a man stepped out of the evening shadows and said youre master shakespeare are you not i am shakespeare said cautiously and who sir are you he used that sir from caution had he felt more cheerful about the world and the people in it he would have said sirrah the fellow whod asked his name looked like a mechanical a laborer in leather jerkin and laddered hose when he smiled he showed a couple of missing teeth oh you need not know my name sir he said then we have no business one with the other shakespeare answered doing his best to sound polite and firm at the same time give you good den he started on hold the stranger said as he set a hand on the hilt of his belt knife to emphasize the word shakespeare stopped in grumbling tones the fellow added nick said you were a tickle un theres a name for you by god and st george you ken nick skeres skeres had led him to sir william cecil i do shakespeare said reluctantly well good on you then the stranger gave him another less than reassuring smile nick sent me to your honor youve someone in your company more friendlier to the dons than an honest englishman ought to be from whom had skeres heard about geoffrey martin burbage will kemp someone else altogether or had this bruiser any true connection to skeres at all with such dignity as he could muster shakespeare said i treat not with a man who hath no name damn you the fellow said but he didnt draw that knife instead exasperated he flung a nameingram at the poet christian name surname shakespeare couldnt guess but the man had given him some of what he wanted shakespeare answered him in turn yes there is such a one master ingram his names martin eh like the bird ingram asked with odd hesitation shakespeare nodded so did the other man all right friend he touched the brim of his villainous cap god give you good even he said and vanished once more into the deepening shadows the poet stared after him scratching his head surelysenor shakespeare you know that his holiness pope sixtus promised king philip a million ducats when the first spanish soldier set foot on english soil and that he very handsomely paid all he had promised lope de vega said a million gold ducats mind you yes i understand shakespeare replied a kingly sum in sooth they sat with their heads together in the tiring room at the theatre de vega puffed on a pipe of tobacco the smoke rising from it fought with that from torches lamps and braziers i am glad you follow sir he said this needs must appear in the play on his most catholic majestys life shakespeare had been scribbling notes in a character lope could not have deciphered had his life depended on it now he looked up sharply wherefore he asked it doth little to advance the action the more so as pope and king never met to seal this bargain it being made by underlings but it shows how beloved of his holiness was the king lope replied by the kings own deeds shall i show that shakespeare said deeds worth the showing on a stage here he dothor rather his men donaught but chaffer like tradesmen at the market over the sum to be paid were this your play master de vega would you such a scene include after some thought lope spread his hands i yield me he said he sucked at the clay pipe hoping the smoke would calm him working with shakespeare was proving harder than hed expected the englishman knew what was required of him a play celebrating and memorializing philip iis life and victories but he had his own ideas of what belonged in such a play and how the pieces should fit together having won his point he could be gracious my thanks sir he said sith the playll bear my name i want it to be a match for the best of my other work for your prides sake lope said for my honors sake shakespeare said lope sprang from his stool and bowed low sweeping off his hat so that the plume brushed the floor say no more sir your fellow poets and players would think less of you did you write below your best this i understand to the bottom of my soul and i in my turn honor you for it i am your servant command me sit sit shakespeare urged him i own i stand in need of your counsel on the incidents of your kings life and on how to show em the which is made more harder by his seldom leaving madrid those in his command working for him all through the spanish empire even so lope returned to his seat he eyed the english poet with considerable respect you have more experience bringing history to the stage than i shakespeares smile somehow didnt quite reach his eyes when i put words into the mouths of romans i may dot without fear the master of the revels will think my ghosts and shadows speak of matters political lope nodded certes this is one of the uses of the distant past he leaned forward here though not so distant is the past of which we speak how thought you to portray the kings conquest of the heretic dutchmen why through his kinsman the duke of parma excellent lope said most excellent parma being dead no unsightly jealousies will to him accrue they kept at it till the prompter summoned shakespeare to sort out something or other in the new play hed offered the company a harried look on his face the english poet returned a couple of minutes later to say your pardon master de vega but this bids fair to eat up some little while he hath set upon my pride a blot catching me with my characters doing now one thing now another quite different having marred it i now needs must mend it qula stima lope said and then in english what a pity he got to his feet i am wanted elsewhere anon shall we take up again on the morrow twere better the day following shakespeare answered lope nodded until the day hasta luego senor shakespeare dipped his head then hurried off de vega left the theatre hed come on horseback today one of the tiremans helpers had kept an eye on the beast to make sure it would still be there when he came out lope gave the englishman a halfpenny for his trouble by the fellows frown hed hoped for more but every mans hopes miscarried now and again riding through the tenements that huddled outside the city wall lope felt something of a conquering caballero hed seldom had that feeling afoot now though he looked down on the english from literally looking down on them i do so metaphorically as well he thought a mans mind is a strange thing the english knew him for a conqueror too that made his passage harder not easier they got in his way and feigned deafness when he shouted at them they flung curses and catcalls from every other window they flung other things too stones to make his horse shy and rear lumps of filth to foul the beast and him he never saw his tormentors the ones not safe inside buildings melted into the crowds on shoreditch high street whenever he whirled in the saddle to try to get a glimpse of them by the time he got back down to bishopsgate he was in a perfect transport of temper one of the irish gallowglasses at the gate seeing his fury asked would your honor have joy of us breaking some heads for you now no let it go you cannot hope to punish the guilty lope said once hed made sense of the heavily armed foot soldiers brogue with a laugh the irishman said and what difference might that make sdeath sir not a groats worth a broken headll make you shy of tormenting a gentleman afterwards be you guilty or no but lope repeated let it go the gallowglasses and kerns brought over from the western island looked for excuses to fall upon the english considering what the english had done in ireland over the years they had reason for wanting revenge but the outrage their atrocities spawned made them almost as much liability as asset for the spaniards and for isabella and albert lope rode into london he still drew catcalls and curses inside the wall though spaniards were more common as were englishmen who favored the spanish cause a man who flung say a ball of dung ran some real risk of being seen and noted catcalls lope took in stride when he got back to the barracks the stable boys clucked at the horses sorry state and what of me lope said indignantly am i a plant in a pot it could be so senor one of them answered and if it is youre a well manured plant by god and st james he held his nose his friends laughed had the misfortune befallen someone else lope might have laughed too since it was his own laughter only enraged him he stormed off to his chamber there he found his servant sleeping the sleep of the innocent and just diego he shouted diegos snores changed timbre but not rhythm diego lope screamed the servant muttered something vaguely placating and rolled from his back to his belly lope shook him like a man trying to shake fleas out of a doublet diegos eyes opened oh buenos dias senor he said is it an earthquake if there were an earthquake it would swallow you as the whale swallowed jonah lope said furiously and do you know what do you know what you son of a debauched sloth his servant didnt want to answer but saw he had no choice what senor he quavered if there were an earthquake it would swallow you as the whale swallowed jonah and you wouldnt even know it lope bellowed scotland that got diegos attention where nothing up till then really had not scotland senor i beg you he broke in the scots are even worse than the irish from all i hear may the holy mother of god turn her back on me if i lie they cook blood in a sheeps stomach and call it supper and some say it is the blood of men scotland i was going to say is too good for you de vega snarled he had the satisfaction of watching diego quail a satisfaction marred when his servant yawned in the midst of cringing by god diego if you fall asleep now ill murder you in your bed do you think im lying do you want to find out if im lying no senor all i want to do is diego stopped looking even more miserable than he had hed undoubtedly been about to say all i want to do is go back to sleep he wasnt very bright but he could see that that would land him in even more trouble than hed already found a querulous whine crept into his voice as he went on i thought youd stay at that damned theatre a lot longer than you did and so lope said and so because im not here does that mean you get to lie there like a salt cod why werent you blacking my boots why werent you mending my shirts why werent you keeping your ears open for anything that might be to my advantage the way captain guzmans enrique does why does that vain little thrip of a baltasar guzman get a prince among servants while im stuck with a donkey and a dead donkey at that diego said something inflammatory and scandalous about exactly how intimate enrique and captain guzman were how would you know that lope jeered when have you been awake to see them its true senor diego answered everybody says so lecturing his servant on what everybody said was worth struck de vega as a waste of breath but his pause was thoughtful for more reasons than that if guzman really did prove a marican a sodomite he might lose his position he would in fact if he brought scandal to himself or to the spanish occupiers as a group and who would benefit if baltasar guzman fell i would lope thought people can call me a great many things but a sodomite never diegos narrow little eyes glittered nastily are you thinking what im thinking no lope said not without wellconcealed regret i am thinking that maybe you would do better asleep after all when youre awake your mind goes from the chamber pot to the sewage ditch for i happen to know captain guzman had a mistress till they quarreled a few months ago and why would they quarrel diego asked if hed sooner abasta lope said and not just enough but too much get up get out of here do what youre supposed to do then once youve done thatwhich will include cleaning the clothes i have on for the english threw filth at me and my horse todayonce youve done that i say youll have earned your rest and youll enjoy it more his servant looked highly dubious de vega supposed he had some reason the only way he could enjoy his rest more would be to make love without waking up diego also thought about making some remark on the state of lopes clothes again he was wise to think twice grumbling under his breath he did at last get out of bed lope pulled off his boots shed his stinking netherstocks and hose and got out of his befouled doublet he changed quickly the room was cold and then he went off to make the days report to captain guzman damn you diego he muttered under his breath as he went no matter what everybody said about guzmanif everybody said anything about himlope still had to deal with him that was hard enough already and would be harder still if de vega watched his superior out of the corner of his eye looking for signs he might be a sodomite before he got to guzmans office he ran into enrique or had enrique contrived to run into him eyes wide with excitement behind the lenses of his spectacles captain guzmans servant said tell me at once senior lieutenantwhat is it like shaping a play with seaor shakespeare i dont shape here lope said remembering he might have to watch enrique out of the corner of his eye too i only have some lumber to sell shakespeare is the carpenter he cuts and carves and nails things together hell do it very well too i think he has a mind of his own enrique asked por dios lope exclaimed and the clever young servant laughed you can think its funny de vega told him you dont have to work with the englishman enrique sighed oh but i wish i did is your master in lope asked yes i think so enrique said he was at a friends house last night but he said before he left that hed try to return in good time he said amiga not amigo the friend was of the feminine persuasion so much for what everybody says lope thought have you seen her he asked is she pretty i should hope so senor enrique said enthusiastically a face like an angels and tits out to here he held a hand an improbable distance in front of his chest so much indeed for what everybody says de vega thought when he walked into baltasar guzmans office the young captain looked like a cat that had just fallen into a bowl of cream and when guzman asked whats the latest senior lieutenant he didnt sound as if hed bite lopes head off if he didnt like the answer he must have had a night to remember i wish i were in love again i probably will be soon but im not now and i miss it sighing de vega summarized his session with shakespeare he also summarized the english attitude toward lone spaniards on horseback only my good luck they chose to throw more dung than stones i might not have made it back if theyd gone the other way captain guzman said im glad youre safe de vega youre a valuable man while lope was still gaping wondering if hed heard straight his superior added and im glad things are going so well with the english poet keep up the good work lope left his office in something of a daze maybe guzmans amiga really did have the face of an angel and tits out to there lope couldnt imagine what else would have made the sardonic nobleman seem so much like a human being wheres master martin shakespeare asked in the tiring room at the theatre he was to have the different several parts from loves labours won ready to go to the scribes that they might make for the players fair copies good luck to em will kemp said theres not a rooster living could read your hen scratchings the clown exaggerated but not by a great dealnot enough at any rate to make shakespeare snap back at him richard burbage looked around ay where is he burbage said as if kemp hadnt spoken geoffs steady as the tides trusty as a hound ah dick kemp murmured you shew again why youre so much better with another mans words in your mouth hed made that crack before it must have stung even so for burbage glared at him a couple of players laughed but they quickly fell silent not only was burbage a large powerful man but he and his family owned the theatre insulting him to his face took nerve or a fools foolishness shakespeare thought pray god he hath not absconded jack hungerford said that drew a loud raucous guffaw from will kemp pray god indeed the clown said hes to the broggers with all our papers for the which theyll assuredly pay him not a farthing under sixpence hapennyhes rich for life belike he got a bigger laugh there than he had when he mocked burbage shakespeare didnt find the crack funny loose papers may not signify to thee that hast not had pirates print em without thy let and without thy profit he growled as ever thou thinkst naught for any of the company but thyself thourt not only fool but ass and dog as well a dog is it kemp said thy mothers of my generation whats she if i be a dog shakespeare sprang for him they each landed a couple of punches before the others of the company pulled them apart smarting from a blow on the cheek shakespeare snarled a dog thou art and for the sake of bitchery he didnt know that kemp sought whores more than any other man but flung the insult anyhow too furious to care about truth before the clown could reply in like vein someone with a loud booming voice called out from the doorway to the tiring room here now here now by god whats the meaning of this whats the meaning oft by god constable strawberry burbage said good day sir good day walter strawberry said he was a jowly middleaged man who looked like a bulldog and had little more wit i hope you are well burbage said the theatre belonging to his family he dealt with the constable i have not seen you long how goes the world it wears sir as it grows the constable replied ay thats well known burbages tone grew sharper why come you here he quietly paid the constable and his helpers to stay away from the theatre except when the players needed aid first tell you me whats this garboil here in aid of whats it about eh he pointed to the men holding shakespeare and the others with a grip on kemp words words words shakespeare answered twisting free good words are better than bad strokes and the strokes will and i gave each other were poor as any ever given we are meseems friends again he looked toward the clown kemp had also got loose most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly he said shakespeare stiffened with a nasty smile kemp added but not ours he came over to shakespeare and planted a large wet smacking kiss on his cheek whispering scurvy dotard thinfaced knave as he did so his acting wouldnt have convinced many but it sufficed for constable strawberry good good he boomed high spirits animal spirits eh why come you here richard burbage repeated as shakespeare and kemp both cued by animal spirits mouthed ass at each other why come i here the constable echoed as if he himself might have forgotten he coughed portentously then went on know you a certain wight named geoffrey martin we do burbage answered will kemp said a more certain wight never was born by god strawberry ignored that which probably meant he didnt understand it why come you here burbage asked for the third time hath aught amiss befallen him amiss amiss walter strawberry said you might say so you just mightan you reckon murther aught amiss you might murther the dreadful word came from half the company shakespeare among them horror and astonishment filled most voices shakespeares held horror alone he realized he was not surprised and wished to heaven he were murther yes murther most foul constable strawberry said master martin a were found besides an ordinary stabbed above an eyethe dexterous one it werethe said wound causing his deceasing to be murther the which were to be demonstarted whod do such a heinous deed burbage said again shakespeare knew or thought he knew all too well ingram had looked the sort to be handy with a knife master burbage sir i know that not this while i know that not the constable said gravely i put it to youay to all of yewhat manner of enemies had he of foes of rivals of opposants and other suchlike folk who wished him not well never set i mine eyne upon the man till overlooking his dead corpse so haply you will have known him better than i behind shakespeare someone murmured vere legitur lex asinus est whats that strawberry said sharply whats that if you know somewhat of the case speak out an you know not keep a grave silence like to master martins keeping the silence of the grave if you be lukewarm of knowing spew nothing out of your mouths truly you are a revelation to us will kemp said doth any man here know who might have been the prime motion of the said master geoffrey martins untimely coming to dust the constable asked shakespeare felt richard burbages eye on him misery roweled him i meant it not to come to this tolled in his mind again and again like a great iron bell before god i meant it not but come to this it had whether hed meant it or not he couldnt even be surprised had he not embarked on treason or what isabella and albert and their spanish props would reckon treason no one would have slain poor geoff martin and treason and murther ever keep together as two yokedevils sworn to eithers purpose walter strawberry looked from one player to another searching the faces of men and boys making them search their consciences shakespeare had never known the tiring room so silent he did not break the silence neither did burbage well the constable said at last well and well and well and yet not so well a man is murthered his blood crieth out for revengeance i had fondly hoped you might make the way more simpler fondly quotha someone said in a penetrating whisper strawberry stared but did not spy the miscreant he coughed and repeated himself i fondly hoped you might make the way more simpler but ant be no tis no whosoever the wretch that strook him down may be i purpose discovering him and what i purpose i aim at give you good morrow he turned on his heel and ponderously strode away that clotted silence held the tiring room for another minute or two till the players were sure the constable was out of earshot then almost everyone started talking at once almost everyone shakespeare held aloof listening without speaking one wild guess followed another footpads an outraged husband a creditor a debtor methinks our prize poet done it kemp put in for that master geoffrey was ever changing his precious verses that roused shakespeare to speech did i slay on such account you had been years dead and more deserving oft than our poor prompter ah but i make you better the clown said smugly enough richard burbages roar filled the room startling everyone into momentary silence once more he pointed first at kemp then at shakespeare too much by god give over else you quarrel with me shakespeare nodded after a moment so did will kemp shakespeare wondered how long the truce would last from what he knew of the clown not long and of course burbage could throw wood on the fire too and so can you shakespeare reminded himself more quietly burbage went on we need a new man to perform the office of playbookkeeper and prompter as soon as may be for we shall make proper ninnies of ourselves without him know ye of a man able to dot and at liberty nobody said anything at last jack hungerford spoke up ill nose about players now players come and go but we who tread not the boards incline more towards finding one place and holding it well find someone burbage said with the air of a man trying to sound confident but meanwhile we all must needs watch our fellows backs any one of us may of a day be dull if a player have forgot his part and be out let him not go even to a full disgrace whisper to himgive him the words he wants all will go forward and all for the best hungerford said till we have our new man it were better to give plays we have done before many a time and oft that by familiarity we feel as little as may be the lack burbage nodded to the tireman well said he eyed hungerford in a speculative way until this exigency be past could you jack undertake some of what master martin did your helpers taking your place with costumes and the like hungerford looked unhappy id be scarce a prentice ins trade as my helpers are scarce more than prentices in mine twould make us weaker all around than we are weaker in the whole of the fabric yes but without the rent this garment our company would otherwise suffer burbage said and only for a brief space of time till we find the man can take poor geoffreys place burbage usually thundered like jove browbeating pushing the company along the path he wanted by force of will here though he roared as gently as any sucking dove cajoling the tireman into doing what he wanted in truth jack hungerford needed little cajoling ill dot he said but only for a little while mind gramercy burbage said and made a leg the tireman chuckled in embarrassed pleasure gramercy shakespeare echoed moving his lips without sound had hungerford stayed stubborn in his refusal burbages eye likely would have fallen on him next who would do better for a makeshift prompter than the man whod penned many of the plays in the first place and might reasonably be expected therefore to know everyones lines and i have not the time in which to dot he thought desperately two plays to write not a word set down on either and he still had to act too he wanted to cry he wanted to scream he wanted to lock himself in a room with nothing but his books and do nothing but set words on paper he could have none of what he wanted they got through the afternoons performance without disgracing themselves as shakespeare left the theatre afterwards richard burbage came up beside him his shoulders sagged in a silent sigh but he wasnt really surprised burbage said sad for poor martins family he had a new babe i believe o the lady he wed after his first wife perished in the fire that marked him most piteous sad indeed shakespeare trudged down shoreditch high street towards filthy crowded london towards his home burbage matched him stride for stride after a while he said will shakespeare didnt answer he just kept walking will what ist shakespeare snapped are you sure you want to know this time burbage was the one who didnt say anything he only waited after a moment shakespeare realized what he was waiting for god be my judge dick i devised his death not i thought naught other theres none o the killing blood in youelse as you say will kemp were long since sped but burbages smile quickly faded from his fleshy lips that you devised it not i believe with all my heart that it grieved you i believe also that it amazed you as it amazed us he shook his head no why say you so shakespeare asked for that you spake of martin his popery as hurtful to a a certain enterprise burbage answered wast the second henry who cried out awho will rid me of this turbulent priestand behold theres becket dead shakespeare laughed uneasily that shot struck much too close to the center of the target trying to lead burbage away from the truth hed found the poet said tis treason or folly or both together to set alongside a kings my name burbage however was not so easily distracted an i hire me another popish prompter will he too lie dead in a ditch the day after i know not shakespeare said what think you the player persisted i think i think a great ship is setting sail i am thereon haply one small sail if the wind blow foul twill tear me to ribbonsand theyll haul me down in a trice and raise in my place another and the shipll sail on as before are you answered dick i am answered burbage said heavily and ill inquire of those with whom i speak how they stand with rome softly softly shakespeare warned if they wonder why you put such questions twere better never to have asked at all you take me for a fool burbage said hes the other wight heh shakespeare said another one whos fain to jape ons own were not on the boards now will think you not shakespeare shook his head till this enterprise go forward if it go forward we are players everywhere players always forget it at your peril burbage chewed on that for a few paces by the sour face he pulled he did not like the taste he pointed ahead theres bishopsgate he hurried on alone flinging words back over his shoulder if you have the right oft best not to be seen with you that hurt it would have hurt worse had shakespeare not been convinced he was rightwhich made burbage right to avoid his company the player passed through the gate and disappeared shakespeare followed more slowly he felt he ought to ring a bell like a leper to warn folk of his presence his touch was liable to prove as deadly as any lepers that he knew too well and then when he was only a couple of houses from the one where he lodged something else occurred to him geoffrey martin had proved an annoyance to those whod framed this plot hed proved an annoyance and theyd brushed him aside as casually as if he were a flea on a doublet and if i prove an annoyance shakespeare shivered but lord burghley styled me his strong right arm the poet shivered again plenty of people in the street that chilly afternoon were shivering so he went unnoticed if i prove an annoyance theyll brush me aside as yarely as poor geoff martin captain baltasar guzman held up a sheet of paper to lope de vega we are ordered to take special notice senior lieutenant of any who profane lent this year by eating of foods forbidden these forty days we are ordered to do all sorts of foolish things lope answered this is more foolish than most the english from all ive seen in my time here break the rules as often as they keep them he exaggerated but not by an enormous amount a surprising amount of meat got eaten here in the weeks before easter guzman waved the paper but this he said portentously is a special year how is this year special de vega asked as he knew he was supposed to do i know his holiness has declared that will be a year of jubilee but he shrugged to me it seems a year among years not so his superior waved the paper again lope was getting tired of seeing it without being able to read it guzman went on ash wednesday this year is the fourth of february and easter the twentysecond of march theyre early lope remarked is that enough to make it special as a matter of fact yes guzman answered it is it says here as early as easter can come he waved that damned paper one more time this is of course the twentysecond of march by the calendar pope gregory ordained fifteen years ago yes ten days earlier by the old calendar the heretics still love lope agreed but easter isnt like christmaswe dont have one day and they another ah but this year we do captain guzman said by their calendar what we call the paschal full moon falls before the vernal equinox they will count the sunday after the next full moon as easterapril the twentysixth by our reckoning the sixteenth by theirs now do you understand after a moment de vega nodded i think so if their easter is later their lent will begin later too and and they will find it no sin to eat meat during the first part of our lent guzman broke in they either have to keep the fast an extra month to make themselves both safe and what they call holy or lope interrupted in turn or break the law of god and the fast i see it now your excellency youre rightthis is a special year he wouldnt have wanted to keep the lenten fast for more than two months and he doubted whether many stubbornly protestant englishmen would either baltasar guzman nodded we can smoke out a lot of heretics whove hidden from us since the armada landed the sooner we get rid of the last of them the sooner well have peace in the kingdom peace lope sighed it seems like one of those mirages that fool travelers lost in the desert you follow the mirage and what looks like water recedes before you if we had peace here maybe one day i could go home to spain i wonder if i would recognize madrid after so long here id probably think it was beastly hot one thing is certain though captain guzman said as long as there are still protestants in england well have no peace this kingdom has to follow the holy catholic faith all the world one day will follow the holy catholic faith then truly peace will come he crossed himself his eyes glowed with a crusaders vision yes de vega crossed himself too but then incautiously he said weve fought the portuguese and the french and theyre catholic tooafter a fashion guzman waved that aside when all the world is catholic there will be peace he declared as if challenging lope to argue with him lope didnt he might not have been so passionately certain of that as guzman was but he believed it too is there anything else your excellency he asked to his surprise and disappointment guzman nodded yes what do you make of the murder of ah geoffrey martin he made heavy going of the dead mans christian name a robber i suppose lope answered with a shrug i hear his purse was empty when the constables found his body robbery perhaps but what else his superior persisted he was a good catholic and now hes dead we might have learned a great deal from him had someone approached him lope asked if anyone had i never knew it nor i guzman said but that does not necessarily signify he could have been talking to the english inquisition with us none the wiser the inquisitors always hold their cards close to their chestssometimes too close to play them i think but they are not anxious for my opinion losing the prompter is a blow to the company lope said they will have to replace him as soon as they can and with whom they replace him may be interesting captain guzman eyed de vega if shakespeare is as much an innocent as you think he certainly has odd things happen around him and if you think shakespeare a footpad your excellency you prove you do not know the man at all de vega replied that is not what i said senior lieutenant guzman said a distinct chill in his voice please think about what i did say you are dismissed to show how very dismissed he was his superior bent his head to his paperwork with him still in the office seething lope gave guzman a salute whose perfection was an act of mockery good day your excellency he snarled sweetly his aboutface might almost have been a dance he neither slammed guzmans door on walking out nor shut it silently as enrique had instead he left it open the captains exasperated sigh and the scrape of his chair on the wood floor as he pushed it back so he could get up and close the door himself were music to de vegas ears he knew nothing but thanks at escaping the barracksthanks and cold for snowflakes fluttered on the northwesterly breeze its january it could be snowing in madrid too he told himself it was true he knew it was true it didnt help when he thought of madrid he thought of a place where the vine and the olive flourished he tried to imagine grapes and olives growing in london and laughed at himself not even a poets imagination stretched so far in the street outside the barracks a spanish soldier and a skinny englishwoman were striking a bargain he gave her a coin she led him away before long he would get relief lope didnt know whether to envy or pity him for being satisfied so easily id sooner be a monk than buy a nasty counterfeit for love he muttered that didnt mean he enjoyed living like a monk he had though ever since his two mistresses were so inconsiderate as to run into each other outside the southwark bear garden goodbye nell farewell martha high time i found someone new he wouldnt do it by the barracks he knew that the spanish soldiers stationed there drew trulls as a lodestone drew iron de vega didnt want women of easy virtue he wanted women who would fall in love with him and whom he would love for a while he wandered down towards the thames past the church of st lawrence poultney in candlewick street not far from the church a woman with a wicker basket called whelks and mussels cockles and clams fresh today whelks and mussels maybe they were fresh today maybe they werent in this weather even shellfish stayed good for a whileone of its few virtues lope could think of he eyed the woman selling them she was a few years younger than he wrapped in a wool cloak she would have thrown out two years before if she could have afforded to replace it the worried look on her face told how hard life could be whelks or mussels sir she said feeling his eye on her clams cockles good for dinner good for supper good for soup good for stew she all but sang the desperate little jingle cockles i think lope answered though i should be pleased to buy anything from so lovely a creature her weary sigh sent fog swirling from her mouth i sell that not she said voice hard and flat god forbid i meant any such thing lope exclaimed though he had at least to test her he swept off his hat bowed and told her his name then gave her his most open friendly smile and asked hers i oughtnt to tell it you she said and why not he affected indignation what shall i do with it make witchcraft against you theyd burn me none less than the which id deserve nay sweet lady i want it only for to write it on the doorposts of mine heart my heart he couldnt remember which was right the girl with the basket of shellfish didnt enlighten him a tiny smile did lift the corners of her mouth for a moment though she said theres a deal of foolery in you ist not so i know not whereof you speak lope said donning a comically droll expression that smile was like a shy wild thing he had to lure from hiding he felt rewarded when he saw it im lucy watkins sir she said my lady lope bowed again she wasnt his lady maybe she never would be but he intended to make trial of that vi smoke from the fireplace smoke from the flames under a roasting capon and smoke from half a dozen pipes of tobacco filled the boars head in east cheap shakespeares eyes stung and watered whats the utility of tobacco he asked the player beside him whod been drinking sack with singleminded dedication for some little while now what pleasure takes one from the smoking of it besides the pleasure of setting fire to ones purse the stuff was among other things devilishly expensive the player blinked at him in owlish solemnity why to pass current of course he answered after a soft belch he buried his nose in the mug of sack once more it suffices not shakespeare murmured pay him no heed christopher marlowe said from across the table marlowe had a pipe he paused to draw in smoke then blew a perfect smoke ring shakespeare goggled hed never seen that before it almost answered his question by itself laughing at his flabbergasted expression marlowe went on he is sensible in nothing but blows and so is an ass is that so the player said well sirrah you can kiss mine arse marlowe rose from his stool in one smooth motion right gladly will i he came around the table kissed the fellow on the mouth and returned to his place the drunken player gaped and then too late cursed and wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his doublet loud raucous laughter filled the boars head under it marlowe nodded to shakespeare you were saying will what goods tobacco shakespeare asked what good ist now marlowe was the one who stared why let aristotle and all your philosophers say what they will there is nothing to be compared with tobacco have you tried it at the least i have four or five years gone by i paid my shilling for the damned little clay pipe and two shillings more for the noxious weed to charge it with and i smoked and i smoked till i might have been a chimneytop and and marlowe echoed and i cast up the good threepenny supper id had not long beforeas featly as you please mind missing my shoes altogetherand sithence have had naught to do with tobacco nor wanted to liked you the leek when first you ate of it or the bitter taste of beer better than that horrid plant from unknown clime shakespeare shuddered at the memory of how his guts had knotted by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you marlowe said you have not so much brain as earwax in sooth there will be little learning die then that day you are hanged he leered at shakespeare and who knows which day that will be eh my chuck go to shakespeare snarled marlowe would not keep his mouth shut more of your conversation would infect my brain you draw out the thread of your verbosity finer than the style of your argument you scambling outfacing fashionmongering peevish lown well shot will thomas dekker called the young poet whooped and clapped his hands lord westmorlands men had put on his first play only a few weeks before he lifted up his mug of wine in salute reload and give him another barrel he drained the mug and slammed it down shakespeare caught a barmaids eye and pointed to dekker when she filled the youngsters mug again shakespeare paid her dekker was chronically short of funds till shakespeares company bought his comedy hed been one step from debtors prisonand now rumor had it was again marlowe clucked reproachfully buying a claque i reckoned it beneath you the devil will not have you damned lest the oil thats in you should set hell on fire he emptied his mug and gave the barmaid a halfpenny to refresh it i pay mine own way he declared drinking again i am sure kit though you know what temperance should be you know not what it is shakespeare answered sweetly me me marlowes indignation was convincing whether it was also genuine shakespeare had no idea what of you eh i am too well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way as shakespeare had with dekker so marlowe also had a partisan a boy actor of about fourteen as pretty as one of the girls he played he laughed and banged his fist down on the tabletop marlowe bought him more of whatever he was drinkingbeer shakespeare saw when the serving woman poured his mug full again hed already had quite a lot hectic color glowed on his cheeks as if he were coming down with a fever marlowe blew another smoke ring then passed the pipe to the boy who managed a couple of unskillful puffs before coughing piteously and turning even redder than he was marlowe took back the pipe he kissed the stem where the boys lips had touched it then put it in his own mouth again watching intently was a tall thin pale man who wore wore a rich doublet of slashed silk his tongue played over his red lips as he watched marlowe and the boy whos that shakespeare asked dekker he pointed i have seen him aforetimes but recall not his name why tis anthony bacon the other poet replied he hath a liking for beardless boys he laughed and drank again shakespeare nodded not only had he seen bacon hed visited the house anthony shared with his younger brother francis to see sir william cecil he suddenly wondered what anthony knew of the plot wonder or not he had no intention of trying to find out marlowe and shakespeare werent the only poets and players and other theatre folk dueling with words in the boars head will kemp had got george rowley an actor notorious for his slow thinking splutteringly furious at him as rowley cast about for some devastating comebackand looked more and more unhappy as none occurred to himkemp gave him a mocking bow and sang out look hes winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strike ill strike you youyouyou fool rowley shouted amidst general laughter which only got louder at his sorry reply is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard kemp demanded of the crowd and got back shouts of no that pierced the smoke and came echoing back from the stout oak beams of the roof george rowley surged up from his bench and did try to strike him then but other actors held them apart marlowe smiled across the table at shakespeare ah the boars head he said fondly what things we have seen done at the boars head heard words that have been so nimble so full of subtle flame shakespeare broke in as if that everyone from whence they came he paused in thought then carried on had meant to put his whole wit in a jest and had resolved to live a fool the rest of his dull life not bad will marlowe said no not bad and all the better for the internal rhyme purposed you that from when you began to speak an i say yes youll call me liar an i say no youll call me lucky clotpoll shakespeare answered the other poet grinned back at him altogether unabashed shakespeare turned thoughtful think you the like hath value in shaping dialogue marlowe leaned forward a thought of merit it might lead mere leaden prose towards the suppleness of blank verse they batted the idea back and forth nearly oblivious to the racket around them till the pretty boy beside marlowe indignant at being ignored got up to go shakespeare wondered if marlowe would notice even that anthony bacon did he saw despite the lure of versification the lure of the boy proved stronger for marlowe he spoke soothingly when that failed to have the desired effect he charged his pipe with tobacco lit it with a splinter kindled from a nearby candle and offered it to the boy the youngster took another puff made a horrible face and coughed as if in the final stages of some dreadful tisick shakespeares sympathies were with him regardless of shakespeares sympathies the boy and marlowe left the boars head together marlowes arm was around the boys waist the youngsters head nestled against his shoulder bacon watched them hungrily anyone looking at them would have guessed they were sweethearts and so shakespeare supposed they were but marlowe could not hideindeed took pride in not hidinghis appetites the english inquisition might burn him for sodomy secular authorities if they caught him would merely hang him maybe the talk with marlowe was what he needed to get his wits going though that night at the ordinary he began work on the play lord burghley had asked of him he wished he were as wealthy as one of the bacons or as burghley himself committing treason was bad enough committing it in public he put a hand over his papers whenever kate the serving woman came near she found it funny instead of taking offense ill not steal your words she said since when could i having no letters of mine own shed said before she needed to make a mark instead of signing her name shakespeare relaxeda very little whenever anyone but kate walked past the table where he wrote he kept on covering up the manuscript that of course drew more attention to it than it would have got had he kept on writing a plump burgess looked down at the sheet in front of him shook his head and said you need have no fear sir nor god nor the devil could make out your character geoffrey martin had voiced similar complaints but poor martin had been the companys bookkeeper he naturally had a low opinion of the hand of a mere poet to hear someone with less exacting standards scorn shakespeares script was oddly reassuring after a while shakespeare was the only customer left in the ordinary his quill scratched across the paper so fast the ink on one line scarcely had time to dry before his hand smudged it while writing the next he started when kate said curfews nigh master will so soon he said amazed soon she shook her head youve sat there writing sith you finished supper none of you but your right hand moving looktwo whole leaves filled never saw i you write so fast little by little shakespeare came forward in time a millennium and a half from bold outraged britons and swaggering romans to london in the year of our lord i wrote two leaves by god i did he whistled in wonder he couldnt remember the last time hed done so much of a night either not even when he was finishing loves labours won had his pen flown like this ist something new then she asked yes he nodded he could safely say that much and he could safely let her see the manuscript as shed reminded him earlier in the evening for she couldnt read it and all of a sudden he didnt feel like thinking about the play any more might i bide a little longer he asked kate nodded she didnt seem much surprised later when they lay side by side on the narrow little bed in her cramped little chamber she set her palm on the left side of his chest perhaps to feel his heartbeat slow towards normal from its pounding peak of a few minutes before shakespeare set his own hand on hers whats to become of us will she asked he sighed hed run into altogether too many questions lately for which he had no good answers here was another having no good answers he responded with a question of his own what can become of us ive a wife and two daughters in stratford ive never hid em from thee kate nodded yes thourt honest in thine own fashion that neither sounded nor felt like praise but here they lay together in her bed warm and naked and sated if that wasnt praise of the highest sort a woman could give a man what was it i do love thee he said kate snuggled against him he leaned over and kissed her cheek hoping he was telling the truth he sighed again did i have a choice but before shakespeare was born henry viii had wanted a choice too when the pope wouldnt give him one hed pulled england away from rome now of course the invading spaniards had forcibly brought her back to the catholic church but even if elizabeth still reigned even if england were still protestant divorce was for sovereigns and nobles and those rich enough to pay for a private act of parliament not for the likes of a struggling poet and player who lived in a bishopsgate lodging house had a sour wife far away and sometimes slept with the serving woman at the ordinary around the corner didst thou have a choice kate echoed before god i know not what id do shakespeare thought if he hadnt got anne with child he doubted he would have wed her years and years too late to worry about that now though what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder hed heard that text in sermons more times than he could count since the armada put isabella and albert on the english throne priests harped on it to show that protestants who countenanced divorce were heretics and sinners didst thou have a choice kate repeated a little more sharply this time would she have me lie to her shakespeare wondered he was just then and would keep on lying to practically everyone he knew why should a serving woman be different from anyone else because i do because i mightlove her not a perfect answer but the best he could do did i have a choice my chuck shakespeare sighed and shrugged expecting her to throw him out of that narrow bed for not crying out that he would cleave to her come what might she startled him by laughing and startled him again by kissing him on the cheek perhaps thou art truly honest will most mend lie for the sake of their sweethearts feelings ill give thee what i can kate and cherish all thou givest me and now i had best be gone shakespeare got out of bed and began to dress god keep thee will she said a yawn blurring her words hurry to thy lodging surely curfews past god keep thee he said and opened the door to her room he went out closing the door behind him lope de vega came up to the priest the englishman marked his forehead with the ashes of the palm usually in this northern clime willow or box or yew branches used the previous palm sunday in latin the priest said remember thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return crossing himself lope murmured amen and made his way out of st swithins church most of the people he saw on the streets english and spaniards alike already had their foreheads marked with the sign of repentance that opened the lenten season anyone who didnt especially in a year when catholics and heretics celebrated easter more than a month apart would get some hard looks from those whose duty was to examine such things though it was still the first week of february the day was springlike mild almost warm the sky a hazy blue with fluffy white clouds drifting slowly across it from west to east the sun shone brightly a few more such days and flowers would begin to open seeds to bring forth new plants leaves to bud on trees once lope had seen this weather hold long enough for nature to be fooledwhich made the following blizzard all the crueler by comparison he didnt expect this stretch to last so long usually they were like a deceitful girl who promised much more than she intended to give knowing as much he didnt feel himself cheated as he had when hed first come to england i am sure you are brokenhearted that lord westmorlands men have got a dispensation to let them perform through lent captain baltasar guzman said outside the church oh of course your excellency de vega replied he was damned if hed let this little pipsqueak still wet behind the ears outdo him in irony he touched his forehead as if to say the ashes there symbolized his mourning but then he went on most of the acting companies gain these dispensations they would have a hard time staying in business if they didnt acting companies were by the nature of things shoestring operations lord westmorlands men a bit less than most they could ill afford losing more than a tenth of their revenue by shutting down between ash wednesday and easter well go on up to the theatre then guzman said see if anyone is bold enough to flaunt his heresy to the world at large whoever he is he will pay yes sir lope said sir is there any further word of his most catholic majesty shakespeare has asked after him not unreasonably he wants some notion of how much time he has to compose the drama don diego flores de valdas set him i have news yes but none of it good captain guzman replied the gout has attacked his neck which makes both eating and sleeping very difficult for him and the sores on his hands and feet show no sign of healing if anything they begin to ulcerate and spread also his dropsy is no betterif anything is worse tears stung lopes eyes he touched the ashes on his forehead again the priest in the church spoke truly to dust we shall return but this is bitter a man who waswho isso great having an end so hard and slow better if he simply went to sleep one night and never woke up god will do as he pleases senior lieutenant not as you please would you set your judgment against his no sirnot that it would do any good if i did for he can act and all i can do is talk guzman relaxed so long as you understand that with a man who makes plays forgive me but i wondered if you arrogated some of the lords powers to yourself since you make your characters and move them about as if you were the almighty for them lope looked at him in astonishment i have had those blasphemous thoughts yes sir my confessor has given me heavy penance on account of them how could you guess it seemed logical guzman said you have a world inside your head an imaginary world filled with imaginary people who could blame you for believing now and again that that imaginary world is real you make it seem real to others in your playswhy not to yourself as well do you know your excellency i am going to have to pay serious attention to you whether i want to or not de vega said slowly baltasar guzman set a hand on his shoulder now now senior lieutenant you had better be careful what you say or youll embarrass both of us being your superior i should do the embarrassing let me try how is your latest lady friend lope wasnt embarrassed he flashed guzman a grin shes very well thank you he said and heaved a sigh i do believe she is the sweetest creature i ever met and i do believe youve said that about every woman for whom you ever conceived an affection which must be half the women in england at the very least captain guzman grinned too a nasty crooked grin how am i doing pretty well thanks lope answered you make me glad im going to the theatre he wasnt sorry to hurry away from st swithins for captain guzmans shot had hit in the white center of the target lope did passionately believe at least for a while that each new girl was the one upon whom god had most generously bestowed his gifts what point to loving someone after all if she werent special lucy watkins now as he made his way through the teeming streets of london he thought of her shy little smile of her soft voice of the pale little wisps of hair that came loose no matter how tightly plaited the rest was and of the taste of her lips of her uncommonly sweet smell of the charms he hadnt sampled yet but soon hoped to a constable and a tavernkeeper stood arguing outside the latters door the constable wagged his finger in the other fellows face marry there is another indictment upon thee he said severely for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house contrary to the law for the which i think thou wilt howl all victuallers do so the tavernkeeper protested whats a joint of mutton or two in a whole lent in a whole lent the constable said a whole lent with ash wednesday scarce begun thoult go to the dock for this beshrew me if thou dost not every soul is of a mind to crush out protestantism like it was a blackbeetle in amongst the sallat greens bad business heresy terrible bad protestantism heresy art daft george trimble whats that to do with a bit o mutton for the which thoust shown no small liking lents gone by liar the constable exclaimed in tones that couldnt mean anything but in the name of god keep your mouth shut he went on besides lents gone by have naught to do with now its all the calendar it is that has to do with heresy how the tavernkeeper demanded why for that it does thats how george trimble said lope sighed and went on his way he could have explained what the problem was but he didnt think either of the quarreling englishmen would have cared to listen to him by now the men who took money at the theatre recognized lope and waved him through as if he were one of the sharers among lord westmorlands men he wished he were the life of a spanish lieutenant was as nothing next to that which burbage or shakespeare or will kemp lived de vega was sure of it kemp threw back his head and howled like a wolf when lope walked into the theatre de vega gave back a courtiers bow which at least disconcerted the clown for a moment kemp he noticed wore no ashes on his forehead what did that mean did it mean anything with kemp you could never be sure swords clashed as a couple of actors rehearsed a fight scene one glance told de vega neither of them had ever used a blade in earnest burbage hed seen had some notion of what he was about these fellows the spaniard shook his head they were even worse than shakespeare whod never pretended to be a warrior burbage now boomed out the scottish kings lines canst thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart therein the patient must minister to himself replied the hireling playing the doctor burbage frowned lope had seen the scottish play a couple of times and admired it he knew or thought he knew what the actor was supposed to say next and sure enough someone hissed from the tiring room athrow physic to the dogs throw physic to the dogs ill none of it burbage finished and went on in his own voice my thanks master vincent the line would not come to me no need to praise my doing only that for which you took me into your company replied thomas vincent the new prompter and playbookkeeper he came out to nod to burbage you should reprove me if i keep silence he was about lopes age lean and seemed bright lope had learned he went to mass every sunday before the armada came hed been as zealous in attending protestant sunday services a trimmer de vega thought scornfully whichever way the wind blows thats the way hell go but a lot of men likely a majority were like that it made things easier for those who would rule them shakespeares like that too lope reminded himself he was no catholic when elizabeth ruled this land which was one more reason to reckon him an unlikely traitor hed made his compromises with the way things were the ones you had to worry about were those who refused to change no matter what refusing cost them geoffrey martin lope thought hed paid no special attention to the prompter while martin lived now that martin was dead it was too late sir edmund tilneyor if not the master of the revels someone in his officecould tell me more about him seek you master will richard burbage called an you do youve found him but that was will kemp not shakespeare the clown went from making a leg at lope to collapsing in a heap before him one of the better pratfalls hed seen de vega shook his head many thanks but nay i have that for which i came he bowed to burbage who looked surprised at his saying no and to kemp resisting the impulse to try to match the fools loosejointed toppling sprawl then he hurried out of the theatre captain guzman didnt think of this maybe ill learn something important even if i dont ill look busy if i have my own ideas and follow them up how can guzman complain about me he cantand if im busy on another play of my own well by god hell have a hard time complaining about that too have you a moment master hungerford shakespeare hated asking the question and the ones that would follow he hated it even more than he had when hed spoken with geoffrey martin when martin gave the wrong answers the inconvenient answers shakespeare hadnt known what would happen next now he did if blood flowed it would drip from his hands but the tireman only nodded certes master will what would you he flicked a speck of lint from a velvet robe what costumes have we for a roman play shakespeare asked a roman play the tireman frowned meseems we could mount one at need in most dramas no matter when or where they were set players wore clothes of current fashion audiences expected nothing else but roman plays were different people had a notion that the romans had dressed differently and so actors strode the boards in kneelength white tunics and in gilded helms with nodding crests mounted often insecurely above them despite his answer hungerfords frown didnt go away why ask you that though i know for a certainty we offer no roman plays any time soon nor grecian ones neither shakespeare nodded nervously you speak sooth but i am writing a roman play one that may be shown soon after its done ah hungerford quirked a gingery eyebrow theyd held their color better than his hair or his beard this alongside your king philip yes shakespeare said one syllable covering a lot of ground youve much to do then and scant time wherein to dot hungerford said shakespeare nodded that was a manifest truth the tireman asked and what title hath this latest boudicca shakespeare answered and waited to see what would come of that if jack hungerford knew latin and remembered his roman history the title would be plenty to alarm himand to hang shakespeare if he mentioned it to the wrong people but the name was only a nonsense word to hungerford shakespeare saw as much in his eyes scarce sounds roman at all the tireman said it is though shakespeare said and summarized the plot in a few sentences even before he finished hungerford held up a hand are you daft master shakespeare never would sir edmund let that be seen no more would the dons our livesd answer for the tenth part oftno for the hundredth i knowt shakespeare said marry how i knowt and yet i purpose going forward even so what say you jack hungerford didnt say anything for some little while he stroked his chin studying the poet you sought to sound me once before on this matter eh i did shakespeare agreed the tireman shook his head no sir you did not you fought shy of t then and if i did shakespeare threw that back as a challenge you hold my life in the hollow of your hand close it and i perish i wonder hungerford murmured tell me an you will did you discover yourself to geoff martin shakespeare said not a word he hoped his face gave no answer either hungerford grunted softly if i say you nay will constable strawberry that good and honest man sniff after my slayer like a dog too old to take a scent after a bone that never was there i devised not poor geoffs death nor compassed it shakespeare said the which is not what i asked the tireman observed shakespeare only waited jack hungerford grunted again im with you he said i have not so much life left and mislike living on my knees what remains praise god shakespeare exclaimed i know not how we could have gone on without you with a new tireman belike as we have a new prompter hungerford said will you tell me im mistook shakespeare wished he could and knew he couldnt hungerford nodded to himself a roman play ist but tell me what you require master will and you shall havet presently my thanks my thanks if you cozen me not if you fly not to the spaniards soon as i turn my back which of the boys thought you to play the part wherefrom the piece takes its name hungerford asked why tom of course shakespeare answered no woman ill swear could better a woman personate but the tireman shook his head he will not serve what swounds why not item his elder brother is a priest item his uncle is a sergeant amongst queen isabellas guards jack hungerford ticked off points on his fingers as he made them item his father gave the rood screen at their parish church such adornments having been ordained once more on our being returned to romish ways item the lad himself more than once in my hearing hath said hes fain on becoming a man to follow his brother into the priesthood he glanced over at shakespeare shall i go on by my troth no would you had not gone so long shakespeare made an unhappy hissing noise why knew i so little of the lad his leanings why ill tell you why master will hungerford chuckled to you hes but a boy playing parts writ or by you or by some other poet you think on him more than you think on a fancy robe some player wears ay but not much more did you think on him as a boy now his voice trailed away then picked up again i warrant you id need to instruct master kit in none o this belike thats so indeed im sure kit hath made it a point to learn all worth knowing of the boy from top to bottom just so your bent being otherwise you the tireman broke off the look he sent shakespeare was somewhere between reproachful and horrified you said that of a purpose i shakespeare looked as innocent as he could his own worries helped keep glee from his face as he went on if the part be for another as meseems it needs must what of him how keep we him in ignorance of this our design haply his voice will break or his beard sprout hes rising fifteen hungerford said some troubles themselves resolve haply shakespeare made the word into a curse ahaply suffices not you spoke of geoff martin are you fain to have his fate befall a boy for no cause but that hes of romish faith he will die the death i tell you unless he be eased from this company ere we give our boudicca if ever we givet he thought unhappily the tireman frowned too sits the wind in that corner nowhere else shakespeare answered whats a mere boy to those whod dice for a kingdom an they think thus should they win it hungerford asked are their foes better shakespeare returned saw you the auto de fe this past autumn nay i sawt not for which i give thanks to god but ive seen others and i take your point jack hungerford bared his teeth in what was anything but a smile would someones hands were clean pilates were he washed em shakespeare said hungerford showed his teeth again with a sigh shakespeare continued would theyd tasked another with the deed but sith tis mine how can i dot save with the best thats in me hungerford eyed him they might have chose worse in many several ways they might have you do me oermuch honor shakespeare said the tireman shook his head shakespeare refused to let himself be distracted what of tom we must separate him from ourselves if he is to be driven hence dick burbage is the man to dot the tireman said ill speak to him shakespeare said at once the more someone anyone else did the less he would have to do himself and the less guilty he would feel he looked down at his hands they already had geoffrey martins blood on them he didnt want toms there too he didnt even want the burden of pushing tom from lord westmorlands men he already carried too many burdens only when he went looking for burbage did he stop and think about the burdens the other player carried tom was without a doubt the best boy actor the company had once he was gone which of the others would take his roles which of the others could take his roles how much damage would his leaving cause to performances on the other hand how much damage would his staying cause to him burbage listened with more patience than shakespeare would have expectedwith more patience in fact than the poet thought he could have mustered himself at last he let out a long sigh what of the company will be left once you have your way with it he asked somberly would you liefer see tom dead shakespeare asked id liefer see him playing burbage said tell me he is not of the romish persuasion and have your wish with another sigh burbage shook his head i cannot for he is he set his meaty hand on shakespeares shoulder but hear me will hear me well i am your servant shakespeare said buzz buzz burbage said scornfully go to will i dance to your piping now and well we both knowt would it were my piping my friend for my feet too tread its measures the which brings me back to what id tell you mark my words now mark em well the purpose you undertake is dangerous the friends you have uncertain the time itself unsorted and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition say you so shakespeare asked say you so marry i do shakespeare wished he could fly into a great temper i say unto you you are a shallow cowardly hind and you lie he wanted to shout by the lord our plot is as good a plot as ever was laid our friends true and constant a good plot good friends and full of expectation a good plot very good friends what a frostyspirited rogue are you he wanted to say all that and more besides he wanted to but could not what oft he said and did not try to hide his own bitterness we go forward een soforward or to the spaniards theres your choice and none other burbages eyes had the look of a foxs as the hounds closed in damn you will anon shakespeare said understanding burbages hunted expression all too wellhed felt hunted himself for months but for now youll see to tom ill dot burbage said forward shakespeare thought now here is an interesting bit of business captain baltasar guzman held up a sheet of paper lope de vega hated it when his superior did that it was always for effect guzman never let him actually read the papers he displayed and lope was in a testy mood anyhow for his visit to sir edmund tilney had yielded exactly nothing useful about geoffrey martin and whoever had slain him with such patience as he could muster de vega said please tell me more sir well senior lieutenant you will know better than i how the pretty boy actors in these english theatrical companies draw sodomites as a bowl of honey draws flies guzman said oh yes sir lope agreed it is a scandal a shame and a disgrace captain guzman waved the paper we now have leave to go after one of these wicked fellows and an important one too ah de vega said who if it turned out to be christopher marlowe he would go after the english poet with a heavy heart marlowe didnt hide that he loved boys far from hiding it in fact he flaunted it he was so blatant about his leanings lope sometimes wondered if part of him wanted to be caught and punished whatever that part wanted the rest of him would not care to be humiliated and then executed but guzman said a certain anthony bacon do you know the name madre de dios i should hope so lope exclaimed the older brother of francis the nephew of lord burghley how did you learn that such a man favored this dreadful vice how is it that you can think of arresting such an important man with such prominent connections for sodomy was what he really meant the rich and the powerful often got away with what would ruin someone ordinary but not here not here guzman answered oh this bacons habits are not in doubt even as long ago as when he was an english spy in france he debauched one of his young servants he was lucky the french court was full of pervertshis lip curledor he would have suffered more than he did we arent arresting him for what happened in france while elizabeth was still queen of england are we lope asked even for a charge as heinous as sodomy that might go too far but baltasar guzman shook his head by no means senior lieutenant he has taken up with one of the boy actors in a company and there can be no doubt hes stuck it in as far as it would go do you know do you have the faintest idea whats being said of you and enrique lope wondered he shook his head guzman couldnt possibly he couldnt speak with such disgusted relish about what anthony bacon had done if hed done the like himself or if he knew people thought hed done the like lope had seen good acting in the spanish theatre and in the english but nothing to compare to guzmans performance if performance it were a question your excellency de vega asked captain guzman nodded lope went on how is it that this falls to us and not to the english inquisition bacon has committed the sin of buggery not treason against isabella and albert or rebellion against his most catholic majesty as it happens don diego flores de valdas referred the matter to us guzman replied it may yet come down to treason remembernot so long ago your precious shakespeare visited the house anthony and francis bacon share why we still dont know we have no idea but if we take bacon and squeeze him till squeeze him till the grease runs out of him lope broke in captain guzman looked blank lope explained bacon in english means the same as tocino in spanish does it guzmans smile was forced shall we stick to the business at hand if we take bacon and squeeze him we may finally find out why shakespeare was thereand from that who knows where we might go if it were up to me burghley would have lost his head with the rest of elizabeths chief officers king philip ordered otherwise de vega said his superior grimaced but that was an argument no one could oppose guzman said we will go seize bacon then we will seize him and we will see how he fries he waited for lope to laugh lope dutifully did even if hed made the joke first half an hour later the two of them rode hotspur out of london towards westminster at the head of a troop of spanish cavalrymen they had passed through ludgate and were trotting west along fleet street when lope suddenly whipped his head around what is it asked baltasar guzman who missed very little i thought that fellow walking back towards london the one who scrambled off the road to get out of our way was shakespeare de vega answered is it worth our while to stop and find out guzman considered then shook his head no even if it was he could have too many good reasons reasons that have nothing to do with the bacons house for being on this side of london walking in his own city is not evidence of anything and neither is getting out of the way of cavalrymen muy bien lope said i would have used these arguments with you but if you hadnt been persuaded he shrugged you are the captain yes i am guzman bared his teeth in a hunters grin and now i want a taste of baconof tocino eh now he wouldnt leave the pun alone the troop of horsemen pounded up drury lane westminster seemed to lope a different world from london less crowded with far bigger far grander homes homes that would have done credit to a spanish nobleman only the abominable weather reminded him in which kingdom he dwelt captain guzman reined in he pointed to a particularly splendid halftimbered house that one he said senior lieutenant de vega you will interpret for us i am at your service your excellency lope dismounted so did guzman and the cavalrymen a few of the latter held horses for the rest the others drew swords and pistols and advanced on the estate behind the two officers i hope the heretics inside put up a fight and give us an excuse to sack the place a trooper said hungrily god cover my arse with boils if you couldnt bring away a years pay without half trying a couple of other men growled greedy agreement by god if they give us any trouble we will sack them captain guzman declared theyre only englishmen they have no business standing in our way they have no right to stand in our way the cavalrymen nodded staring avidlywolfishlyat the house upon which they advanced pale english faces stared out of them through the windows whose small glass panes were held together by strips of lead before de vega and guzman reached the door it opened a frightenedlooking but welldressed servant bowed to them what would ye gentles he asked why come ye hither with such a host at your backs we require the person of senorof masteranthony bacon he to be required to give answer to certain charges laid against him lope answered he quickly translated for captain guzman his superior nodded approval then turned and rapped out an order to the cavalrymen surround the place let no one leave as the troopers hurried to obey the house servant said bide here a moment my masters ill return presently with one wholl tell ye more than i can he ducked into the house but did not presume to close the door can they hide him in there lope asked not from us guzman spoke with great conviction and ill tear the place down around their ears if i think thats what theyre trying the servant was as good as his word coming back almost at once behind him strode a man made several inches taller by a highcrowned widebrimmed hat the newcomers enormous fancy ruff and velvet doublet proclaimed him a person of consequence so did his manner though no bigger than lope apart from that hat he contrived to look down his nose at him when he spoke it was in elegant latin what do you desire so much for my translating de vega thought i desire to know who you are to begin with captain guzman replied also in latin i i am francis bacon the englishman replied he was in his late thirtiesnot far from lopes agewith a long face handsome but for a rather tuberous nose a pale complexion dark beard and eyebrows the latter formidably expressive and the air of a man certain he was talking to his inferiors it made de vega want to bristle it put baltasar guzmans back up too you are the younger brother of anthony bacon he snapped i have that honor yes who are you and why do you wish to know guzman quivered with anger i am an officer of his most catholic majesty philip ii of spain and i have come to arrest your brother sir for the abominable crime of sodomy so much for your honor now where is he speak or be sorry for your silence francis bacon had nerve he eyed guzman as if the captain were something noxious hed found floating in a mud puddle you may be an officer of the king of spain but this is england show me your warrant or else get hence for the house of everyone is to him as his castle and fortress as well for his defense against injury and violence as for his repose guzmans rapier cleared the scabbard with a wheep lope also drew his sword backing his superiors play the troopers with pistols behind them pointed their weapons at bacons face damnation to you and damnation to your castle sir the dapper little noble ground out here is my warrant obey it or die the choice is yours for a moment lope thought francis bacon would let himself be killed on the spot but then very visibly the englishman crumpled i beseech your lordships to be merciful to a broken reed he said ask i will answer in spanish captain guzman said to lope you see fear of death makes cowards of them all yes your excellency de vega answered in the same language watching bacons face he added have a care sir i think he understands this tongue whether he cares to speak it or not thank you i will note it i promise you guzman returned to latin as he gave his attention back to the englishman so you are the brother of the abominable sodomite anthony bacon i francis bacon bit his lip i am anthony bacons brother yes i said so where is your brother he is not here the point of guzmans rapier leaped out and caressed bacons throat just above his ruff just below his beard that is not what i asked englishman one more time where is he iii do not know you may take my life but before god it is the truth i do not know day before yesterday he left this house he did not say whither he was bound i have not seen him since tipped off lope wondered aloud by whom captain guzman demanded what spaniard would do such a wicked treacherous thing perhaps another sodomite a secret one de vega said guzman grimaced and grunted yes damn it that could be or it could be that seaor homeishiscastle here is lying through his teeth hell be sorry if he is but it could be well find out by god he turned and called over his shoulder to the cavalrymen at his back now we take the place apart the troopers whooped with glee one of the first things they found in the front hall was not anthony bacon himself but a painting of him he was even paler than his brother with a longer wispier more pointed beard and with a long thin straight nose rather than a lumpy one but for their noses the resemblance between the two of them was striking pointing to the portrait lope told the cavalrymen here is the wretch we seek whoever finds him will have a reward he jingled coins in his belt pouch the troopers grinned and nudged one another with a grin of his own de vega said go on my hounds hunt down this rabbit for us the spaniards went through the bacons home with a methodical ferocity that said they would have done well as robbersand that might have said some of them had more than a little practice at the trade they examined every space that might possibly have held a man from the cellars to the kitchens to the attic they knocked holes in several walls some protestants houses had preacher holes concealed with marvelous cunning a couple of troopers went out onto the roof lope listened to their boots clumping above his head they did not find anthony bacon his brother francis asked how much of my own will they leave me by the way the troopers pouches got fatter and fatter as time went by the question seemed reasonable but captain guzman was not inclined to listen to reason his hand dropped to the hilt of his rapier once more you will cease your whining he said in a soft deadly voice otherwise i shall start inquiring amongst the younger servants here about your habits if he had any evidence that francis bacon liked boys too he hadnt mentioned it to lope but if that was a shot in the dark it proved an inspired one the younger bacon sucked in a horrified breath and went even whiter than the portrait of his brother with more clumping the cavalrymen on the roof came down the ones whod gone through the house returned to the front hall no luck your excellencies their sergeant said not a slice of this bacon did we find now he was making de vegas joke lope did his best to look on the bright side well run him down baltasar guzman nodded well run him down or well run him out of the kingdom let him play the bugger in france or denmark they deserve him lets go he led lope and the troop of cavalrymen out of the house francis bacon stared after them but said not another word as lope mounted his horse and started riding back to london he thought nobody would dare call guzman a marican now not after the way hes hunted anthony bacon the troop had almost got back to the barracks before something else along those lines occurred to him no one would dare call captain guzman a marican now but does that really prove he isnt one he worried at that the rest of the day but found no answer to it the expression will kemp aimed at shakespeare lay halfway between a leer and a glower well master poet what have you done with tom naught shakespeare answered blinking is he not here he looked around the theatre hed just got there a little later than he might have he saw no sign of the companys best boy actor kemp went on leering an youve done naught what wish you youd done with him naught shakespeare said again this time in some alarm tom was a comelymore than a comelyyouth and such liaisons happened often enough in the tight altogether masculine world of the theatre but what might be a jest at another time could turn deadly now if the spaniards or the english inquisition started wondering if he were a sodomite they might also start wondering if he were a traitor what was buggery after all but treason against the king of heaven but from the tiring room came a sharp command go to kemp give over had richard burbage spoke to the clown like that a fight would have blown up on the spot not even kemp though failed to respect jack hungerford he asked the tireman know you somewhat o this matter then ay somewhat and more than somewhat the which is somewhat more than you hungerford answered whats toward then master hungerford shakespeare asked maybe if everyone stuck to facts no one would throw any more insults around and maybe the horse will learn to sing shakespeare thoughtone more bit of grecian not quite folly he had from christopher marlowe my knowledge is not certain mind the tireman said shakespeare braced himself to squelch will kemp before the clown could offer sardonic agreement there but kemp for a wonder simply waited for hungerford to go on and go on he did some will know and some will have guessed tom hath been an object of desire for those whose affections stand in that quarter that proved too much for kemp to resist when their affections stand he said they want to stick em up his he didnt finish somebodyshakespeare didnt see whoshied a pebble or a clod of dirt at him he let out an irate squawk before he could do anything more shakespeare broke in to say carry on master hungerford i pray you gramercy so i shall as i said hes a ganymede fit to tempt any whod fain be jove but even as jove cast down saturn so toms jove himselfs been oerthrown anthony bacons fled london a short jump ahead of the dons bacon shakespeare said lord burghleys nephew hed met burghley in the house that belonged to anthony bacon and his younger brother hungerford nodded the same methinks he is fled the tireman nodded again not caught yet by all accounts he being a man of parts haply he may cross to the continent still free to the continent no sir no kemp said were he continent hed need not flee now would he and forsooth a man of parts i knew not till this moment sausage was a bacons troublous part shakespeare groaned hungerford looked pained kemp preened shakespeare asked tom was bacons ingle then i own i have seen bacon here though never to my certain knowledge overtopping the bounds of decency ato my certain knowledge kemp echoed in a mocking whine why think you he came hither for the plays he laughed that idea to scorn adding quotha his brother could write the like did he please to dot a rasher bacon never spake shakespeare said indignantly will kemp opened his mouth for another gibe of his own then did a better double take than most he used on stage sending shakespeare a reproachful stare the poet looked back blandly missing the byplay jack hungerford said i fear me tomll not return to the boards hes smirched and would smirch us did we use him henceforward that had several possibilities kemp rose to none of them shakespeare eyed him in some surprise the wealth of his wit outdone by the wealth of his choices the poet wondered no other explanation made sense then suddenly shakespeare raised a hand to his mouth to smother a laugh what did paul say in his epistle to the romans all things work together for good to them that love god that was the verse now he couldnt have to worry about either asking catholic tom to play boudicca or finding some good reason for not asking him he hadnt just found a good reasonthe spaniards themselves had handed him one but the more he thought about it the less inclined he was to laugh maybe the way that verse from pauls epistle had worked out here was a sign god truly lay on his side lord burghleys side elizabeths side englands side shakespeare hoped so with all his heart their side needed every scrap of help it could get hungerford went on with his own train of thought he being smirched i wonder wholl play his parts henceforward will kemp had avoided temptation once twice no he said why man had this bacon not played with his parts wed worry on other things the tireman coughed shakespeare would have been more annoyed at the clown had the identical thought not popped into his mind the instant before kemp said it the days play was another offering of romeo and juliet they keenly felt toms absence and the groundlings let them hear about it caleb who played juliet in his place made a hash of his lines several times and wouldnt have measured up to tom even if he hadnt richard burbage was not pleased he bearded shakespeare in the tiring room after the performance i am told this was the spaniards doing he said heavily i am told the same shakespeare answered burbage glowered at him were i not so told id blame you since this madness of yours commenced the company is stirred as with a spoona long spoon one fit to sup with devils shakespeare asked and burbage gave him a cold nod that hurt to try to hide how much it hurt shakespeare busied himself with the lacings of his doublet when he thought he could speak without showing what he felt he said this came not from me hath naught to do with me and i am called a devil fort how would you use me were i guilty of somewhat having spent all your wrath upon mine innocence you came to me you said tom needs must avoid else thus and so advanceth not what said i i said id liefer see him playing you said also youd tend to it regardless burbage ignored that well hes gone now his gesture suggested crumpling a scrap of waste paper and throwing it away then he drew himself up i lead this company dyou deny it not i nor would i never shakespeare said at once he might as well have kept silent burbage went on as if he had repeating i lead this company the land we stand on the house we play inwe burbages lease the one and own the other dyou deny that how could i shakespeare asked reasonably all true every word of t all right then all right burbages angry exhalation might have been the snort of a bull just before it lowered its head and charged heres what id ask of you if i in any way obstruct you who takes my place and what befalls me shakespeare wished he could pretend he didnt understand what his fellow player was talking about he couldnt not without making himself into a liar miserably he said i know not god damn you then will burbages thunderous explosion made heads turn his way and shakespeares all over the tiring room shakespeare wished he could sink through the floor as hed sunk down through the trap door while playing the ghost in prince of denmark when the buzz of conversation picked up again and let him speak without having everyone in the crowded room hear what he said he answered there is in this something you see not burbage folded his arms across his broad chest that being by his tone he believed he saw everything and all too clearly but shakespeare said an i prove a thing obstructive i too am swept away for another i know not whom you reckon me agent dick would i were would i might persuade myself i were for a mans always fain to think himself free agent i am none though i am but tool tool to be cast aside quick as any other useless thing of wood or iron he waited watching burbage the player was a man who delighted in being watched he probably made up his mind well before he deigned to let shakespeare know hed made up his mind he played deciding as if the theatre were full and every eye on him alone mayhap he said at lasta king granting mercy to a subject who probably did not deserve it shakespeare felt he ought to applaud instead he said im for bishopsgate ive endless work to spend on king philip and on burbage was vain and badtempered but not a fool he would not name or even come close to naming boudiccanot here not where so many ears might hear yes shakespeare let it go at that he set his hat on his head having his own share of a players vanity he tugged it down low on his forehead to hide his receding hairline hed squandered a few shillings on nostrums and elixirs purported to make hair grow back one smelled like tar another like roses yet another like cat piss none did any good over the past year or so hed stopped wasting his money the lenten threepenny supper at his ordinary was a stockfish porridge stockfish took hours of soaking to soften and to purge itself of the salt that preserved it even then it was vile it was also cheap and doubtless helped pad the places profit because the ordinary was crowded shakespeare worked on king philip there the more of the other play he wrote the more he worried about strangers eyes seeing it when he went back to his lodging house he intended to sit by the fire and see if he could change horses most of the other people who dwelt with the widow kendall would lie abed by then his landlady herself remained awake when he came in give you good even she said and you my lady shakespeare swept off his hat and gave her a bow lieutenant de vega might have admired jane kendall smiled and simpered she enjoyed being made much of but her smile disappeared when shakespeare put a fresh chunk of wood on the fire hed known it would and had hoped to sweeten her beforehand no such luck master will she said her voice sharp with annoyance with the winter so hard have you any notion how dear woods got in sooth my lady youd have set it there yourself ere long shakespeare said as soothingly as he could youd be wood to spare wood would you not he smiled both to sweeten her further and because his wordplay pleased him it failed to please her for she failed to notice it daft he calls me she said to no one in particularperhaps she was letting god know of his sins bought he the wood he spares not marry he did not cared he what it cost marry not that either but called he me wood marry he did hell drive me to frenzy thus to frenzy and to bed on that anticlimactic note she left the parlor shakespeare pushed a table and a stool up close to the fire he took out the latest sheet of paper for boudiccano othersand set to work a couple of minutes later he yawned over the years hed got used to writing plays in odd moments snatched from other work and sleep something brushed against his ankle before he could start the cat said meow good den mommet shakespeare scratched the gray tabby behind the ears and stroked its back mommet purred ecstatically when shakespeare stopped stroking the cat so he could write it sat up on its hind legs and tapped his shin with a front paw as ifto say why dont you go on he glanced down at it a trifle uneasily would a common cat sit so he wondered or hath this beast more wit than a common cat still purring the animal twisted into an improbable pose and began licking its private parts and anus shakespeare laughed would a familiar do anything so undignified cicely sellis appeared in the doorway god give you good even master shakespeare she saidshe certainly had no trouble pronouncing the name of the lord as witches were said to do have you seen ah there he is mommet the cat went on licking itself as shakespeare answered and you mistress sellis she snapped her fingers and cooed mommet kept ignoring her with a small rueful shrug she smiled at shakespeare he does as he would not as i would care killed a cat or so they say the poet replied laughing the cunning woman said if he die of care hell live forever but how is it with you did he disturb you from your work do i no and no shakespeare said the first no truthful the second polite i am well enough how ist with yourself well enough as you say cicely sellis answered truly i have been pleased to make your acquaintance for your name i hear on everyones lips you ken my creditors then shakespeare said better they should come to you for their fortunes than to me a thing i had not heard was that you were in debt she paused then sent him a severe look oh you quibble on afortune had i one my lady i should not quibble ont she snorted that made the cat look up from grooming itself she snapped her fingers again the cat rose to its feet stretched purredand rubbed up against shakespeare once more vile fickle beast cicely sellis said in mock fury shakespeare reached down and stroked the cat it began to purr even louder ay theres treason in em in their very blood he said how then differ they from men she asked that put him back on uncomfortable groundall the more so considering what he was writing he stopped petting the gray tabby it looked up at him and meowed when he didnt start again it walked over to its mistress and now you think ill make much of you eh she said as she picked it up it purred she laughed belike youre right she glanced over to shakespeare shall i bid you good night by no means he answered polite once more polite and curious youll think me vain mistress sellis but from whose lips hear you of me vanity had something to do with the question but only so much he wasnt richard burbage but he might learn something useful something that would help keep him alive the more he knew the better his chances he was sure of that he was also sureunpleasantly surethey werent very good no matter how much he knew from whose lips cicely sellis pursed her own before answering ill not tell you that not straight out many who come to me would liefer not be known to resort to a cunning woman there are those whod call me witch i believe it shakespeare said whats in a name he wondered the english inquisition could no doubt give him a detailed answer well you might she said but believe also no day goes by when i hear not some phrase of yours repeated by one who likes the sound likes the sense and knows not nor cares whence it cometh awho ever loved that loved not at first sight or shakespeare laughed your pardon i pray you but that is not mine and kit marlowe would wax wroth did i claim it oh she laughed too its i who must cry pardon for speaking of your words and speaking forth anothers what am i then but a curst unfaithful jade like unto mine own cat i speak sooth even so you do me too much honor shakespeare said i do you honor certes but too much give me leave to doubt it why i should not be surprised to hear the dons admiring your plays he looked down at what hed just written queen boudicca who had been flogged by the roman occupiers of britannia and whose daughters had been violated was urging the iceni to revolt saying but mercy and love are sins in rome and hell if rome be earthly why should any knee with bending adoration worship her shes vicious and your partial selves confess aspires to the height of all impiety therefore tis fitter i should reverence the thatched houses where the britons dwell in careless mirth where the blest household gods see nought but chaste and simple purity tis not high power that makes a place divine nor that men from gods derive their line but sacred thoughts in holy bosoms stord make people noble and the place adord what would the dons say if they heard those lines what will the dons say when they hear those lines he laughed he couldnt help himself give me leave to doubt they will admire them cicely sellis misunderstood the reason for his mirth if mirth it was she sounded angry as she said if you credit yourself not who will credit you in your despite not the dons methinks he answered but have i not seen em mongst the groundlings she returned and have i not seen you yourself in converse earnest with em come they to the theatre for that they may dispraise you damn you lieutenant de vega shakespeare thought not for the first time not only did the man threaten to discover his treason whenever he appeared but now hed just cost him an argument shakespeares fury at the spaniard was all the greater for being so completely irrational when he did not respond the cunning woman smiled a smile that told him she knew shed won she said when the dons and their women come to see me shall i ask em how they think on you the dons come to see you mistress sellis shakespeare said slowly in good sooth they do she answered why should they not be they not men like other men have they not fears like other men sicknesses like other men fear not their doxies they are with child or poxed or both at once ay they see me some o the donsd liefer go to the swarthy wandering egyptians whom in their own land they have also but they see me very well i believet an it please you though i would not have my name in your mouth no nor in the spaniards ears neither shakespeare thought he spoke quietly calmly but mommets fur puffed up along his back the cats eyes reflecting the firelight flared like torches as it hissed and spat by the way it stood between shakespeare and its mistress it might have been a watchdog defending its home easy my poppet my chick easy cicely sellis bent and stroked the cat little by little its fur settled once it began to purr once more she looked up at shakespeare fear not it shall be as you desire for which i thank you ill leave you tot then she said scooping mommet up into her arms good night and good fortune she spoke as if she could bestow the latter shakespeare wished someone could he would gladly take it wherever it came from vii lope de vega looked up from the paper i pray you forgive me master shakespeare he said but your character is not easy for one unaccustomed to it you are not the first to tell me so the english poet answered and i thus conclude the stricture holds some truth they sat on the edge of the stage in the theatre legs dangling down towards the dirt where the groundlings would stand behind them swords clashed as players practiced their moves for the afternoons show looking over his shoulder lope could tell at a glance which of them had used a blade in earnest and which only strutted on the stage but that was not his worry the nearly illegible words on the sheet in his left hand were he pointed to one passage that had once hed deciphered it particularly pleased him this is your heretic queen elizabeth speaking to his most catholic majestys commander as she goes to the tower shakespeare nodded just so it hath the ring of truth lope said and began to read stay spanish brethren gracious conqueror victorious parma rue the tears i shed a mothers tears in passion for her land and if thy spain were ever dear to thee o think england to be as dear to me sufficeth not that i am brought hither to beautify thy triumphs and thy might captive to thee and to thy spanish yoke but must my folk be slaughterd in the streets for valiant doings in their countrys cause o if to fight for lord and commonweal were piety in thine it is in these will it serve shakespeare asked anxiously most excellent well lope replied at once it is in sooth a fine touch her pleading for mercy thus how came you to shape it so i bethought me of what she might tell king philip himself did he come to london then made her speak to his general those same words shakespeare said ah sitting lope couldnt bow but did take off his hat and incline his head to show how much the answer pleased him most clever and then the duke of parmas reply is perfectperfect i tell you he read again at mine uncles bidding i spare your life for mercy is above this sceptrd sway tis mighty in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown it is enthroned in the hearts of kings and blesseth him that gives and him that takes if it please you i am content the englishman murmured please me you are too modest sir lope cried while shakespearemodestlyshook his head the spaniard went on would king philip might read these wondrous words you write in his behalf as i live hed praise em know you the escorial outside madrid i have heard oft shakespeare said twill be his most catholic majestys monument forevermore lope said and your king philip meseems will live as long may he have many years shakespeare said in a low voice may this play remain for years unstaged lope crossed himself yes may it be so though i fear me the day will come sooner than that he tapped the sheet of paper with a fingernail i shall take back to my superiors a report most excellent of this gramercy the englishman told him no no no de vega wagged a hand back and forth tis i should thank you seaor again you prove yourself the poet don diego knew you to be will kemp sidled up to them what business have you put in for a clown he asked in a squeaky whine it is a play on the death of a great king lope said coldly he did not like kemp all the more reason for japes and jests the clown said you are mistaken de vega said more coldly still to his surprise shakespeare stirred beside him no lieutenant haply not he said and lope felt betrayed shakespeare went on sweeten the posset with some honey and down it goes and sinks deep without the same he shook his head i have trouble believing this lope said then whos the fool will kemp said he went on a was the first that ever bore arms a sudden shift of voice for awhy he had none back to the original what art a heathen how dost thou understand the scripture the scripture says adam digged could he dig without arms ill put another question to thee if thou answerest me not confess thyself confess thyself a blockhead lope broke in what is this nonsense quietly shakespeare said it is from my prince of denmark sir the which you were kind enough to praise not long since kemp bent and took lopes head in both hands the spaniard tried to twist away but could not the clown was stronger than he looked solemnlyand lope realized after a moment doing an excellent imitation of richard burbagekemp intoned aalas poor yorick i knew him as if lopes head were the skull of the dead clown in the play ai knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft he kissed lope de vega on the mouth and let him go furious lope sprang to his feet his rapier hissed free whoreson knave thou diest he roared hold shakespeare said give over he made his point with words kemp seemed too stupid to care whether he lived or died pointing to lope he jeered he hath no words and so needs must make his with the sword with a mocking bow he added fear no more kisses im not so salt a rogue that you shall make a bacon of me all the contagions of the south light on you lope said but he did not thrust at the hateful clown he regretted his restraint a moment later for kemp bowed once more and answered why here you are go to both of you shakespeare said give over master de vega this once i will pray pardon in the clowns name for i want no pardon not from the likes of him kemp broke in which almost got him spitted yet again silence one word more shall make me chide thee if not hate thee the english poet told him shakespeare turned back to lope i will pray pardon ins name sir for how else but by clowning shall a clown answer breathing heavily de vega sheathed his blade for your sake master shakespeare i will put by my quarrel but it was not for shakespeares sake or not altogether that he took it no further shakespeare gave him an honorable excuse yes and he seized on it but will kemp demons of hell torment him lope thoughthad been right and had proved himself right no matter how offensively hed done it lope wouldnt admit that to the clown but couldnt help admitting it to himself i thank you shakespeare said not i kemp minced away sticking out his backside at every step through clenched teeth lope said let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in his own house in sooth hes wise enough to play the role shakespeare answered with a sigh and to do that well craves a kind of wit he doth indeed show some sparks that are like witbut not much like it de vega said and what passes for his wit likes me not much with another sigh shakespeare said have you not betimes seen it with players that differences twixt whom they play and who they are smudge even in their own minds i have but lope would not leave it alone if this be so with kemp send him to how is the place whither you send distraught and lunatic people called to bethlem within bishopsgate shakespeare replied at once to bethlem gracias lope said let him live there when not upon the stage and make a spectacle for the general even when he plays not the english poet only spread his hands as if to ask what can you do and since kemps foibles truly werent shakespeares fault de vega spread his hand too silently answering nothing at all aloud he went on i shall take my superior as i say a good report of your progress which will also i doubt not shortly reach don diegos ear i am glad it pleases you shakespeare said and i warrant you once master kemp hath the lines wherewith to work his foolery hell make a proper man as one shall see in a summers day a most lovely gentlemanlike man god grant it be so lope knew he didnt sound convinced he bowed i go when he got back to the spanish barracks enrique wouldnt let him in to see captain guzman till hed recited and translated shakespeares lines for elizabeth and the duke of parma when hed finished guzmans servant kissed his bunched fingertips like a lovesick youth again senior lieutenant i envy you your fluency in english if only i spoke better i would be with you at the theatre every moment until my principal beat me with sticks to hold me to his service lope believed him his excellency would beat you to get you not to do something he observed with diego he didnt go on enrique was clever enoughmore than clever enoughto draw his own pictures and now that i have sung for the privilege be so kind as to take me to your principal of course if you will do me the favor of accompanying me baltasar guzman listened attentively to lope when de vega started to quote the english though his superior held up a hand spare me that i dont know enough of the language to follow give me the gist en espaaol certainly your excellency lope said and obeyed when hed finished guzman nodded this all sounds well enough lieutenant i have one question though lope nodded too looking as if he awaited nothing more eagerly captain guzman asked can you be sure no treason lurks here that an englishman would hear but you do not you have harped on shakespeares subtlety before the question was better more serious more important than lope had looked for i he began and then shook his head no sir i cannot be sure of that i am fluent in english but not perfect still the master of the revels will pass on the play before it appears i may miss this or that he will not yes that is so captain guzman nodded and looked relieved and sir edmund is most reliable he clicked his tongue between his teeth i have to make sure he stays reliable eh quis custodiet ipsos custodes de vega remarked just sowho watches the watchmen guzman turned latin into spanish he eyed lope who felt a sudden horrible fear the little nobleman might decide he ought to do that job but guzman shook his head reading de vegas thought youll stay where you are youre doing well there and i have no one else who could take your place so your precious shakespeare really is writing this play eh he really is your excellency lope answered good very good captain guzman said one more english whorepay him and he does what you want shakespeare was tired of cheese and stockfish and even of fresh fish what he wanted was a beefsteak hot and sizzling and full of juice when he grumbled to kate in the ordinary she leaned toward him and spoke in a low voice you can have what you crave though not for the threepence of a common supper ah he looked around only a couple of other men sat in the ordinary and they were quietly arguing over some business deal even so he answered in a whisper of his own your master hath fitted out a close room for such dealings so hath he done upstairs for a shilling with a laugh shakespeare shook his head stockfish it shall be did its being forbidden make a threepenny beefsteak suddenly quadruple in worth not to him and you were wise to take no chances on betraying yourself in a small way lest you discover your larger treason he thought kate said ive heard this is not truly lent at all the whichd make the eating of meat at this season no sin ive heard the same shakespeare admitted but the priests say otherwise and theirs is the word of weight he was pleased she thought he refrained from fear of sin as well as because of cost the more he had to hide the less he wanted anyone thinking he had anything hed almost finished his unsatisfying lenten supper when someone who was not a regular strode into the ordinary and looked around shakespeare needed a moment to realize that though he hadnt seen the fellow here before he knew him even so the newcomer recognized him at the same moment and walked over towards his table master shakespeare an i mistake not he said indeed constable strawberry shakespeare answered give you good even and you the constable perched on a stool he waved to kate a cup of sherrissack and yarely as the serving woman brought it shakespeare thanked heaven he hadnt brought boudicca to the ordinaryalthough he reminded himself uneasily walter strawberry could also have come to the house where he lodged fighting that unease he said what would you im turning up clods you might say strawberry replied gravely he nodded pleased with his own turn of phrase aye im turning up clods see yourself in a glass and youll turn up a great one the thought flickered through shakespeares mind he bit back the urge to fling it in strawberrys face will kemp wouldnt have hesitated but kemp had less to lose wearing his polite players mask shakespeare asked and what have you turned up somewhat of this somewhat of that strawberry answered for ensample that you and the expired prompter to wit one geoffrey martin were prompt to quarrel not long before the time of his untimely demise forgive me for speaking prose but there you have it i have worked with master martin since coming to london and joining lord westmorlands men shakespeare did his best to sound annoyed and not frightened we always quarrel when first i give him a play learned you that in your questioning constable strawberry solemnly nodded i did sir indeed i did and whats the whyfore behind it that he would change what i would were left unchanged shakespeare answered every man who shapes a play will quarrel thus with a companys prompter learned you that in your questioning i did sir strawberry repeated then whyshakespeare almost said whyfore himselfcome you here fear not master shakespeare i draw nearer the occasion of my occasion so i do the constable took a scrap of paper from his wallet peered down at it and then put it back dyou ken a man named frizer frizer the poet echoed strawberry nodded shakespeare shook his head and shrugged no sir that name i wot not of ingram frizer he calls himself strawberry went on ice ran through shakespeare he hoped his surprise and dismay didnt show that loudmouthed knifeman whod asked if geoff martin was causing trouble the poet made himself shrug again i am none the wiser sir ah well ive said the same thing the very same thing many a time so i have the constable held up his mug and called to kate here my dear fetch me another if youd be so genderous so can she scarce help being shakespeare remarked ah in sooth that likes me in a woman genderosity so it does i thank you for learning me of it strawberry laid a finger by the side of his nose and winked when the serving woman refilled his mug he patted her backside she poured wine in his lap he let out a startled squawk oh your pardon i pray you kate said sweetly and went back behind the counter strawberry fumed methought you said she was genderous of her person he grumbled dabbing at himself i saw no hint of thatmarry none he sipped what was left of the wine his expression still sour a misunderstanding belike shakespeare said ay truly for i understood the miss to be of her person the constable took another pull at the mug set it down and looked at shakespeare as if just realizing he was there ingram frizer he said again i told you sir i know not the man you told me oh yes you told me constable strawberry nodded and then kept on nodding as if he ran on clockwork but you ken a man who knows the aforespoken frizer not to my knowledge shakespeare said ah knowledge strawberry was still nodding perhaps wisely i know all manner of things i have no knowledge of but i say what i say the which being so in dispect of the man what man shakespeare demanded hoping a show of temper would mask his growing fear i pray you tell me who it is quickly and speak apace one more inch of delay is a south sea of discovery take the cork out of your mouth that i may drink your tidings pour this concealed man out of your mouth as wine comes out of a bottle as you like it sir i shall his name is nick skeres will you tell me you ken him not eh will you shakespeare would have liked to but dared not too many people had seen him with skeres and might give him the lie yes weve met he admitted we are not friends he and i but weve met not friends is it walter strawberry leaned forward using his bulk to intimidate be ye foes then say you so no shakespeare answered i say we are not friends i ken the man not well enough to call him friendnor he me id venture i see strawberry gave no sign as to whether he believed what the poet told him know you where this nick skeres locution is to be located where he dwells mean you said i not that very thing i dare say your pardon constable but i know not as i told you we are but acquaintances not friends he waited tensely for the next question strawberry would send his way the constable was not bright but he was diligent he mighthe plainly didneed longer than a more clever man would have to find his answers but he had a chance of finding them in the end not tonight though finishing his wine he got to his feet i thank you for passing the time of day with me master shakespeare i do haply twill prove in your regard much ado about nothing i hope it may so give you good den he lumbered out of the ordinary who was that man kate asked after strawberry closed the door behind him tell me he is your friend and you shall no more be mine god save me no shakespeare exclaimed he is a constable from shoreditch inquiring after the death of poor geoff martin of which i believe i have spoke somewhat a constable i might have known kate said darkly with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove himself an ass at bottom he is nothing elsebut an officious ass mind i would have more to say of him than that but let it go let it go put his hands on me would he marry id best bathe to wash the taint away a constable she muttered something else which shakespeare perhaps fortunately could not make out he had intended going back to his lodging and working on boudicca there hed just sat down in front of the fire though when cicely sellis came out of her room with a swarthy fellow who lifted his hat to her said muchas gracias and then vanished into the night as casually as he could shakespeare said that was a spaniard he hoped his words covered the pounding of his heart the cunning woman nodded he is friend to a woman who hath oft come hither and so thought to ask of me a question of his own i hope he paid well shakespeare said cicely sellis nodded again and smiled he did indeed the dons are fools with their money nothing less whether i gave him full satisfaction i know not though i dare hope ah shakespeare had been about to ask what the spaniard had wanted and had been afraid she wouldnt tell him now he thought he knew especially as the fellow was well into his middle years he hath a difficulty in rising to the occasion een so amusement glinted in cicely sellis eye and have you a physic for the infirmity ins firmity shakespeare coughed i do but inquire from curiosity mind certes that amused glint got brighter how shall i sayt oftentimes if a man believe i have this physic why then i do shakespeare found himself amused too strong reasons make strong actions then he asked betimes they do master shakespeare the cunning woman said ay betimes they do our remedies oft in ourselves do lie a truth without doubt a truth would more knew it now cicely sellis shook her head nay say not so were it other than a secret close kept who would visit cunning women do you publish it and i starve she clasped her hands together in mock distress no shakespeare laughed out loud as he too shook his head how not how could it be otherwise how ill tell you straight whats the common curse of mankind folly and ignorance to wisdom mans a fool that will not yield i do now mind me of a saying athe fool doth think he is wiseand you may as well forbid the sea for to obey the moon as or by oath remove or counsel shake the fabric of mans folly that is truth or there be liars you think not much of them god made i think god made themfools shakespeare said or will you quarrel not i cicely sellis said never let it be said i could do such an unchristian thing as that and ill leave you to your work now good sir lest you find reason to quarrel with me she dropped him a curtsy that might have come from a noblewomannot that hed ever had a noblewoman drop him a curtsyand drew back into her room god give you good even she said closing the door behind her and you shakespeare answered though he wasnt sure she heard he perched on the stool in front of the table then nervously got up and put more wood on the fire the widow kendall would complain in the morning when she found it gone but she wasnt here now and shakespeare needed the light he also needed to take a deep breath and calm himself before setting pen to paper on boudicca first constable strawberry then that whoreson spaniard swounds an i die not of an apoplexy twill be the hand of god on my shoulder holding me safe from harm it was perhaps not by accident that his mind and his pen turned to the revolt britain under the queen of the iceni raised against the romans and to the romans horrified response how would they feel seeing a province they thought subdued rise and smite em he wondered his pen began to move poenius postumus a roman officer began to speak on the page nor can rome task us with impossibilities or bid us fight against a flood we serve her that she may proudly say she hath good soldiers not slaves to choke all hazards who but fools that make no difference betwixt certain dying and dying well would fling their fames and fortunes into this britaingulf this quicksandruin that sinking swallows us what noble hand can find a subject fit for blood there or what sword room for his execution what air to cool us but poisond with their blasting breaths and curses where we lie buried quick above the ground and are with labouring sweat and breathless pain killd like slaves and cannot kill again shakespeare paused to read what hed just written and nodded in satisfaction he started to add something to poenius speech but his pen chose that moment to run dry muttering hoping he wouldnt lose his inspiration he inked it and resumed set me to lead a handful of my men against an hundred thousand barbarous slaves that have marchd name by name with romes best doers serve em up some other meat ill bring no food to stop the jaws of all those hungry wolves my regiments mine own he nodded again yes that would do nicely poenius would later kill himself for shame at not having joined suetonius victorious army meanwhile his anguished despair would move the play forwardand make the groundlings cheer his british female foe after the romans first conquered britain tacitus said theyd flogged boudicca and violated her daughters rumor said the spaniards had raped englands virgin queen after capturing her shakespeare didnt know whether rumor was true but he intended to use it in the play but not tonight he thought yawning he began to rest his head on his arms then jerked upright with alarm tingling through him if he fell asleep in front of the hearth and someone else got a look at what he was writing if that happened he was a dead man and lord burghleys plan dead with him he made himself get up and put away the deadly dangerous manuscript before he went to bed his last thought as slumber seized him was i may not make this business easier but i will not make it harder when lope de vega walked into his chamber he expected to find diego asleep he wouldnt even have been angry if he had it couldnt have been far from midnight the dice had rolled lopes way and hed stayed in the game longer than hed expected gambling during lent was probably a sin whether it was or not it was certainly profitable a lamp burned in the outer room where diego dwelt the servant wasnt even in bed but sitting on a stool lope grinned at him if you sleep all day will you stay awake all night why arent you hed intended to say snoring but his voice trailed away he stared at diego in astonished dismay his servant stared back more appalled still diego had just cut a bite from a big chunk of roast beef and now stopped with that bite halfway to his mouth the dim flickering lamplight was more than enough to show how pale he went madre de dios lope whispered diego you idiot have you turned protestant now diegos fleshy jowls wobbled as he shook his head protestant god save me no sir how is god supposed to save you if you eat meat during lent dont you know were hunting englishmen who do the very same thing are you out of your mind no sir im just hungry his servant answered bread and cheese bread and cheese to the devil with bread and cheese no no no now de vega was the one who shook his head to the devil with eating meat at this season of the year or i should say the idea of eating meat at this season of the year has come straight from satan no such thing sir diego said indignantly no such thing i got hungry thats all its nothing else nothing eh suppose i call captain guzman suppose i call a priest suppose i call a priest from the spanish inquisition or the english will they think its nothing would you have turned the color of whey if you thought it was nothing diego shot him a resentful stare what are you doing here anyway when you didnt come back and you didnt come back i thought you were off screwing your new englishwoman if you hadnt walked in when you werent supposed to you never would have seen me and you still would have sinned lope said and so what his servant replied god would have known and maybe my confessor but nobody else im not doing any harm lope pointed to the chunk of beef get rid of that wrap a rag around it so nobody can see what it is and get rid of it you didnt think anyone would catch you but now somebody has and do you know what that means do you diego what diego asked apprehensively it means you are mine de vega answered mine do you hear me i hold your life in my hand and if i choose to squeeze he held out his right hand palm up and slowly folded it into a fist he made the fist as tight as he could to make sure diego got the idea his servant shuddered you wouldnt do such a thing senor would you that last frightened question one diego surely didnt want to ask but also one he couldnt hold back told lope just how worried he was maybe i wouldnt lope said but on the other hand maybe i would too that depends on you dont you think on me diego didnt like the sound of that on you lope said again maybe you were just hungry this once as you say if you were maybe we can forget about it if you keep your nose clean from now onif you stay awake by god and if you do all the things youre supposed to dothen nobody needs to know about it but if you think you can go on being lazy and useless well even if i cant wake you up id bet the inquisitors damned well can diego looked sullen thats blackmail yes it is isnt it de vega agreed cheerfully a shame i need to blackmail you into doing what you ought to be doing anyhow but if thats what it takes thats what ill do you will stay awake from now on wont you si senor diego said sounding more sullen still he sounded sullen enough in fact to make lope wonder whether he might prove dangerous best to forestall that lope judged dont even think about poisoning me or knocking out my brains while im asleep he warned im going to write down just what ive seen and im going to seal the letter and give it to someone i trust if anything happens to me you know what will happen to you dont you si senor his servant repeated his voice gloomy lope smiled very good now while im writing suppose you take that roast beef away then come back and go to bed you wont mind doing that will you no sir diego heaved an enormous sigh he wrapped the offending meat in a rag as de vega had suggested and carried it out lope went into his own chamber using the lamp in the anteroom to light the one inside because he worked on plays in odd moments he always had paper and pens and ink handy he sat down on the stool and started to write diego came back very quietly as if by magic the pen vanished from de vegas hand and his rapier replaced it you dont want to try anything foolish do you diego he said softly no senor the servant didnt even bother pretending he hadnt been thinking about it i guess i dont good night good night lope said when i finish what im working on here im going to take off my boots and leave them out there for you to black ill expect them to be ready when i get up in the morning youll do a good job wont you ill take care of them yes diego sounded like a man utterly without hope lope used the rapier to wave him out of the room once his man was gone lope did finish the letter better safe went through his mind he sealed the letter then got out of his boots and put them in the anteroom when he went back into his bedchamber he barred the door from the inside as soon as the letter was in someone elses hands hed be reasonably safe till then better safe he told himself again out beyond the barred door diego cursed quietly his blasphemies were music to lopes ears then diego picked up the boots their heels thumped together lope hugged himself with glee as he got into bed not even the threat of the scottish border had turned diego into a tolerable servant the threat of the inquisition though seemed to have turned the trick and when lope woke the next morning he found diego already up and waiting for him here are your boots seaor the servant said tonelessly all the mud and scuff marks were gone from them the leather gleamed with grease still with no expression in his voice diego went on what else do you require do i hear rain outside lope asked diego nodded de vega said well in that case you can fetch me my good wool cloak and get me a hat with an extra wide brim just as you say diego answered and went to do it he didnt grumble he didnt even yawn it was like a miracle lope had no idea how long it would last but aimed to enjoy it while it did taking the letter hed written with him he went off to get his breakfast even the porridge the barracks kitchen served up tasted better than usual this morning with a bowl of barley mush and a cup of wine inside him he went to see his superior as usual captain baltasar guzmans servant intercepted him before he got through the door youre looking cheerful this morning senior lieutenant enrique remarked i feel cheerful de vega replied shakespeares play goes well yes i think so lope said if enrique wanted to think that was why he felt happy the servant was welcome to do so de vega added as a matter of fact im going up to the theatre as soon as i see captain guzman is his excellency in un momento por favor enrique ducked behind the door as if to see whether guzman was there though he had to know perfectly well but he was smiling when he came out again he says he is delighted to see you go right in gracias de vega walked past enrique and made a leg at captain guzman who nodded in return from behind his desk i trust your excellency is well lope said ill do guzman said dryly as enrique had he went on you look pleased with yourself today senior lieutenant and so i am sir lope handed him the letter hed written would you do me the courtesy of holding this unread unless some misfortune befalls me captain guzman raised an eyebrow as he took the sealed sheet of paper just as you say of course may i ask whether it has to do with your theatrical connections or with your women with neither de vega answered and had the satisfaction of watching that eyebrow jump in surprise again but guzman stowed the letter in his desk without another word lope bowed many thanks your excellency and now if youll excuse me im off for shoreditch how alarmingly diligent guzman murmured he might almost have been lope himself talking to diego that comparison perhaps fortunately didnt occur to lope till hed got a horse from the stables and ridden out through bishopsgate when it did the raina steady downpourmuffled his bad language so that only the couple of englishmen closest to him turned their heads his way lope squelched through the mud around the theatre the space within the wooden o where the groundlings would stand was muddy too on stage actors rehearsed under the protection of a painted canvas canopythe heavens they called it where is master shakespeare lope called in english to richard burbage i see him not the big players broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug he should have come hither burbage answered he should have but he did not dot i know not where he is myself master de vega and wish to heaven twere otherwise keep dry now the widow kendall called out as william shakespeare left her house to go to the theatre with rain drumming down the advice struck him as useless but was no doubt kindly meant he nodded and hurried away his belly growled as he hurried through bishopsgate lent wore on him but he dared not break the fast not in this year of all years he was much more virtuous than he might have been to make sure the spaniards paid him no special notice master shakespeare the voice came out of the rain shakespeare jumped who is it he asked sharply peering through the dripping earlymorning gloom here i am your honor shakespeares heart sank hed heard that sly whining voice before seen that clever ugly face what would you master skeres he said let it be brief an you can i must to the theatre nicholas skeres shook his head i fear me not or not yet you needs must come with me and straightaway wherefore shakespeare demanded skeres smile showed his bad teeth it also made shakespeare want to drive them down his throat the wherefore ofts not for me to say skeres answered still and all them as sent me theyd not be happy did i come back to em solus and who did send you them youll meet when i fetch you thither from everything shakespeare had seen nick skeres delighted in being uninformative he also delighted in the power he held over shakespeare when he said come the snap of command filled his voice and shakespeare had to go with him he knew as much he hated it but he knew it he did say theyll miss me up in shoreditch nick skeres shrugged better that than they miss you whose man i am he turned away towards the southwest heart sinking shakespeare followed however much he wanted to go in the opposite direction a horse trying to haul a wagon full of barrels through the muck blocked a narrow street the wagon had bogged down the driver rained blows on the horses back with all its strength the beast strained against the weight and the mud then with a noise like a pistol shot it broke a leg its scream was like that of a woman on the rack cut its throat skeres said with a laugh its knackers meat now so it is shakespeare thought grimly and youd cut my throat as heartlessly you bloody bawdy villain did i likewise break down in your employ nick skeres laughed again as if to say he knew what was going through shakespeares mindknew and didnt care and that was all too likely true weve not far to go skeres said after a while what hereabouts shakespeare pointed theres the london stone the which signifies the spaniards barracks cannot lie a stones throw distant beard we the dons in their den skeres laughed again which did nothing to reassure shakespeare they think the same that noned be so fond as to plot under their very noses even as he spoke a squad of unhappylooking spaniards tramped past on patrol one man glanced towards the two englishmen and kept walking the rest paid them no attention at all madness shakespeare muttered nick skeres grinned at the spanish soldiers who disappeared round a corner one after another reluctantlymost reluctantlyshakespeare nodded though this be madness yet there is method int een so skeres said here come you with me this is the house we seek the building in question was large and well made whose it it shakespeare asked it belongs to sir john hart the alderman skeres answered but thats nor here nor there instead of going to the door and knocking as he had at the bacons house in drury lane a few months before he led shakespeare to a side gate that opened onto an enclosed garden one surely splendid in spring and summer but sad now with scarcely any green to be seen whod meet us here shakespeare said pulling his hat down lower to keep his face dry why the men whore fain to see you who else nick skeres replied shakespeare glared the other man looked back unperturbed and resolutely closemouthed he took shakespeare towards a rose arbor that no doubt perfumed the air and gave welcome shade when the sun shone high and hot but that seemed as badly out of season as the rest of the garden now as shakespeare drew closer to it he saw through the rain that two men sat in that poor shelterwaiting for him sblood master skeres theyll take their deaths he exclaimed shrugging skeres answered an they fret not why should you he sounded altogether indifferent the milk of human kindness ran thin in him if it ran at all when shakespeare ducked his way into the arbor both waiting men slowly got to their feet god give you good morrow sir william cecil rumbled shakespeare bowed low and you your grace he said but should you not go inside where where its warm and dry where i may hope youll die not on the instant was what he meant lord burghley was paler and puffier than he had been the previous autumn he wheezed with every breath he took and shivered despite being swaddled in furs but he shook his head even so who knows what ears lurk within as the matter advanceth so advanceth also the need to keept secret and here in sooth we speak under the rose he chuckled rheumily despite the laugh and his bold words though his lips had a bluish cast that alarmed shakespeare he gathered strength and went on when last we met i told you my son would take this matter forward allow me to present you to him now robert here is master shakespeare the poet i am your servant sir shakespeare murmured bowing to the younger man as he had to the elder robert cecil gave back a bow of his own he was about shakespeares age with a long thin pale face made longer still by the pointed chin beard he wore and by his combing his sealbrown hair back from his forehead he would not have been a tall man even had he stood straight a crooked back robbed him of several more inches but when he said i take no small pleasure at making your acquaintance master shakespeare being an admirer of your dramas shakespeare bowed again knowing hed got praise worth having the younger cecils voice was higher and lighter than his fathers but no less full of sharp even prickly intelligence sir william cecil sank back to the bench from which hed risen to shakespeares relief his color improved slightly when he sat down switching to latin he asked how fares your play upon the rebellion of boudicca i hope to finish it before spring ends shakespeare replied in the same language i am certain sure my lord you will already know i am also ordered to write a play upon the life of king philip yes i do know that lord burghley nodded i also know the spaniards are paying you more than i gave you at our last meeting robert be so good as to make amends for that certes father robert cecil reached under his cloak his hands were long and thin and pale toohands a musician might have wished he had he gave shakespeare a small but nicely heavy leather sack we cannot let ourselves be outbid by god sir shakespeare began alarmed back into english the younger cecil waved him to silence did we fear betrayal from you wed work with another this is for our prides sake not suffering our foes to outdo us gramercy shakespeare bowed once more your thanks are welcome but not needed for doing this likes us well robert cecil said his father nodded shakespeare did not answer no doubt the younger cecil meant what he said but shakespeare knew he might have met with ingram frizer and his knife had he displeased the two powerful englishmen in aid of which constable strawberry knows ingram frizers name the poet warned we know of constable strawberry lord burghley said with another wet chuckle fear not on that score robert cecil nodded if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse his wits are not so blunt as god help us i would desire them shakespeare said comparisons are odorous the younger cecil observed proving he had indeed marked walter strawberrys style but not hercules could have knocked out his brains for he had none belike shakespeare said yet some of what your wisdoms would not have discovered that shallow fool hath brought to light hell find no more robert cecil said with that shakespeare had to be contentor rather less than content nick sir william cecil said sharply your grace nicholas skeres replied go walk the garden nick the old man told him bring back report of its beauties in oh a quarter hours time shakespeare would have resented such a peremptory dismissal skeres took it in stride he dipped his head in what was more than a nod but less than a bow just as you say my lord he murmured and withdrew from the arbor both cecils stared at shakespeare who suddenly felt very much alone whatwhat would ye he asked and felt blood rush to his face in embarrassment at hearing his voice quaver lord burghley said heres what master shakespeare id fain hear some of your verses the play advanceth ay but my course on earth doth likewise the horses of the night of which marlowe writ will not run slow for me give me some foretaste then of the dish i ordered but shall not eat my lord may you glut yourself with it shakespeare said lord burghley only shrugged and gestured for him to go on after a moments thought he did you are to understand this is boudicca urging her stalwarts to war against the romans ah very good that was robert cecil not his father give it us i shall as best i recall it shakespeare replied here then ahad we a difference with a petty isle or with our neighbours good sirs for our landmarks the taking in of some rebellious lord or making a head against commotions after a day of blood peace might be argued but where we grapple for the ground we live on the liberty we hold as dear as life the gods we worship and next these our honours and with these swords that know no end of battle these men besides themselves allow no neighbour those minds that where the day is claim inheritance and where the sun makes ripe the fruits their harvest and where they march but measure out more ground to add to rome and here ithe bowels on us it must not be no as they are our foes and those that must be so until we tire em lets use the peace of honour thats fair dealing but in the end our swords that hardy roman that hopes to graft himself into my stock must first begin his kindred underground and be allied in ashes he waited the two cecils looked at each other slowly magisterially lord burghley nodded so did his son who despite his briskness deferred to the old mans opinion shakespeare felt as if hed just received the accolade robert cecil said twill serve beyond doubt twill serve have you more shakespeare beamed by my troth you know how to please a poet william cecil laughed robert allowed himself a thin chuckle shakespeare continued this is caratach boudiccas brotherinlaw and the great warlord of the iceni we know our tacitus master shakespeare robert cecil broke in your pardon i pray shakespeare said the groundlings however will not thus i needs must make it plain indeed you know your craft best and so tis i must ask your pardon the younger cecil said carry on so i shall this is caratach i say speaking to hengo who is his young nephew and boudiccas and who is not in the text of the annals william cecil declared in a voice that brooked no contradiction in sooth your grace he is not shakespeare agreed but i need him for the play and so summoned him to being the two cecils put their heads together sir william cecil said again master shakespeare we take your point the plays the thing let us hear it gladly here is caratach and little sir when your young bones grow stiffer and when i see you able in a morning to beat a dozen boys and then to breakfast ill tie you to a sword and hengo repliesshakespeare did his best to change his voice to a boyish treble aand what then uncle in his usual tones he spoke for caratach once more then you must kill sir the next valiant roman that calls you knave treble for hengo and must i kill but one his own voice for caratach an hundred boy i hope he tried to make the treble fierce for hengos reply was i hope five hundred through shakespeare caratach said thats a noble boy lord burghley raised a hand shakespeare obediently fell silent the old man said i chose wisely to summon you you make a fine fletcher for the shaft i purpose loosing at the dons i he broke off and began to cough he had trouble stopping his face turned red and then began to turn blue his son leaned towards him raw fear on his face william cecil waved robert back at last he mastered the coughing fit slowlytoo slowlyhis normal color or rather pallor returned he went on belike ill loose it from beyond the grave but may it fly no less straight for that amen your grace shakespeare said rain dripping from the brim of his hat nicholas skeres returned to the rose arbor nodding to lord burghley and robert cecil in turn he said ill take him away now by the way he spoke shakespeare might have been a butt of ale yes do nick robert cecil spoke the same way which set shakespeares teeth on edge but then the crookback added he hath our full favor let all your friends know as much ill dot sir you can depend on nick skeres shakespeare could imagine no one on whom he less wanted to depend but nobody in this mad game cared a farthing for what he wanted skeres turned to him with a half mocking grin you may not knowt master shakespeare but i reckon you the safest man in london these days what mean you shakespeare asked that grin got wider theres not a ferret not a flick not a foist not a high lawyer in the city but knows your name and visageand knows youre to be let alone god help him who sets upon you in lord burghleys despite and my sons sir william cecil said he will outdo me as any man should pray his son will do shakespeare wondered about that on several counts hed known plenty of men his own father among them who wanted to see their sons as less than themselves not greater more than a few of that type far from advancing their sons did everything they could to hold them back and robert cecil though surely a man of formidable wit lacked his fathers indomitable will maybe his slight frame and twisted back accounted for that or maybe the younger man would have been the lesser even had he been born straight in the end who but god could know such things and what is a playwright but a man who seeks to make a god of himself and creatures of his characters shakespeare shoved the blasphemous thought aside though surely it had crossed the mind of everyone whod ever touched pen to paper in hopes of writing something worth going up on stage enough he told himself and bowed to the two cecils my lords again i say gramercy for the favor you show me we do but give you your deserts robert cecil answered shakespeare wondered whether that had an edge to it or he himself was seeing shadows where nothing cast them he feared he wasnt if a word from the cecilsa word delivered through nick skeres and perhaps through ingram frizer as wellcould ward him against cheats and thieves and pickpockets and highwaymen what could a different word do he pleased the cecils now if ever he didnt an i please them not twill be a mayflys life for me skeres stirred wed best away go you gentles robert cecils smile was strange bloodless almost fey as for my father and me why how can we get hence when never were we here at all a bit of a ballad lately popular in london ran through shakespeares mind with an host of furious fancies whereof i am commander with a burning spear and a horse of air to the wilderness i wander by a knight of ghosts and shadows i summoned am to tourney ten leagues beyond the wide worlds end methinks it is no journey as nick skeres led him out of sir john harts garden he slowly nodded yes tom o bedlam fit well hed just given the cecils some small taste of the furious fancies whereof he was commander and if they both werent knights of ghosts and shadows who deserved the name skeres peered over the gate before opening it safe as can be he said sounding as if he wanted to reassure himself as much as shakespeare now go your way sir and ill go mine and ill see you again when next theres need give you good morrow off he went at a skulking half trot he quickly disappeared in the rain shakespeare started off towards the theatre a squad of spaniards coming back to their barracks tramped right past him their boots splashing in unison since they wore armor that they would have to grease and polish to hold rust at bay and that kept trying to pull them down into the mud they were likely even more miserable than he none of them looked at him he hurried up towards bishopsgate not far from the house where he lodged a tall thin ragged man with a stout staff in his hand and a sword on his hip stepped into the middle of the street as if to block his path heart pounding shakespeare boldly strode toward the fellowwho stepped aside to let him pass had the ragged man been a high lawyer who recognized him and let him go had the man decided he looked like someone who might put up a fight and let him go on account of that or had he not been a robber at all shakespeare realized he would never know life offered fewer certainties than the stage when shakespeare got to the theatre one of jack hungerfords helpers pointed to him and let out a delighted whoop god be praised hes here in sooth god be praised richard burbage boomed from center stagehis usual haunt wed begun to fear youd gone poor geoff martins way and the great and wise constable strawberry would summon one of us for to identify your moral remainders like most players worth their hire burbage had a knack for mimicking anyone he chanced to meet he made no worse hash of the language than the constable himself though some of us were less afeard than others will kemp said shakespeare wonderedas he was no doubt intended to wonderhow the clown meant that had he meant to say some people remained confident nothing had happened to shakespeare or did he mean some people wouldnt have cared had something happened better not to know i pray your pardon friends shakespeare said i was summoned to see someone and had no choice but compliance he hoped the company would take that to mean hed been called before don diego flores de valdas kemp as was his way drew a different meaning from it his hands shaped an hourglass in the air several players laughed so did shakespeare his laughter abruptly curdled when burbage said your spaniel of a spaniard came sniffing after you earlier today and made away in some haste on hearing youd come not said he what he wished of me shakespeare asked cursing under his breath lope de vega of course would have no trouble learning he hadnt gone to don diego i did well not using the lie direct shakespeare thought hed fain hear moe king philip else im a dutchman burbage answered at which will kemp began staggering around as if in the last stages of drunkenness and mumbling guttural nonsense that might have been dutch shakespeare laughed again he couldnt help it when kemp let himself go no man who saw him could help laughing he lurched up to burbage and made as if to piss on his shoes burbage sprang back as if hed really done itand had burbage held still a moment longer he might have when he let himself go he let himself go altogether he stumbled after burbage who said give over will kemp spouted more guttural pseudodutch gibberish and gave him a big wet kiss on the cheek burbage exclaimed in disgust he shoved kemp away the clown looked at him out of eyes suddenly huge and round with grief thou lovest me not he wailed and tears began sliding down his cheeks madman burbage said half in annoyance half in affection now kemp bowed like a don burbage returned it kemp skittered up to himand kissed him again madman burbage cried againthis time a fullthroated roar of rage not i the clown let out a mourning lovers sigh with pretty tom gone i seek beauty where i find it he puckered up once more youll find my boot in your backside sure as tom found bacons yard in his burbage said kemps sigh wordlessly claimed he wanted nothing more shakespeare asked know you where de vega went on leaving this place will he descend on me with a company of pikemen at his back fearing me murthered nobody answered shakespeare made as if to tear his hair that only got him a scornful snort from kemp who said leave clowning to clowns foolery to fools you have not the art oft wherefore should that hinder me shakespeare replied you leave not sense to sensible men the players laughed and clapped their hands will kemps glower this time was perfectly genuine he enjoyed making others the butt of his japes when he had to play the role though it suited him less well before he and shakespeare could start another round of insults richard burbage asked the poet doth the work thus far done suit the principal was he speaking of don diego or of lord burghley of king philip or of boudicca shakespeare wasnt sure he wondered if burbage were sure either way though he could safely nod so i am given to understand good then beside that naught else hath great import burbage set his hands on his hips and raised his voice till it filled the theatre now that wills back amongst us and back with good news lets think on what we do this afternoon eh the wives of windsor shall not be merry unless we make them so kemp fell to with more spirit than he often showed at rehearsalsbut then of course he played sir john falstaff around whom the comedy revolved even though the play ended with falstaffs humiliation the part was too juicy to leave him room for complaint indeed after the rehearsal ended he came up to shakespeare and said would youd writ more for the great larded tun he put both hands on his belly he was not a thin man but would play falstaff well padded more of what sort shakespeare asked he knew kemp spoke because he wanted the role but was curious even so the clown might give him an idea worth setting down on paper but kemp said he is too straitened in a town of no account let him come to london let him meet with princes no by godhe deserveth to meet with kings shakespeare shook his head i fear me not i got leave to write of the third richard he being villain black but did i bring other kings of england into my plays and in especial did i speak them fair twould be reckoned treason no less than the other matter we pursue can you tell me i am mistook will kemp scowled damn me but i cannot devil take the dons then a bargain master shakespearedo we cast them down give me falstaff and a king if he had a reason to throw off the spaniards yoke he would be less likely to go to them in a fit of temper or simply a fit of folly a bargain shakespeare said solemnly they clasped hands lope de vega and lucy watkins stood among the other groundlings at the theatre the boy playing mistress page said good husband let us every one go home and laugh this sport oer by a country fire sir john and all richard burbage who played ford replied let it be so sir john to master brook you shall hold your word for he tonight shall lie with mistress ford a flourish of horns announced the end of the play the actors bowed despite the rain that had been coming down all day the theatre erupted in applause lope clapped his hands beside him lucy hopped up and down in the mud squealing with delight de vega smiled i am glade it pleases thee he said he had to repeat himself to make her hear him through the din she nodded her eyes shining ay it likes me well my thanks for bringing me hither el gusto es mio lope replied and the pleasure was his through the way the merry wives of windsor enchanted her he enjoyed it as he couldnt have if hed come alone the whelkseller didnt try to pick it to pieces to see how it worked she just let it wash over her taking it as it came lope couldnt do that by himself with her he could william shakespeare came out on stage behold the poet will kemp shouted the applause got louder still shakespeare bowed lucy watkins whooped and blew him kisses she wasnt the only one in the crowd sending them to him or to one or another of the players after another bow shakespeare withdrew the rest of the company followed him one or two at a time art fain to meet them lope asked she stared at him could i she said as if expecting him to tell her no he bowed twould be my pleasure he said pleasing thee is my pleasure lucy leaned forward to peck him on the cheek a man who smelled of onions standing behind them whooped and rocked his hips forward and back lope ignored the churl he took lucys hand and led her towards the wings towards one of the doors that opened onto the backstage tiring room a delight of falling in love as hed said was that which he took in making her happy some small part of him knew that one day before too long he would spy another face another form that pleased him as much as lucys or more he would fall in love with the woman who had them too maybe he would lose his love for the whelkseller maybe he wouldnt he had no trouble staying in love with two or three women at oncetill they found out about it then he had trouble he tried to forget what had happened after the bearbaiting in southwark lucy helped by distracting him look a man guards the way will he give us leave to go forward fear not my sweet lope answered grandly the tiremans helper had just turned a prosperouslooking merchant away from the door de vega pushed past the disgruntled englishman an anxious lucy on his arm good day to you edward he said ah master lope the tiremans helper stood aside go in sir i know theyll be glad to see you the look on lucy watkins face was worth twenty pounds to him theyll be glad to see thee she whispered in what couldnt have been anything but awe certes lope said and patted her hand they are my friends her eyes got wider still he wanted to take her in his arms and kiss her on the spot but didnt for fear of embarrassing her she wasnt and didnt act like a trull a woman of the town if she gave herself to him when they were alone together she behaved like a lady when in public god give you good morrow master lope richard burbage called when de vega and lucy came into the tiring room lope bowed in return lucys curtsy came a heartbeat slower than it might have but was graceful as a duchess as if she were a noblewoman burbage made a leg at her they are thy friends she said in wonder pressing closer to lope id never lie to thee sweetheart he answered and knew he was lying will kemp had got out of the padded costume hed worn as falstaff the water hed used to wash paint and powder from his face still dripped from his beard he was puffing on a pipe of tobacco here he said with an inviting smile holding it out to lope smoke eddied from his mouth and nose as he spoke gracias lope puffed too blew out his own stream of smoke and handed the clay pipe to lucy ive not done this before she said doubtfully kemp snorted lope shot him a warning glance for a wonder he heeded it lucy raised the pipe to her lips she sucked in smokeand then coughed and choked and almost dropped the pipe she made a horrible face what vile stuff how can anyone take pleasure int lope retrieved the pipe and gave it back to kemp we have no trouble he said the clown nodded lucy only looked more disgusted will kemp laughed for once he and lope agreed completely before that agreement could shatter as it was likely to do de vega led lucy away from the clown and over to shakespeare she curtsied to the english poet he bowed over her hand saying i am pleased to make your acquaintance my lady and i yours sir she said the play todaytwas a marvel i all but split my sides laughing when falstaff hid amongst the washing she giggled shakespeare raised an eyebrow ever so slightly that it like you delights me he said without words his face said something else to lope something like you didnt choose her for her wit did you her pleasure becomes mine lope murmured lucy still gushing about the merry wives of windsor didnt notice shakespeare gave back a thoughtful nod part understanding part lope thought something else here is a quirk worth remembering for a play was likely going through the english poets mind hark you now master lope shakespeare said heres don juan de idiaquez king philips secretarywhose role i hope youll essayspeaking to his royal master ais the sun dimmd that gnats do fly in it the eagle suffers little birds to sing and is not careful what they mean thereby knowing that with the shadow of his wings he can at pleasure stint their melody even so may you the circle of the world lope tasted the lines then slowly nodded an honor to play so great a man an honor to have such splendid words to say shakespeare nodded thanks for the compliment lucy watkins eyes widened thoult tread upon the stage with master shakespeare here writing thee a part even so my beloved lope answered some women especially those of higher blood would have looked down their noses at him for it to one who sold shellfish though the glamour of the theatre seemed perfectly real lope knew how tawdry a place it could be in lucys eyes it shoneand so through her it shone again for him too at least for a little while when he and lucy left the theatre a little later they found the closest lodging they could he never quite figured out whose arms first went around whom lucy had been less lively in bed than some women hed known no more up till then he hadnt learned all that went into igniting her he laughed at the moment they spent themselves together something hed hardly ever done despite all his many partners the theatre had more enchantments than even hed thought viii along with the rest of the parishioners shakespeare came to the church of st ethelberge early on easter morning before the bells rang out that would have summoned them to mass as he walked into the church deacons went up and down the aisles lighting candles and torches till the building blazed with light a small stone sepulcher stood against the north wall of the church more candles burned before it it was covered by a cloth embroidered with scenes of the passion and the resurrection on good friday a priest had laid the host and a crucifix within it since then men prominent in the parish had taken turns watching over the sepulcher receiving bread and ale and some small payment for their service now the clergymen formed a procession that went up to the sepulcher a priest swung a censer over it the sweet smoke tickled shakespeares nostrils another priest ceremoniously lifted the sepulcher cloth while a third took the pyx that held the host and returned it to its usual position above the altar then solemnly yet another priest raised the crucifix from the sepulcher and carried it in triumph all around the church the bells in the steeple clamored out joy the choir sang christus resurgens christ rising again from the dead dieth no more death shall have no more dominion over him for in that he liveth he liveth unto god now let the jews declare how the soldiers who guarded the sepulcher lost the king when the stone was placed wherefore they kept not the rock of righteousness let them either produce him buried or adore him rising saying with us alleluia alleluia the crucifix was reverently placed on an altar on the north side of the church worshipers crept towards it some on their knees others on their bellies tears of rejoicing streamed down their faces as they adored the risen christ tears stung shakespeares eyes too his father had spoken of such ceremonies when he was a young man and again in marys reign till the coming of the armada shakespeare had never seen them himself elizabeth had suppressed them along with so much other catholic ritual they did have a grandeur a passion fitting word for this season of the year missing from the protestant liturgy shed imposed on england matins began and my treason thrive all this once morell be cast down shakespeare thought that saddened part of him the part that responded to the drama of catholic ceremonial but the rest did we choose it of our own will well and good but the dons forced it down the throat as a farmerll force an onion up the arse of a sick ox let them keep it mass followed matins at the end of the ceremony shakespeare queued up to receive communion have to take my rights someone in front of him muttered he nodded though the words hadnt been aimed at him taking communion on easter sunday marked one as part of the adult community being denied the host on this holiest of days ostracized and disgraced a man or a woman in some townseven in some churches in london shakespeare had heardfolk delinquent with parish dues could be refused the sacred wafer he reached the head of the line hoc est enim corpus meum the priest murmured as he had so many times before and popped the host into shakespeares mouth sinners it was said choked on the host to prevent embarrassing accidents a parish clerk stood by the priest with a chalice of unconsecrated wine he offered it to shakespeare who took a mouthful to wash down the unleavened morsel often when he left the church after easter mass the green of new spring growth offered its own symbolic resurrection not this year with easter so earlyonly a day after the equinoxwinters grip still held the land trees and bushes remained barebranched the muddy ground was brown with only the sickly yellowgray of last years dead grass showing here and there to his own surprise he didnt much care maybe the mass had inspired him or maybe he stopped a sudden delighted smile illuminating his face do i not work towards englands resurrection however much the thought pleased him it did nothing for the fellow behind him who bumped into him when he unexpectedly halted here pick up your feet you breathing stone the man grumbled i pray pardon shakespeare said and got out of the way still unhappy the man whod bumped him went up the street shakespeare followed more slowly the glory of that notion still blazed in him it struck him as a perfect cap for the day christ rose from the dead it struck him as a perfect cap that is till he got back to the house where he lodged jane kendall had gone to the early mass too and had got back before him she was already throwing fresh wood on the hearth this day for once she cared nothing for expense god bless you master will she said now we feast let it be so my lady shakespeare answered never before this year have i known lent to seem so long nor i his landlady said i had not thought on it thus but you have the right oft i wonder why it might be so haply for that lent began so early shakespeare said twas but the middle part of february mind you widow kendall nodded yes it could be but now lent too is passed away will you do me the honor of carving the leg of pork i took just now from the fire a rare privilege shakespeare cried and bowed over her hand as hed seen lope de vega bow over that of his latest lady friend jane kendall giggled and simpered playing the coquette for all she was worth shakespeares stomach rumbled hed gone without meat for a long time at a hard season of the year which made it seem even longer spit flooded into his mouth at the thought of finally breaking the fast as he carved slice after slice from the leg of pork a few odd bitsor perhaps more than a fewfound their way into his mouth his landlady looked on indulgently no matter how indulgent she looked he did try to be moderate and evidently succeeded well enough pleaseth you the flavor she asked he made sure he swallowed the morsel in his mouth before answering ay he had no trouble sounding enthusiastic the widow kendall had been lavish with cloves and cinnamon and pepper and the meat was so fresh it hardly even needed the spices to taste goodan advantage of easters coming in a cool season of the year one by one the other lodgers came back to the house shakespeare exchanged easter greetings with jack street and cicely sellis and sam king and the rest when jane kendall wasnt looking he tossed mommet a bit of pork the cat made the treat disappear then stared up at him as if tosay well wheres the rest of it everyone ate pork and bread and boiled parsnips smothered in melted cheese and drank the widow kendalls freshbrewed ale shakespeare wondered if he were the only one not only eating meat but making a point of eating it where others could see nobody now could claim he was continuing the lenten fast and waiting for what the old calendar reckoned to be easter jack street patted his belly oh thats monstrous fine the glazier said would i were so full every day sam king nodded he still remained without steady work so a feast like this had to be an even bigger treat for him than for the other man grinning at street he said so its the emptiness within you then that roars forth when you sleep that made everyone laugheveryone but the glazier who asked what mean you why your snoring man king said what else what jack street shook his head i snore not despite making every night hideous for his fellow lodgersand very likely for their neighbors to either side as wellhe meant it the more the others tried to convince him he did indeed snore the less willing he was to believe it lets to the church once more sam king said and ill take oath on the gospel there street shook his head again nay id not have you forsworn for the sake of a jape tell truth and shame the devil master street you do snore of nights shakespeare said tis not the many oaths that make the truth but the plain single vow that is vowed trueand i vow i snore not jack street was beginning to sound angry he gulped down his mug of ale then reached for the pitcher to pour it full again shakespeare began to wish sam king had kept his mouth shut the silence that hovered round the feasters was distinctly uncomfortable if street didnt want to believe he snored how could the rest of them persuade him they couldnt but they knew the truth too well to be content with his denials no matter how vigorous this quarrel was liable to fester and burst out again weeks from now cicely sellis drew out the chain she wore around her neck it had a sparkling pendant at the end of it one that had been hidden in the valley between her breasts the pendant caught firelight and torchlight as she swung it in a small arc back and forth back and forth be easy master street she said in a soft soothing voice be easy no cause for wrath be easy and why should i when all mock and fleer at me the glazier said the cunning woman didnt answer directly she kept swinging that pendant in the same slow steady rhythm ever so slightly she shook her head by no means master street she said still quietly we are your friends here we are all your friends here no one seeks to do you harm methought otherwise street said but less belligerently than hed spoken before his eyes followed the cheap glass pendant as it moved his head began to go back and forth at the same rate shakespeare had trouble keeping his eyes off the pendant too but he managed jack street didnt even try no one seeks to do you harm cicely sellis repeated sam king made as if to speak shakespeare used his long legs to kick the young man under the table something out of the ordinary was going on here he didnt know what but he didnt want to see the spell broken not till that phrase crossed his mind did he wonder whether hed been wise to kick king after all cicely sellis went on as she had before alls well master street naughts amiss no need for fury hear you me i hear streets voice came from far away as if he heard with but half an ear his eyes his head still followed the pendants motion though he didnt seem to know they were doing it when he reached for his mug of ale he did so without looking away from the sparkling glass good the cunning woman let the shiny pendant go back and forth for another minute or so then asked hear you me once more as she kept on swinging it i hear street said even more distantly than before then hear also theres no cause for fuss no reason to recall the warm words just past no purpose to holding em in your memory no cause for fuss jack street echoed dreamily no reason to recall no purpose to holding een so cicely sellis nodded shall it be as i ask of you then it shall be so the glazier tried to nod but the motion of the pendant still held him captive good let it be so then and fret no more ont cicely sellis stopped swinging the bauble and tucked it away again when she spoke once more her voice was loud and brisk would you pass me the pitcher of ale master street im fain for another mug myself eh street started as if suddenly wakened oh certes mistress sellis here you are he gave her the pitcher with a chuckle he said belike youll hold it better than i for what i drank mounted straight to my head methought i dozed at table i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was man had as well snore as go about to expound this dream methought i wasthere is no man can tell what and methought i hadbut man is but a sleepy fool if he will offer to say what methought i had id drink somewhat of ale myself mistress sellis when you have poured your fill shakespeare said nodding the cunning woman passed him the pitcher he filled his mug too then quickly emptied it jack street gave no sign of remembering the argument over whether he snored he talked he laughed he joked how had cicely sellis managed that sam king leaned forward to take the pitcher after shakespeare finished with it the young mans eyes were wide and staring as he poured golden ale into his mug he mouthed something across the table at shakespeare the poet raised an eyebrow not having got it king mouthed the words again more exaggeratedly than before shes a witch that was indeed the other name for a cunning woman even so shakespeare kicked king under the table again some names were better left unspoken and king did keep quiet after that but the fear never left his eyes after the feast shakespeare stooped to stroke mommet the cat arched its back and purred you please him cicely sellis said haply hell fetch me a mouse or rat then as token ofs praise shakespeare answered mommet twisted to scratch behind one ear shakespeare thought he saw a flea fly free but couldnt be sure a flea on a rammedearth floor simply disappeared mommet went on scratching with a smile the cunning woman said you ken cats well shakespeare was the only lodger who spoke to heror for that matter even acknowledged she was alive and in the house if she noticed she gave no sign of it in a low voice he said you made them afeard in an even lower voice he added you made me afeard wherefore master shakespeare wherefore shakespeare still held his voice down but couldnt hold the anger from itanger and fear often being two sides of the same coin why else but for your show of witchery witchery cicely sellis started to laugh but checked herself when she saw how serious he was thank you i be in sooth a witch i know not he answered by my halidom i know not but this i know no one else dwelling here hath the least doubt he shook his head no i mistake me you are yet clean in jack streets eyes for he recalleth naught of what you worked on him that got through to her her mouth tightened the lines that ran to either corner of it filled with shadow making her suddenly seem five years older maybe more slowly she said i but sought to forestall a foolish quarrel and so you didbut at what cost shakespeares eyes flicked towards sam king who seemed to have set to work getting drunk would you have the english inquisition put you to the question cicely sellis gaze followed the poets hed not blab she said but her voice held no conviction god grant you be right shakespeare said wondering if god would grant a witch any such thing but you put me in fear and i am a man who earns his bread spinning fables nay morei am a man who struts the stage who hath played a ghost who hath known somewhat of strangeness and as i say you affrighted me what then of him his voice dropped to a whisper and what too of the widow kendall i pay her and well the cunning woman didnt try to hide her scorn but her eyes almost as green as her cats went back to sam king id liefer not seek a new lodging so soon again again came you here then of a sudden shakespeare asked reluctantly cicely sellis nodded shakespeare ground his teeth till a twinge from a molar warned hed better do no more of that did the english inquisition already know her name were inquisitors already poised to swoop down on this house if they seized the cunning woman would they seize her and no one else or would they also lay hold of everyone whod had anything to do with her to seek evidence against her and to learn what sort of heresy her acquaintances might harbor shakespeare didnt know the answer to that but thought he could make a good guess i meant no harm cicely sellis said nor have i never worked none that you have purposed nonethat i believe shakespeare answered what you have worked he shrugged he hoped she was right he hoped so yes but he didnt believe it no matter how much he wished he could captain baltasar guzman looked disgusted i have just learned anthony bacon has taken refuge at the court of king christian iv he said sure enough that explained his sour expression something is rotten in the state of denmark then lope de vega answered if its king will give shelter to a proved sodomite he shows himself to be no christian despite his nameonly a godcursed lutheran heretic captain guzman nodded yes and yes and yes every word you say is true senior lieutenant but none of your truth does us the least bit of good denmark and sweden persist in their heresy as they persist in being beyond our reach yes sir lope agreed a pity he escaped us if you like though we can always go back and arrest his younger brother nothing is proved against francis bacon and the family has connections enough that we cannot proceed against him without proof that too is a pity guzman sighed after a moment though he brightened forty years ago after mary died and the english relapsed into heresy who would have imagined we would grow strong enough to come here and correct them in a generation or two denmarks turn and swedens may yet come god grant it be so de vega crossed himself so did his superior with a grin lope went on i confess your excellency i wont be sorry to miss that armada though no nor i but guzmans eyes glowed with what lope recognized after a moment as crusading zeal but after denmark and sweden are brought back into the true and holy catholic faith what then the russians do not admit the supremacy of his holiness the pope before i came to england im not sure id ever even heard of russia lope said now ive talked to a few men whove been there they say the weather in russia is as much worse than it is here as the weather here is worse than spains if thats so god has already punished the russians for their heresy it could be guzman said but it could also be that the men you talked to are liars i dont think any place could have weather that bad you may be right your excellency lope snapped his fingers remembering something with anthony bacon in denmark is there any word that tom the boy actor from shakespeares company at about the same time is with him let me see baltasar guzman ran his finger down the report hed received he got close to the bottom before stopping and looking up he is accompanied by a handsome youth yes no name given but but we are well rid of two sodomites and the danes are welcome to them lope said we are well rid of them yes but better they should have gone to the gallows or the fire than to denmark captain guzman had no give in him and lope could hardly disagree youre right of course your excellency with some luck well catch the next ones we flush from cover before they can flee just so senior lieutenant just exactly so guzman set down the paper now you know my news what have you for me shakespeare continues to make good progress on king philip de vega answered i wish your english were more fluent sir id quote you line after line that will live forever the man is good he is so very good i find him intimidating when i sit down to write even though he works in a different language as things are spare me the quotations guzman said if anythings more deadly than listening to verses you dont understand i cant imagine what it is he steepled his fingertips and looked over them at lope you are writing again then in spite of the intimidation i mean yes your excellency part of me says i should congratulate you baltasar guzman observed part of me though believes im not keeping you busy enough with everything else you have to do how do you find time to set pen to paper guzman had a habit of asking dangerous questions he also had a habit of asking them so they didnt sound dangerous unless his intended victim listened carefully otherwise a man could easily launch into a disastrous reply without realizing what hed done till too late here lope recognized the trap he said i will answer that in two ways your excellency first a man who will write does not find time to do it he makes time to do it even if that means sleeping less or eating faster and second sir lately ive had more help from diego than ive been used to getting yes enrique mentioned something about that to me guzman said i would have thought you needed a miracle to get diego to do even half the work a proper servant should how did you manage it maybe i was lucky maybe diego saw the light lope answered not wanting to admit his blackmail or maybe its simply spring and the sun is waking him as it does the frogs and the snakes and the dormice and all the other creatures that sleep through winter a pretty phrase and a pretty conceit captain guzman said with a laugh but diego has been your servant a long time now and hes always been just as sleepy and lazy in the summertime as he has with snow on the ground whats the difference now maybe hes finally seen the error of his ways de vega replied it could be the only way he was likely to see such a thing though it seems to me was up the barrel of a pistol guzman said lope didnt answer his superior shrugged all right if you want to keep a secret you may keep a secret i suppose but do tell me since you are writing what are you writing about by the way he leaned towards lope he was more interested than he wanted to let on hed always held his enthusiasm for lopes plays under tight rein maybe though he really enjoyed them more than he showed lope said im calling this one el mejor mozo de espaaa the best boy in spain captain guzman echoed whats it about a waiter no no no no no lope shook his head the best boy in spain is ferdinand of aragon who married isabella and made spain one kingdom i told you your excellencyshakespeares rubbing off on me hes writing a play about history and so am i as long as you dont start writing one in english guzman said that no de vega threw his hands in the air at the mere idea i would not care to work in a language where rhymes are so hard to come by and rhythms so irregular shakespeare is clever enough in englishjust how splendid he would be if he wrote in spanish frightens me well he doesnt so dont worry your head about it captain guzman saideasier advice for him to give than for lope to take but he went on i did very much enjoy your last play the one about the lady who was a nitwit for which i thank you your excellency lope said if this next one is as good it should have a bigger audience than spanish soldiers stranded in england his superior said write another good play senior lieutenant and i will do what i can to get both of them published in spain senor lope exclaimed baltasar guzman being both rich and well connected could surely arrange publication as easily as he could snap his fingers lopes heart thudded in his chest hed dreamt of a chance like that but knew dreams to be only dreams to see that one might come true i am your servant your excellency and i would be honoredyou have no idea how honored i would bewere you to become my patran he realized he was babbling but couldnt help it what would i do for the chance to have my plays published almost anything guzman smiled yes he knew what power he wielded with such promises write well senior lieutenant write well and make sure the englishman writes well too i cannot tell you to neglect your other duties i wish i could but i cannot i understand sir de vega was quick to offer sympathy to a man who offered him the immortality of print he knew captain guzman was saying do everything i tell you to do and then do this on your own normally he would have howled about how unfair that was but when his superior dangled the prospect of publication before him i am a fish swimming in the stream i know that tempting worm may have a hook in it i know but i have to bite it anyway for oh dear god i am so very hungry shakespeare looked at what hed written slowly he nodded the ordinary was quiet he had the place almost to himself for most of the folk whod eaten supper there had long since left for home he had the ordinary so much to himself in fact that hed dared work on boudicca here which he seldom did and now ceremoniously he inked his pen one last time and in large letters wrote a last word at the bottom of the page finis sblood he muttered in weary amazement never thought i to finisht even now he half expected the spaniards or the english inquisition to burst in and drag him away in irons but all that happened was that kate asked what said you master will naught worth hearing believe you me shakespeare folded his papers so no untoward eye might fall on them i did but now set down the ending for a tragedy oer which ive labored long good for you then the serving woman answered whats it called and when will your company perform it i know not he told her you know not what its called nay shakespeare said impatiently too late he realized she was teasing and made a face at her i know not when well give it he avoided telling her the title she wouldnt know what it meantno one without latin wouldbut she might remember it and an inquisitor might be able to tear it out of her shakespeare hadnt steeped himself in conspiracy his whole life long as men like robert cecil and nick skeres had done but he could see the advantages to keeping to himself anything that might prove dangerous if anyone else knew it kate unfortunately saw he was holding back youre telling me less than you might she said more in sorrow than in accusation telling you aught is more than i should shakespeare said and then telling you that is more than i should he paused hoping she would take the point she did she was ignorant but far from stupid ill ask no more then she said go on curfew draws nigh she lowered her voice to add god keep thee and thee shakespeare answered he rose from the stool where hed perched most of the evening bowed over her hand and kissed it and left the ordinary for his lodging the night was foggy and dank the moon not quite two weeks after what the catholic church called easter sunday was nearly new it wouldnt rise till just before sunrise and wouldnt pierce the mist once it did a stranger abroad in the london night would get hopelessly lost in moments shakespeare intended to go back to the widow kendalls house more by the way the street felt under the soles of his feet and by smell than by sight his intention collapsed about a dozen paces outside the ordinary somebody came hurrying up from the direction of his lodging house the fog muffled sound too so shakespeare heard only the last few footfalls before the fellow bumped into him oof he said and then have a care ant please you will is that you the other mans voice came out of darkness impenetrable shakespeare knew it all the same he wished he didnt kit he replied apprehension making him squeak like a youth why come you hither oh god be praised christopher marlowe exclaimeda sure danger sign for when all went well he was likelier to take the lords name in vain than to petition him with prayer help me will sweet jesu help you me they bay at my heels closer every minute ice ran through shakespeare who dogs you and for what is it peculiar to you alone or hath ruin oerwhelmed all who marlowes voice fluttered like a candle flame in a breeze the dons thats who mother mary shakespeare said an oath he never would have chosen had the spaniards not landed on english soil he realized that later at the moment panic tried to rise up and choke him so that he almost turned and fled at random through the shrouded streets of london something though made him repeat why seek they you you know i fancy boys marlowe began and some of shakespeares panic fell from his shoulders like a discarded cloak belike half of london knows you fancy boys shakespeare answered the other poet had never figured out the virtues inherent in simply keeping his mouth shut but if the dons wanted him because he fancied boys they did marlowe said anthony bacon was but the first theyd fain rid the realm of all sodomites and ingles and so theyll put me on the gallows if i into their hands do fall but how could i be otherwise nature that framed us of our elements warring within our breasts for regiment did shape me so even on the brink of dreadful death he struggled to justify himself that constance left shakespeare half saddened half amusedand altogether frightened what would you of me he asked why to help me fly of course the other poet answered and how prithee might i do that shakespeare demanded am i daedalus to give thee wings he didnt know himself whether he used thee with marlowe for the sake of intimacy or insult exasperated he went on een had i wings to give thee belike thoudst fly too near the sun another icarus and plummet into the briny sea twit me rate me as thou wouldst so that thou help me marlowe said for in sooth dear willhe laughed a ragged laughwheres the harm in loving boys quoth jove dandling his favorite upon his knee come gentle ganymede and play with me i love thee well say juno what she will shakespeare burst out laughing he couldnt help himself only marlowe could be vain enough to recite the opening lines from one of his own plays in such an extremity with pleasure more than a little malicious shakespeare used a high thin piping voice to give back ganymedes reply from dido queen of carthage i would have a jewel for mine ear and a fine brooch to put in my hat and then ill hug with you an hundred times marlowe hissed like a man trying to bear a wound bravely and here will i thought you never paid my verses proper heed would i had been wrong would you had shakespeare shook his head no never mind tis of no moment now you must get hence if they dog you for this want you money nay what i have sufficeth me marlowe answered then what think you i might do that you cannot for yourself shakespeare asked hie yourself down to the river take ship if any ship there be that sails on the instant if there be none such take a boat away from london and the first ship you may so that you outspeed the hue and cry at your heels all may yet be well or well enough or well enough marlowe echoed gloomily but hark you will awell enough is not even awell is scarce well enough nothing ever satisfied him shakespeare had known that as long as hed known the other poet marlowe had a jackdaws curiosity and a jackdaws inability to hold a course when somethingor someonenew and bright and shiny caught his eye shakespeare stepped forward and reached out in the fog one groping hand grazed marlowes face he dropped it to marlowes shoulder god speed you kit get safe away and come home again when when times are better marlowe snorted i hope i must not wait so long as that he hugged the breath out of shakespeare and kissed him half on the mouth half on the cheek you give good counsel ill take it an i may ill pray for you shakespeare said belike twill do me no lasting harm marlowe answered having got the last word he hurried away the fog muffled his footsteps and soon swallowed them shakespeare sighed hed done what he could if nothing else hed talked marlowe out of his blind panic that mattered it might matter a great deal it might shakespeare muttered trying to convince himself he made his way through the thick swirling mist to the widow kendalls house his landlady sat in the parlor poking up the fire i wondered if wed lost you master will she said as he closed the door behind him thick as clotted cream out there so it is shakespeare agreed beads of fog dotted his face and trickled from his beard as sweat would have on a hot day will you waste my wood to give you light wherewith to write his landlady asked an it serve my purpose madam i reckon it no waste shakespeare said with dignity nay and why should you the widow kendall replied tis not you buying the wood you burn not so shakespeare said i buy it with the rent you have of me each month she sent him a stony stare not wanting her angry at him he added be that as it may i need no wood tonight i finished a play at my ordinary by the fine clear light of the candles therein i am glad to hear it jane kendall said both for the sake of my wood and for the sake of your rent so long as you keep writing so long as your company buys your plays youll pay me month by month eh just so shakespeare agreed where marlowe was pure selfcentered will the widow kendall was equally pure selfcentered greed and what call you this one she asked willt fetch you a fine fat fee very fine god willing he said as he had with kate he fought shy of naming boudicca for her good good she said smiling his money or some of it was destined to become her money is this the play on the life of good king philip then that surely deserveth more than a common fee its subject also being more than common he shook his head no that will be a historya pageant almost a masque the play i just now finished is a tragedy that much he thought he could safely say ill tell you whats a tragedy master shakespeare the widow kendall said what i needs must pay for firewoodmarry tis the bleeding of mine own lifes blood she went on complaining till shakespeare took advantage of a brief lull to slip away to his bedroom jack street lay on his back his mouth wide open making the night hideous me i snore not the glazier had insisted shakespeare laughed quietly street might not be able to hear himself but everyone else could after a moment the poets laughter faltered so far as he could tell street recalled nothing of the argument theyd had at easter whatever cicely sellis had done to him its effect lingered maybe it wasnt witchcraft shakespeare had yet to find another name that fit half so well though he put his papers and pens and ink in his chest and made sure the lock clicked shut then he pulled off his shoes shed his ruff and lay down on the bed in doublet and hose his eyes slid shut maybe he snored too if he did he never knew it when he woke the next morning jack streets bed was empty sam king was dressing for another day of pounding londons unforgiving streets looking for work god give you good morrow master will he said as shakespeare sat up and rubbed his eyes and a good morrow to you as well shakespeare answered around a yawn im for a bowl of the widows porridge and then whatever i can find king said the porridge was liable to be the only food he got all day he had to know as much but didnt fuss about it shakespeare couldnt help admiring that bleak courage good fortune go before you he said king laughed good fortune hath ever gone before me so far before me i see it not an i run fast enough though peradventure ill catch it up he bobbed his head in a shy nod then hurried out to the widow kendalls kitchen for whatever bubbled in her pot this morning shakespeare broke his fast on porridge too having eaten he went up to the theatre for the days rehearsal he worried all the way there if inquisitors came after cicely sellis would they search everywhere in the house if they opened his chest and saw the manuscript of boudicca he was doomed and another question one that had been in the back of his mind now came forward even with boudicca finished how could the company rehearse it without being betrayed the players would have to rehearse he could see that when word of philips death reached england they wouldthey mightgive the play on the shortest of notice they would have to be ready but how yes he saw the question clearly the answer he shook his head he was among the first of the company to get to the theatre richard burbage paced across the stage like a caged wolfback and forth back and forth he nodded to shakespeare as the poet came in through the groundlings entrance god give you good day will he boomed how wags your world even with only a handful of people in the house he pitched his voice so folk in the upper galleryof whom there were at the moment nonecould hear him with ease i fare well enough shakespeare answered and you wherefore this prowling i am to be alexander today burbage reminded him as he pursues darius he is said to be relentless he waved a sheet of paper with his part and stage directions written out seemed i to you relentless always shakespeare said burbage pursued wealth and fame with a singlemindedness that left the poet half jealous half appalled laughing burbage said it is one of kits plays mind a relentless man of his is twice as relentless as any other poets as an angry man of his hath twice the choler and a frightened man twice the fear with his mighty line he is never one to leave the auditors wondering what sort of folk his phantoms be shakespeare nodded beyond doubt you speak sooth but come you down he gestured id have a word with you whats toward burbage sat at the edge of the stage then slid down into the groundlings pit in a low voice shakespeare said marlowe is fled i pray he be fled anthony bacon belike was but the first boylover the dons and the inquisitors sought an kit remain in england id give not a groat for his life a pox burbage exclaimed as loud as everloud enough to make half a dozen players and stagehands look toward him to see what had happened he muttered to himself then went on more quietly how know you this from kits own lips shakespeare answered he found me yesternight i bade him get hence quick as ever he couldelse hed not stay quick for long god grant he hearkened to me ay may it be so burbage made a horrible face may it be so indeed but een marlowe fleds a heavy blow strook against the theatre for all his cravings sodomiticaland for all his fustian bombast toohes the one man i ken fit to measure himself alongside you i thank you for your kindness the which he would not do shakespeare sighed we are of an age you know but he came first to london first to the theatre i daresay he reckoned me but an upstart crow and when my name came to signify more than his it gnawed at him as the vulture at prometheus his liver he remembered how very full of spleen marlowe had been when thomas phelippes passed over him for this plot never could he dissemble burbage said not for any cause in an occupied kingdom he might have been reading marlowes epitaph i know shakespeare sighed again i sent him down to the thames i hope he found a ship there one bound for foreign parts if not a ship a boatman whod bear him out of london to some part whence he might get himself gone boatmen there aplenty regardless of the hour richard burbage seemed to be trying to convince himself as much as shakespeare after a moment he added what knows kit of your enterprise now in train that such an enterprise is in train the which is more than likes me shakespeare answered it was also less than the truth he realized remembering the copy of the annals marlowe had given him but he said no more to burbage what point to worrying the player if the spaniards or the english inquisition caught marlowe he knew enough to put paid to everyone and everything and what he knew he would tell he had not the stuff of martyrs in him they seek him but for sodomy yes burbage was trying to reassure himself sodomy by itself was a fearsome crime a capital crime next to treason though it was the moon next to the sun the enterpriseshakespeare liked that bloodless wordgoes on apace last night or ever i saw marlowe i wrote finis to boudicca good thats good will burbage set a hand on his shoulder now god keep boudicca from writing finis to us all a squad of spanish soldiers at his back lope de vega strode along the northern bank of the thames not far from london bridge not so long ago hed taken a boat across the river with nell lumley to see the bearbaiting in southwark he kicked a pebble into the river hed crossed the thames with his mistresswith one of his mistressesbut hed come back alone he straightened fighting against remembered humiliation hadnt he been getting tired of nell anyway now that he was in love with lucy watkins what did the other englishwoman matter one of the troopers with him pointed theres another boatman seaor gracias miguel i see him too lope answered he shifted to english to call out to the fellow god give you good day and to you sir the boatman swept off his ragged hat which in an earlier a much earlier life had probably belonged to a gentleman and gave de vega an awkward bow cant carry you and all your friends sir i fear me his gaptoothed smile showed that was meant for a jest lope smiled back some wherrymen took their boats out into the thames empty to keep from talking to him hed do what he could to keep this one happy with a bow of his owna bow he was careful not to make too smooth lest it be seen as mockeryhe said might i ask you somewhat say on master don ill answer better and better de vega thought were you here on the river night before last that i was your honor the boatman replied meseems im ever here times is hard needs must get what coin i can eh certes lope said now thensaw you a gentleman an english gentleman that evening a man of my years he would be more or less handsome roundfaced with dark hair longer than mine own and a thin fringe of beard he styles himself christopher marlowe or sometimes kit he looked for another pebble to kick but didnt find one he did not want to hunt marlowe not after spending so much time with him in tiring rooms and taverns but if what he wanted and what his kingdom wanted came into conflict how could he do anything but his duty the wherryman screwed up his face in badly acted thought i cannot rightly recollect sir he said at last that surprises me not lope said sourly and gave him a silver sixpence hed already spent several shillings and got very little back for his money nor did he this time the boatman pocketed the coin and took off his hat again gramercy your honor god bless you for showing a poor man kindness i needs must say though i saw me no such man he spread his oarcallused hand in apology a couple of lopes troopers knew some english one of them said we ought to give that bastard a set of lumps for playing games with us maybe the boatman understood some spanish he pointed to the next fellow with a rowboat saying haply george there knows somewhat of him you seek we shall see lope said in english in spanish he added i wouldnt waste my time punishing this motherless lump of dung if the boatman could follow that too bad the trooper whod suggested beating the fellow said this river smells like a motherless lump of dung he wrinkled his nose since he was right lope couldnt very well disagree with him all he said was come on lets see what george there has to say lets see if i can waste another sixpence gulls soared above the thames in shrieking swarms one swooped down and came up with a length of gut as long as lopes arm in its beak half a dozen others chased it eager to steal the prize de vegas stomach did a slow lurch a pursuing gull grabbed the gut and made away with it the bird that had scooped it from the water screeched in anger and frustration boats of all sizes went up and down the river westward ho shouted the wherrymen bound for westminster or towns farther up the thames eastward ho shouted the men heading towards the north sea westbound and eastbound boats had to dodge those going back and forth between london and southwark sometimes they couldnt dodge and fended one another off with oars and poles and impassioned curses consumption catch thee thou gorbellied knave a boatman yelled jolthead botchy core mooncalf louse of a lazar returned the fellow whod fallen foul of him instead of trying to hold their boats apart they started jabbing at each other with their poles one of them went into the river with a splash not the worst sport to watch a spanish soldier said si lope said and then went back to english calling you there sirrah be you george ay tis the name my mother gave me the wherryman answered what would you seaor he pronounced it more like the english word senior de vega asked him about marlowe he waited for the vacant stare hed seen so many times before to his surprise he didnt get it instead george nodded i carried such a man yes he said whats he done some cozening law an i mistake me not a barrator peradventure or a figure caster summat shrewd whither took you him lope asked excitement rising in him marlowe wasnt so far as lope knew an agent provocateur or an astrologer but he was a clever manthough he might have been more clever not to let his cleverness show tell me now george looked blank de vega paid him without hesitation the boatman eyed the little silver coin murmured god bless the queen and the king and made it disappear he nodded to lope as you say sir not yesternight but that aforet ten of the clock methinks or a bit later id fetched back a gentleman and his lady from the bearbaiting at southwark he pointed across the thames as if towards a foreign country i know of the bearbaiting and of crossing the river lope said tightly he knew more of such things than hed wanted to shaking his head didnt make the memories go away what then why then sir i bethought myself should i hie me home for that it was a foggy night and for that curfew would come anon or should i stay yet a while to see what chance might give fortune brings in some boats that are not steered they say and my boatthe wight whereof i speak you understand yes yes lope fought to hide his impatience did this ignorant wherryman think him unable to grasp a metaphor say on sirrah say on ill dot george said this wight came along the river seeking a boat awhither would you i asked him i mind me the very words he said he said you could row me to hell and tonight id thank you fort then he made as if to shake his head and laughed a laugh that left me sore afeard for meseemed twas a madmans laugh and could be none other and he said awhy this is hell nor am i out of it i thought him daft buti see you stir your honor know you these words i do i know them well they are from a play a play writ by the man i seek that your man spake them proves him that very man were he mad or not you took his penny the boatman nodded i did for a madmans penny spends as well as any other he bade me take him to deptford to the private dock there and so i did a longer pull than some i make for which reason i told him id have tuppence in fact not just the single penny and he gave it me to deptford say you that was a shrewd choice it was close to london but beyond the citys jurisdiction lying in the county of kent till the armada came it had been a leading english naval yard even now many merchant ships tied up at the private dock lope knew he would have to go through the motions of pursuit but any chance of catching marlowe was probably long gone ay sir deptford he was quiet as you please in the boateven dozed somewhat i thought id judged too quick but he was taen strange again leaving the boat he looked about him and he said ahell hath no limits nor is circumscribed in one self place for where we are is hell and where hell is there must we ever be i had a priest bless the boat sir the very next day to be safe he crossed himself had he been a catholic while elizabeth ruled england maybe but lope wouldnt have bet a hapenny on it he also made the sign of the cross i think you need not fear he told the wherryman once more marlowe but recited words he had earlier writ he wasnt surprised marlowe had quoted his own work he would have been surprisedhe would have been thunderstruckhad marlowe quoted say shakespeare the man was too full of himself for that are you done with me sir george asked nearly lope took out a sheet of paper and pen and ink he wrote in spanish a summary of what the boatman had said have you your letters he asked as hed expected george shook his head lope thrust paper and pen at him make your mark below my writing then what say the words the boatman couldnt even tell english from spanish de vega translated george took the pen and made a sprawling x de vega and one of his soldiers who was literate witnessed the mark george asked why seek you this fellow maybe despite the sixpence he regretted talking to a spaniard too late for your second thoughts now lope thought as he answered because he is a sodomite oh whatever regrets the englishman might have had disappeared god grant you catch him then a filthy business buggery yes de vega nodded he meant it too and yet all the same no small part of him did mourn the pursuit of marlowe true the man violated not only the law of england and spain but also that of god but god had also granted him a truly splendid gift of words lope wondered why the lord had chosen to give the same man the great urge to sin and the great gift that though was gods business not his while he spoke in english with the wherryman the soldier whod witnessed the mans statement told the other troopers what was going on one of them asked sir do we go down the river to this deptford place i think we do lope answered not quite happily i hope the englishmen there dont obstruct us if they do we give em a good kick in the cojones and after that they wont any more another soldier said the rest laughed the wolfish laughs of men who looked forward to giving the english another good kick georges boat wouldnt hold lope and all his men they had to walk along the riverside till they found a wherryman who could take the lot of them to deptford de vega paid him and off they went eastward ho the boatman cried at the top of his lungs though deptford lay just down the thames from london lope was conscious of being in a different world when he got out of the boat london brawled deptford ambled and he and his troopers drew more surprised looks and more hard looks in five minutes in deptford than they would have in a day in london london was englands beating heart and the spaniards had to hold it to help isabella and albert hold the kingdom that meant they were an everyday presence there not in deptford once theyd closed the naval shipyard there theyd left the place to its own devices lope hadnt been asking questions along the wharfs for very long before a sheriff came up to question him the fellow wore a leather tunic over his doublet to keep it clean a black felt hat with a twisted hatband slops hose dyed dark blue with woad and sturdy shoes the staff of office he carried could double as a formidable club he introduced himself as peter norris after lope explained whom he sought and why norris shrugged and said i fear me youll not lay hands on him sir hes surely fled these past two days weve had a carrack put to sea bound for copenhagen a galleon bound for hamburg and some smaller shipi misremember of what sortbound for calais an he had the silver for to buy his passage hed be aboard one or another of em i fear me you have reason sheriff lope said no he wasnt altogether sorry however much he tried to keep that to himself it sorrows me he hath escaped you a buggers naught but gallowsfruit norris said and you have come from london on a bootless errand which sorrows me as well he sounded as if he meant it lope wondered if he would have seemed so friendly had the chase been for a traitor rather than a sodomite the spaniard had his doubts but didnt have to test them this time he said for your kindness sir may i stand you to a stoup of wine norris touched the brim of his hat gramercy don lope eleanor bulls ordinary close by in deptford strand hath a fine candia malmsey the ordinary proved a pleasant place in other ways as well it had a garden behind it that would prove more enjoyable when the plants came into full leaf the proprietress showed sheriff norris lope and his soldiers into a room with a bed a long table and a bench next to the table de vega and the englishmen sat side by side the spanish soldiers sprawled here there and everywhere as norris had said eleanor bulls malmsey was excellent sipping the sweet strong wine lope asked can you find for me the names of the ships wherein marlowe might have fled certes ill send em in a letter peter norris said lope nodded maybe the sheriff would maybe he wouldnt either way de vega had enough for a report that would satisfy his own superiors norris hesitated then asked this marlowe seek you the poet of that name tis the very man i fear me lope replied pity norris said by my halidom sir his art surpasseth even will shakespeares think you so lope said i believe you are mistook and right gladly will i tell you why he and sheriff norris spent the next couple of hours arguing about the theatre he hadnt expected to be able to mix business and pleasure so and was sorry when at last he did have to go back to london shakespeare had never imagined that one day he might actually want to find nicholas skeres but he did skeres had a way of appearing out of thin air most often when he was least welcome and throwing shakespeares days if not his life into confusion now shakespeare found himself looking for the smoothtalking gobetween whenever he went outside looking for him and not seeing him skeres found him one day when spring at last began to look as if it were more than a date in the almanac a day when the sun shone warm and the air began to smell green a day when redbreasts and linnets and chaffinches sang he fell into stride beside shakespeare as the poet made his way up towards bishopsgate give you good morrow master will he said and you master nick shakespeare told him i had hoped we might meet time is ripe skeres didnt explain how he knew it was or why he thought so shakespeare almost asked him but in the end held back skeres answer would either be evasive or an outright lie smiling the devious little man went on alls well with you sir well enough and my thanks for asking shakespeare looked about if skeres could appear from nowhere a spanish spy might do the same that being so the poet named no names how fares your principal not so well he fails and knows himself to fail the corners of nick skeres mouth turned down despite his brave spirit tis hard sore hardand as hard for his son who shall inherit the family business when gods will be done he too was careful of the words he spoke where anyone might hear sore hard indeed shakespeare said he had seen for himself in the house close by the spanish barracks that the shadow of death lay over sir william cecil that formidable intellect that indomitable willnow trapped in a body ever less able to meet the demands they made on it shakespeare shivered as if a black cat had darted across the street in front of him when my time comes lord by thy mercy let it come quickly till meeting lord burghley hed never thought to make such a prayer but dying by inches knowing each inch lost was lost forever he shook his head he feared death less than dying and well you might bethinking yourself of the death the spaniards or the inquisition would give you all at once he wanted to do as marlowe had done to take ship and flee out of england i would be safe in foreign parts with no dons nor inquisitors to dog me speaking with nick skeres brought home the danger he faced that danger would only get worse after william cecil died too crookbacked robert was naturally a creature of the shadows and had thrived for years in the enormous shadow his great father cast once that shadow vanished could robert cecil carry on in full light of day he would have to try but it wouldnt be easy for him what seek you of me skeres asked know your masters that my commission for them is complete shakespeare asked in return nicholas skeres nodded yes they know twas on that account they sent me to you i ask again what need you of them or of me the names of certain men shakespeare said and explained why ah skeres gave him another nod you may rely on them and on me he hurried away and soon vanished into the crowd shakespeare went on towards bishopsgate he knew he could rely on the cecils they would do all they could for him relying on nick skeres shakespeare shook his head at the absurdity of the notion and kept on walking at the theatre that day lord westmorlands men offered the cobblers holiday a comedy by thomas dekker it was a pleasant enough piece of work even if the plot showed a few holes most of the time shakespearea good cobbler of dramas himselfwould have patched those holes or found ways for dekker to do it himself before the play reached the stage he hadnt had the chance here not when he was busy with two of his own it might have gone off well enough even so such plays often did good jests even more to the point frequent jests and spritely staging hid flaws that would have been obvious on reading the script not this time among the groundlings were a dozen or more oxford undergraduates come to london on some business of their own and taking in a play before or after it the university trained them to pick things to pieces they jeered every flaw they found and as undergraduates were wont to do went from jeering flaws to jeering players even by the rough standards groundlings set they were loud and obnoxious richard burbage who played the cobbler went on with his role as if the oxonians did not exist will kemp ideally cast in the role of the title characters blundering befuddled friend had a thinner skin shakespeare tried to calm him when he retreated to the tiring room during a scene in which he didnt appear this too shall pass away may the lot of them pass away the clown growled and be buried unshriven tomorrow theyll be gone shakespeare said never do they linger nayonly the stink of em kemp said but shakespeare thought hed soothed the other mans temper before kemp had to go out again and then one of the university wits noticed an inconsistency dekker had left in the plot and shouted to kemp no fool you said just now shed gone to canterbury what a knavish fool thou art and the blockhead cobbler too his voice was loud and shrill the whole theatre must have heard him giggles and murmurs and gasps rose from every side burbage started into his next speech will kemp raised a hand burbage stopped startled the gesture wasnt one theyd rehearsed kemp glared out at the undergraduates is it not better he demanded to make a fool of the world as i have done than to be fooled of the world as you scholars are their jeers brought the play to a standstill as he must have known they would wretched puling fool they shouted thou rag thou dishclout spartan dog superstitious idleheaded boor kemp beamed out at them a smile on his round face say on say on he urged them ay say on you starveling popinjays you abject anatomies be merry my lads for coming here you have happened upon the most excellent vocation in the world for money they come north and south to bring it to our playhouse and for honors who is of more report than dick burbage and will kemp he bowed low a moment later burbage swept off his hat and did the same the groundlings whooped and cheered them a couple of the university wits kept trying to mock kemp and the other players but most fell silent they lived a hungry life at oxford had it been otherwise they would have paid more than a penny each to see the cobblers holiday will kemp bowed again have we your leave gentles to proceed ay the groundlings roared the same shout came from the galleries gramercy he said and turned back to burbage i will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways therefore tremble and depart as effortlessly as hed stepped out of character he returned to it god keep thee out of my sight burbage retorted and the play went on the oxford undergraduates troubled it no more kemp had outfaced them shakespeare hadnt been sure anyone could but the clown had brought it off afterwards in the tiring room everyone made much of kemp he was unwontedly modest as he cleaned greasepaint from his cheeks he said easy to be bold bawling out from a crowd like a calfa mooncalfseeking his dams teat but they went mild as the milk they cried for on seeing me bold in my own person solus from the stage three cheers someone called and they rang from the roof and walls will kemp sprang to his feet and bowed as he had after subduing the university wits that set off fresh applause from the crowd around him the noise made shakespeares head ache he soaped his face and splashed water on it from a basin the sooner he could leave the theatre today the happier he would be he wanted to work on king philip the sooner that piece was done the sooner he could start thinking of his own ideas once more they might bring less lucre than those proposed by english noble or spanish don but they were his his face was buried in a towel when someone spoke in a low voice a word with you master shakespeare an i may he lowered the linen towel there stood the companys new bookkeeper and prompter the late geoffrey martins replacement having compassed the one mans death shakespeare dared not ignore the other what would you master vincent he asked id speak with you of your latest master shakespeare whilst other business distracts the company thomas vincent nodded towards the crowd of people still hanging on will kemps every word still sniggering at his every smirk he had the sense not to name boudicca as usual after a performance not all the folk in the tiring room belonged to lord westmorlands men and for aught i know we have our own spying serpent amongst us as satan did even in eden shakespeare thought i attend he told vincent a scribe shall make your foul papers into parts the players shall use to learn their lines the prompter said certes shakespeare nodded my character i know can be less than easy to make out thomas vincent nodded too relief on his face i would not offend sir not for the world but you knowing of the trouble i may speak freely by all means shakespeare said vincent was more polite about it than poor geoff martin had been had shakespeare believed all the late prompters slanders he would never have presumed to take pen in hand even if vincent was polite he pressed ahead and were your hand never so excellent your latest still causeth ah difficulties in choosing a scribe every time a new pair of eyes saw boudicca the risk of betrayal grew vincent did his best to say that without actually saying it shakespeare didnt need it spelled out he knew it all too well as he had since thomas phelippes first drew him into the plot if a scribe writing out fair copies for the players took them to the spaniards if that happened everyone in lord westmorlands men would die the death but the poet said fear not hearing those words coming from his mouth almost made him laugh out loud only when he was sure he wouldnt did he go on haply i may name you a name anon may it be so vincent said and shakespeare had to remember not to cross himself to echo that sentiment ix it was the middle of a fine bright morning when lope de vega walked into his rooms in the spanish barracks he found his servant curled into a ball under the covers fast asleep de vega sighed diego had been almost unnaturally good and obedient these past few weeks more surprising than his backsliding was how long it had taken lope shook him not at all gently wake up by god and st james youre not the best boy in spain diego muttered something that had no real words in it lope shook him again even harder this time wake up he repeated his servant yawned and rubbed his eyes oh hello seaor i didnt expect you de vega finished for him his tone sour youre supposed to do your job whether im here or not diego i know i know diego said sulkily he yawned again though he did get out of bed before lope started screaming at him im sorry im very sorry its only that i get tired he meant it he was the picture of rumpled sincerity that he could mean it made lope marvel and the less you do the more tired you get too lope said if you did nothing at all you would sleep all day long and all night long as welland you would love every moment of it are you a man or an oyster i am a man who likes oysters diego replied with dignity now that youve got me up what is it thats so important for me to do el mejor mozo de espana lope told him you may not be the best boy in spain or even england but youre damned well in the best boy in spain and its time to rehearse come on get moving do you want enrique to give you the horse laugh you think i care about that marican diego said not likely if his arsehole isnt wider than the thames enough of your filth lope exclaimed youve said it before but youve got no proof none not a farthings worth not a flyspecks worth so keep your mouth shut and dont make trouble itll turn out worse for you than for the people youre trying to hurt and you can bet on that oh yes oh yes diego struck a pose more dramatic than any he was likely to take in the best boy in spain when an ordinary fellow says anything about a noblemans servant hes always wrong even when hes right hes wrong when an ordinary fellow talks about a noblemans servant hed better be right lope said and you arent or you cant prove you are so youd better shut up about that all right seaor ill keep quiet diego still sounded surly but youll see whether im right or not in the end youll see and when you do im going to say i told you so dont gloat till you have the chance lope said for that matter remember your station in life whether youre right or youre wrong youre still a servant youre still my servant so dont gloat too much even if you turn out to be right that sat none too well with diego lope could see as much but the servant put on a pair of shoes and accompanied him to the courtyard where his makeshift company was rehearsing el mejor mozo de espana even in spain it would have made a spartan rehearsal ground here in england where de vega could compare it to the luxury of the theatre and the other halls where plays were presented it seemed more austere yet austere lope laughed at himself what you really mean is cheap makeshift shabby he wondered what shakespeare would think seeing what he had to work with shakespeare was a gentle courteous man he would without a doubt give what praise he could he would also and equally without a doubt be appalled as lope had expected enrique was already there he sat on the ground his back against a brick wall as he solemnly studied his parts he was to play several small roles a moor a page and one of ferdinands friends when he saw lope he sprang to his feet and bowed buenos dias senor polite as a cat he also bowed to diego though not so deeply buenos daas a good day to you as well lope replied and bowed back as superior to inferior diego still grouchy only nodded lope trod on his foot thus cued he did bow lope didnt want captain guzmans servant offended by anyone connected to him enrique didnt seem offended he seemed enthusiastic he waved sheets of paper in the air this is an excellent play senor truly excellent no one in madrid will see anything better this year im sure of that you are too kind lope murmured he was no more immune to flattery than anyone elsehe was less immune to flattery than a lot of people when he bowed again to show his pleasure it was almost as equal to equal diego looked disgusted de vega debated stepping on his foot again before he could enrique asked tell me seaor is it really true what the soldier over there says a real woman a real spanish woman is going to play isabella that will be wonderfulwonderful i tell you the wife of an officer who could afford to bring her here he told me de vega shot diego a look that said would he be so happy about a woman if he didnt care for them his servants sneer replied all he cares about is the play if she makes it better thats what matters to him with a scowl lope turned back to enrique a woman yes a spaniard of coursecould an englishwoman play our great queen the wife of an officer no don alejandro brought his mistressher names catalina ibanezto london not his wife and a good thing too for the play a noblemans wife could never appear on stage that would be scandalous but his mistress no trouble there ah i see enrique nodded i did wonder but it is don alejandro de recaldes woman then corporal fernandez had that right yes he did lope said diego guffawed if i had a choice between bringing my wife and my mistress to this miserable freezing place id bring the one who kept me warmer too be careful or youll be sorry enrique whispered through lips that hardly moved here she comes don alejandros mistress knew how to make an entrance she swept into the courtyard with a couple of serving women in her wake they were both pretty but seemed plain beside her she was tiny but perfect no not quite perfect she had a tiny mole by the corner of her mouth be careful or youll be sorry de vega knew enrique hadnt been talking to him and hadnt meant that kind of care when he was talking to diego but the servants words might have been meant for lope he couldnt take his eyes off catalina ibaaez and where his eyes went he wanted his hands and his lips to follow he swept off his hat and bowed as low to her as if she really were isabella of castile the first queen of a united spain buenos dias dona catalina he said a nobles mistress didnt really deserve to be called doaa out of the corner of his eye he saw statusconscious enrique raise an eyebrow some tiny fraction of an inch catalina ibanez accept the title as nothing less than her due buenos dias she replied with truly queenly condescension her black eyes snapped is everyone ready is everything ready everyone and everything had better be her tone warned when lope didnt say no she nodded grudging approval lets get on with the rehearsal then i have plenty of other things to do once im finished here she tossed her head be careful or youll be sorry lope hadnt lived his life being careful he found it wildly unlikely hed start now yes catalina ibanez was a noblemans plaything yes she was trouble in a beautiful wrapping yes she had no more pity and no more regard for anyone else than a cat did lope knew all that every bit of it was obvious at first glance none of it stopped him from falling in love nothing had ever stopped him from falling in love he hadnt fallen out of love with lucy watkins he didnt fall out of love with one woman when he fell in love with another no his way was to pile one love on another adding delight to delight till the whole rickety structure came crashing down on top of him as it had outside the bearbaiting arena down in southwark he gazed at catalina ibanezand found her looking back those midnight eyes full of old cold wisdom she knew oh yes she knew he hadnt said a word yet but she knew everything there was to know he didnt think she could read or write but some things plainly shed been born knowing be careful or youll be sorry lope sighed he saw no way this could possibly end well he intended to go on with it go through with it anyhow later not yet el mejor mozo de espana came first even set beside his love affairs the words the rhymes the verses in his head counted for more what had shakespeare said in prince of denmark the plays the thingthat was the line take your places then ladies and gentlemen lope said first act first scene well start from where rodrigo the page enters with his guitar and speaks to isabella rodrigo was played by the strapping spanish corporal named joaquin fernandez he was tall as a tree blond as an englishman handsome as an angeland wooden as a block he stumbled through his lines catalina ibanez replied tres cosas parecen bien el religioso rezando el gallardo caballero ejercitando el acero y la dama honesta silando she wasnt just pretty she could act unlike poor fernandez whose good looks still worried lope when she spoke you believed three things seemed good to hera monk praying a gallant knight going to war sword in hand and an honest woman spinning that had to be acting de vega couldnt imagine catalina ibaaez caring about monks or honest women spinninggallant knights were liable to be a different story but listening to her you believed she cared and that was the mystery of acting if the audience believed nothing else mattered on they went joaquin fernandez had at least learned his lines he might get bettera little catalina sparkled without much help lope knew how hard that was no matter who surrounded her this play would work as long as she was in it de vega felt that in his bones i wish shakespeare had spanish enough to follow this he thought as the scene ended i wish he could see the difference using actresses makes too he shrugged the englishman would just have to bumble along in his own little arena with its own foolish conventions if that meant his work never got the attention it deserved in the wider world well such was life bravo corporal fernandez lope said fernandez blinked he wasnt used to getting praise from the playwright lope went on and brava doaa catalina your majesty truly spain will come into its own with you on the throne thank you senior lieutenant catalina ibaaez purred she dropped him a curtsy their eyes locked oh yes shed noticed him watching her or rather shed noticed the way he watched hernot just as an author and director watched an actress which he had every right to do but as a man watched a woman he desired if she wanted him too then in some sense he had every right to do that as wellthough don alejandro de recalde her keeper would have a different opinion all right lope said lets go on he might have been speaking to the assembled players people shifted getting ready for the next scene or he might have been speaking to catalina ibaaez alone all the rest of them forgotten by the way her red full lips curved into the smallest of smiles she thought he was her eyes met his again just for a moment yes lets they said kate poured beer into shakespeares mug i thank you he said absently hed eaten more than half of his kidney pie before noticing how good it wasor indeed paying much attention to what it was most of him focused on king philip hed stormed ahead the night before and he couldnt wait to get to work tonight the candle at his table was tall and thick and bright it would surely burn till curfew or maybe even a little longer the door to the ordinary opened shakespeare didnt look up in alarm as hed had to whenever it opened while he was working on boudicca hed seldom dared write any of that play here but even having it at the forefront of his thoughts left him nervousleft him to be honest terrified if spaniards or priests from the english inquisition burst in now he could show them this manuscript with a clear conscience but the man who came in was neither don nor inquisitor he was pale slight pockmarked bespectacled a man whod blend into any company in which he found himself the poet hardly heeded him till he pulled up a stool and sat down saying give you good den master shakespeare oh shakespeare stared in surpriseand yes alarm came flooding back he tried to hide it behind a nod that was almost a seated bow god give you good even master phelippes i am your servant sir thomas phelippes said a great thumping lie the dusty little man was surely someones servant but not shakespeares did he rank above nick skeres or under him above shakespeare thought phelippes after all was the one whod brought him into this business in the first place kate came up to the table good even sir she said to phelippes the threepenny supper is kidney pie ant please you monstrous fine too shakespeare added spooning up some more of his phelippes shook his head i have eat mistress he said a stoup of rhenish wined please me though ill fetch it presently kate hurried away and as shed promised returned with the wine at once phelippes set a penny on the table she took it and withdrew what would you shakespeare asked or ist what would you of me seek you a scribe phelippes inquired in return so i am given to understand shakespeare frowned i grow out of patience with others knowing my affairs ere i learn of them myself i know all manner of strange things the dusty little man answered not without pride he would never be a hero on the battlefield nor shakespeare judged with the ladies and so had to make do with what he knew twitting him about it would only make an enemy ken you a scribe then shakespeare asked a scribe who can read whats set before him write out a fair copy and speak never a word oft thereafter i ken such a man but not well phelippes said with a small smile that will not serve shakespeare said if you cannot swear he be trusty phelippes held up a hand that small smile grew bigger you mistake me sir i but repeat a grecians jest when asked by someone who knew him not if he knew himself i am the man ah shakespeare was not at all convinced phelippes was trusty after all he worked at the right hand of don diego flores de valdas and yet plainly don diegos was not the only right hand at which he worked wanting very much to ask him about that shakespeare knew he couldnt he would get back either no answer or whatever lie seemed most useful to phelippes but he could say id fain see your character or ever i commend you to master vincent think you my claim by some great degree outdoth performance thomas phelippes sounded dryly amused his mirth convinced shakespeare he likely could do as he claimed even as shakespeare started to say he needed no proof after all the pockmarked little man cut him off have you pen and paper here ay shakespeare left them on the floor by his feet while he ate to keep from spilling gravy on them he bent now picked them up and set them on the table good give them me i pray you phelippes said i shall see what i make of your hand and you will see what you make of mine he looked at some of what shakespeare had written then up at the poet himself this is philip sending forth the armada it is shakespeare answered but for myself you are the first to seet a privilege indeed phelippes murmured and then began to read arough rigor looks outright and still prevails let sword let fire let torments be their end severity upholds both realm and rule what then for minds which have revenging moods and neer forget the cross they boldly bear and as for englands desperate and disloyal plots spaniards remember write it on your walls that rebels traitors and conspirators shall feel the flames of everflaming fire which are not quenched with a sea of tears looking up again he nodded twill servetwill serve very well and a pretty contrast you draw twixt his most catholic majestys just fury here and the mercy of her life he grants elizabeth conquered gramercy shakespeare said automatically and then staring how know you of that phelippes clicked his tongue between his teeth your business is to write the which you do most excellent well mine i told you is to know think you the pause was a name he did not say aloudwould choose me would use me did i not know passing well had he named that name would it have been sir william cecils or that of don diego flores de valdas or might he have chosen one as readily as the other shakespeare wished the question hadnt occurred to him phelippes openly avowed being a tool might not any man take up a tool and cut with it phelippes tore off the bottom part of the sheet of paper on which shakespeare had been writing shakespeare stifled a sigh the other man surely would not pay him for the paper phelippes inked a pen he began to write shakespeares own hand was quick and assured if not a thing of beauty but his eyes widened as he watched phelippes the bespectacled little mans talents werent showy but talents he unquestionably had the goose quill raced over the paper at a speed that put shakespeares best to shame here phelippes handed him the scrap hed torn off will it serve think you hed copied out the bit of king philips speech hed read before shakespeare stared he himself used the native english hand hed learned in school back in stratford his writing had grown more fluid over the years because he did so much of it but had never changed its essential nature phelippes studied italian script by contrast was so very perfect an automaton might have turned it out and hed written in haste here not at leisure you know full well twill serve ay and more than serve shakespeare answered i yield you the palm master phelippes and own i have not seen so fine a character writ so swift in all my days the writing masters who show their art before the general could not outdo you hed meant it for praise but thomas phelippes only sniffed and looked at him over the tops of his spectacles those disguised cheaters and prating mountebanks he said scornfully threadbare jugglers the lot of them they write to be writing i write to be read and need no great show towards that end he prides himself in his very obscurity shakespeare realized hed liefer be a greyhen unseen against the heather than a strutting peacock flashing his feathers for all to admire that struck the poet as a perverse pride most englishmenand spaniards toogloried in display so much so as to make deliberate selfeffacement seem unnatural but that was wide of the mark i shall give master vincent your name shakespeare said phelippes nodded complacently the poet asked how shall he inquire after you never mind phelippes said so that he hath my name it sufficeth me come the time we shall know each the other he rose from his stool farewell with no more flourish than when hed come in he slipped out of the ordinary what a strange little man kate said a few minutes latershe seemed to need so long to realize phelippes had gone strange shakespeare considered that after a moment he shook his head he is far stranger than simply strange the serving woman frowned will you speak in riddles how not speaking of one he didnt explain himself he wasnt sure he could have explained himself poet though he was but he knew what he meant when he went to the theatre the next day he told thomas vincent of phelippes the prompter nodded but asked hath he the required discretion of discretion he hath a surplusage shakespeare answered he wants some of the goodly qualities framing a man of parts but discretion never i rely on your judgment as i needs must here vincent said an you be mistook he broke off as if he didnt even want to think about that neither did shakespeare but he said therein i am not god grant it be so vincent said and when may i look for king philip he was as pushy as a prompter should be anon shakespeare told him anon anon anon thomas vincent echoed mockingly are you then metamorphosed into a drawer at the boars head ever vowing to cure ails with ale and never bringing the which is promised youll havet and in good time the poet said letting a little irritation show king philip breathes yet mind you we stray close to treason treating of his mortality ere it be proved don diego hath given you his commission vincent said that being so treason enters not into the question the question say you shakespeare shivered though the day was mild enough when he thought of the question he thought of endless hogsheads of water funneled down his throat of thumbscrews of iron boots thrust into the fire of all the fiendish ingenuity spaniards and homegrown english inquisitors could bring to bear in interrogating some luckless wretch whod fallen into their clutches and he had no trouble at all seeing himself as a luckless wretch how may i find this master phillips said you phelippes shakespeare corrected he told me he would make himself known to you in good time he told you that did he vincent turned his head a little to one side and brought a hand up to his ear as if imagining he were listening to a conversation at which he hadnt been present quotha ai shall make myself known to him in good time he sounded preposterously pompous and then you would have nodded and said alet it be so master phelippes suddenly he stabbed a forefinger at shakespeare but if he fail to make himself known to me then we are betrayed and god have mercy on our souls shakespeare said thomas vincent asked him no more questions he wished the same would have been true of the players hed had to sound them out one by one knowing a wrong word in the wrong ear would bring catastrophe down upon them all he felt as if he were defusing the hellburner of antwerp each time he spoke to one of them at his nod richard burbage had eased a couple of devout papists from the companyboth of them hired men fortunately and not sharers whom the other sharers would have had to buy out some of those who remained and who knew what was toward seemed to think it certain no one not of their persuasion was left in the theatre they were careless enough with what they said to make shakespeare flinch several times a dayor when things were bad several times an hour it would have been even worse had they seen their parts for boudicca and begun throwing around lines from the play that would come soon enoughall too soon shakespeare feared even now a robustious periwigpated fellow named matthew quinn got a laugh and a cheer by shouting out that all jesuits should be flung into the sea only chance only luck lieutenant de vega came not this morning else he had been here to catch that shakespeare said to burbage in the tiring room after the company gave the days play i have spoke to master quinn burbage answered grimly the rascally sheepbiter avouches he shall not be so spendthrift of tongue henceforward will kemp came up to the two of them puffing on a pipe of tobacco still nervous and irritable shakespeare spoke more petulantly than he might have how can you bear that stinking thing how kemp for a wonder took no offense why naught simplerit holds from my nostrils the reek of yon affectioned ass he pointed with his chin towards matt quinn and they style me fool and clown he rolled his eyes they call you by the names you have earned burbage said the names master quinn hath earned for this days business needs must be named by satan himself none other having the tongue to withstand the flames therefrom engendered better quinn were dis gendered shakespeare said the fright he gave me id not sorrow to see him lose both tongue and yard youre a bloody kern today kemp said nay shakespeare shook his head i thirst for no blood nor want none spilledmost especially not mine own master quinn will attend henceforth burbage promised he stakes his life upont the game hath higher stakes than that shakespeare said for his i reckon worthless but i crave mine own to keep and they style me fool and clown will kemp repeated shakespeare leftall but fledthe tiring room a moment later he knew this plot was all too likely to miscarry but wished kemp hadnt reminded him of it quite like that ah my love i must go lope de vega murmured regretfully lucy watkins clung to him stay with me she said stay with me forever till i met thee i knew not what love was thy lips are sweet he said and kissed her but then he got out of the narrow bed and began to dress still i must away duty calls duty would consist of more rehearsals for el mejor mozo de espana lope knew he would go back to his games with catalina ibaaez the more he saw of don alejandro de recaldes mistress the more games he wanted to play with her that didnt mean he despised lucy but the thrill of the chase was gone softly lucy began to weep would thou gavest me all thy duty i may not what i may give thee i do what i dont give to catalina lope thought lucy knew nothing of the other woman lope dabbed at her face with the coverlet here dry thine eyes well meet again and soon and when we do meet let it be with gladness i always come to thee with gladness the englishwoman said but when thou goest she shook her head and snuffled at last though she too sat up and reached for the clothes shed so carelessly let fall to the floor a little while earlier by then lope was pulling on his boots hed had plenty of practice dressing in a hurry he didnt urge lucy to move faster bettermore discreetif they werent seen coming down the stairs together from the rooms above this alehouse he kissed her again think of me whilst we are parted that the time until we meet again might seem the shorter even as he tasted her tears on his lips she shook her head always it is an age an eternity never knew i time crawled so slow he had no answer for that or none that would make her happy that being so he slipped out of the cramped little room without another word before long lucy would come forth too what else could she do after all the stairs were uneven and rickety he stepped carefully on them and used care of a different sort going out through the throng of englishmen drinking below he walked very erect hand on the hilt of his rapier as if eager for one of them to challenge him because he looked so ready none did behind him one of them asked what doth the don here what doth he why his doxy a drawer answered and masculine laughter rose from the crowd de vega ignored it the server wasnt even wrong or not very wrong though lucy watkins was no whore shed fallen in love with lope as hed fallen in love with her if she hadnt he would have lost interest in her right away getting to a womans secret place was easy getting to her heart was harder and mattered more his own heart leaped when he began directing catalina ibaaez explaining to her just exactly how she as isabella was falling in love with the soldier playing ferdinand of aragon and if you as yourself happen to fall in love with me as i think im falling in love with you lope thought he intended to give catalina all the help he could along those lines no matter what he intended though he had to restrain himself for the time being don alejandro darling catalina ibanez squealed when a handsome tawnybearded fellow strutted into the courtyard where lope was putting his mostly ragtag company through its paces you did come to see me rehearse i told you i would don alejandro de recalde replied bowing to her i keep my word he nodded to lope you are the playwright senor at your service your excellency lope said with a bow of his own at your mistress service especially at your mistress service if the nobleman knew what was in de vegas mind he gave no sign of it with another friendly nod he said ive been listening to catalina practicing her lines these past few days and i have to tell you im impressed i heard a good many dreary comedies in madrid that couldnt come close to what youre doing here in this godforsaken wilderness slightly dazed lope murmured youre far too kind your excellency he scratched his head he wasnt impervious to guilt here was this fellow praising his work and he wanted to sleep with the mans mistress he took another look at catalina ibaaez at her sparking eyes the delicate arch of her nose her red lips and white teeth the sweetly curved figure her brocaded dress displayed well as a matter of fact yes lope thought the game is worth the candle do i hear you write plays in english as well as spanish don alejandro asked no sir that is not so i speak english but i have never tried to write it de vega answered i am working with seaor shakespeare though on his play about his most catholic majesty the englishman has even written a small part for me into his king philip that may be what you heard yes it could be de recalde agreed still friendly and polite would you do me the honor of letting me see what you have here so far lope didnt really want to do that the production was still ragged and no one knew it better than he but he saw no way to refuse a noblemans request however polite it sounded it was really more a noblemans order he did feel he could warn de recalde it wont be the show youd see in a few more days of course of course don alejandro waved aside the objection but i do want to see how my sweethearts lines fit in with everybody elses he gazed fondly at catalina ibaaez lope would have sold his soul for the look she sent the nobleman in return but then she turned one equally warm on him as she said hes given me such lovely words to use he certainly has don alejandro agreed because of his wealth and good looks was he too complacent to believe catalina might be interested in a man who had little to offer but words if he was that complacent did he have reason to be so i hope not lope thought aloud he said take your places everyone were going to start from the beginning for his excellency madre de dios somebody kick diego and wake him up diego rose with a yelp what was that for he demanded indignantly i wasnt asleep i was only resting my eyes arguing with him was more trouble than it was worth de vega didnt try he just said no time for rest now lazybones were going to take it from the top for don alejandro so he can see what weve been up to ah senor since when have you wanted anybody knowing what youre up to diego murmured his eyes sliding towards catalina ibaaez lope coughed and spluttered diego might make a miserable excuse for a servant but that didnt mean he didnt know the man he served so badly instead of looking at catalina himself lope glanced toward alejandro de recalde the nobleman fortunately hadnt paid any attention to diego places places lope shouted submerging wouldbe lover so playwright and director could come forth being all those people at once he sometimes felt very crowded inside were other people also so complex when he thought of diego he had his doubts when he thought of christopher marlowe i wont think of marlowe he told himself hes gone and i dont have to worry about seizing him any more but oh by god how ill miss his poetry de vegas own poetry poured forth from his amateur company he screamed cajoled prompted and kept looking at don alejandro catalinas keeper plainly enjoyed el mejor mozo de espaaa he laughed in all the right places and clapped loud enough to seem a bigger audience than he was he didnt applaud only his mistress either which proved him a gentleman when the play ended catalina ibanez curtsied to him then deliberately as if she really were queen isabella she curtsied to lope too he bowed in return also as if she were the queen don alejandro de recalde laughed and cheered for them both catalinas eyes lit up she smiled out at the noblemanbut somehow managed to include lope in that smile too shes trying to see how close to the wind she can sail he realized playing games with me right under don alejandros nose hell kill herand likely me tooif he notices but if he doesntoh if he doesnt lope slid closer to her as softly as he could he murmured when can i see you alone had she shown surprise then surprise or offense he would have been a dead man but she unlike most of her companions here really was an actress lope had had that thought before soon she whispered back very soon her expression never changed not a bit shes going to betray don alejandro lope thought how long before she betrays me too his eyes traveled the length of her again for the life of himand he knew it might be for the life of himhe couldnt make himself worry about that thomas vincent held sheets of paper under shakespeares nose steeth master vincent mind what you do shakespeare said none should look on those who hath not strongest need be you not amongst that number the prompter returned methought youd fain see our scribe his work i have seen his work shakespeare said had i not i had given you the name of another but he took a sheet from vincent even so thomas phelippes had had to work like a man possessed to copy out all the parts of boudicca so quickly however fast hed written though his script hadnt suffered it remained as clear as it had been when hed demonstrated it in shakespeares ordinary you could get no better shakespeare said and thomas vincent nodded the poet gave back the part now thenmake this disappear place it not where any sneaking spy nor prowling spaniard might come upont i am not so fond as you hold me the prompter said none shall see it but he whose part it isand him i shall not suffer to take it from the theatre marry i hope you do not shakespeare said yet will even that suffice us for know you we may also be done to death by slanderous tongues i knowt well sir too well by jesu vincent replied here i am come unto a fear of death a terrible and unavoided danger let only the fear thereof be unavoided the thing itself passing over us like the angel of death oer the children of israel in egypt from this nettle danger may we pluck the flower safety before thomas vincent could answer one of the tiremans helpers who stood at the entrance to the theatre began to whistle the tune to a particular bawdy song the players on the stage whod begun learning their parts for boudicca switched on the instant to rehearsing the piece they would put on that afternoon the prompter said mark you nowin sooth they do vanish he vanished himself disappearing into the tiring room shakespeare wished he too could disappear no such luck instead he walked out to greet lieutenant de vega of whose arrival that bawdy song had warned god give you good morrow he called and made a leg at the spaniard and you sir lope swept off his hat and bowed in return you are well i hope passing well i thank you shakespeare didnt mind exchanging courtesies with de vega as long as they talked in commonplaces peril seemed far away it wasnt he knew that full well but it seemed so and even the semblance of tranquility was precious how fares king philip lope asked passing well shakespeare repeated adding or so i hope the commission he had from don diego flores de valdas was far safer than the one lord burghley had given him part of him hoped lord westmorlands men would offer their auditors king philip not boudicca that would pluck safety from the nettle of danger it would be a cravens safety but safety nonetheless let boudicca once see the light of day and let boudicca once see the light of day and god grant i get free of england as kit hath done shakespeare thought england had lain under the spaniards boots for almost ten years now could she rise up and cast them out if she could why hadnt she long since how fares king philip himself he inquired lope de vega frowned not well i fear me not well at all late word from spain hath it he waxeth dropsical his belly and thighs now much distended whilst his other members waste away he crossed himself shakespeare did the same he couldnt quite hide a shudder hed seen the horrid bloating of dropsy seen it rob its victims of life an inch at a time theyd had to press a board against one luckless players belly to help him make water as if they were squeezing the juice from grapes in a wine press next to that the swift certainty of the gallows seemed a mercy but youd have no swift end not now best you finish the play quick as you might de vega told him soon enoughall too soonthe company will show it forth it lacks but little shakespeare said glad i am to hear you say so the spaniard said as soon as all the parts be finished let your prompter give them to the scribes that they might make fair copies of them for the players to learn by heart certes your honor just as you say so shall it be now shakespeare bowed you know well the customary usages of a theatre not your own he put more sarcasm into that than perhaps he should have de vega fortunately did not seem to notice he answered they are not so different from those of spain your prompter is new to his work not so indeed his predecessor having died guilt stabbed at shakespeare he did his best not to show it de vega here might one day talk to constable strawberry and strawberry in his own plodding way had already connected shakespeare and ingram frizer though he didnt quite know what connections hed made but for now lope de vegas attention focused on king philip and the problems involved in producing it an he have trouble finding scribes fit for the matter i ken a man whod suit it ah shakespeare said the most noncommittal noise he could make lope nodded ay sir an englishman already in the employ of don diego and thus acquainted with all you purpose here i have seen his writing and know him to have an excellent character most legible he is called thomas ah phelippes he pronounced the name in the spanish manner as if it had three syllables that kept shakespeare from recognizing it for a moment when he did he felt as if a thunderbolt had crashed to earth at his feet lope knew phelippes well enough to know what sort of scribe he made did the spanish officer have a fair copy of boudicca had he got it before thomas vincent got his whom may i trust shakespeare wondered dizzily vincent phelippes nick skeres lord burghley anyone in all the world the deeper into the plot he sank the closer he came to the moment when the company would offer one play or the other the more certain he became that no one had any business ever trusting anyone else what think you senor lope asked when shakespeare didnt answer right away master vincent meseems hath already scribes enough for the work shakespeare said picking his words with the greatest of care you were wiser though to speak to him in this matter than to me he is quite out of countenance with my character reckoning it to show mine own bad character the spanish officer chuckled at his feeble wordplay not knowing how hard shakespeare was working to distract him and to conceal his own alarm as you suggest so shall i do de vega said shall i find him in the tiring room i know not shakespeare replied hoping vincent had had the sense and the time to hide the fair copythe fair copy thomas phelippes had written out of boudicca ill seek him there lope said and off he went before shakespeare could try to delay him any more no howls of fright or fury came from behind the stage so shakespeare dared hope the prompter had proved prompt enough in concealing the dangerous play shakespeare had only a small part in the days production marlowes caligula the poet was fled but his plays lived on shakespeare would have been glad with more to do he might have worried less as things were hed never been so glad to escape the theatre once the show was done he hadnt gone far towards london before richard burbage fell into step with him give you good even the other player said and then it went right well methought hed played the title role and milked it for all it was worth still shakespeare nodded as marlowe had written it the role was worth milking this was the frightfullest roman of them all shakespeare said in sooth he is a choice bit of work burbage said and in sooth could we but show more of what he did hed seem frightfuller yet it wonders me the master of the revels gave kit leave to present een as much as the play offers shakespeare said come the day well show more than sir edmund wots of burbage observed come the day shakespeare echoed and by what the spaniard saith the day comes soon philip hath declined further he walked along for a few paces then added or come the day well give the auditors king philip and all will weep for fallen glory burbage was also silent for a little while peradventure we will he said at last but ere i sleep each night i pray god theyll see the other here in shoreditch high street he named no names who could tell which jade or ragamuffin might take some incautious word to the dons or the english inquisition well dick your prayer at least is to the purpose shakespeare said wearily when i petition the lord it is that he let this cup pass from me i fear me though he hears me not he threw his hands in the air swounds why fled i not this madness or ever it laid hold of me the heart hath its reasons whereof reason knoweth naught burbage said shakespeare stopped in surprise that is well said ist your own when burbage nodded shakespeare set a hand on his shoulder when next will kemp assails you as being but the mouthpiece for other men cast defiance ins teeth so i would and so i will the other player answered but gramercy for your courtesy your servant sir shakespeare said would i were penning some trifling comedy of lovers loving will they nill they id engraft your line therein fast as ever i could he sighed shall i ever again labor over aught so sweet and simple but if all go well burbage said perhaps shakespeare said and said no more he didnt want his hopes to rise too high they would only have further to fall burbage might have sensed as much instead of going on with the argument he pointed ahead bishopsgate draws nigh spring at last being arrived it likes me having daylight left once weve strutted and fretted our two hours upon the stage why it doth like me as well shakespeare said in surprise he clapped a hand to his forehead by my troth dick ive scarce noted proudpied april dressed in all his trim putting a spirit of youth in everything goose quill and paper have compassed round my life belike for its april no moe burbage told him these are mays newfangled shows and far from the best of em may shakespeare cried surely not surely theyd have decked the streets with greenery as is the custom and burnt bonfires and run up maypoles for that they might dance round em surely they would have surely they did surely you never marked it richard burbage eyed him with amused pity wait shakespeare snapped his fingers i mind me we gave the groundlings the taming of the shrew on the day there dyou see i had some knowledge of it after all that felt very important to him just then burbages expression changed not a jot and so we did but why know you of it only for that it came to pass within the theatres bourne otherwise he shook his head as usual irishmen with long hungry faces and fiery eyes stood guard at bishopsgate the gallowglasses glowered at shakespeare and burbage the two players were big enough and young enough to seem dangerous no matter how mildly they behaved one of the guards said something in his own musical language of which shakespeare understood not a word another started to draw his sword but their sergeantdistinguishable only because he was a few years older and a little more scarredshook his head he waved the englishmen into london saying pass through quick now mind lean rawboned rascals burbage muttered but he made sure the gallowglasses couldnt hear him i do despise the bloody cannibals shakespeare agreed also in a low voice may they prove roast meat for worms god grant it burbage said that the dons lord it over us is one thingthey earned the right having beaten us in war but these redpolled swashbucklers he shook his head men whod never dare rise against the spaniards will run riot to cast out irish wolves ay belike shakespeare wondered if sir william cecil had thought of inflaming londoners against the savages from the western island likely he will have the poet thought he sees so much would he have missed that still he resolved to speak of it to lord burghley when next he saw him or to nick skeres or thomas phelippes if he didnt see the noble soon phelippes shakespeare kicked a pebble into a puddle whom did the clever dusty little man really serve sir william don diego or only himself first last and always as soon as shakespeare shaped the question he saw what the answer had to be but where in the end would phelippes judge his interest lay and how much would that cost everyone on the other side burbage clapped him on the back im to mine own house god give you good even will and you shakespeare said absently his head full of plots he had to remind himself to turn off bishopsgate street and make for his lodging then hed be off to the ordinary to write as long as he could and then back to the lodging once more this time to sleep god save me he muttered may day passed by and i knew it not he wondered what else hed missed and decided he didnt want to know come on diego lope de vega said impatiently from horseback you have only a donkey to mount the two of you must be close cousins senor i would never mount my cousin the good book forbids itand besides shes ugly his servant answered as lope blinked at such unexpected wit diego swung up into the saddle the ass brayed pitifully at his weight you have your costume lope demanded diego set a hand on a saddlebag de vega nodded good to westminster then they say englands isabella may come to watch the play to see castiles performed on stage she could make your fortune diego she could make mine he thought diego said a servant playing a servant wont make much of a mark you should have cast me as ferdinand they rode away from the spanish barracks at the heart of london and west toward the court center lope had to rein in to keep his horse a highspirited mare from leaving diegos donkey behind ferdinand lope said what mad dream is that youre not asleep now not so i can tell but am i not the perfect figure of a king diego said surveying his rotund servant de vega answered you are the perfect figure of two kingsat least diego sent him a venomous glare lope paid no attention on such a day he was happy enough to be outdoors as always spring had to a spaniards reckoning come late to england but it was here at last the sun shone brightly the only clouds in the sky were small white ones drifting slowly from west to east on a mild breeze it had rained a couple of days beforenot hard just enough to lay the dust without turning the road into a bog everything was green new grass grew exuberantly more so than it ever did in drier hotter castile trees and bushes were in new leaf the earliest spring flowers had begun to brighten the landscape birdsong filled the moist air robins and chaffinches cuckoos and larks waxwings and tits all made music they left england sooner and came back later than they did in spain each spring when they returned lope discovered anew how much hed missed them and how especially empty and barren the winter had seemed without them diego smiled to hear those songs too mesh nets he murmured birdlime by all the saints theres nothing can match a big plate of songbirds all nicely roasted on spits or maybe baked in a pie i dont think much of english cookery but they make some savory pies beefsteak and kidneys mighty tasty too and you can get that any season of the year yes that is a good one lope agreed and the song of the cow is much less melodious than that of the linnet or greenfinch the song of the cow seaor diego asked before de vega could answer his servant shook his head no dont tell me i dont think i want to know it must be something only poets can hear not at all diego lope smiled sweetly for example whenever you open your mouth everyone around you is treated to the song of the jackass oh i am wounded diego moaned he clutched at his heart i have taken a mortal thrust send for the physician no send for the priest to shrive me for i am surely slain you are surely a nuisance is what you are lope said but he couldnt help laughing no more than a mile or so separated westminster from london with the space between the two cities only a bit less crowded than either one of them de vega never had the sensation of truly being out in the country as he would have while traveling between a couple of towns in spain whenever he looked to the left a forest of sails on the thames reminded him how brash and busy this part of the world was fancy houses diego remarked as they rode into westminster you can tell this is a place for rich people all the poor menall the honest menare back in london lope couldnt help laughing at that either but for a rather different reason london drew the ambitious the hungry the desperate from all over england a lot of them discovered that no matter how ambitious and desperate they were they stayed hungry the hungrier they got the less likely they were to stay honest london had more thieves and robbers than any other three cities lope could imagine those fancy houses drew his eye tooagain for a different reason this is drury lane he said lord burghley lives here who was elizabeths chief minister anthony bacon lived here too till the accursed sodomite fled the kingdom sounds like a good street for a fire diego said just by accident of course he winked i dont know what youre talking about lope answered deadpan the two of them exchanged knowing looks the thames bent towards the south the road followed it de vega and diego rode past a tiltyard and several new tenements before coming to a large area on their left enclosed by a brick wall over the top of the wall loomed the upper stories of some impressive buildings whats that diego asked pointing to the enclosure that that is scotland lope said diego scornfully tossed his head you cant fool me boss youve been scaring me with scotland for a while now i know what it isthat kingdom up north of here the one where the wild men live some of the wild men lope amended but that yard that too is scotland he crossed himself to show he was telling the truth when the king of the wild men comes to visit england he is housed there and so it took its name he wished the present king of scotland would come to visit england but despite honeyed invitations protestant james vi was too canny to thrust his head into the catholic lions mouth lope continued and there beyond lies whitehall where the company shall perform oh joy diego said whitehall had formerly been a nobles residence henry viii having taken it for his own had enlarged it adding tennis courts bowling alleys and another tiltyard with a secondstory gallery from which he and his companions might observe the sport elizabeth had also watched jousts from that gallery but neither isabella nor her consort albert much favored them a wooden stage not much different from that of the theatre had gone up on the tiltyard in front of the gallery the highestranking english and spanish grandees would view el mejor mozo de espaaa from the comfort of the gallery the rest prominent enough to be invited but not enough to keep company with the queen and king would impersonate the groundlings who packed the theatres out beyond londons walls they didnt have to pay a penny for the privilege though in the makeshift tiring room behind the stage players donned costumes put on makeup and mumbled their lines trying to hold them in their memory when lope came in catalina ibaaez rushed up to him oh senor de vega god help me im so nervous she cried i want to explode he glanced around to make sure don alejandro was out in the audience and not hovering backstage here then leaned forward and gave her a kiss that might have seemed careless dont you worry about a thing sweetheart youll be wonderful he told her and sent up a quick silent prayer that hed prove right a lackey rushed into the tiring room the queen and king have taken their places in the gallery he said then wed better perform for them hadnt we lope said come on my friends show them what you can do he looked around again to make sure everyone was ready diego in the name of god dont fall asleep now i wasnt falling asleep diego said i was only resting my eyes lope finished for him youve used that one before dont use it again unless you want to get to know the real scotland not the yard here one last quick worried look then he nodded to catalina ibaaez and one of her maidservants who would open the play as isabella and doaa juana her ladyinwaiting catalina crossed herself her maidservant giggled they went out onto the stage the audience which had been mumbling and buzzing gave them its ears as soon as catalina ibaaez got on stage she was finebetter than fine lope breathed a sigh of relief everything went as well as hed hoped everything in fact went better than hed dared hope the actors remembered their lines even the most wooden ones delivered them with some feeling diego made a better servant on stage than he ever had for real an hour and a half flew by as if in a dream the applause for the players was thunderous from the tiring room lope heard catalina ibaaez call and here is the man who gave us these golden words to say senior lieutenant lope falix de vega carpio more applause as lope who felt as if he were dreaming himself came out onto the stage and bowed to the audienceespecially to the central gallery where isabella and albert of england sat how had catalina learned his full name no time to wonder about that now queen isabella was calling well done senor de vega you are a very clever fellow lope bowed again isabella tossed him a small leather purse he caught it out of the air it was heavy heavy enough to be stuffed with gold he bowed once more this time almost double dazedly he followed the company offstage back in the tiring room he went over to catalina ibaaez and said how can i thank you for calling me out there her eyes were as warm with promise as an early summer morning if youre as clever as queen isabella says seaor de vega im sure youll think of something she purred only later did he wonder whether she was really looking at him or at the purse hed just got sam king came up to shakespeare in the parlor of the lodgings they shared a little shyly he said i have somewhat for you master will he held out his hand and gave shakespeare three penniestwo stamped with the visages of isabella and albert the third an older coin of elizabeths gramercy shakespeare said in surprise up till now king hadnt had enough money for himself let alone to pay back anyone else shakespeare had almost forgotten the threepence hed given the younger man for a supper and certainly hadnt expected to see it again but a touch of pride in his voice king said i pay what i owe i do right glad am i to heart shakespeare answered youve found work then you might say so but kings nod seemed intended to convince himself at least as much as to convince shakespeare ay sir you might say so and what manner of work ist pray tell no sooner were the words out of his mouth than shakespeare wished he had them back had sam king landed an apprenticeship with a carpenter or a bricklayer he would have shouted the news to the skies and would have deserved to as things were as things were he turned red i am stalled to the rogue he replied at last are you shakespeare tried to sound happy for the man who slept in the same room as he did for someone on his own and hungry in london even being formally initiated as a beggar had to seem a step up carefully the poet went on god grant men be generous to you he wondered how long they would stay generous king was young and healthy even if on the scrawny side a beggar with one leg or a missing eye or some other injury or ailment that inspired pity might have a better chance at pennies and hapennies and farthings but king smiled and said there are all manner of cheats to pry the bite from a gentry cove or from your plain cuffin too ive a cleym now fit to make a man spew an he see it have you indeed shakespeare wasnt surprised to hear that hed known other beggars who used false sores to get money from those who saw them ay sir sam king said and the moe i learn the art the better the living i shall have of it yes he might almost have been speaking of carpentry or bricklaying may it be so shakespeare said as politely as he could he wished the other man would go away he gave beggars coins now and again and did not care to think of them as frauds king though bubbled with enthusiasm for his new trade i take crowfoot spearwort and salt and bruising these together i lay them upon the place of the body i wish to make sore he said grinning the skin by this means being fretted i first clap a linen cloth till it stick fast which plucked off the raw flesh hath ratsbane thrown upon it to make it look ugly and then cast over that a cloth which is always bloody and filthy shakespeares stomach lurched as it might have in a small boat on rough water fascinated in spite of himself he asked but doth your flesh not from such rude usage take true hurt nay nay sam king shook his head i dot so often that in the end i feel no pain neither desire i to have it healed but i will travel with my great cleym from market to market being able by my maunding to get quite five shillings in a week in money and in corn no wonder you could repay me then shakespeare remarked five shillings a week wouldnt make a man rich but he wouldnt starve on such earnings either no wonder at all king agreed happily i company with two or three other artificial palliards and we sing out boldly thus his voice rose to a shrill piercing whine ah the worship of god look out with your merciful eyne one pitiful look upon sore lame grieved impotent people sore troubled with the grievous disease and we have no rest day nor night by the canker and worm that continually eateth the flesh from the bone for the worship of god one cross of your small silver to buy us salve and ointment to ease the poor wretched body that never taketh rest and god reward you for it in heaven jane kendall hurried into the parlor begone we want no beggars here she began and then checked herself oh tis you master king methought you some other tricksy wretch seeking to beguile silver by cleyms and other frauds ill not have such doings in this house i know better she didnt mind if king begged elsewhere she simply didnt want her lodgers tricked out of money that might otherwise assure her of her rent having dwelt in her house some little while shakespeare was certain of that he said fear not he did but learn me his law the which is indeed most quaint and bene well say no more about it then the widow kendall heaved a sigh this place is not what it wasby my halidom it is not that i should have lodging here all at the same time a beggar and a witch and a poet she shook her head shakespeare resented being lumped together with sam king and cicely sellis a moments reflection though told him they might resent being lumped together with him he said so that we pay what you require on the appointed day wheres your worry mistress kendall so that you do alls well she answered but with such trades sweet jesu who ever heard of a rich poet she could imagine a rich beggar she could imagine a cunning woman with money a poet no shakespeare was tempted to brag of the gold hed got from lord burghley and don diego he was tempted for a good half a heartbeat then common sense prevailed the best way to keep from being robbed or having his throat slit was not to let on he had anything worth stealing mommet stalked into the parlor the cat rubbed the side of its head against shakespeares ankle and began to purr a little uncomfortably shakespeare stroked it the cunning womans cather familiar had seemed to like him from their first meeting what would an inquisitor on the trail of witchcraft make of that nothing good shakespeare was sure sam king said mistress kendall may i take a mug of your fine ale at her nod king hurried into the kitchen when he came back with the mug mischief lit his face he squatted by mommet and poured out a little puddle on the floor the widow kendalls voice rose in sharp indignation here now what do you do would you waste it by no means king crooned here puss puss puss to the animal come on your waysopen your mouthhere is that which will give language to you cat open your mouth mommet sniffed at the ale slowly soaking into the rammedearth floor the cats head bent ever so delicately it lapped at the puddle then it looked up it eyes caught the firelight from the hearth and glowed green what game play you at sam king started violently and made the sign of the cross shakespeare jerked in surprise too but it wasnt the cat that had spoken it was cicely sellis standing in the doorway to her room hands on hips her face furious what play you at she asked again tell me straight out else ill make you sorry for your silence nnnnaught mistress sellis king stammered his face going gray with fear i was but ah giving your cat ah somewhat to drink you play the palliard the cunning woman said play not the fool sirrah or youll find more in the way of foolery than ever was in your reckoning hear you me ii do king answered in a very small voice see tot then cicely sellis snapped she made a small clucking sound come you here mommet cats didnt come when called shakespeare had known that since he was a little boy in stratford cats did as they pleased not as anyone else pleased but mommet trotted over to cicely sellis like a lapdog the cats contented buzz filled the parlor that frightened sam king all over again god be my judge mistress i meant no harm he whispered the look the cunning woman gave him said she would judge him and that god would have nothing to do with it some men there are that love not a gaping pig she said some that are mad if they behold a cat as there is no firm reason to be rendered why he cannot abide a harmless necessary cat so he were wiser to show mercy and pity than to sport with a poor dumb beast that knoweth naught of sport or think you otherwise no kings lips shaped the word but without sound he vanished into the bedchamber he shared with shakespeare jane kendall disappeared almost as quickly that left shakespeare all alone with cicely sellisand with mommet he could have done without the honor if that was what it was as she stroked the cats brindled coat he asked go you to the arena to see bears baited or bulls or to the cockfights to his relief she didnt take offense and did take the point of the question shaking her head she answered i go not to any such socalled sports i cannot abide them i am of one piece in mine affections and opinions master shakespeare can you say the same me lady nay nor would i essay it for my wits are all in motley now of one shade now another and which of us is better fort shakespeare asked cicely sellis thought then shrugged which struck him as basically honest x a sharp cough brought lope de vega up short he looked back towards shakespeare who advanced across the stage of the theatre you attend not master de vega shakespeare said severely that was your cue to say forth your lines and it passed you by i had not known you as such an unperfect actor on the stage who with his fear is put besides his part nor am i such lope bowed apology you pardon sir i pray you twas not fear put me out what then shakespeare asked still frowning whateer the reason you must improve else youll appear not would you have the groundlings pelt you with marrows and beetroots and apples gone all wormy would you have them outshout the action crying ao jesu he does it as like one of these harlotry players as ever i see the englishmans voice climbed to a mocking falsetto no and no and no lope shook his head that harlotry struck too close to the mark i fear me i find myself distracteda matter having naught to do with yourself or with your most excellent king philip he wondered how much more he would have to say but shakespeare after cocking his head to one side got to the nub of it in two words a woman yes a woman lope answered in some relief she hath made promises made them and then kept them not and yet she may this being so i am torn twixt hope and fury he hadnt thought catalina ibaaez would play him for a fool he hadnt thought she could play him for a fool but don alejandros mistress had been all warmth and seductiveness when she didnt have to deliver and had either kept from seeing him alone or been frustratingly cool when she did it drove lope mad too mad to realize it might have been intended to do just that will kemp laughed the clown pitched his voice high as shakespeare had if thou thinkest i am too quickly won ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay so thou wilt woo he let it drop back to its usual register sits the wind so hed summed it up more neatly than de vega had on his own yes just so lope answered what am i to do you are to have your lines as master idiaquez by heart even an she be heartless shakespeare told him let not your honor as a man touch your honor as a player or no player shall you be i understand lope said contritely you have reason seaor my private woe should not unsettle this your play as for the wench a boot in the bum may haply work wonders as hath been known aforetimes kemp said and if you cannot cure her by the foot belike youll dot by the yard he leered shakespeare snorted so did the rest of the englishmen in earshot lope scratched his head he spoke english well but every so often something flew past him he had the feeling this was one of those times i do know my lines he said ignoring what he couldnt follow hear me if you willthis cardinal though from an humble stock undoubtedly was fashioned to much honour from his cradle he was a scholar and a ripe and good one exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading lofty and sour to them that lovd him not but to those men that sought him sweet as summer and to add greater honours to his age than man could give him he died fearing god in sooth you have them shakespeare agreed it were better though to bring them forth when called for and so i shall lope promised before god i shall before god aywe are ever before god will kemp said but can you stand and deliver before the groundlings theres the rub he couldnt mean he thought the groundlings a more important and more difficult audience than god could he no one could be that blasphemous the english inquisition would get its hooks into a man who dared say anything of the sortwould get them in and never let go again an ordinary man fetched before the inquisitors would have no defense but a player lope realized just might he could say hed put the thought of his craft ahead of his soul for a moment he probably wouldnt escape scotfree but might avoid the worst let us try again shakespeare said the more we work afore ourselves alone the better we shall seem when the theatres full or not an god will it so kemp said the bestrehearsed company will now and again make a hash of things i have myself seen the same more often than i should wish lope agreed ay certes so have we all shakespeare said but a company less than well rehearsed will make a hash of things more than now and again thus i tell you once more into the breach dear friends once more or close the show up with our bungled lines disguise fair nature with hardsummoned art when the trumpets blast blows in your ears then imitate the action of the spaniard i need not imitate lope pointed out shakespeare made a leg at him indeed not lieutenant but as for you others id see you stand like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start follow your spirit and upon your cue cry agod for philip sweet spain and saint james richard burbage had left the stage probably for the jakes returning he clapped his hands and said by god will ive gone off to war with words less heartening ringing in my ears never mind war shakespeare said let us instead piece together this king philip take your places we shall once more essay the scene this time lope remembered his lines he sent them ringing out into the empty theatre as he spoke and gestured he tried to imagine the place full of noisy excited people all straining forward to catch his every wordand all ready to pelt him with whatever they had handy if he came up dry or simply if they didnt care for what he had to say from everything hed seen english audiences had less mercy in them than their spanish counterparts when they scented weakness they went straight for the kill here though shakespeare seemed satisfied enough for now methinks he said god grant we have time aplenty for further work herewith the days play however we must give at two o the clock that wherein we should be good betimes needs must yield pride of place to that wherein we must be good anon master lope gramercy for your work this day the pleasure is mine de vega touched a finger to the broad brim of his hat in salute the phrase was an english translation of a spanish commonplace but he meant it youall of youshow me every day i am here what a company of players should be steeth master lope i take it as an insult that anyone should style me an exemplar will kemp growled do you withdraw it or will you give satisfaction for a moment de vega thought hed truly been challenged then he thought he might draw on the clown to cure him of such insolence once for all but after a pause that couldnt have spanned two heartbeats he drew himself up as if affronted i give satisfaction sirrah do you take me for a woman the players laughed will kemps grin showed uneven teeth by my troth no he answered dyou take me for kit marlowe more laughter arose the baying laughter of men mocking one anothers prowess i am wounded de vega said and clapped both hands over his heart which only shows you know not where kitd wound you kemp said and clapped both his hands over his backside that coarse baying laughter redoubled lope joined it hed admiredstill did admiremarlowe the poet it was as if marlowe the sodomite were some different creature divorced from the other life would have been simpler were that true but they both made up different parts of the same man de vega wondered not for the first time how god could instill such great gifts and such a great sin into the same flesh and spirit he sometimes thought god did such things to keep mortals from believing they understood him and getting an exaggerated notion of their own cleverness does marlowes fall then save other men from sins of their own he wondered if that be so does it not make marlowe like our lord lope shook his head there was one bit of speculation his confessor would never hear if it should reach an inquisitors ears no lope didnt want to think about that as lord westmorlands men began going through the play theyd put on when the theatre opened de vega walked out swung up onto his horse and rode back to london this time no one in the crowded tenements outside the wall troubled him not beyond the usual catcalls and curses from behind his back ignoring those was always easier trying to track down the folk who loosed them led only to frustration and fury at bishopsgate the irish guards also recognized him for a spaniard from them he got respect instead of scorn their sergeant an immense man made a clumsy leg at him the common soldiers murmured in what might have been irish or might have been what they reckoned english either way it was unintelligible to lope he tipped his hat and rode on not far inside the gate he was struck by the spectacle of a handsome woman coming out of an ordinary with a cat perched on her left shoulder as if it were a sailors bird he reined in give you good day my lady he said and why i pray you sits the beast there she gave him a measuring look good day to you sir she answered lope realized then she was a few years older than he he hadnt noticed at first glance as he would have with most women her smile held a certain challenge as for mommet herewell porqua no of course she would know him for a spaniard by his dress his looks his accent he laughed why not indeed what an extraordinary beast though to stay where you choose to set it the catmommetsent him a sliteyed green stare a good deal more dismissive than its mistress its yawn displayed needle teeth and a pink tongue the woman said what cat is not an extraordinary beast come to that what man is not an extraordinary beast lope blinked he was in love with lucy watkins he was also in love with catalina ibaaez a love that tormented his soulamong other thingsall the more because it remained as yet unconsummated even so a woman who spoke in riddles could not help but intrigue him love of the body yes love of the spirityes that too but also love of the mind especially for a man with a leaping darting mind like lopes a love neither of his two present amours returned who are you he asked urgently he wondered if she would tell him a modest woman wouldnt have but then a modest woman wouldnt have spoken to him in the street at all im called cicely sellis she answered with no hesitation he noted and you sir are with another woman or with a woman of another sort he would have given his rank and the rolling grandeur of his full name to this one he said only i am known as lope de vega he couldnt help bowing in the saddle and adding very much at your service mistress sellis mommet yawned again as if to say how little his service meant cicely sellis dropped him a token curtsy careful not to dislodge the cat you are master shakespeares friend she said he started to cross himselfit hadnt been a question but a calm statement of fact arresting the gesture he demanded how know you that no mystery amusement sparkled in her eyes his lodginghouse and mine own are the same and full many a time hath he spoke your name oh lope wanted to ask what shakespeare had said about him regretfully he decided that wouldnt be a good idea with a nod he urged his horse forward i hope to see you again mistress sellis may it be so she said and english spring truly came home to lope jack hungerford showed shakespeare a row of cheap rusty helmets somewhat brightened by splashes of silver paint with feather plumes master will they serve passing well for roman casques the tireman said see you how the cheek pieces ive added help give em the seeming of antiquity shakespeare reached out and touched one of those cheek pieces it was as hed expected nothing but cut tin hardly thicker than a leaf of paper that didnt matter it would look all right to the audience what the players wore and what the groundlings sawor imagined they sawwere two very different things he knew that no one whod ever gone on up on stage could help knowing it still can we not make it plainer who these romans are whom they personate he inquired hungerford frowned they are romans not so he scratched his head ay certes they are romans shakespeare drummed the fingers of his right hand on his hose the tireman who dealt in things cared nothing for symbols but bethink you master jack they are romans yes they are invaders come to britain to conquer her to change for their own her ancient and ancestral usages in the doing they have cast down a queen how many examples would he have to string together how long before jack hungerford saw where he aimed would the tireman ever see it scratching again this time at the side of his chin hungerford spoke in thoughtful tones they fair put you in mind o the dons not so even so master jack even so shakespeare wanted to kiss him hungerford had seen where he was going after all can you devise somewhat wherewith they have at once the seeming of romans and spaniards both well i have me these morions here hungerford said doubtfully pointing to a row of spanishstyle helmets below the roman ones haply i might make shift to give em a crest of feathers or horsehair here along the comb so he ran his finger from the front of a morion to the back to show what he meant yes most excellent indeed shakespeare exclaimed by my troth master jack the very thing at times now the roman soldiery will be seen armored can this also call to mind the dons equipage oh yes naught simpler there now that the tireman had the bit between his teeth he could run a good english backandbreast is like unto that which the spaniards wear an eagle daubed on the breast thereof should show the armor is purposed to stand for a romans ant please you indeedit pleases me greatly shakespeare nodded now one thing more what have we here of queenly regalia queenly even with bit between his teeth hungerford didnt change gaits quickly he needed a moment to shift his thoughts from one path to another but then he snapped his fingers ah i follow for the lad who is to play he snapped his fingers again this time in annoyance beshrew me if i recall the name boudicca shakespeare said patiently how many people these days knew of the queen of the iceni defeated and dead more than fifteen hundred years only those whod fought through the annals maybe his tragedy would change that then again maybe it would never take the stage but he had to go on as if he thought it would boudicca hungerford echoed a heathen appellation if ever such there be well what would you in aid of the garb purposed for that part master will that it resemble a certain other deposed queens as close as may be shakespeare answered he would not say the name he didnt know why not this conversation was already so manifestly treasonous the name couldnt make it worse but no one ever said it in todays england without a shiver of fear without wondering who might be listening he wondered if any girl child born after the summer of bore it he had his doubts he knew he wouldnt have given it to a little girl not in an england ruled by isabella and albert maybe some folk were braver than he no certainly some folk were braver than he but were any that brave or that reckless again the tireman needed a heartbeat or two to catch up with him a certain other hungerford said and then nodded oh elizab he stopped he would not say all of the name either his eyes widened i take your drift whatsoever we may lack i can get for barter from other companies they need not know our veritable intent only that it is to garb a queen you may say queen mary ant please you shakespeare said she hath some small part in king philip as she had some small part in king philip his life said hungerford who was old enough to remember when mary and philip had briefly shared the english throne he nodded ay that will suit well enough should any presume to make inquiry are you fain to have me give him a red wig and powder his face white as was her custom for some years however your wit may take you shakespeare answered the greater the semblance though the more likely the play to seize the auditors then ill dot hungerford said and one thing more master jack shakespeare said earnestly come what may suffer not lieutenant de vega to learn aught of whats afoot else alls ruined you need not tell me that the tireman replied dyou take more for a witling a soft and dulleyed fool the poet shook his head by no means sir but the enterprise hath such weight and urgency id liefer warn without need than need without giving warning swounds i meant no offense and cry your pardon for any i gave hungerford smiled rest easy i am not one to hold anger to his inward self cherishing the warmth like a man in january newcome to hearth and home and you speak sooth tis no game we play unless youd style thus dicing oer the fate of kingdoms shakespeare sighed with relief he still had no guarantee boudicca would come off well or that it would do as sir william cecil hoped and help rouse england against the spanish occupiers he had no guarantee the play would even appear on stage that gave rise to a new worry if boudicca didnt appear if king philip did how could he reclaim the written parts any of those should a spaniard see it would be plenty to get him dragged to tower hill hanged cut down drawn quartered and burnt his danger didnt end if boudicca failed to play if anything it got worse but if his tragedy of the british queen did reach the stage jack hungerford would do everything in his power to make it look the way it should and the tireman took it seriously he understood the stakes for which they were playing haply i make a better poet than did kit marlowe shakespeare thought but in all else he were better suited than i being an intriguer and intelligencer born o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me he didnt realize hed said that aloud till hungerford completed the quotation for him nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt was this gods will shakespeare checked himself that was the wrong question everything surely was gods will but was it gods will that the uprising should go forward and succeed how can i know shakespeare sighed again on a very different note almost groaning he said o god that one might read the book of fate and see the revolution of the times what fates impose that men must needs abide hungerford said shakespeares nod was half glum half exalted we have thrown our gloves to death himself that theres no maculation in our hearts if it be otherwise if the canker of treason dwell in someones bosom we are all undone hanging and wiving go by destiny the tireman said a homely saw that would have made shakespeare happier had his own marriage been better he left the tiring room and went out on stage where rehearsal for boudicca went on burbage as boudiccas brotherinlaw caratach traded barbs with will kemp who played marcus a roman soldier now captured by the iceni and with peter baker the boy playing caratachs nephew hengo fill em more wine give em full bowls which of you all now in recompense of this good dare but give me a sound knock in the battle burbage boomed the words caratach was a fierce blustering soldier delicate captain to do thee a sufficient recompense ill knock thy brains out kemp replied marcus talk was far bolder than his performance he mimed gobbling down food in front of him by the gods uncle if his valour lie ins teeth hes the most valiant the boy playing hengo jeered he shook his fist at will kemp thou darst as well be damnd thou knock his brains out thou skin of man uncle i will not hear this tie up your whelp kemp told burbage exactly as if he were a proud roman in barbarous hands peter baker capered about in a wellacted transport of fury thou kill my uncle would i had but a sword for thy sake thou dried dog what a mettle this little vermin carries will kemp muttered kill mine uncle the boy screeched he shall not child said burbage as caratach he cannot hes a rogue an only eating rogue kill my sweet uncle oh that i were a man peter baker cried will kemp smirked by this wine which i will drink to captain junius who loves the queens most excellent majestys little daughter most sweetly and most fearfully i will do it uncle ill kill him with a great pin the youngster playing hengo squeaked no more boy richard burbage began before he could go on and drink to kemps marcus in turn the tiremans helper started whistling the bawdy tune of which he was so fond instantly peter baker ran off the stage burbage went from fierce caratach to majestic philip by leaning forward a little letting his belly droop down and dropping his voice half an octave will kemp was as quick to turn chameleonlike into a cardinal hounding the mahometans of southern spain the drunken lecherous roman he had been was forgotten in the wink of an eye by the time lope de vega walked into the theatre what had been a rehearsal for boudicca had metamorphosed into a rehearsal for king philip good morrow gentles the spaniard called as he walked towards the stage he waved to shakespeare give you good morrow master will you go on without me is it not so a good day to you lieutenant shakespeare answered all of us must take our parts that is so lope nodded tell me something ant please you if i do know it you shall know it shakespeare said it sounded like a promise but it was one he had no intention of keeping if de vega wanted to know anything he shouldnt all lope said though was whensoever i come hither of late some fellow in yon topmost gallery whistles the selfsame song what ist the music thereof quite likes me be there accompanying words shakespeare coughed richard burbage kicked at the boards of the stage will kemp guffawed still shakespeare could answer safely so he did an i mind me aright the dittys named aa mans yard not a tailors yard nor a clothiers yard burbage added perhaps helpfully any mans yard ah lope looked unenlightened can you sing somewhat oft for me that made shakespeare cough again cough and hesitate very little made will kemp hesitate he sang out in a ringing baritone arede me a riddlewhat is this you hold in your hand when you piss it is a kind of pleasing sting a pricking and a pleasant thing it is a stiff short fleshly pole that fits to stop a maidens hole it is venus wanton staying wand that neer had feet and yet can stand he would have gone on but lope grinning held up a hand basta he said enough that sufficeth me and now por dios i take your jape of a few days past we have such songs also in spanish he too began to sing shakespeare followed a little of it he knew italian and french which were cousins to spanish and had picked up some of the conquerors tongue itself during their ten years in england from what he got of it it was indeed of the same sort as a mans yard he held up his hand in turn this sport were better suited to the alehouse than the theatre what would you here lieutenant de vega what would i lope said why only to see how you fare my friend and how your company fares he sat at the edge of the stage his feet dangling down towards the dirt floor where the groundlings would stand come the afternoon shakespeare fought back a sigh he wished the spaniard had come for some specific reason in that case he would settle whatever needed settling and then leave this way he might stay all day which meant no one could work on boudicca all day every day that comes comes to decay a days work in him will kemp said tis sweating labor to bear such idleness so near the heart twitting a spaniard could be dangerous the dons were touchy of what they called their honor what an englishman would pass off with a smile might send a spaniard into a killing rage or equally it might not lope inclined his head to the clown my body shall be idle whilst my wits race better thus than contrariwise meseems call you me contrariwise kemp bowed in return at your service sir in sooth you have ever been contrary to the wise burbage murmured the clown bowed to him too et tu brute he said pronouncing the name of the noblest roman as if it were the ordinary word brute burbage winced so did shakespeare but he couldnt resist piling quibble on quibble let it not be bruited about that we are aught but contrariwise to idleness de vegas gaze went from one of them to the next in turn you give a better show now than when the groundlings spend their pennies i say two things to that will kemp declared imprimis say i piss on all those who spend their pennies here shakespeare and burbage both groaned lope de vega only looked puzzled again as he had at the title of a mans yard before anyone could explain the english phrase to him kemp went on and secundus say i tis no wonder were better now come the play he writes all the lines he pointed at shakespeare by thrusting his thumb out between his first two fingers and added i care not a fig for him thou knewst not what a fig meant till thy mother taught it thee shakespeare retorted giving back the gesture and would thou wert a figment now kemp flinched burbage clapped his hands de vega sat at the edge of the stage smiling and waiting for the next exchange by the virgin and all the saints my dear i wish you had been there and understood the english lope told catalina ibanez they might have been fighting with rapiers save only that their words pierced again and again without slaying however much they might make a man wish he were dead catalina shrugged her lowcut tightfitting bodice made a shrug worth watching from everything ive seen actors are always bitchy she said no he shook his head you make it less than it is could i have written this down as it was spoken and then rendered it into spanish it would probably sound petty and foolish she broke in such things always do when theyre not fresh she looked at him from under lowered lashes besides senior lieutenant did you bring me here to babble about mad englishmen certainly not my beautiful one lope answered oh no certainly not they sat side by side on a taffeta coverlet in the leafy shade of a small grove of willows in the yard by whitehall the yard given over to the kings of scotland whenever they chose to visit no visit from king james seemed imminent however much the spaniards would have liked to see him fall into their hands but the english kept up the yard and the buildings inside even so lope lifted a bottle more wine why not catalina answered as he poured a bird began to sing she frowned whats that i dont recognize the song a seed warbler i think he answered the name necessarily came out in english the bird does not dwell in spain i never heard it before i came here either catalina ibaaez listened for a little while then tossed back the wine and shivered that for once had nothing to do with nasty english weather summer was here at last it wasnt a patch on summer in madrid but it was tolerable perhaps a bit better than tolerable catalina said even the birds here are foreigners no wonder i always feel so alone alone lope set his hand on hers oh no sweetheart how can you say such a thing when you have don alejandro she looked over to him in surprise she must have expected him to ask how can you say such a thing when you have me her nod showed a certain admiration as if hed made an unusual thoughtprovoking move in a game of chess since hed mentioned her keeper she had to answer and she did with a toss of the head that sent her curls flying in pretty disarray don alejandro doesnt understand me she saidan old gambit but always a good one hes rich hes important but he has no idea what a woman wants lope was neither rich nor important and doubted he ever would be as for the other slowly he raised catalinas hand to his lips what could a woman want he murmured but to be adored that was an old line too it didnt work precisely as hed hoped don alejandro is the stingiest man in the world catalina went on and he doesnt give me presents or take me dancing or evenshe seemed to be reminding herselfout on nice little picnics like this well lope said that is a pity all at once he began to wonder whether taking her on this nice little picnic had been such a good idea she was beautiful yes undoubtedly but was she any less mercenary than a scarred german soldier who sold his sword to the highest bidder and walked away if his pay fell in arrears catalina seemed to realize she might have shown a card or two too many she swayed towards him with melting eyes and said im so glad to go out anywhere at all so very glad she leaned closer yet to kiss her was the work of a moment altogether without thought lope did had he thought he might have wondered who was doing what with whom and for which reasons but hed never been in the habit of thinking around women hed hardly even imagined the possibility till his chance meeting with the odd englishwoman with the cat and so he kissed catalina ibaaez and things went on from there she sighed deep in her throat and twisted to press herself against him ah querido she murmured when their lips parted at last you dont know how long ive wanted to do that and i lope said oh yes by god and i he kissed her again her mouth tasted of wine but sweeter still except for the twittering birds they were all alone the willow branches hung down almost to the ground shielding them from prying eyes the grass under the taffeta coverlet was long and soft and resilient catalina slapped lopes hands away a couple of times as he began to explore her but it was only for show and they both knew it she giggled when he nibbled the side of her smooth white neck the giggle turned to a soft almost breathless sigh as he slid down so his tongue could tease a nipple she sighed again not very much later when he poised himself above her and thrust home as if with the rapier her thighs clasped his flanks her arms squeezed him as if she never wanted to let him go english summer he discovered was more than warm enough to work up a pleasant sweat provided one found the right company oh lope catalina gasped just before his moment of joy then she let out a little mewling cry that oddly made him think of mommet cicely sellis cat even though hed never heard mommet make a sound her nails sharp as little daggers scored his back he drove deep and spent himself her mouth twisted in regret when he pulled out of her but she quickly started putting herself to rights de vega got dressed too he reached out to pat her bare backside as she pulled up her drawers even more than i imagined he told her imagined she raised a hand to her face as if to hide a blush as if to say she couldnt imagine a man hungrily imagining making love to her it was all i could do he said it was but no more had he been a few years younger he would have laid her down on the taffeta coverlet and taken her again then and there he sighed for lost youth there would be other chances though and soon and he would be seeing lucy watkins again before long it wasnt as if hed fallen out of love with her when he fell in love with catalina ibaaez and what might that englishwoman with the cat be like between the sheets lope hadnt thought about finding a lover older than himself since he was eighteen for that one he thought he would make an exception we had better get you back he said to catalina shaking his mind free of the women he wasnt with he gave the woman he was with a quick kiss i dont believe i ever enjoyed a picnic more ishould hope not she drew herself up with touchy pride oh yesthis one is all ice and fire lope thought never a dull moment with her around he put the cork back in the wine bottle hed brought along a loaf of bread and a pot of honey too honey and bread remained untouched he smiled as he bundled them into the coverlet i tasted better sweets than honey today hand in hand he and catalina walked through the anklehigh grass of the yard no king of scotland was likely to visit any time soon towards the gate by which theyd come in theyd gone about halfway from the willow grove when the gate opened a tall broadshouldered man walked into the yard and strode purposefully towards them ay madre de dios catalina ibanez yelped she dropped lopes hand as if it were on fire under her paint her face went white as milk its don alejandro lope let the coverlet fall to the grass the wine bottle clanked against the honey pot he hoped they didnt break but that was the least of his worries right now his right hand fell to the hilt of his rapier hed worn it as much for swank as on the off chance of trouble without it hed be a dead man now i may be a dead man anyhow don alejandro went from purposeful walk to thudding trot his rapier leaped free of its sheath the long slim deadly blade glittered in the sun de vega the nobleman bellowed ten thousand demons from hell de vega what are you doing with my woman had de recalde come in a few minutes earlier he would have seen for himself what lope was doing by catalinas delighted response the nobleman would have learned something too this seemed neither time nor place for that discussion lope drew his own sword but he gave as mild an answer as he could talking about the theatre liar dog son of a dog don alejandro shouted and roared down on him like an avalanche steel clattered from steel sparks flew catalina screamed shut up you little puta don alejandro shouted youre next his first long abrupt thrust almost pierced lopes heart de vega barely managed to beat the blow aside he couldnt counter fast as a striking serpent don alejandro thrust for his belly only a hasty backwards leap saved him from owning a second navel and any puncture a couple of inches deep probably meant death either from bleeding or more slowly and painfully from fever don alejandro de recalde was a picture fencer with a style as pure as any lope had ever seen he kept his blade in front of his body and poised to strike at every moment and he was quick and strong he might have stepped out of a swordmasters school and straight into the king of scotlands yard for their first few exchanges lope wondered how he could possibly come through the fight alive and then as he managed a thrust at don alejandros belly and the nobleman beat his blade aside with a perfect parry he suddenly smiled a most unpleasant smile his next thrust wasnt at don alejandros midriffit was at his face catalinas keeper turned that one too but not so elegantly and he jerked his head back in a way no fencing master would have approved lopes smile grew wider and nastier dont do a lot of real righting you say he panted i say nothing to you de vega de recalde snarled and bored in again nothing clang clang clang went their swords as if they were battling it out up on stage but swordplay in real fighting was different from what went on with the groundlings cheering down below it was different from what the fencing masters taught too lope thrust at don alejandros face again this time his foe didnt jerk away fast enough the point pierced his cheek the nobleman howled in pain blood ran down the side of his jaw catalina ibanez shrieked they dont show you that in school do they lope jeered he knew perfectly well they didnt nobody included blows to the face in fencing exercises they were too dangerous swordmasters who slaughtered their students or scarred them for life werent likely to get much new business don alejandro tried to answer him but blood poured from his lips instead of words de recalde was game he kept on doing his best to skewer lope his best was alarmingly goodbut not quite good enough lope thrust at his head again this time pinking his left ear more blood flew don alejandro shook his head and kept fighting both he and lope ignored catalinas screams once more lope thought he gave this thrust all the arm extension he had his point pierced his opponents right eye pierced the flimsy bone behind and penetrated deep into de recaldes brain with a grunt that seemed more surprise than pain don alejandro toppled to the grass like a kickedover sack of clothes his rapier fell from fingers that could hold it no more his feet drummed briefly then were still a sudden stench said his bowels had let go catalina screamed one last time she gulped to a stop tears streaming down her face stupid bastard lope said wearily tugging his sword free and plunging it into the ground to cleanse it you never really tried to kill anyone before did you well by god you wont try again thats certain sure he wished hed never killed anyone himself but hed fought his way to london after the armadas army came ashore if he hadnt killed a few englishmen they would most assuredly have killed him he wished their souls a kind judgment from godas he did now for don alejandro de recaldesbut they were dead and he was alive and that was how he wanted it to be he turned to catalina ibanez come on he told her we have to let the authorities know what happened here you are my witness i slew in selfdefense she nodded you are my hero my champion she said you killed for my sake for for me tears still wet on her cheeks she gave him a glance full of animal heat lope had never had a woman look at him that way for that reason he hoped to heaven he never would again the night before shakespeare had fallen asleep to jack streets snores now he woke to them as he yawned and got out of bed he wondered if he would ever be able to go to sleep without the glaziers racket after a couple of years of it hed got so very used to it he had his doubts sam king lay asleep in the third bed in their common bedchamber streets snoring had stopped bothering him too shakespeare got out of his nightshirt and into doublet and hose the earlymorning sun leaking through closed shutters gave him plenty of light by which to dress in summer day swallowed half the night not the other way round he reveled in the daylight and reveled in it more because he knew it would dwindle again as the seasons spun through their neverending cycle a kettle of porridge bubbled over a low fire on the hearth shakespeare dipped out a bowlful to break his fast he poured a mug of ale from a pitcher on the counter then sat down to eat cicely sellis came out of her room a couple of minutes later with mommet walking around and between her feet give you good day master shakespeare she said and got herself breakfast too as she sat down on a stool across the table from the poet the cat puddled himself on top of her shoes give you good morrow as well shakespeare answered i hope the world wags well for you passing well she said how fares your friend the spaniard de vega these past few days ive seen him not shakespeare said then he started violently he had all he could do not to sign himself with the cross how knew you we have an acquaintance what witchs trick told you so was what he meant as with crossing himself though he lacked the nerve for that but cicely sellis laughed a merry laugh no bell book and candle by god i give you my oath she showed no fear about using the holy sign herself she never had laughing still she went on for one thing you have in my hearing spake his name though peradventure you recall it not for another not long since i met the man himself in bishopsgate streeti daresay mommet on my shoulder drew his eye a man of much charm and wit and much an admirer of yours shakespeare only half heard her even less after she showed she hadnt used the black arts to learn of lope de vega normally he would have savored praise and savored cicely sellis company too now he scraped his bowl clean gulped his ale mumbled i must away and all but fled the lodging house shed convinced him she hadnt used witchcraft this time she hadnt come close to convincing him she was no witch someone two houses down flung the contents of a very full chamber pot from an upstairs window out into the street even though it didnt come close to splashing shakespeare the stench made him wrinkle his nose that stench also took the edge off his pleasure in the fine day he hurried up towards bishopsgate hoping hed get no more unpleasant surprises people streamed into london from the tenements outside the walls to look for work to buy and sell or to drink fewer folk went in the other direction whither away so early now an irish gallowglass asked as shakespeare headed out he made as if to step forward and bar the poets path im for the theatre shakespeare answered faith are you indeed the irishman said riddle me why then im after knowing these plays run of afternoons in sooth they do shakespeare agreed but we needs must practice or ever we play else were the show not worth the seeing the irishman scratched at his red whiskers he scratched hard caught something and squashed it between his two thumbnails seeing that made shakespeare want to scratch too maybe getting rid of the vermin cheered the gallowglass for he waved shakespeare forward pass on gramercy god give you good day not least from fear shakespeare was always polite around the savages from the western island out beyond the wall the tenements were as crowded and squalid as anything within maybe worse shakespeare strutted up shoreditch high street towards the theatre as fiercely as he could footpads had never set on him and he hoped a show of belligerency from a goodsized man would keep making them choose other targets only the night watchman was at the theatre when shakespeare got there he sat on a stool his back against the wall by the outer entrance his hat down over his eyes to shield him from the sunlight soft snores rose from him shakespeare hoped hed been more alert during the night he paused in front of the entrance and coughed the watchmans snores changed rhythm shakespeare coughed again louder this time the other man yawned and stretched and raised his hat enough to see out from under the brim oh tis you master will he said around a yawn that showed bad teeth good day sir go on in ant please you youre first here today how know you that like pilate asking what is truth shakespeare didnt want an answer he nodded and went into the theatre the watchman pulled his hat down again he was ready for more sleep he turned out to be right no one from the company had gone past him while he dozed shakespeare had the theatre all to himself he looked up to the wide ring of heaven a kestrel flashed by overhead the little hawk never had any doubts of what prey nature intended it to take nor of how to go about the tasks nature had appointed it for his part shakespeare had never imagined he might envy a birds pure simplicities hed never imagined it but it was so while he stood with his feet on the hardpacked earth it smelled faintly of spilt beer despite the sweepers nutshells bits of bread a broken clay pipe and other refuse still lay all around he stretched out his arms full length and wistfully flapped them he envied the kestrel its ability to fly out of trouble too from behind him someone said lo here the gentle lark weary of rest from his moist cabinet mounts on high and wakes the morning shakespeare spun round there stood richard burbage a grin on his handsome fleshy face i am no songbird shakespeare said but the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended no songbird haply not not in your own person burbage said but verily you give others music killing care and grief of heart orpheus with his lute made trees bow themselves when he did sing so you as well een if it be through the throats of others you are gracious shakespeare said and i thank you fort how dyou come here the hour being so young burbage asked i had looked to be alone yet some little while as usually chances how dick ill tell you how shakespeare spoke of how cicely sellis had asked him about lieutenant de vega she ghasted me out of doors betimes nor am i shamed to own it and yet twas no witchery that you should speak or even that they should meet passing strange that burbage snapped his fingers i mind me we need not fear dear master lope for some little while at the least wherefore say you so shakespeare asked if dame rumor run abroad she hath not caught me up i supped yesternight at an ordinary close by the dons barracks there was talk in spanish amongst em and in english back and forth twixt the tapman and the drawer the which i might follow de vega hath slain a man a noble spaniard swounds shakespeare said shall he be hanged fort burbage shook his head methinks not twas in some affray over a woman with master de vega you astound me shakespeare said burbage laughed he too knewhe could hardly help knowinglope de vegas passion for passionate conquests shakespeare went on still and all that could be murther did he lie in wait for his rival or smite from behind why so it could burbage admitted i had not thought on it the spaniard seeming a tolerable man of his hands but haply you have the right oft i know not nor could i glean it from the talk i overheard but he shant come hither soon an i mistake me not may it be so shakespeare said a few days time to rehearse our boudicca in peace were a blessing ay naught compares to moving about the stage for the refining of bits of business and breaking off in the midst of a scene jars hardly less than breaking off in the midst with a wench burbage said a fit figure in view of whats passed shakespeare inclined his head im certain sure she had a fit figure burbage said the spaniard hath an eye for em hold the tiremans helper on high shakespeare warned if master lope return of a sudden we dare not be caught out that i know will burbage said heavily by my troth that i know lope de vega stood at stiff attention before captain baltasar guzman before god sir it was selfdefense nothing else he declared a pen scratched across paper off to one side guzmans servant enrique writing down every word he said don alejandro came at me sword in hand if i hadnt defended myself some other officer would be taking his statement now some other officer might be taking his statement now lope thought or then again maybe not had don alejandro de recalde slain him how much of an inquiry would there have been he was only a lieutenant after all from a family not particularly eminent as likely as not they would have buried him patted don alejandro on the back for his fine swordsmanship and gone on about their business baltasar guzman now said nothing at all he sat behind his desk staring up at de vega you will have questioned my companion lope said stiffly senorita ibanezs account should match mine and so it does guzman admitted or you would be in a great deal more trouble than you are your excellency if senorita ibanezs account does match mine i should be in no trouble at all unfortunately senior lieutenant it is not quite so simple what were you doing with the woman when don alejandro discovered the two of you alone together wed had a picnic sir lope said stolidly we were leaving the yard for the kings of scotland when don alejandro burst in scratch scratch scratch went the quill in enriques clever right hand a picnic one of captain guzmans eyebrows leaped yes your excellency a picnic the soldiers who came after the fight took the coverlet we sat on and the wine bottle we drank from and the mugs and the bread and honey we had there oneor twocan do other things on a coverlet besides sitting no doubt sir we were having a picnic lope said scratch scratch scratch will you see senorita ibanez again guzman asked how can i know your excellency de vega answered she is an attractive woman and her protectorher former protectoris now unfortunately deceased yes most unfortunately i saw the corpse captain guzman said when you fight a man you dont do things by halves do you senior lieutenant sir he came at me bellowing like a bull if i hadnt fought to kill he would have killed me lope replied that was not only true it was what he had to say to keep himself safe guzmans respect though however reluctantly granted warmed him for his superior was a formidable man with a rapier in his hand de vega added he was good with a bladevery quick very strong very cleanbut purely a school fighter ah captain guzman nodded so thats how it was eh no you dont learn those strokes in school you learn them when you put your life on the lineor else you dont as don alejandro didnt what will become of me senor lope asked well i believe your storyor most of it anyhow guzman answered as far as im concerned you remain on duty but you must understand when you kill a nobleman the matter doesnt end with your immediate superior yes sir lope said resignedly it could be worse you know baltasar guzman told him you could have killed de recalde back in spain then you wouldnt have to worry about your superiors alone youd have everyone in his clan hot for your blood and all his friends too he doesnt have many kinsmen here in england and he wasnt here long enough to make a lot of friends no doubt youre right sir the same thing had occurred to lope is there anything more sir not from me as i told you but i also tell you something else if you fall head over heels in love with catalina ibaaez in the next few weeks tongues will wag i dont suppose anyone will be able to prove a thing but tongues will wag nothing i can do about that your excellency lope replied you could try keeping away from her captain guzman said lope stood mute guzman sighed no point to puncturing a man if you cant enjoy yourself afterwards is that what youre thinking your excellency do you question my honor lope asked very softly had guzman said yes things would have taken a different turn but the captain impatiently shook his head no no no by no means the ibaaez is only a mistress not a wife how can anyone lose honor over a mistress but even the touchiest man will see there is a difference between honor and gossip and scandal very well senor i thank you for the advice guzman sighed by which you mean you have no intention of taking it well youve already proved youre not shy about carving a man so the undertakers cant pretty him up that will make some people think twice go on get back to work but bear in mind you may be summoned by others besides me sure enough lope was in his room working on a report of doings at the theatre when enrique knocked on his door captain guzmans servant said begging your pardon senior lieutenant but my principal has just received an order from don diego flores de valdas at westminster you are to report to him at once for questioning in the matter of don alejandro thank you enrique lope sighed and rose from the stool where hed perched ill go of course what else could he do when summoned by the commandant of spanish forces in england as he was heading out of the barracks his own servant came up the corridor towards him senor there is an english constable outside a man named strawberry he said it with care he would speak to you so says a soldier who knows a little english a constable de vega shook his head i am called before don diego flores de valdas i have no time for this noaccount englishman now i would have no time for the queen and king of england now go back and tell the fellow whoever he is that i am very sorry but i will have to see him some other day i speak no english diego wailed well get that soldier again then lope said impatiently hurrying off towards the stables you found out what the constable wanted he can find out what you want when he rode off towards westminster he got a glimpse of his servant and a large middleaged englishman standing nose to nose in the street each shouting at the other neither understanding a word the other said maybe the englishspeaking soldier had gone away lope smiled diego needed such exercise to keep his blood flowing as for the other man that strawberry well who cared about an english constable anyhow once lope got to westminster he had to find don diego flores de valdas office which hed visited only once he knew he was getting close when someone called out to him a thin weedy pockmarked englishman who wore spectacles oh seaor phelippes lope said glad to see a face he knew the commandants chamber is along this corridor is it not yes thats right phelippes answered where lope had spoken english he used his fluent spanish finishing congratulations on the skill of your right hand his own right hand still clutching a quill made cutandthrust motions for which i thank you de vega did his best to keep laughter off his face he had a hard time imagining a man less dangerous than thomas phelippes hurrying up the corridor he found don diego also scribbling away at something he waited till the spanish commandant look up from his work then saluted i report as ordered your excellency so you do come in senior lieutenant come in don diego drummed his fingers on the desk he pointed to a stool in front of it sit if you care to so youve had more woman trouble have you well lope saw no way out of that one yes your excellency he said reluctantly youll get talked about killing a social superior don diego remarked no doubt but i preferred that to letting him kill me yes i can see how you might don alejandro was not the brightest man i ever saw but he was brave and well miss him we havent enough spaniards here as is we cant afford to kill each other yes your excellency lope said better you tell me that though than that you tell him he wouldnt agree with youbut then hes not here to ask is he don diego drummed his fingers again by your account by his mistress account it was a fair fight those fingers went up and down up and down the ibanez woman im sure is great fun in bed but damn me senior lieutenant if shes worth a man in his grave shell be as faithless to you as she was to don alejandro and sooner for he had more money to spend on her than you do no matter how infatuated with her lope was that held the unpleasant ring of truth ill take my chances your excellency he replied for want of anything better so you will the spanish commandant agreed so you do he scowled go on get out of here you have to keep an eye on the englishmen at the theatre the good lord only knows what theyre planning but its something i need a hound to smell out treachery for that youll do and a man who knows how to handle a blade is always an asset too through the eye madre de dios your excellency with a life on the line one does what one must do lope said yes and that is why i am sending you back to your duty at the theatre don diego said his long face was made to show sorrow and it did now we will need you we will need the play before long word just here from spain is that it is doubtful his most catholic majesty shall leave his bed again his doctors dare not move him even to change the linen on his mattress the end approaches he crossed himself so did lope de vega i shall do all i can to ensure that he has his monument here lope said you may rely on me sir i do senior lieutenant don diego flores de valdas told him that is why you are returning for i still fear treason from the theatre i want you there to stop it ive seen no sign of it lope said but if it rears its ugly head ill tear it out root and branch in the upper gallery of the theatre the tiremans helper who did duty as a lookout started whistling a mans yard at once the players who had been romans and britons hacking away at one another shifted positions and became spaniards and englishmen hacking away at one another by god richard burbage snarled at shakespeare is he here again he glared at the poet as if it were his fault shakespeare spread his hands i did not bid him come unbidden guests are often welcomest when they are gone burbage said but of late he is never gone how can we rehearse boudicca under the eyes of a don he bleeds us of time like a leech of blood save that a leech may heal whilst he doth only harm i cannot mend itand say not the name never no moe shakespeare added he hath the latin to know whence it comes and what it portends in strode lope he wasnt very tall but swaggered like a giant shakespeare smiled and waved to him welcome he lied give you good day and a good morrow to you de vega answered advancing towards the stage he surveyed the struggling players with a critical eye many of these would die quickly did they take the field in earnest they are not soldiers they but personate them shakespeare said but their personation wants persuasion lope said shakespeare glanced towards burbage ever so slightly the player nodded hed been a soldier and knew whereof lope spoke a soldiers eye may discern the flaws but will the generality shakespeare asked those of them have fought in war will know they see no war upon the stage lope told him we shall do what we can shakespeare did his best to hide a sigh he didnt think de vega noticed burbage did and smiled shakespeare asked the question uppermost in his uppermost in everyones mind how fares his most catholic majesty he fares not well at all de vegas handsome face looked old and worn as if he were speaking of his own dying father as i have said before he is bedridden the least movement pains him to the marrow his sores advance apace when the surgeons cut them to loose the pus it hath a vile stench he is dropsicalmore so by the day they say and yet his heart is strong he fails but fails by degrees all over the stage players nodded most men had watched deaths like that as well as the quicker easier more merciful kind signing himself with the cross shakespeare said god grant him ease from suffering may it be so lope also crossed himself it likes me to watch the work here advance i had liefer see king philip go unproduced shakespeare said de vega made a leg at him you are gracious master shakespeare to say so i am an ordinary ramping fool with no more brain than a stone shakespeare thought lope de vega had taken him to mean he wanted philip ii to live forever that was how hed meant to be taken but the spaniard could have taken his words another way as meaning he wanted to see some other play go on in place of king philip and he did but to let lieutenant de vega know that would have meant nothing but catastrophe burbage had noticed the same thing with a growl that might have come from the throat of a bear chained to the pole in the baiting pit he said you will make show of your wit eh wherefore should he not lope asked would you ask a poet to hide his wit would you ask a woman to hide her beauty a poets wit may lead him into danger shakespeare said and a womans beauty may likewise lead herand him that sees herinto danger or would you say otherwise burbage suddenly brightened shakespeare couldnt resist preening a little proud of his own cleverness if anything could make lope turn away from untoward meanings thinking of himself and his brush with death ought to do it the spaniards hand fell to the hilt of his rapier a few inches of the blade slid from the sheath as he struck a pose danger knows full well that lope is more dangerous than he his strutting would have seemed laughable had he not just killed a man as things were hed earned the right to swagger beauty itself doth of itself persuade the eyes of men without an orator shakespeare said will you bring to the theatre the beauty hath ensnared you that we all may marvel and envy you for your conquest alas no i fear me for she speaks not your tongue lope replied will kemp chose that moment to come out of the tiring room the clown gave lope a courtiers bow exaggerated to absurdity whether she speak or no doth her tongue not please you he inquired maybe the spaniard wouldnt understand just what kemp meant so shakespeare hoped lopes english while good wasnt perfect but it was good enough and he did how dare you have her tongue in your mouth he snarled and made as if to draw the rapier again never did i that nor she neither kemp said but he seemed less afraid than shakespeare would have been having insulted a man whod proved himself sword in hand put up he told de vega know you not an you blood your blade in a fool twill surely rust the absurdity of that stopped the spaniard where nothing else might have but what then becomes of the fool he asked kemp let out a horrible scream clutched his belly and thrashed and writhed on the stage in wellfeigned agony as abruptly as hed begun he left off thus belike he answered getting to his feet once more lope laughed and shook his head truly god must love fools he said how may i do less how should you find it hard where most men find it easy kemp returned but then did you not find it hard enough shakespeare and burbage spoke the same word at the same time kemp flew to disaster like a moth to flame after that afternoons performance shakespeare left the theatre as soon as he scrubbed off his makeup usually he would have stayed in the tiring room to share gossip and gibes or else repair to a tavern to hash over the play with players and friends not today not least because lope de vega came back there sometimes keeping company with the spanish officer was too much for him to bear but leaving brought him scant relief as he hurried out of the theatre constable walter strawberry marched in a grim expression on his face shakespeare wondered if strawberry were after him for more questions but the constable after giving him a somber nod kept on going so did shakespeare in the other direction he hadnt got far when a mediumsized homely man of about his own age sidled up alongside him and said a good day to you master shakespeare his voice suggested he knew all manner of interesting things some of them perhaps even licit master skeres shakespeare hoped he sounded less dismayed than he felt and to you a good day as well sir ive not had the pleasure of your company for some little while nor wanted it neither he thought what would you id tell you somewhat id liefer not have to speak but een so somewhat you should know nick skeres answered when he didnt go on shakespeare asked and that is lord burghleys on his deathbed skeres said bluntly hell not rise from it again save to go ins coffin for shakespeare the news was like a blow in the belly god give him peace he said he and philip die together as he said they would when first we met ay skeres chuckle showed uneven teeth his minds still hale and he jests oft yet what of the enterprise shakespeare would say no more than that not in the open in shoreditch high street later he remembered he should have spoken with nicholas skeres about raising the english mob against spains hated irish soldiers at the moment with skeres news the thought never entered his mind the other man replied without hesitation it goes forward as before under lord burghley his son and mark me twill go as well under robert cecil as ever it could under his sire crookback though he be his wit and will run straight may you prove a true prophet but shakespeare couldnt help worryingworrying even more than he had before sir william cecil had been a power in the land longer than hed been alive hed been in eclipse since the coming of the armada yes but robert his son seemed always to have dwelt and dealt in the shadows could he come out into the light now at greatest need he must essay it shakespeare thought and kicked at the dirt the timing couldnt have been worse xi when lope de vega visited the theatre with lucy watkins he didnt take her back to the tiring room after the performance will kemp or another wouldbe wit was too likely to ask him why he hadnt brought his spanish lady instead he didnt want lucy finding out about catalina ibanez bad things happened when one of his ladies learned of another so hed painfully discovered but here it seemed he was bound to have trouble he and lucy had just left the theatre on their way back into london when she said is it true you killed a man unease prickled through de vega he tried his best to misunderstand her saying my love i am a soldier this chances in the soldiers trade she shook her head no of late a spanish gentleman they say a nobleman but by my troth no gentleman he said then he stopped and sighed hed told her what she needed to know or most of it and shed already heard or heard of the rest too they say you fought him over a lady as hed called don alejandro de recalde no gentleman so he wanted to call catalina ibaaez no lady but that wouldnt help he sighed again yes that is so lucy nodded i was fain to hear it from your lips first i owed you so much before saying farewell say no such thing lope exclaimed i love thee and the other lady and her lope agreed you may not love more than one lucy said sadly wherefore may i not he asked i have had this stricture laid against me ere now but never have i grasped it that i credit but if you love twoshed stopped using thou a bad signthen two will love you each to herself wanting all you have to give as she hath given all she hath can you in equal measure return the love of two give me leave to doubt loving more than one you love not wisely but too well how can one love too well a fond notion a notion not possible love two women at but a single timesay you love two women at but a single timeand you love too well lucy insisted do but let me show thee thou art mistook that lope began how wouldst thou put us twain this spanish hussy and me in but a single bed now lucy used thou again but in insult not intimacy whether shed go or no i would not nor i will not where i shall go is far from thee now and forever her voice held tears so we loved as love in twain had the essence but in one we were two distincts division none number there in love was slain so between us love did shine that one lover saw her right flaming in her lovers sigh either was the others mine but for us lovers now sigh a prayer she walked away love to lope was like a child that longed for everything it could come by telling that to lucy seemed unlikely to change her mind we that are true lovers run into strange capers he called after her alas that love gentle in his view should be tyrannous and rough in proof in proof thou canst give no proof of love not loving another besides myself lucy kept walking a few paces farther on she stooped picked up a stone and flung it at lope with unladylike dexterity if he hadnt ducked it would have hit him in the face she bent down for another stone fie give over lope exclaimed ill trouble theeyouno more lucy let the stone fall would thoudst never asked my name would thoudst never spoke me fair would thoudst never found thy spanish popsy fair for thou canst not have her and me together mary pity women she rounded a corner and was gone fret not friend said an englishman whod listened with amusement to the quarrel women are like fish anotherll come along soon enough to nibble the end o your pole he laughed so did lope when he got the joke a moment later he didnt go after lucy that plainly was a lost cause instead he trudged back towards bishopsgate he still had catalina ibaaezs fiery affections but he found he didnt want them right now he wanted lucy whom hed just lost had he lost catalina and kept lucy he had no doubt he would have pined for the spanish womans caresses instead i know what i am by god he thought what to do about it thats a different question the irish soldiers at the gate recognized lope for a spaniard they swept off their hats and bowed to him as he went by he nodded in return once inside bishopsgate he slowed down and looked around if he was lucky and he was cicely sellis came out of a ribbonmakers shop a couple of yards of green ribbon wrapped around the left sleeve of the mannish doublet she wore her cat following at her heel like a dog lope made a leg mistress sellis so good to see you give you good day she curtsied as if he were a duke not a junior officer and good day to you master lope how wags your world i have known it better he replied why surely those set over you have agreed you fought don alejandro only for to save your own life she said how could it be otherwise with mistress ibaaez telling a tale like unto yours the difficulty lies elsewhere de vega said before blinking and wondering how she knew of that he started to ask but found he lacked the nerve he started to cross himself but found he also lacked the nerve for that bruja he thought and shivered in the warmfor england at any ratejuly sun where cicely sellis asked she didnt let him answer but showed more of what might have been witchery by softly singing on a day alack the day love whose month is ever may spied a blossom passing fair playing in the wanton air through the velvet leaves the wind all unseen can passage find that the lover sick to death wished himself the heavens breath air quoth he thy cheeks may blow air would i might triumph so but alack my hand is sworn neer to pluck from thee thy thorn vow alack for youth unmeet youth so apt to pick a sweet do not call it sin in me that i am forsworn for thee thou for whom een jove would swear juno but an ethiop were and deny himself for jove turning mortal for thy love this time lope did cross himself and violently how knew you of my affections he demanded his voice harsh tell it me this instant else others holier than i shall ask it of you her cat bristled at him but she remained smiling unconcerned this needs not the cunning womans arts master lope you came towards me all cast down when late you fought don alejandro you kept company with his mistress but is it not so you had also another sweetheart an i mistake me not she hath given you her farewell bruja lope thought again but maybe not what she said made good logical senseas much as anything to do with women ever made good logical sense slowly grudgingly he said you are a cunning woman indeed cicely sellis curtsied again for the which i thank you and you have my sympathythe which like all such is worth its weight in goldfor her who was too blind to see your true worth he stared at her openmouthed it wasnt for her looks though she was fair enough and would have been lovely at eighteen but he had never known a woman who used words as a bravo used a rapierand was as deadly with them as any bravo ever born before god he breathed hardly knowing he spoke aloud i must know thee better and will you turn your back on mistress ibaaez cleaving only to me she asked with any other woman he would have babbled promises knowing they were lies with cicely sellis that seemed less than wise what would she do if she caught him out what could she do do you really want to find out lope asked himself and knew he didnt he sighed and shook his head nay i doubt i shall he answered his smile was crooked i thank god i am as honest as any man living that is a young man and no honester than i the cunning woman smiled too every man hath his fault and honesty is yours she suggested yes she had a dangerous tongue and if it was dangerous in one sense what might it do in another lope made himself stop his lewd imaginings while he tried to figure out how to reply to that at last he said doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love what me now cicely sellis paused after a moment she wagged a finger at him nay you said that not you are clever sirhaply too clever by half i could love thee i would love thee de vega said but not me alone she said it wasnt a question she waited to see if lope would deny it when he didnt she smiled once more and shook her head id not give all of my love for the part of anotherswould not nor will not gladly would i be your friend and as gladly be no more shall i beg thee lope made as if to go to one knee in the muddy street laughing cicely sellis gestured that he should stay on his feet shall i serenade thee he strummed an imaginary lute and began to sing in spanish give over she said with another laugh shall the tiger change his stripes i think not were i myself a different jade id say come woo me woo me for i am in a holiday humor and like enough to consent but being all of mine own ill not be but part of someone elses liking she sounded annoyingly like lucy watkins i am your friend then lope said knowing hed get no more this day those you make friends and give your heart to keep their friendship under their own lifes key betimes the cunning woman said betimes but not so oft as wed fain havet she offered up what at first sounded like a prayer grant i may never prove so fond to trust man on his oath or bond or a keeper with my freedom or my friends if i should need em amen aii he said wincing few men saw the world so sardonically and even fewer women i must away cicely sellis scooped up her catmommet that was the beasts nameand set it on her shoulder where it had perched when lope first met her as she started up bishopsgatetowards the gate itself the direction opposite to hisshe added god give you good friends and you lady he called after her and you he wanted to turn around and follow her only the certainty that that right now would cost him even her tenuous friendship kept him walking on into london his feet dragging reluctantly through the dirt at every step william shakespeare watched from the side of the stage as lieutenant de vega as juan de idiaquez declaimed what amounted to his epitaph for philip ii fair spain neer had a king until his time virtue he had deserving to command his brandishd sword did blind men with his beams his arms spread wider than a dragons wings his sparkling eyes replete with wrathful fire more dazzled and drove back his enemies than midday sun bent against their faces what should i say his deeds exceed all speech he neer lift up his hand but conquered to shakespeares astonishment the spaniard after delivering his lines covered his face with his hands and wept here whats toward shakespeare called hurrying towards him lope de vega looked up at him tears streaming unashamed from his eyes the beauty of your words hath pierced me to the heart he answered their beauty ay and their truth for truly great philip dies and much dies with him spain shall be fatherless henceforth truly spain shall be fatherless henceforth shakespeare murmured turning the line to the iambic pentameter of blank verse he said it over again then nodded gramercy lieutenant i shall append that to the end of your speech he made a leg at lope and i congratulate you your first line in english actually de vega had made only four feet of the line but shakespeare wasnt inclined to quibble there several of the players clapped their hands lope grinned and bowed but matthew quinn who played a roman soldier named decius in boudicca told shakespeare think an hour more then if your confidence grow strong on you youll leave it in place sudden silence slammed down inside the theatre shakespeare hoped his own jaw didnt drop too far the first line and a half were taken straight from the hired mans part while the last five words were the sort of halfline of blank verse any player could make up in his sleep blank verse sounded like natural speech sounding like natural speech was its reason for being lope didnt wouldnt couldnt know the words came from boudicca but everyone else did and the spaniard did notice the dismay on the stage is somewhat amiss he asked no naught shakespeare hoped he sounded convincing merely a dumbshow ay an asshead a stuffed man a very dull foolin sooth a most imperceiverant thing i do not follow lope said quinn did entirely too well you breeder of dire events he shouted his fat face purpling you sneaking fellow you still and dumbdiscoursive devil that tempts most cunningly he didnt quite come out and scream that shakespeare was a traitor but he didnt miss by much either longtongued babbling gossip shakespeare retorted damnable box of envy enough richard burbage cried hold give over you rabble of vile confederates or answer to me he folded one hand into a massive fist shakespeare fell silent hed already said too much so had quinnmuch too much and so for that matter had burbage the hired man periwig slightly askew looked ready to say much more but burbage advanced on him that fist drawn back and ready to fly quinn thought better of it lope laughed you are a band of brothers and fight like it he said een so shakespeare laughed too he hoped convincingly and now meseems we should ready ourselves for the days play we shall resume king philip on the morrow or the day after be it so then lopes voice held regret would we might work more now but i understand you must set the play at hand before the play to come he touched the brim of his hat this days rehearsal done i must away having other duties give you good morrow gentles he hurried out of the theatre as soon as he was gone shakespeare and matt quinn started screaming at each other again hold burbage shouted again he pointed at the hired man you sirrah played the sparrow astrut afore the cat that he doth not pounce means not that he may not pounce his finger swung towards shakespeare and you sirrah strook too hard putting us in danger worse than any sprung of master quinns folly had the spaniard commenced to dig but he did not and alls well we go forward then with such caution as we may find your pardon i pray you shakespeare said he turned to matthew quinn more reluctantly he also said your pardon i pray to the hired player let it go quinn answered when we play is time enough for these lines you have writ me ay fire em too soon and they fail of their purpose shakespeare wondered why decius part excited the other man it was neither large nor important but then matt quinn had never enjoyed much luck in the theatre despite more than a little talent hed managed to offend someone or to take sick at just the wrong moment four or five different times killing whatever chance he might have had of becoming something more than a man who could do small roles well enough but would never get a big one maybe he was glad of any part he could claim and maybe too he was nothing but a loudmouthed fool shakespeare had known plenty of those in his years in the theatre he did wish lord westmorlands men hadnt been burdened with this one at this vital moment had he dared he would have asked burbage to sack quinn glancing over towards the hired man he shook his head no he didnt dare quinn knew too muchknew much too much if he were sacked if he were disgruntled wouldnt he go straight to the spaniards and sing his song shakespeare found it all too likely the afternoons play was shakespeares if you like it which the company had performed many times before in fact shakespeare remembered theyd put it on the day marlowe had first dragged him into this conspiracy having done it so often the players didnt need a lot of rehearsal to be fresh shakespeare went back to his lodging as soon as he could after it was over when he returned to the theatre the next morning players and stagehands stood in little knots with their heads together here what now shakespeare called that was no sight he cared to see edward the tiremans helper said matt quinn was dyeing scarlet at the bull inn yesternight and he at the bull inn shakespeare interrupted in bishopsgate not far from mine own lodgings the same edward said and ins cups he did go on more than considerable from boudicca ay and about the same will kemp heard him every word as did all too many not initiate in our mystery if men were to be saved by merit what hole in hell were hot enough for quinn shakespeare cried clapping a hand to his forehead truly he is damned like an illroasted egg all on one side he started to say more and more fiery still but checked himself wheres kemp id have this froms own lips he looked around come to that wheres the drunken roarer himself id have the tale ofs folly from his own lips master kemps in the tiring room edward replied as for master quinn he hath not deigned to spread himself upon our stage this day is he drunk asleep shakespeare cried or in the bought illicit pleasure of his bed at game aswearing or about some act that hath no relish of salvation in it then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be damned and black as hell whereto it goes edward spread his hands i know not master shakespeare i know only he is not here as to the why oft he shook his head if he repent of his drunken antic and thinking to save himself from the fruit thereof if he flee to the dons shakespeares voice trailed away as edwards had a moment before richard burbage came out of the tiring room just in time to hear that marry god prevent it he exclaimed but now i will sack that whoreson knave will speak not against it speak not of caution my minds made up having played many kings he could sound like one at need ill say not a word shakespeare answered meseems though amongst our other cares thats small beer wholl take his role an he come not edward asked burbage stabbed out a finger at the muscular young man will you essay it he hath but a handful of lines nor need you no dancing shoes with nimble soles edward gaped then an enormous grin stretched across his face ill dot sir learn me those lines and ill have em by heart quick as boiled asparagus do you but show me whence i am to go on and whither to go off and im your man god bless you for the chance what fools these youngsters be will kemp exclaimed emerging from the tiring room behind burbage his shoulders shook with laughter he glanced towards shakespeare were you ever so all afire to make an ass of yourself before the general i hotter than edward dreams of being shakespeare answered and now and again an ass i made of me so do we all matthew quinn did not come to the theatre edward took his part and managed well enough thomas vincent had to hiss some of his lines to him the second time he came on but he brought them out loud enough and remembered to face the audience so they could be heard if nervous sweat darkened the armpits of his tunic well it was a warm day other players were sweating too after the play everyone made much of the tiremans assistant shakespeare heard quinns name come up only once when it did someonehe couldnt see whosaid he is to us a dead man heads in the tiring room solemnly went up and down from the theatre shakespeare had come down almost to bishopsgate when a man stepped out of an alley and into his way on shoreditch high street the fellow was about his own age a wideshouldered brunet cleanshaven with his hair cropped short as puritans had worn theirs before the inquisition set out to stifle protestantism of all stripes his doublet might have been fine when it was new but it hadnt been new for years instead of hose he wore a sailors striped trousers when he didnt move aside shakespeare said yes you want somewhat of me he gathered himself if what the stranger wanted was his money hed get a fight first and then the fellow smiled and spoke and suddenly was a stranger no more by my troth will he said if you know me not then who will kit shakespeare gaped butbutyou took ship in deptford even marlowes smile looked different without the fringe of beard and the long hair that had framed his face ay i took ship in deptfordand left the ghastly scow in margate sithence ive changed my seeming and my style call me charles munday if you please ill call you an idiot a fond monster a mad mooncalf dotard shakespeare exclaimed you could be safe away but no youll have none of safety should any man pierce your shorn locks where could i live but london marlowe asked this place hath life all other towns are as dead beside it this place hath your death on the gibbet or worse shakespeare said where will you live how will you eat where ill keep in my own privitywhat you know not no inquisitor may rip from you marlowe said and shakespeare was forcibly reminded of his own danger the other poet went on as for how no man with a quick pen needquitefear starving and that i have how fares boudicca even in mortal danger marlowe would speak of things better left unthought let alone unsaid i know that name not shakespeare answered stonily till the day i know it not een after the day haply shall i know it not you may be wise said marlowewho shakespeare realized hadnt changed his initials with his name or like as not you may be but a different sort of fool showing forth a different sort of folly thinking of all the rehearsals for boudicca hed watched shakespeare could only nod lope de vega fought to keep his face from showing how bored and how annoyed he was how many times had captain baltasar guzman summoned him to his office only to wave a sheet of paper in his face and then not let him see what it was but though guzman waved this sheet of paper like any other he startled lope by handing it to him and saying here this may possibly be of some interest to you senior lieutenant ah lope rapidly read through it his eyes got wider and wider with each succeeding line he didnt realize how far his jaw had fallen till he needed to speak again and had to pull it up again but this this your excellency this is from a printer a printer in madrid in in the capital realizing he was babbling he fell silent again captain guzmnn nodded yes a printer he said i told you that if el mejor mozo de espana succeeded i would send it and la dama boba back to spain to put them before the civilized world el mejor mozo de espana won praise from no less than the daughter of his most catholic majesty i keep my promises this says de vega made himself stop starting and stopping every few words this says the printer likes the playshe admires them he saysand that he would be delighted and honored to put them into print delighted and honored god and the holy virgin and all the saints bless you your excellency i am going to be in print in print at last i shall be remembered forever so many plays died with their creators once he was there no more who cared about who remembered the children of his imagination they died with him as worms ate him oblivion swallowed him but to leave behind work in print a hundred years from this moment or two hundred or four hundred someone could take a book of his plays off the shelf leaf through it and decide to put on la dama boba and when the lady nitwit went up on stage lope would live again with a sardonic smile captain guzman returned him to the present while you are here and merely mortal senior lieutenant do you recall any mention of sir william cecil at the theatre of lord burghley no your excellency lope answered i dont remember ever hearing his name there though i have heard hes dying he is nearly dead he is older than philip and fails faster i never did understand why his most catholic majesty spared him after the conquest but that was his will maybe he respected a worthy foe burghley towered above the other men the little men who advised elizabeth every spanish officer i know is sure he had one last damnable plot in him but no one ever sniffed it out over in westminster don diego said much the same thing sir de vega said but i have seen nothing in the theatre to make me think lord westmorlands men involved not the murder of geoffrey martin guzman asked no sir lope replied for all that the mad english constable in shoreditch mumbles about someone knowing someone who knows someone elsei think thats what he mumbles for he speaks in riddles often i believe riddles to himselfhe has no proof none whatever martins murder was anything but an ordinary knifing in an ordinary robbery it could be guzmans voice was studiously noncommittal yes it could be but in that case what of the murder of matthew quinn the murder of that brought lope up short but i saw this quinn alive and rehearsing only a few days a very few days ago hes dead when how as for when by the smell and the other signs only a few days agoi presume after you saw him last guzman had a wit so dry lope had taken longer than he should have to notice it was there at all now he went on as for how he drew a finger across his throat where did they find him de vega asked in an alley behind and down the street from a tavern called the bull inn in bishopsgate baltasar guzman replied it is not far from seaor shakespeares lodgings whatever that may mean the body was found without a purse without a penny so this may have been a simple robbery it maybut then again it may not yes lope plucked at his neat little chin beard one murder in a company of actorsthat means nothing i wouldnt mind murdering one actor in that company myself but two two murders from the same small group do make you wonder was quinn doing anything out of the way in this tavern guzman favored him with an approving glance he didnt get that many from his superior and basked in this one the nobleman said now that senior lieutenant that is a very interesting question what i wish we had is an interesting answer we have no answer at all no one we can find who was in the tavern that night admits to remembering quinn at all no one not even the taverner lope scowled quinn liked to hear himself talk and he wore an illfitting periwig he would not be easy to forget someone had stolen the periwig too by the time the body was found captain guzman remarked lope made a small disgusted noise guzman nodded and continued no not even the taverner he says quinn wasnt a regular and he never wastes much time with people who arent regulars people who are regulars swear he is telling the truth would they say the same if we questioned themproperly de vega had no trouble contemplating torture but didnt care to come right out and name it another interesting question maybe for that one well find an answer baltasar guzman replied meanwhile though i want you to work with this constable strawberry who has been trying to catch whoever killed geoffrey martin maybe he can help us here if these two killings are connected yes your excellency lope said dutifully but he couldnt help heaving a sigh i dont much like this englishman though and i dont think hes very bright as may behe is the man on the spot and he has been working on the matter since martin died guzman said martin was a good catholic man his killing should not go unpunished was quinn a good catholic man lope asked looking unhappy captain guzman shook his head no or no one thinks so before we came here he was a protestant he went to mass afterwards but no one ever thought he was pious no link there then lope said guzman sent him a warning look he hastily added but ill go find out if there are any others feeling put upon he rode up to shoreditch when he got there one of the watchmen who assisted the constable told him strawberry was out on rounds the fellow had only a vague idea of where strawberry might be found i could be at the theatre lope thought resentfully not chasing down this slowwitted englishman who isnt likely to know much anyway he finally came upon walter strawberry marching up a muddy street swinging a truncheon by its leather thong give you good day constable he called hurrying towards the other man why master de vega as i live and expire strawberry said tipping his hat greetings and palpitations to you sir erthank you lope said listening to the constable always reminded him english was a foreign language i have just learned of the death of the player matthew quinn he died the death indeed murther murther most foul and robbery ofs periwiganother felony besides strawberry said mind you i am factitious of who the miscegenate was are you lope said constable strawberry solemnly nodded de vega asked think you this slaying hath connection to that of geoffrey martin connection connection the englishman said why man if some low cove had not connection with geoff martin and now with quinn theyd not be slain will you tell me im wrong he stuck out his jaw in challenge meseems you have mistook me lope said be there in your view connection betwixt masters martin and quinn give me leave to doubt it sir they were both honest men or honest enough and with such vice square against all conjunctions biblical de vega muttered a quick pater noster he hoped god was listening trying to get through to walter strawberry was like going to the dentist save that strawberry drew sense rather than teeth let me try once more lope said with what he reckoned commendable calm think you the same man did slay these twain ay belike the constable saidat last a definite answer lope felt like cheering and who was this man why the murtherer assuredly strawberry stared at him who else might he be another pater noster did not suffice de vega neither did crossing himself through clenched teeth he asked what calls he himself this man you reckon the murtherer i mean know you of a wicked cove hight ingram frizer no sir i ken him not lope shook his head well him i believe to be the benefactor in question i am sorry sir lope said i am most terribly sorry one of us hath of your tongue a grasp imperfect which that may be he threw his hands in the air i own i know not i have spake english since i was a puling babe it is the tongue of my captivity strawberry said you then needs must be inerrant would i were lope exclaimed tell me more of this man frizer maybe he would learn something he dared hope stranger things must have happened though none occurred to him offhand he hath a knife and a temper and a quick way with both constable strawberry said and de vega understood every word the englishman went on you being intermittent with them of the theatre i feel it recumbent upon me to give you fair warning this ingram frizer hath acquaintance with nick skeres he paused expectantly again i am sorry but this name i know not lope said do you not do you not indeed sir well master skeres though hell not slit your weasand with a cuttle still and all he is a most vile cozening rogue a cheat such that judas ins chariot hath not seen the like andanother portentous pause he hath acquaintance with master shakespeare the poetaster poetaster shakespeare you show yourself no judge of poesy master strawberry an you place him so low can it be doubted he is amongst the finest poets of our time i think not can it be doubted he knows nick skeres i think not strawberry returned again lope understood every word at least individually what he didnt understand was what if anything all those words meant taken together he muttered something nasty under his breath knowing he had no choice but to try to find out after another performance as the ghost in prince of denmark shakespeare scrubbed chalk and black greasepaint from his face in the tiring room every so often someone would come up and tell him how frightful hed been his thanks were distinctly abstracted he kept looking around the room wondering if christopher marlowe would dare appear his fellow poet would make a ghost even less welcome than that of the unhappy princes father thus far no sign of marlowe shakespeare knew nothing but relief maybe kits folly had limits after all maybe he dared hope well played master shakespeare most well played shakespeare had a towel over his eyes at that moment but he didnt need to see to be sure who spoke to him for which kindness i do thank you lieutenant de vega he replied it is nothing nothing at all lope said grandly when shakespeare took the towel away from his face he got a surprise after all for there beside the spaniard stood cicely sellis mommet perched on her shoulder hoping to hide his alarm shakespeare bowed to the cunning woman give you good day as well mistress sellis and to you she replied i have more than once before seen you give the ghost but never methinks better than today you are too generous by half shakespeare murmured id liefer give than give up the ghost he thought but have i the choice he turned to lope de vega and murmured again this time only two words how now how are you now come hither with mistress sellis and not with the spanish jade who cost a noblemans life was what he meant by the way lope coughed a couple of times and turned red he understood all the words shakespeare hadnt said but he answered smoothly saying we two being friends and having in common a friend were together glad to see him play his famous role just so cicely sellis said her cat yawned de vega smiled shakespeare didnt care for the expression mommet might have worn it playing with a mouse the spaniard was going to take his revenge and he did know you a man called ingram frizer master shakespeare i might have guessed flashed through shakespeares mind no one in the company had spoken much of matthew quinns death no one had seemed much surprised to hear of it either not when quinns tongue had flapped so free but two murders in one company had drawn the dons notice as well as that of constable strawberry and shakespeare didnt suppose he should have been much surprised at that no more than a heartbeat slower than he should have he shook his head and answered frizer no lieutenant i ken no one of that name nobody could prove otherwisehe hoped a question of his own seemed safe why ask you me of him sure enough de vega replied he is suspect in the murther of the player quinn may the hangman sell the rope by which he dances on the air then shakespeare said but why i pray you think you he and i be known each to the other for that you are both known to one nicholas skeres the spanish officer said his voice suddenly hard how much did he know if he knew enough he wouldnt have brought cicely sellis along while he asked questionshe would have brought a squad of soldiers and dragged shakespeare away realizing that helped the poet quell his fear lope was only fishing for whatever he might find shakespeare resolved to give him as little as he could i have met nicholas skeres ay but he is no friend of mine indeed i misdoubt him not a little as i live he is like as not a queerbird his name writ down in the black book he had no idea whether skeres had actually gone to prison and had his name inscribed in the register but he wouldnt have been surprised and he didnt mind in the least slandering a man he truly disliked skeres he was sure could take care of himself lope said this marches with that which you told unto constable strawberry damn constable strawberry for a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow shakespeare thought is not the truth the truth he said aloud that truth should be silent i had almost forgot i know not whether tis truth or another thing de vega answered i do know i will find where truth be hid though it were hid indeed within the center that a man saith twice the same thing proves not its truth but only his constancy are we not friends here cicely sellis asked use friends each the other so to shakespeares surprise lope bowed to her and said you are as wise as you are lovely let it be as you would havet of course she sketched a curtsy she didnt bend low to keep mommet from either falling off or sinking in his claws gramercy she said in a false quarrel there is no true valor lope nodded that is well said indeed it is shakespeare agreed but he knew the spaniard hadnt stopped digginghed only paused while in the cunning womans company even that was a good deal more than shakespeare had expected he watched the way de vegas eyes caressed her hed fain be more than friend the poet realized what tangled skein have we here and how will it unravel he tried to imagine lope coming regularly to the widow kendalls lodginghouse walking into cicely sellis room closing the door behind him would mommet watch he wondered could a man bed a witch her puckrel attending her would it not unman him he eyed her himself would i know these things for the dons sake or for mine own haply for mine own cicely sellis eyes gray as the northern seas met his ownmet them and held them not for the first time he had the feeling she knew every thought in his head considering what some of those thoughts were he feared he blushed like a schoolboy if the cunning woman truly could divine his mind she gave no sign of it she leaned towards lope and spoke to him in a voice too low for shakespeare to make out the spaniard nodded his smile indulgentand more than a little hungry a moment later he was making his goodbyes to shakespeare and leading her out of the tiring room richard burbage came over to the poet the don hath another new woman shakespeare only shrugged i cannot say that he would have her though i doubt not she is the cunning woman hight cicely sellis of whom i may once or twice have spoke burbages eyes got wide the one dwelling in your lodginghouse the same i hope that damned witch that damned sorceress hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares burbage said his deep voice somber of shakespeare let the title of the play hang unspoken in the air of that and of other things the player answered so i hope as well but cicely sellis methinks is unaware of very little will she discover to the spaniard that which she knows burbage asked nervously i think not shakespeare wanted to shake his head and say such a thing was impossible unimaginable he wanted to but knew too well he couldnt he and cicely sellis had hardly spoken of things political few in occupied england said much about such things except to those they knew would not betray them trusting the wrong manor womanwas among the worst mistakes anyone could make you think not richard burbage echoed and shakespeare nodded burbage persisted no more than that can you say now the poet did shake his head burbage looked very unhappy indeed for which shakespeare could not blame him he asked and will she too meet the smiler with the knife under the cloak that made shakespeare blink hed used chaucer as a source for a couple of his plays but hadnt known burbage read the canterbury tales asking him about that though would wait for some other time why to me put you this question he said speaking in a nearwhisper to make sure no one else in the tiring room heard i knew naught of poor geoffs murther aforetimes nor of matt quinns neither burbage said nothing his silence felt more devastating than any words could have shakespeare grimaced and turned away hed told the truth as so often happened it did him no good at all and when he got back to his lodginghouse he found jane kendall in a swivet a spaniard the widow hissed at him as soon as he walked through the door she came hither with a spaniard she crossed herself being sincerely catholic she preferred isabella and albert on the throne to elizabeth but had no great love for the stern soldiers whod set them there such contradictions were anything but rare these days rest you easy mistress kendall shakespeare said another upset was the last thing he needed the don is known to me a sweetfaced man a proper man but he is a don the widow kendall said be he never so sweetfaced he is a don a busy meddling fiend she paused then made the sign of the cross again and i dare not even rate her fort lest she do me a mischief with her foul witchery her voice fell to a barely audible whisper is he her sweetheart i know not not to a surety shakespeare answered hed have it so meseems but oft yawns a gulf twixt what a man would and what a woman will jane kendall sniffed saith she i am a widow and how many queans and callets and low harlots say the same shakespeare thought cicely sellis might be a great many things a whore never he didnt argue with the widow kendall though hed long since seen there was no point to that he simply headed for his bedchamber saying i needs must take pen and paper and then im for the ordinary and supper and god grant it some tolerable verses his landlady couldnt complain so loudly as was her custom not when she feared the cunning woman and so also feared being overheard that let him get out of the house and off to the ordinary by the time he came back jane kendall had gone to bed so did he not much later he was on his way up to the theatre the next morning when nicholas skeres slid out of a side street and fell into step with him aroint thee shakespeare exclaimed id liefer see a black cat cross my path than thee i am suspect for that we are acquainted and known to be acquainted skeres didnt get angry which disappointed shakespearehe longed for a quarrel even a fight ill begone anon the clever but illfavored man said first though you must know at once lord burghley is no more he died yesternight ins sleep god save us shakespeare whispered hed expected the news since the last time he saw nick skeres hearing it jolted him even so god save us indeed skeres answered now god and good st george save englandgod and st george and you master shakespeare i am sure as need be this cloth hath more threads than mine own shakespeare said and nicholas skeres did not contradict him he went on god grant robert cecil hath hold of them all skeres nodded then slipped away shakespeare trudged on towards the theatre alone with his thoughts lope de vega and catalina ibanez sat in a tavern in westminster drinking sweet rhenish wine and glaring at each other across the table you never take me anywhere catalina complained i might as well be in a convent for all the fun i have with you that is not so lope said indignantly did we not go to the bearbaiting only two nights ago was it not a fine spectacle going back to southwark gave him a twinge but hed done it for catalina since she was at the moment his only lover hed feared no disaster nor had he suffered one hed had a good time and thought she had too maybe she had but she didnt show it now bearbaiting she laced the words with scorn where are the balls where are the feasts where are the masques don alejandro used to take me to i ask you thatwhere are they youd better have a good answer for me too her eyes flashed dangerously with such patience as he could muster de vega answered my dear don alejandro was a nobleman and a man newly come from spain of course he got invited to these things i am only a senior lieutenant i wish i were in great demand unfortunately though oh why did i ever take up with you catalina seemed more likely to be asking god than lope lope answered nonetheless for love love she waved away the very idea when queen isabella tossed you that purse after we put on el mejor mozo de espaaa i thought you were going places but the only place you want to go is the english theatre i wish you spoke the language lope said theres so much to see so much to admire so much to learn catalina ibanez yawned in his face so much to be bored by ive been bored every single minute since we started seeing each other every minute lope said i think not my dear if shed faked her pleasure she was a far better actress even than shed shown on stage she didnt deign to respond to the sly dig instead she said i never should have told anyone you killed poor don alejandro in a fair fight if you dont start treating me better ill tell people what really happened there in that yard what really happened lope didnt spring from his stool he didnt raise his voice he didnt so much as lean forward menace filled his words and manner even so what do you mean tell me most precisely intent on herself catalina ibanez didnt notice the menace not at first why how you lay in wait for him and and her voice trailed away too late too slow lope said you will not do that he spoke as calmly as if he were telling her the sun will come up tomorrow if you think you can blackmail me my sweet you had better think again do you remember what don alejandros body looked like that could be you you wouldnt d but catalina once more failed to finish her sentence lope might what would stop him hed already done it to don alejandro de recalde do you want to try me do you want to find out what i would or wouldnt do lope asked go right ahead my love youll learn everything you ever wanted to know i promise you that you are a monster an animal catalina said shrilly de vega inclined his head at your service seaorita always at your service my service she said the best service you could give me would be never to see me again if thats how you would have it so shall it be lope got to his feet he swept off his hat and bowed low pity a man died over so small and passing a thing as your affection but such is life but even if we are quits do bear in mind that i shall know if you go telling lies about me to those in authority you may think you can ruin me you may even be right but i promise you i will have my revenge do you doubt it catalina ibanez looked as if she would have liked nothing better than to do exactly that but all she said was nnnnoas frightened a stammer as hed ever heard he had no idea whether to believe her he refused to worry about it either way if she did go to the authorities with her lies they might or might not take her seriously whether they did or not honor demanded that he avenge the slight he would do it too at whatever cost to himself she had to know that she wasnt wise in the ways of book learning but she was shrewd with another bow lope said farewell my former dear i shall remember you in my dreamsand if god is kind nowhere else he strode out of the wineshop a quick glance over his shoulder showed him catalina staring after him her eyes enormous in a face gone pale and yellow as goatsmilk cheese he went out into the street just in time to see sir william cecils funeral procession pass by carrying deposed elizabeths great counselor from westminster to his final resting place in st pauls cathedral in london de vega hadnt thought any englishman especially one of such dubious loyalty could be buried with so much pomp but when he saw how many people lined the street for a last glimpse of lord burghleys earthly remains even here in westminster a stronghold of isabella and albert and the spaniards he realized the powers that be hadnt dared say no to this procession for fear of riots or worse four white horses draped in black velvet decorated with sir williams coat of arms drew the bier through the streets more velvet this of a deep purple hue covered the coffin that held cecils corpse above the coffin was an effigy of the dead english nobleman his arms folded over this chest in the shape of the cross a canopy of black velvet again picked out with the cecil coat of arms shielded the effigy from the august sun in the wake of the bier walked robert cecil lord burghleys son the pale little man with his twisted back seemed out of place in that robust sun the black velvet of mourning he wore only accented his pallor just for a moment his eyes met lopes he nodded as if to a friend and kept on walking behind him came several other prominent englishmen of his generation and his fathers lope recognized francis bacon who being lord burghleys nephew could hardly be blamed for mourning his passing some of the others though surprised de vega sir william cecil had had more friends than hed believed among the men who ran the country for queen isabella and king albert many of those men no doubt would have been as glad to run england for elizabeth the heretic lopes eyes flicked east towards the tower where she remained in an odd way killing mary queen of scots might have saved elizabeths life not wanting to be a regicide himself king philip hadnt imitated her and had let her live catalina ibanez came out of the wineshop seeing lope standing there watching the funeral procession move on towards london she snarled something that would have made a grizzled muleteer blush then stalked away i dont suppose ill see her again de vega thought with a sigh i dont need to waste any worries on her though shes bound to land on her feet or on her back or wherever will do her the most good but even so he sighed again beside him someone spoke in englishaccented spanish theres a dangerous foe of isabella and albert dead lope started oh buenos dias senor phelippes my head must have been in the clouds for i noted you not when you came up i am most sorry he bowed in apology thomas phelippes politely returned the bow nothing to worry about senior lieutenant he continued to speak spanish where lope had replied mostly in english tell me de vega said what think you of robert cecil lord burghleys son and heir to answer that phelippes returned to english himself as if he couldnt be scornful enough in spanish small curs are not regarded when they grin he is as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress dog an untaught puppy by my troth you shall see him heave up his leg and make water against a gentlewomans farthingale lope laughed in delight at the unexpectedness of that not the man his father was then by your reckoning not half the man sir not in any particular the englishman answered not in height nor in girth not in years nor in wisdom not in paunch nor in pizzle a dear manikin such a dish of skim milk as the world hath not seen the likes of since neros day you ease my mind lope said i shall take your opinion to captain guzman who hath some concern oer the son of such a father far from fearing such as robert cecil your good captain may set all plain sail and dread naught thomas phelippes said i have told don diego flores de valdas the same by god sir this is good to hear de vega said i grieve only that his most catholic majesty will not long outlive the foe he ins mercy spared the lord moves in mysterious ways blessed be his name phelippes crossed himself lope did the same the pockmarked bespectacled little englishman continued i had me the privilege of writing out the parts from shakespeares king philip making fair copy for the players use though it were builded of brick and marble a man might have a lesser monument mine own thought is much the same de vega agreed phelippes bowed again may that production come not soon he said and now sir your pardon but i must away he hurried off in the directionlope thought it was the directionof the palace where he and don diego helped administer the spanish occupation of england lope had intended to go back to london but lord burghleys funeral procession would surely clog the strand for some time to come with catalina ibanez gone he ducked back into the wineshop instead whenever shakespeare left his lodginghouse or the theatre these days the first thing he did was anxiously peer in all directions he didnt want to see nick skeres coming his way with more bad news and he especially didnt want to see ingram frizer who might come his way with death he was supping on boiled beef and marrow bones stewed with barley and parsnips and mushrooms when thomas phelippes walked into the ordinary by then hed come into the place often enough that kate called to him a cup of the rhenish sir as youve drunk before if youd be so kind mistress phelippes replied he pulled up a stool at shakespeares table and sat down saying give you good even shakespeare had raised a bone to his lips he sucked out the rich delicate marrow with a small almost involuntary sound of pleasure then he set the bone back in the bowl this was no low dive nor was he a rustic or a ruffian to throw his refuse on the floor god give you good den as well master phelippes he said grudgingly was the pockmarked little man a companion any safer than skeres or frizer he had his doubts the serving woman brought phelippes his wine he set a penny on the table she scooped it up he eyed her as she walked off with it candlelight glinted from the lenses of his spectacles a likely wench he remarked think you so shakespeare said as neutrally as he could he sprinkled some salt from the saltcellar into his stew what would you he asked in a low voice you came not meseems for to praise the ladys beauty however praiseworthy she be phelippes nodded there you speak sooth sir he pointed to the pewter spoon shakespeare had brought to the ordinary eat up quick as you may id have you come with me what tonight now shakespeare yelped thomas phelippes nodded again whither wherefore the poet demanded id purposed work of mine own this even the one commission and the other both being done as you will have seenhe couldnt resist the gibe for he remained unsure who phelippes true master wasi dared hope i might pursue a notion no one set me be ever at enmity with cozening hope he is a flatterer phelippes said shakespeare glared at him wasted effort he gave no more heed than a snake to the frantic stares of a bird it swallowed he went on come away with me someone would fain take counsel with you someone shakespeare echoed phelippes nodded once more who the poet asked the other man cocked his head to one side the dancing candle flame filled his spectacle lenses with light and lent him for a moment an inhuman cast of feature shakespeare mouthed robert cecils name phelippes gave him yet another nod knowing he couldnt refuse shakespeare did eat quickly when hed finished the meat and the parsnips he took up his writing tools and got to his feet lead on master phelippes seeing him head for the door instead of settling down to write kate called after him in surprise and alarm is all well will well enough or so i hope he answered that wouldnt reassure her he hoped it would unsettle phelippes if anything happened to him the alarm would spread quickly the other question was did phelippesdid robert cecilcare shakespeare had to believe they did if they would kill him when hed done them no harm when hed labored long and hard to aid their cause how were they better than the dons outside the ordinary darkness hung thick almost palpable as august moved towards september nights were getting longer again and colder too when shakespeare sighed he could see the vapor of his own breath somewhere high overhead an owl hooted tiny skitterings from close by the walls said rats and mice went about their business even so whither away shakespeare asked again in that smothering dark he felt as much a skulker as the skittering vermin instead of answering with words thomas phelippes set off at a brisk pace can i endure this arrogance and from this fellow sadly shakespeare knew he had no choice he followed he wished he had mommets eyes that would have kept him from stepping in several noxious piles and puddles by phelippes lowvoicedand sometimes not so lowvoicedcurses he knew the other man had the same trouble somehow that didnt console him phelippes led him south and west he didnt realize how far hed come till he saw the great bulk of st pauls heaving itself up into the sky blocking out the stars before long phelippes knocked at the door to a house that seemed neither rich nor poor the knock had a curious rhythm to it a code shakespeare thought the door opened inmake haste someone said phelippes ducked inside shakespeare followed once more he wished he could turn and flee instead if he did though he was grimly certain he would meet ingram frizer in the ruffians professional capacity would frizer smile as he drove the knife home shakespeare would not have bet against it inside light blazed from candles and torches and a leaping fire in the hearth a fire better suited to winter than summer robert cecil sat in a chair not far from the flames perhaps his back pained him when he used a stool like most men give you good evening master shakespeare he said dipping his head in what was almost but not quite a seated bow and to you sir shakespeare replied my deepest condolement on your loss lord burghleys son waved him to a stool as he perched there nervous as a bird the younger cecil said tis the kingdom should condole not i my father passed from us full of years but englands savior died untimely what he cannot now do i needs must essay how stand we in respect of your part therein you will know the play is writ shakespeare said and robert cecil nodded the poet went on you will also know constable strawberry sniffs after him who murthered both geoff martin and now matthew quinn cecil nodded again thomas phelippes said we merit our freedom not an such a bedlam brainsick counterfeit module may make to totter the fabric of our designs what strawberry solus may not do peradventure with confederates he may shakespeare said belike you will know he concerts with lieutenant de vega again phelippes was the one who spoke up and is not de vega well and truly cozened does he not believe me friend to his enterprise can such a worthless post be feared any man opposing us may be feared said shakespeare whod learned more about fear since the previous autumn than he ever wanted to know he glanced towards robert cecil cecil kept his own counsel he would have been a dangerous man in a game of cards shakespeare had no idea what he was thinking he dared hope cecil was thinking something and reminded himself lord burghley had had a good opinion of his crookbacked son a servant brought in goblets of sherrissack and sugar to sweeten it everyone fell silent till the man bowed his way out of the room then sipping the wine cecil asked and should i know aught else shakespeare started to shake his head as robert cecil plainly expected him to do but then he checked the motion haply you should your honor one of cecils eyebrows rose startlingly dark against the pallid skin of his forehead his long thin fingers tightened on the goblets stem but his voice showed nothing as he said tell it me then as you know of walter strawberry as you know he treats with the don so belike you will know kit marlowe is returned to london that loosed a hawk amongst the pigeons robert cecil started so violently sugared sack slopped out of his goblet and onto the slashed black velvet of his doublet why thou infinite and endless liar thomas phelippes burst out by my troth sir i am no such creature and be damned to thine ignorant oppressive arrogance for naming me one shakespeare answered angrily before phelippes could loose some hot retort of his own robert cecil help up a hand the gesture though spare was commanding phelippes fell silent at once shakespeare just had time to note that before the younger cecils gaze fell full on him it was not a magisterial stare such as sir william had had but its blazing intensity made it at least as arresting robert cecil said tell me at onceat once how you know this to be true how sir because i have seen him and spoke with him shakespeare said he hath cropped his hair close to his head and shaved his beard so that a man might pass him in the street and know him not but his voice is not so easily disguised but he went to sea at deptford thomas phelippes said in sooth as i told him shakespeare replied and quotha he came ashore at margate for that he might hie back to london damnation take him phelippes said he were better gone for he will make himself known he can no more help spewing words than a malmseynose sot can help spewing wine do the spaniards seize him he dies the death robert cecil said the which he must know he doth know it indeed shakespeare said but he cannot avoid what plays out here no more than can a jackdaw spying some trifling shiny thing serving to bait a snare grimly cecil said a jackdaw snares but itself until it be snared and tamed and taught it hath no knowledge of human speech would the same were so of marlowe an the dons lay hold of him how shall he save himself phelippes asked the question hung in the air phelippes didnt answer it neither did robert cecil silence did the job for them one possibility immediately occurred to shakespeare by telling them all he knows that had been in his mind ever since hed had the misfortune to discover his fellow poet hadnt had the sense to get out of england while he could cecil looked his way again gramercy master shakespeare for bringing this word to my notice doubt not i shall attend tot by the which you mean do your confederates find him he likewise dies the death shakespeare said now cecils gaze was perfectly opaque shakespeare realized hed blundered and might have blundered badly it wasnt that he was wrong it was in fact that he was right such things might better have stayed unspoken then the younger cecil wouldnt either have to admit to planning marlowes untimely death or to tell a lie by denying it would hed gone abroad thomas phelippes murmured as much of an answer as shakespeare was likely to get i shall ask once more have you other news we should hear cecil this time sounded as if he meant the question not as if he were asking it for forms sake alone but shakespeare shook his head when next i see kit i must tell him both sidesd fain know the color ofs blood he thought he didnt know hed see marlowe again but found it all too likely icarus flew nigh the sun and perished thereby kit outdoth him in folly first helping kindle the flame that now will burn him phelippes pointed towards the door we are in paternoster row by st pauls he said knowing so much can you wend your way homeward i can an i be not robbed or murthered faring thither shakespeare answered nicholas skeres had told him londons miscreants were ordered to leave him alone hed seen some signs it might be so but he still remained far from sure skeres word was to be trusted and on a night as dark as this even an honest footpad might make an honest mistake and fall on him the night wasnt so dark when he left the house as it had been when he got there the thirdquarter moon looking like half a glowing gold angel or mark had climbed up over the rooftops to the northeast in fact it made a pretty fair guide for shakespeare as he hurried back towards jane kendalls lodginghouse he was out after curfew twice he had to duck into shadowed doorways as a spanish patrolalways several men together as single spaniards werent safe on the streets past sunsetmarched by once somebody else out late didnt disappear fast enough a spaniard called out the englishman ran instead of coming forward shouting and cursing the dons pounded after him one of them fired a pistol no scream followed so shakespeare supposed the ball missed he waited till the soldiers had rounded a corner then went on his own way he got home with no more trouble he even got a little writing done sleep he might have got a little that night he wasnt sure xii lope de vega and cicely sellis stood just outside the door to the cunning womans room as she set her hand on the latch she said we are friends mind you master de vega not lovers i trust youll recall as much when we go within and seek not to paw me or do me other such discourtesies god forbid it lope exclaimed making the sign of the cross to show his sincerity then he let out a melodramatic sigh to show he wasnt so sincere as all that she made a face at him he winked and blew her a kiss saying teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made for kissing lady not for such contempt and my kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread she rolled her eyes love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do nowswear and swear true or stay without my door as you wish so shall it be lope said solemnly this i swear and if once they were inside and alone together she wished for something other than that he keep his distance he would gladly oblige her and if he could persuade her to wish for something other than that why then he would something in cicely sellis expression said she knew perfectly well what lay in his mind that irked lope he didnt like women seeing through him she is a cunning woman after all he reminded himself and then not for the first time reminded himself of the other shorter name for a cunning woman witch some things he might try with other women he would perhaps be wise to forget with this one i shall take you at your word she said and opened the door enter ant please you he did curious not least to see what a witchs room was like it seemed ordinary enough bed stool chest of drawers with basin and pitcher atop it undoubtedly a chamber pot under the bed the only thing even slightly strange was a box half full of raw uncombed wool that puzzled lope till mommet stuck his head out of the box and mewed a clever nest the spaniard said it suits him cicely sellis waved to the stool sit you down she herself perched on the edge of the bed he would rather have sat beside her but he couldnt very well do that not when shed been so definite mommet leaped from the box paused to scratch behind an ear and wandered over to sniff at his boots he stroked the cat it purred then snapped he jerked his hand away mommet went right on purring faithless beast he muttered he is a cat the cunning woman said from one moment to the next he knows not what hed have is he then so different from those who go on two legs treasons in his blood de vega said is he then so different cicely sellis didnt repeat all of her last question only enough to make it plain in doing so she gave lope an opening know you of any such he asked keeping his tone as light and casual as he could for surely you must hear all manner of fearful and curious things the confessional hath its secrets she said no less my trade whod speak to a cunning woman knowing his words were broadcast to the general no less than a priest i hear of adulteries and fornications and cozenings and as you say all manner of proof adams get be a sinful lot a cunning woman of course lacked the immunity of a priest hearing confession lope didnt mention that she had to know it only too well and while shed mentioned several kinds of things she heard about she hadnt said a word about treason if he pressed her on it he would make her suspicious instead he changed the subject or seemed to how i envy you lodging here cheek by jowl with master shakespeare hath he told you aforetime what his next plays to be cicely sellis shook her head nay nor hath he spoke treason in my hearing neither lopes ears burned he hadnt been so subtle there as he would have wished if he acknowledged the hit though she would think him more interested in spying on her than interested in her he was interested in spying on her but that didnt mean he wasnt interested in her on the contrary right glad i am to know it then he said ears so sweet as yours should hear no base no gross no disgusting thing she laughed the cat sat up on its haunches like a begging dog staring at her what should they hear then why how beautiful thou art he answered at once thou dost teach the torches to burn brightbeauty too rich for use for earth too dear that made her laugh again said i not we are friends say you so to all you hold in friendship i do not lope said but whilst we are friends id fain we were more i own it twould curd my blood to say otherwise you flatter me cicely sellis drew out a sparkling glass trinket that hung on a chain around her neck she let the pendant swing back and forth a couple of times it drew lopes eye as a lodestone draws iron then smiling to herself she tucked it back under her blouse into the shadowed vale between her breasts his gaze followed it till it disappeared seeing that made her smile wider youd say the like to any woman you found comely that held some truth but only some i have seen comely women aplenty he said i have loved comely women aplenty and having done it i find loving em for comeliness sake alone doth stale he thought of catalina ibaaez and wished he hadnt id sooner love one who might love me in return for reasons as several and various as mine for loving her i tell you yet again we are not lovers she said i tell thee yet again would we were lope exclaimed being balked only made him burn hotter you flatter me cicely sellis said once more nay for flattery is lies whilst i am full of truth lope said when this man swears that he is made of truth i near believe him though i know he lies the cunning woman said as if to an audience only she could see then her attention unmistakably swung back to lope said you the like to catalina ibaaez said you the like to lucy watkins said you the like to nell lumley to martha brock to maude fuller or ever you dove out her window de vega gaped how know you of her he was sure shakespeare didnt which meant cicely sellis couldnt have heard about that from him i have my ways she said he crossed himself thinking witch she is a bruja after all affecting not to notice she went on her sister is my washerwoman and hath been known to gossip oh lope felt foolish cicely sellis always had or said she had some natural means of gaining her knowledge maybe she wasnt a witch maybe on the other hand she just did a good job of covering her tracks who could know for certain de vega knew he didnt every time he thought he was sure more confusion followed are you answered she asked i am he said more or less truthfully rather more to the point his ardor was cooled he realized he would not lie with cicely sellis today peradventure i had best get hence he murmured hoping against hope she would ask him to stay but she didnt she only gave him a brisk nod that were best methinks i am ever glad to see you master de vega and to talk with you you are a man of parts not all those parts though would i take into me had a woman ever said anything bawdier in turning him down most women who let him into their beds never said anything bawdier jolted he bowed muttered god give you good day then and hurried out of her room he intended to hurry out of the lodginghouse too but he almost ran over william shakespeare on the way out both men exclaimed in surprise shakespeare said i had not looked to meet you here master lope mistress sellis is a friend as you know lope said indeed shakespeare answered the word seemed to hang in the air what lay behind it jealousy had the english poet cast longing glances at cicely sellis too shed given no sign of it but what did that prove he hadnt told her about his other lady friends eithernot that that mattered for she knew about them anyhow an edge in his voice shakespeare asked and what passed betwixt you twain thinking to reassure him de vega answered we spoke of many things yourself not least amongst em if shakespeare imagined the two of them talking he wouldnt imagine them naked and entwined they hadnt been but imagination could prove more dangerous than fact even in as normally unwarlike a man as shakespeare but the englishman remained pretty obviously unreassured how found my name its way into your mouths he asked his voice harsh why for your poesyhow else lope said i told her how i envied her the chance to know your verses or ever anyone else may that doth she not shakespeares glower matched his tone none but mine own self hears even a line ere it go forth to lord westmorlands men he coughed then spoke again with more selfcontrol thieves skulk everywhere een as is ist not the same in spain there you speak sooth de vega admitted and be damned to them he made as if to step towards a stool in the parlor to sit down and chat a while shakespeare shifted to put himself between lope and the stool taking the hint lope left the lodginghouse he is jealous of me whether hell admit it or not he thought sadly i hope it doesnt hurt our friendship but he didnt hope so enough to want to keep from seeing cicely sellis again the ghost in prince of denmark wasnt the only one shakespeare played crouched under the stage as the specter in christopher marlowes cambyses king of persia he peered out at the crowd through chinks and knotholes powdered chalk from his makeup and smoke that would rise with him through the trap door both tickled his nose he hoped he wouldnt sneeze the smoke made his eyes sting too but he couldnt rub them for fear of smearing the black greasepaint around them what would the groundlings do wheniflord westmorlands men put on boudicca he knew what lord burghley robert cecil and the other wouldbe rebels wanted the crowd to do on seeing a play about britons oppressed by invaders from across the sea would the people give the plotters what they wantedan they give not god give mercy to us all he thought gloomily he stiffened there not ten feet away stood lope de vega with cicely sellis beside him she laughed at something the spaniard said what were they talking about shakespeare turned his head and set his ear to the chink through which hed been looking but couldnt separate their talk from the rest of the noise finding lope in his lodginghouse had been a nasty surprise if hed still been working on boudicca he shuddered and shook as if the sweating sickness had seized him still shaking he moved to another chink a few feet away a moment later he stiffened into immobility so thorough and profound a glance from a cockatrice might have turned him to stone there stood marlowe he remained cleanshaven and closecropped but he also remained himself he wasnt very far from lope he wasnt very far at all would the don know him despite his altered seeming if he shouted something like any groundling whod poured down too much beer would de vega know his voice shog off shakespeare thought at him as urgently as he could get hence aroint thee avaunt but marlowe of course didnt move he stood there as if no one had ever wanted to hang him for sodomizing boys when a man with a tray of sausages pushed his way through the crowd marlowe bought from him and munched away like any tanner or stockfishseller or dyer by then shakespeare wished hed never started looking at the crowd in the first place and so when he spied walter strawberry a little to marlowes left he didnt panic as he might have otherwise hed already sunk down towards despair the constable couldnt send him there not when hed got there on his own performing in the play itself came as a great relief while he trod the boards he didnt have tohe couldntthink about anything else hearing people gasp at his first appearance hearing a woman up in the galleries let out half a shriek assured him he still played a specter better than anyone else he only wished he had more lines the better to keep himself distracted aye i make me a passing fine ghost he thought as he crouched under the stage again awaiting his next scene shall i make me a ghost in sooth ere this coil unravel to the fullest that seemed altogether too likely he came out on stage for his bows after cambyses king of persia ended still in ghost makeup and turban he saw de vega applauding and cicely sellis with him he saw marlowe applauding too which gave him an odd prick of pleasure he even saw dour walter strawberry applauding but the only thing that stuck in his mind was i go well acclaimed to my doom back in the tiring room he accepted congratulations with half an ear as it always did in a play with a ghost the chore of getting off his unusually elaborate makeup gave him an excuse for not paying too much attention to people who came up to him he could always soap and splash and scrub and say gramercy without really worrying about what they were trying to tell him today of all days that suited him well he wanted to escape from the theatrewhich was just how he thought of itas fast as he could he said hello to lope and to the cunning woman on his arm do they lie together he wondered by the way they spoke and touched and looked at each other he didnt think so but they were both in a way players and so likely better at dissembling than most that made him wonder what else lope might be concealing did the spaniard know of boudicca was he biding his time waiting to scoop up all the plotters when the time was ripe theres a question id give much to ask but shakespeare had to dissemble too he had to dissemble and to pray no one betrayed him before the day whenever that day should come and he had to pray the rising that would come on and after the day succeeded for its failure likewise doomed him and all of lord westmorlands men unless they could flee abroad ahead of spanishand englishvengeance he kept looking around the tiring room for christopher marlowe especially after the company had given one of the other poets plays kit had had the chance to flee abroad ahead of spanish vengeance hed had it and he hadnt taken it zany shakespeare thought marlowe did seem to have the sense to stay away from this chamber where his disguise could not hope to hold up shakespeare was about to slip out of the tiring room himself out of the tiring room and out of the theatre when walter strawberry pushed his way towards him through the crowd good day to you master shakespeare the constable boomed good day and the same to you sir shakespeare answered your performance this day was ghastly passing ghastly indeed strawberry said by his smile that was evidently intended for praise shakespeare dipped his head in what he hoped would pass for modesty i thank you for your gracious kindness he murmured he didnt ask strawberry what he wanted if he didnt ask maybe the constable would prove not to have wanted anything and leave him alone forlorn hope strawberry planted his wide frame in front of shakespeare and said know you in his last hours under this earth matt quinn spake traitorously it be so a certain witness hath demurred to me i knew this not sir shakespeare lied and did his best to spread confusion wherever he could but if he were a traitor then belike he who slew him loved his country think you so eh constable strawberry said well i have my suppositions on that ay some suppositious coves yet run free a murtherers blood adrip from their fingers surely it were the blood of them that were murthered shakespeare said the which is what i said not so god forbid i should quarrel with your honor god forbid it god forbid it indeed for i tell you sir them as quarrel with me have cause to beget it afterwards the constable declared i doubt not you speak sooth shakespeare said soberly mark it well then the constable said for the day of beckoning draws nigh i shall keep your words ever within my mind shakespeare hesitated then asked what sort of treason spake this matthew quinn vile unlawful treason most vile know you another sort might you make yourself more clear more plain why sir i aim to be as clear as the nose on my face as plain as a peacock strawberry said and so i shall exculpate more upon this matter the said quinn did speak insultingly on the king of spain dislikening him to a common bawd a bawd shakespeare said frowning walter strawberry nodded the very same sir a bawd which hath two debauched daughters an this be not treason what name shall you give it shakespeare didnt answer right away he was trying to make the pieces fit together and then with sudden frightening ease he did whoever had given strawberry the story must have misheard bawd for boudicca substituting a familiar word for the unfamiliar name and the queen of the iceni had had two daughters the romans had ravished a good thing whatever witness the constableand the spaniards had found seemed to know nothing of roman history or he would have given a clearer picture of matt quinns folly from the report that had come back to the theatre through will kemp quinn had said far more than walter strawberry knew be this not treason strawberry repeated if it be not treason what name would you give it would you call it plum pudding treason indeed id not deny it shakespeare said haply his end came at the hand of some bold soul whose overflowing choler would not suffer him to hear good king philip reviled so again he did his best to lead the constable away from the true trail and again he did not get so far as he would have wanted constable strawberry said this ingram frizer i have aforementioned is villain enough and to spare for murther and felonious absconding with his periwig both by my halidom i do believe him to be the perpetuator against matthew quinn since shakespeare believed the same thing he had to tread with the greatest of care he said your honor will know better than i for i have not met the gentleman you name no gentry cove he but a high lawyer and rakehell strawberry said once more shakespeare agreed once more he dared not let strawberry see as much the constable went on curious you twain should hold friends in common passing curious i call it how say you i say nick skeres is no friend of mine i have said the same again and again will you not heed me sir shakespeare showed a little anger were he honest he thought he would have done so and it helped hide his fear before constable strawberry could answer another man came up to shakespeare an older man jowly and leaning on a stick strawberry bowed to him give you good day sir edmund and you constable sir edmund tilney answered give me leave to speak to master shakespeare here if you please certes certes shall i gainsay the master of the revilements walter strawberry bowed again and withdrew shakespeare too made a leg at sir edmund good morrow sir what would you the master of the revels looked around to make sure strawberry was out of earshot before murmuring that man will trip to death ons own tongue nothing in his lifed become him like the leaving of it shakespeare said he is an annoyance but surely not so bad as that tilney said his vexatiousness knows no bounds with a sigh shakespeare added but it will be what it is an i rail at it or no i ask again sir how may i serve you in the matter oer which i come hither i am your servant master shakespeare the master of the revels replied i speak of your king philip ah say on sir whatsoeer the play in your view wants i shall supply direct me that i may have the changes done in good time his most catholic majesty failing by the day shakespeare crossed himself so did sir edmund his awkward motion told how full of years hed been before the success of the armada brought catholicism and its rituals back to england he said no need for change here not by the standards of mine office by the standards of dramaturgy the purpose of playing was and is to hold as twere the glass up to nature methinks you have held it here most exceeding well for the which you have my most sincerest thanks shakespeare meant every word of that if all went as robert cecil hoped king philip would never be staged even so the poet had worked as hard and as honestly on it as on boudicca he had no small pride in what hed achieved that the master of the revelsa man whod likely seen the scripts for more plays than anyone else aliveshould recognize its quality filled him with no small pride you have earned your praises tilney said now shakespeare bowed the master returned the gesture then he asked wherefore doth master strawberry make inquiry of you he is sir oracle and when he opes his lips let no dog bark shakespeare said sourly sir edmund chuckled but shakespeare realized his answer would not do tilney could ask the constable himself better to lull him than to let strawberry fan his suspicion to flame the poet went on he seeks him who murthered geoffrey martin and matt quinn he cannot believe you are the man tilney said no sir for which i thank god but quotha the man he suspects and i both are known to the same man from this i seem to lie under reflected suspicion so to speak whom have you in common the master of the revels asked shakespeare wished he would have picked a different question one nicholas skeres sir he said again knowing walter strawberry could give the answer if he didnt nick skeres tilney said shakespeare nodded sblood ive known nick skeres these past ten years near enough sir edmund told him a friend of marlowes nick skeres is id not dice with him ill say that he hath no small skill in the cheating law and hed not stick at sliding high men or low men or fullams into the game to gull a cousin but a murtherer i find that hard to credit and id say as much to the constables face gramercy if youd be so kind shakespeare said he too thought skeres would use dice with only high numbers or only low ones or weighted dice whenever he thought he could get away with it master strawberrys importunings do leave me distracted from seeing king philip forward could you ease them i hope i may the master of the revels said zeal without sense is like a mast without staysthe man having the one without the other will soon fall into misfortune ay master shakespeare ill bespeak strawberry for you for the which many thanks sir id be most disgraceful to you on account oft shakespeare said deadpan sir edmund tilney started to nod and turn away then he heard what shakespeare had really said after one of the better double takes the poet had seen sir edmund guffawed you are a most dangerous vile wicked fellow he said and you know your quarry as a conycatcher knows his cony why whatever can you mean shakespeare said this time they both laughed tilney clapped him on the shoulder and went off to chat with thomas vincent by the way the prompter smiled and nodded sir edmund was also telling him lord westmorlands men could legitimately perform king philip shakespeare peered into a lookingglass he muttered under his breathhed missed some greasepaint below one eye so he looked as if he had a shiner he scrubbed at the makeup with a rough cloth then examined himself again this time he nodded in satisfaction the sun hung low in the west when he left the theatre the equinox had come the day before soon all too soon days would dwindle down to the brief hours of late autumn and winter a chill breeze that smelled of rain made him glad of his thick wool doublet he hadnt gone far towards london before he saw marlowe perched on a boulder by the side of shoreditch high street the other poet plainly was waiting for him begone you carrion crow you croaker you slovenly unhandsome corse shakespeare said your servant sir marlowe descended from the rock and made a leg at him you can play the ghost i deny it not henceforth ill hear in your voice dead darius words i may play the ghost but do you not get hence youll have the role in good earnest shakespeare answered robert cecil knows you are returned to london an his men find you you are sped he didnt tell marlowe he was the one whod given cecil that news wherefore should he seek to jugulate me marlowe asked play not the innocent with me thou false virgin shakespeare said wondering whether marlowe were virgin anywhere upon his person you know oermuch of this and that he named no names not with other people walking in shoreditch high street you know oermuch and your tongue flaps like drying linen ithe wind cause aplenty to see you silentist not so like drying linen ithe wind thou most lying slave nay shakespeare shook his head by god kit hear me i tell you the truth he clicked his tongue between his teeth in annoyance hed automatically come out with a line of blank verse and not a very good one marlowe noticed the same thing and ten low words oft creep in one dull line he jeeredmore blank verse with a nasty barb mock an you would mockbut go stay and you die the death if not from the likes of ingram frizer then from the dons what cecil knows belike theyll learn anon can you tell me i am mistook they walked along arguing i can tell you im fain to stay to see the hand played out marlowe said stubbornly when first you learned the spaniards dogged you you nigh wet yourself for fear of em shakespeare said then you were wise this you show forth now tis but a madmans courage steeth did you not see you all but trod on de vegas toes there amongst the groundlings i saw him ay with yet another trull marlowe said scorn in his voice what of it he knew me not first the widow kendall had doubted cicely sellis chastity now marlowe did the same shakespeare hadnt argued with his landlady he saw little point to correcting kit either instead he tried once more to make the other poet see sense you are no player here being none lie low lest you bring yourself to the notice of them whod lay you low an you wouldan you mustsee how the hand plays out but suffer it not to be played upon your person the counsel of a craven marlowe said i looked for better from you will you will throw your life away you madheaded ape tis pikestaff plain you care not a fig therefor well be it so but in your lunacy will you throw old england away with it whats old england to me or i to old england that i should weep for her marlowe seemed genuinely curious say you so shakespeare clapped a hand to his forehead you brought me to this game marblepated fiend and now it likes you not fie on you marlowe laughed as though i were a latin verb you misconstrue me for the game i care greatly tis the game lured me back from margate i will see it played an i may i will play it ay the games the thing but for england he snapped his fingers that for old england with a nod he ducked into the doorway of a tenement and disappeared shakespeare started to go after him then stopped muttering a curse what good would it do none less than none probably shakespeare didnt believe marlowe despised his country as he said he did he was all pose all outrageousness all shock but force him to it and he might decide he had to act on his pose better to leave him alone and hope he came to his senses on his own better he had not left them shakespeare thought but then use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping that cheery notion uppermost in his mind he trudged on down towards bishopsgate enrique stretched out an imploring hand to lope de vega senior lieutenant you must let me know when you are to play juan de idiaquez on the english stage baltasar guzmans man said i will come to see you though i still know less of the language than i should ill be glad to see you de vega said i fear it wont be long i fear the same every ship from spain brings worse word of his most catholic majesty enrique crossed himself so did lope for all he knew king philip might already have died strange to think he would be in his grave back in spain while here in england till news of his death arrived he still ruled a play could make something of those twists of time and knowledge lope thought he wondered how he might shape it god protect the new king when his day comes enrique said lope nodded yes god protect him indeed he and enrique shared a glance they both knew philip iii was not half was not a quarter of the man philip ii had been neither of them could say such a thing but saying and knowing were far from the same lope feared for spain in the reign of philip iis son he couldnt say that either he could pray hed done a lot of praying lately or he could try to put his worries out of his mind he bowed to enrique almost as respectfully as he would have to captain guzman then said hasta luego im off to bishopsgate enrique smiled good luck with your new lady friend senior lieutenant what a pity she is only a friend lope thought and then well if god is on my side i may yet make her more to enrique he said only thank you very much and hurried out of the barracks in the heart of london but his little chat with captain guzmans servant delayed him just enough so that as he was coming out he nearly bumped into walter strawberry who was coming in he couldnt escape the man no matter how much he wanted to with such grace as he could muster he smiled and said give you good day constable strawberry god give you good morrow as well lieutenant strawberry replied i have heard a thing passing strange strange as any i have seen the which methought i should bring to your honors orifice say on de vega urged hoping the englishman would come to the pointif he had a pointand let him get on his way up to see cicely sellis in his own fashion walter strawberry did dame tumor hath it sir that christopher marlowe otherwise styling himself one karl tuesday is returned to london and making himself unbeknownst hereabouts lope stared that was newsif true how know you this have you seen him as i told you not with mine own ears the constable answered but i have much attestation thereto from certain of them that share his advice his advice de vega frowned wondering what strawberry was trying to say suddenly a light dawned mean you i mean what i say and not a word of it strawberry declared he hath the advice of gomorrah wherefrom is he also tumorously said to suffer from the malediction which hight gomorrhea or peradventure from the french pox that held enough tangles to hide a swarm of foxes from the hounds but lope ruthlessly cut through them you have it from catamites and sodomites that marlowe is returned to london he didnt know whether marlowe was diseased nor much care that wasnt his worry not now and walter strawberry nodded said i not so one never knows lope murmured he clapped the english constable on the shoulder you have done me a service to bring this word hither believe you me sir if marlowe be in this city we shall run him to earth and now i pray you forgive for i must away he pushed past strawberry and out into st swithins lane but strawberry called after him he heard no more for he was hurrying up the street on his way to bishopsgate at last his rapier slapped against his thigh at every step his thoughts whirled how could marlowe have come back to london when hed gone to sea why would he have come back knowing marlowe fairly well lope made his own guess about that something was stirring and the englishman wanted to see it whatever it was marlowe could no more stay away from trouble than bees from flowering clover what sort of trouble de vega wondered one thing immediately sprang to mind treason this means more questions for shakespeare lope thought unhappily if i find him at the lodginghouse ill ask them now but the old woman who ran the place shook her head when he asked if shakespeare was there surely you must know sir he is gone up to the theatre for to earn the bite wherewith his rent my rentto pay she said nervously lope thought about going up to shoreditch straightaway but decided it would keep he had no proof shakespeare knew anything of marlowes return for that matter he had no proof marlowe had returned de vega hoped walter strawberry was wrong both for marlowes sake and because that would mean less trouble lay ahead when he knocked on cicely sellis door she opened it at once but when she saw him standing there she started a little or more than a little oh master lope i looked for another for christopher marlowe de vega rapped out suddenly suspicious of everyone around him but the cunning woman shook her head i know him not she said if she was acting she proved how fond and foolish englands ban on actresses was why are you come here to speak with thee lope said seizing the opportunity her mouth narrowed in exasperation come you in then she said but only for a moment mind though she must have heard him use the intimate pronoun she didnt follow suit as soon as lope stepped inside he realized shed been waiting for a client astrological symbols were scrawled on the wall in charcoal a circle inscribed on the rammedearth floor tall candles burned to either side of the circle within it mommet scratched behind one ear to rout out a flea then yawned at the spaniard showing needle teeth it was de vegas turn to say oh as light dawned and then youd tell a fortune he dropped thou himself ay and for a good price too of the which stand i in need cicely sellis said say what you would and then i pray you away the bird comes anon and you dont want a spaniard about to frighten him off whoever he is de vega thought well fair enough better trusting her intentions he sighed dramatically and tried again id speak to thee of love her smile showed more annoyance than amusement i tell you sir ive no time fort now speak me fair another day ant please you and who knows haply i will hear you haply he said less than delighted at the hedge but cicely sellis nodded haply she repeated her voice firm would you have me promise more than i may give by my troth id kiss thee with a most constant heart lope said she looked harassed the cat eerily reflecting her mood as it often did bared its teeth again after a moment though she said a bargain one kiss and then you go if there be more between us let it wait its proper occasion which this is not one kiss then lady and i am hence lope promised she nodded once more and stepped forward he took her in his arms having but the one chance he made the most of it clasping her to him so their bodies molded to each other her mouth was sweet and knowing against his the kiss went on and on at last though it had to end lopes arms still around her cicely sellis stroked his cheek but she said only one word farewell aii thoult tear out my heart like the savage men of new spain lope cried she only waited he thought about the risks of breaking a bargain with a brujathought about them and found them formidable though his lips still glowed from the touch of hers he bowed stiffly farewell he echoed and spinning on his heel strode out of her room and out of the lodginghouse storming away he almost ran intoalmost ran overanother man heading for the widow kendalls house a broadshouldered fellow with a smooth face and with hair cut short lope took a step past the man then froze remembering what walter strawberry had told him marlowe he said and his sword seemed to leap from its sheath into his hand christopher marlowe whirled he too wore a rapier it flashed free the fig of spain he shouted his obscene gesture matched the words put up lope said put up and give over youre caught even an you beat me youre known to be in london how can you hope to win free yield you now i will not marlowe sighed and shook his head base fortune now i see that in thy wheel there is a point to which when men aspire they tumble headlong down he seemed to speak more to himself than to de vega that point i touched and seeing there was no point to mount up higher why should i grieve at my declining fall with no more warning than that he thrust at lopes heart lope beat the blade aside his hand had more to do with his answering stroke than did his brain though perhaps he remembered his fight with don alejandro de recalde his point took marlowe not in the right eye but above it the english poet let out a shriek that faded almost at once to a rattling gurgle he fell down in the street dead as a stone a big roughlooking blond man wearing a disreputable cap smiled at lope showing a couple of missing teeth gramercy your honor he said and touched the brim of that cap you just saved me a bit o work that you did before the spaniard could ask him what he meant he hurried away another man said i shall fetch a constable hither he too hurried off yes do and yarely lope called after him an you come on a spanish patrol fetch them likewise he looked down at his rapier the last couple of inches of the blade had blood on them blood and christopher marlowes brains he stabbed the sword into the ground to clean it as he had after slaying don alejandro lope was still waiting by marlowes body for the constable and for his own countrymen when bells began to chime first at one church far away then at another and another and another till after no more than a minute or two the bronzen clangor filled all the streets of london what signifies that someone asked someone else shrugged but lope knew what it meant what it had to mean and ice and fire ran through him his most catholic majesty king philip ii of spain after so long dying at last was dead and lope de vega standing there bare blade in hand burst into tears like a little boy a dapper little gamecock of an officer rapped out a question in spanish shakespeare looked to lope de vega who translated it into english captain guzman would know why christopher marlowe was bound for your lodging when we chanced each upon the other i own i too am fain to know the same as am i shakespeare said if his voice trembled who could blame him the dons had come for him at dawn as he was about to leave the widow kendalls for the theatre and marched him here to their barracks instead if they misliked the answers he gave them he was assuredly a dead mannor was he all that would die he went on methought kit was fled abroad had anybody who could recognize marlowe seen him and shakespeare together if someone gave him the lie he refused to dwell on that if someone gave him the lie there the spaniards wouldnt merely question him they would put him to the question an altogether different and more painful business but all de vega said was plainly not you fools zany you stood close by him at cambyses and knew him not shakespeare thought captain guzman flung more spanish at him again lope de vega did the honors he asks how ist constable strawberry knew marlowe was returned to london whilst you remained deepsunk in ignorance damn constable strawberry but shakespeare knew he had to have a better answer than that he said belike the constable will have ears mongst the masculine whores ofs bailiwick knowing kits pleasures theyd learn he was in these parts or ever the generality heard it de vega spoke in excited spanish to his superior captain guzmans reply sounded anything but convinced lope spoke again even more passionately guzman answered with a shrug to shakespeare de vega said twas even so strawberry got wind oftthus he told me when i inquired of him well then shakespeare dared risk indignation this being so wherefore tax you me oer that which i wist not of after de vega rendered that into his own language baltasar guzman growled something that sounded angry thus saith my captain lope replied you standing on the edge of so many swamps of treason how do your feet stay dry i am no traitor shakespeare said as he had to were i such a caitiff rogue could i have writ king philip once more lope translated his words into spanish once more he did not presume to answer himself but waited for his superior to respond captain guzman spoke a curt sentence in spanish that is what we seek to learnif the worm of treason still begnaw your soul was how de vega put it in english still ist shakespeare knew he was fighting for his life and could concede his foes nothing my duty to your captain master lope and say this most precisely by this word he assumes me treacherous and proves himself no honest judge he must forthwith retract it as slanderous to my honor and how would captain guzman respond to that by letting him defend his honor with a sword if so he was a dead man he had no skill at swordplay whereas a spanish officer was all too likely to be a deadly man of his hands lope de vega had certainly shown himself to be such a man at any rate but guzman nodded and then bowed low he spoke in spanish you have reason quotha lope said naught against you is proved nor should he have spake as if it were he cries your pardon therefor shakespeare bowed in return he hadnt expected even so much the spaniard spoke again this time harshly naught against you is proved saith he but much suspected we will have answers from you i have given all i can shakespeare said and so shall i do ask what you would they pounded him with questions about marlowe about nick skeres about ingram frizer and about the late sir william cecil they had most of the pieces to the puzzle but did not know howor even ifthey fit together shakespeare told them as little as he could he admitted having heard marlowe and nicholas skeres knew each other that wouldnt hurt marlowe now and skeres remained safely out of the dons hands when shakespeare said he was thirsty they gave him strong sack to drink he wished hed kept his mouth shut the wine was liable to make him trip over his own tongue and fall to his doom but he could not refuse it not after hed complained he sipped carefully never taking too much after some endless while someone knocked on the door to captain guzmans office guzman snarled a spanish curse he pointed to the door lope de vega opened it in came a skinny pockmarked englishman wearing spectacles thomas phelippes shakespeare didnt know whether to rejoice or to despair the spaniards had not said a word about phelippes for good or ill did that mean the dusty little man had succeeded in covering his tracks or did it mean phelippes was their man a spy at the very heart of the plot whatever he was he spoke in spanish far too quick and fluent to give shakespeare any hope of following it before long baltasar guzman answered him sharply phelippes overrode the officer shakespeare caught the name of don diego flores de valdes the spanish commandant in england he caught the name yes but nothing that went with it captain guzman spoke again once again thomas phelippes talked him down guzman looked as if hed bitten into a lemon at last lope de vega returned to english don diego being satisfied you are a true and trusty man master shakespeare you are at liberty to get hence and to return to your enterprises theatrical after king philip be put before the general then we may delve further into such questions as remain gramercy shakespeare could honestly show relief here and gramercy to you as well master phelippes thank me not phelippes voice came blizzardcold tis my principals mercy upon you not mine own don diego hath a good and easy spirit mine is less yielding and i do wonder at his wisdom obey though i must get hence as saith master lope and thank god you have leave to go by my halidom and hope of salvation sir i do thank him shakespeare crossed himself for god shall be my hope my stay my guide and lantern to my feet he crossed himself phelippes and de vega also made the sign of the cross so did captain guzman when phelippes translated shakespeares words then guzman made a brusque gesture get out the poet had never been so glad as to obey outside the barracks the day was dark and cloudy with occasional cold nasty spatters of drizzle to shakespeare it seemed as glorious as the brightest warmest sunniest june hed never expected to see freedom again a spanish soldiera fierce little man who wore his scars like badges of honorcoming into the building growled something at him probably get out of the way shakespeare sprang to one side the soldier tramped past him without a backwards glance shakespeare hurried off towards the theatre what ist o clock he called to somebody coming the other way why just struck one the man answered nodding his thanks shakespeare trotted on the audience was filing into the wooden building in shoreditch when he got there one of the men at the cash box tried to take a penny from him nay tis master shakespeare another man said where were you master shakespeare you are much missed where in durance vile shakespeare replied but i am free and readymore than readyto give my lines with a good heart a cheer rose from the players when he rushed into the tiring room richard burbage bowed as low as if he were a duke will kemp sidled up to him and said we feared youd taen sick o the tisick that claimed geoff martin and matt quinn tisick the poet exclaimed you style it so certes kemp said innocently a surfeit of iron in the gullet wast not away away that was jack hungerford even kemp took the tireman seriously he slouched off hungerford said out of your clothes master will and into costume for the apparel oft proclaims the man have i time for the change shakespeare asked for he would appear in the second scene of thomas dekkers comedy you have sir an you use it stead of talking back hungerford said severely without another word shakespeare donned the silk and scarlet the tireman gave him not the smallest miracle of the day at least to him was that he did remember his lines he even got laughs for some of them when he came back on stage to take his bows after the play was done he felt as dizzy as if hed spent too long dancing round a maypole too much had happened too fast that day afterwards as he exchanged the gorgeous costume for his ordinary clothes burbage came up to him and said we did fear youd found misfortuneor misfortune had found you why so late de vega yesterday slew marlowe outside my lodginghouse shakespeare answered wearily a man need not see far into a millstone to wonder why kit was come thither the dons this morning gave me an escort of soldiery to their barracks that they might enquire into what matters he carried ins mind marry burbage muttered his proud fleshy face went pale and you said why that i knew not the which is only truth whose ears besides richard burbages were listening shakespeare let them hear nothing different from what hed told de vega and guzman he added by my troth i knew not that poor marlowe was returned to london nor i burbage agreed he too played for other earsshakespeare had told him marlowe was back liars both they smiled at each other when shakespeare got back to his lodginghouse after the performance the widow kendall gave him an even warmer welcome than his fellow players had oh master will i thought you sped she cried an the dons seize a man but seldom returneth he i am here i am hale shakespeare bowed as if to prove hed undergone no crippling torture twas but a misfortunate misunderstanding misunderstanding forsooth jane kendall exclaimed a misunderstanding like to prove your death she poked him with a pudgy forefinger and all centering on the accursed sodomite that marlowe the which mistress sellis spaniard did slay in the street like a curdog this day just past before shakespeare could answer the door to cicely sellis room opened out came the cunning woman with a plump worriedlooking englishman mommet wove around her ankles fear not sir and trust god she told her client he will provide may it be so my lady he said as if she were a noblewoman bobbing a nod to shakespeare and the widow kendall he hurried out into the gathering gloom after hed closed the door behind him cicely sellis said lieutenant de vega is not my spaniard mistress kendall and though hed fain make me his englishwoman i am not that neither jane kendall signed herself by my halidom mistress sellis ii meant no harm she stammered twas but aa manner of speaking she brightened yes thats ita manner of speaking ay belike the cunning womans words said she accepted that her tone said something else altogether but then as her cat went over to shakespeare and rubbed against his leg she gave him a smile full of what he thought to be unfeigned gladness like mistress kendall right pleased am i to see you here to see you well once more i do own i am right pleased once more to come hither shakespeare answered he wondered how cicely sellis could have known what he and their landlady were talking about she had after all been behind a closed door were her ears as keen as that shakespeare supposed it wasjustpossible he stooped to scratch the corner of mommets jaw the cat pushed its head into his hand and purred louder have a care cicely sellis said the game is not played out she sounded almost oracular as she had that one time in the parlor when she didnt recall what shed said after saying it i am but a player and somewhat of a poet shakespeare said id not play at subtle games he wondered if shed remark on the difference between would and will instead and to his relief she only nodded he ducked into his bedchamber got his writing tools and the new playhis own play he was working on and went off to the ordinary for supper will kate cried when he came through the door dearbeloved will the serving woman threw herself into his arms and kissed him did i know it roused such affections in thee id have the spaniards seize me every day shakespeare said that made a couple of men who were already eating chuckle it made kate pretend to box his ears after hed supped after hed written after the last of the other customers had left the ordinary she took him up to her cramped little room they both made love with something like desperation oh fond will whats to become of thee she said whats to become of us wanting to give her some soothing lie he found he couldnt i know not he said after a moment he added ere long though i shallwe shall one way or another he thought but did not say that he caressed her instead i fear for thee she whispered i fear for me he answered but i needs must go on this road hath no turning the which i could not use een an it had what meanst thou kate asked i will not tell thee lest i harm thee in the telling soon enough thoult know shakespeare got up and quickly dressed as he opened the door to go he added another handful of words come what may remember me he closed the door behind him when he got back to the lodginghouse he put a couple of chunks of wood on the fire to fight the night chill the widow kendall had gone to bed and couldnt scold him from the room where shakespeare would eventually sleep jack streets snores reverberated the poet waited till the fresh wood was burning brightly then sat down in front of the fire and got to work he wasnt unduly surprised to hear a door open a few minutes later or to see cicely sellisand mommetcome out into the parlor give you good even he said nodding to the cunning woman good den to you she answered and sat on a stool while the cat prowled the room do i disturb you by your being now and again by your being hereshakespeare gave her a wry smile and shook his headnay i am enough bemoiled in toils and coils to his voice trailed away hed already said as much as he could sayprobably too much cicely sellis gave him a grave nod as if she knew exactly what he was talking about perhaps she did for she said the matter of the dons and of master marlowe cut down like a dog in the street it did not sound like a question shakespeare eyed her how much had she heard from lope de vega whatever shed heard what did she think about it he desperately needed to know and dared not ask instead he sat silent waiting to hear what she said next her shrug was small and sad you misdoubt me so many on small acquaintance gladly entrust me with their all yet you misdoubt me alack the heavy day i may do only as i do shakespeare answered did i say more now he broke off sharply shaking his head that was too much too peradventure you are wiser than the many the cunning woman said and yet from her expression shed found out most of what she wanted to know shakespeare wondered how much his stumbles and sudden silences had told her she went on think what you will i mean you no harm nor england neither before he could find any sort of answer to that she clucked to mommet the cat came like a welltrained dog with a murmured good night she went back into her room shakespeare got very little work done after that when he walked into the theatre the next morning he found lieutenant de vega already there in earnest conversation with richard burbage burbage was bowing and nodding seeing shakespeare de vega bowed too be there proclamation made throughout the city he said that lord westmorlands men shall offer king philip on tuesday of the week following this now present the thirteenth day of october marking a month to the day of his most catholic majestys departure from this life for a better place the spaniard crossed himself shakespeare and burbage made haste to imitate him he went on so saith don diego flores de valdas commander of our spanish soldiers in england shall all be in readiness for the said performance ay master lope so long as you show forth juan de idiaquez as he should be seen shakespeare answered i already told you ay master de vega burbage said heavily that being so you need not seek the scribblers assurances besides mine own as head of the company he was of course quite right all the same the bold way he said it might have offended shakespeare not today his heart pounded at last the date was set without a word he bowed to burbage and to lope de vega for his life shakespeare could not have said which play lord westmorlands men put on that afternoon though he had a role in it he came back to himself on his way home from the theatre when a little hunchbacked beggar filthy and clad in rags came up to him and whined alms gentle sir gods mercy upon you for your grace to a poor hungry man instead of walking past him or sending him on his way with a curse shakespeare stopped and stared where he had not known the visage he recognized the voice there before him ingeniously disguised stood robert cecil lord burghleys son grinnedgrinned a little maniacally in factat the look on shakespeares face gathering himself the poet whispered what would you sir why a penny of your kindness robert cecil said and shakespeare did give him a coin under cover of capering with delight cecil went on also in a low voice you shall not give king philip come tuesday next but your boudicca if all follow well from that and other matters now in train england her liberty shall regain till the day be of good cheer and dread naught off he went begging from others in shoreditch high street shakespeare walked on towards the widow kendalls and his dread grew with every step he took seeing the bright sun that shone down on london on the appointed day lope de vega couldnt have been more delighted when his servant came into his inner chamber he beamed sunnily himself what a grand day diego it might be spring not autumn he said the heavens do all they can to make king philip well received si senor diego sounded altogether indifferent that english constable that strawberry is waiting outside he wants to talk with you about something today now oh for the love of god lope felt like tearing his hair i have no time to deal with him i need to go to the theatre to rehearse what can he want diego shrugged i dont know i dont speak english by all the saints neither does he lope calmed himself i cant escape him i see bring him in ill deal with him as fast as i can walter strawberrys solid bulk seemed to fill the little chamber to overflowing god give you good morrow sir he rumbled and to you as well constable de vega answered whats toward be quick if you can i must away to the theatre anon ay sir quick i am and quick ill be and being quick ill tell you somewhat or ever i die whenever lope listened to strawberry he felt himself going round in dizzying circles keeping a tight grip on his patience he nodded say on know you sir that master shakespeare hath taen to talking to buggers in the street buggers de vega scratched his head surely you are mistook christopher marlowe being dead the constable looked as bewildered as lope felt marlowe who said aught of marlowe i speak of buggers with palms for alms outstretched amongst the which is a little dancing crookbacked wight who bears a passing verisimilitude unto master robert cecil cecils was perhaps the only name that could have gained lopes complete and immediate attention say you so he murmured leaning towards strawberry say you so indeed be you certain of this i am walter strawberry nodded it hath been witnessed by witnesses thereto and likewise by those who have seen the same an it be not the same robert cecil he hath a twin unrecked though himself but the wreck of a man have you any other evidence past this which your witnesses er witnessed lope asked shakespeare denies all treasonous associations and assuredly in the favor of don diego flores de valdas stands high with reason he having writ a splendid yes a most splendid play on the life of his late most catholic majesty in which i shall have the honor of performing later this day all this being so you see i am not fain to seize him without strongest proofs ofs guilt what i have sir i have given you constable strawberry said tis my bounding duty and i have bounded hither for to do it damnation de vega muttered strawberry had brought him just enough to alarm him but not enough to let him act especially not after shakespeare had wriggled free of trouble after christopher marlowes return to london lope stroked his little chin beard as he thought suddenly he pointed at the constable have you searched his lodging if he have done treason he will have donet with his pen why else engage a poet a maker of plays in the enterprise have you then not having a warrant strawberry seemed genuinely shocked no sir i have not that were beyond my bounds altogether and beyond the bounds of any honest englishman a plague take all bounds youyou bounder lope burst out he stabbed a thumb at his own chest i am no englishman for which i thank god if i desire to search i may search i mayand by the blessed virgin i shall secure in the power the occupiers held he had no doubt of that whatever neither did constable strawberry you will do as you shall do i have not the right nor the writ he turned to go adieu be vigitant i beseech you vigitant or not lope hurried up to shakespeares lodginghouse the hour was still early enough to leave him content with the world and the way it shaped what do i do if i find proof here he asked himself the answer seemed clear enough i play in king philip then arrange for shakespeares arrest he sighed arresting the poet after hed written such a play seemed a pity but what choice was there none de vega could see he hoped shakespeare was already off to the theatre he would have a fight on his hands if he tried to search while the englishman was still there he touched the hilt of his sword he didnt want a reputation for killing playwrights but he would take that reputation if he had to when he got to the lodginghouse he found cicely sellis in the parlor saying farewell to an early client the man showered her with blessings as he left the cunning woman dropped de vega a curtsy god give you good day master lope she said why are you come here at such an hour in search of treason against his most catholic majesty the king of spain lope said harshly mommet had sprawled by the hearth at lopes tone the cat sprang to its feet its fur on end its tail puffed out like a bottle brush he ignored it asking is master shakespeare here or is he gone up to the theatre why he is more than an hour gone cicely sellis answered she cocked her head to one side and gave lope a slow half sad smile catalina ibaaez would have laid down her life to own a smile like that it left the spaniard weak in the knees the cunning woman added and here i hoped thou wert come to see me truly lope said cicely sellis didnt even nod just by standing there she let him know it was and could be nothing but the truth his pulse thudded whatever he did now no one would take anything of shakespeares from this place while he did it he had the time he was sure he had the time he made a low leg at her my lady i stand ever at thy service and he did stand too or part of him did come then she said and went back into her room mommet trotting at her heels lope followed eager as a green boy his first time he closed and barred the door behind him as at his last visit fat candles lit the closed room almost as bright as day mommet curled up in a corner yawned once and went to sleep cicely sellis sat down on the bed when lope would have joined her there she smiled again and saying anon anon waved him once more to the stool in front of it more than a bit sulkily he perched there thoudst not tease i trust he said the intimate pronoun was sweet in his mouth marry no she replied and yet never would a woman be taen for granted thus de vega was no green boy much experience told him she spoke the truth he dipped his head to her as thoudst have it so shall it be though i needs must say in delay there lies no plenty prithee bear with me she said we that are lovers run into strange capers before he could answer she reached up and drew something out from under her dress that sparkling glass pendant hed seen once before dangling on the end of its long chain she swung it back and forth back and forth lope thought it might have been a nervous habit for she hardly seemed to know she was doing it the pendant caught the candlelight and drew his eye to it as it swung he looked away now and again but his gaze kept coming back nay a woman mislikes ever being hurried ever being rushed ever being told to give and give forthwith for all that her words might have shown annoyance cicely sellis spoke in a soft calm smooth voice ist not sweeter when freely offered when tendered with full heart with glad heart with heart brimful of love than when rudely seized ere the time be ripe ere she be fully ready ere she would do that which in the fullness of time she assuredly will do assuredly lope echoed his voice abstracted hed only half noted her words his eyes kept following that sparkling pendant back and forth back and forth after a little while he wasnt sure he could have taken them away from it but he didnt want to so what difference did that make the cunning woman talked on as smoothly and quietly as before de vega could not have told what she said he noted her voice mostly as soothing background to the endless motion of the pendant back and forth back and forth watching it he felt almost as if he were falling asleep before too very long she asked dear lope hearest thou me ay the sound of his own voice left him dully surprised it might have come from far far away hearken well then for i speak truth she said he nodded in that moment he could not possibly have doubted it even as he nodded his eyes swung back and forth back and she went on master shakespeare hath done no treason hearest thou me i hear master shakespeare hath done no treason when she said it when he affirmed it it might have been carved in stone inside his mind he hath no papers treasonous here hence no need to search hearest thou me dear lope no papers treasonous no need to search when she said it when he said it it was so holy scripture could have been no truer for him nor hast thou need to seek him this day in the theatre for all will be well there the cunning woman murmured idiaquez lope began idiaquez glimmered in the glitter of glass and was gone no need to seek all will be well all will be well cicely sellis repeated she led him through her catechism twice more then as she stopped swinging the pendant and tucked it back into place she said in token thou hast heard me well when i bring my hands together thoult blow yon candleshe pointedand then become again thine own accustomed self hearest thou me ay blow out that candle lope said cicely sellis clapped her hands he blinked and laughed feeling as refreshed as if hed just got out of bed after a good nights sleep then laughing still he sprang off the stool and blew out one of the candles by the head of the bed why didst thou so she asked its light shone in mine eyes he answered one quick step brought him to her and now my sweet my love my life he took her in his arms she laughed down deep in her throat thine own accustomed self she said and it seemed to lope for a heartbeat that hed heard those words before but then his lips came down on hers and hers rose up to his and he cared not a fig for anything he might have heard xiii wheres de vega wheres the poxy spaniard wheres the don inside the theatre the questions tore at shakespeare again and again i know not before god i know not trying to escape them he fled from the stage back into the tiring room richard burbage pursued him relentless as fate personified see you not will we needs must know burbage said had he come hither wed have seized and bound him knocked him over the head and gone forward with good heart but where is he will he burst in the instant we are begun soldiers at his back crying hold what foul treason is this will he will i know not shakespeare said again desperate for the escape he knew he could not have he perched on a stool and hid his face in his hands he pressed the fleshy bases of his thumbs against his closed eyes till swirling flashes and sparkles of color lit the blackness that he saw better he should have covered his ears for burbage persisted were we not wiser were we not safer to give king philip and not the other play even now he would not name it we still can and right well you know it dick i know naughtnaught hear you shakespeare wanted to scream it instead it came out as not much more than a whisper there is no wisdom in me only a most plentiful lack of wit and i say further een with lope seized and bound i should not have gone forward with good heart for sure safety lurks nowhere in this tangled coil burbage grunted as if taking a blow in the belly shakespeare wondered why as far as he could tell hed spoken simple truth the only truth he knew voice a painfilled groan the player asked what to do then will what are we to do reluctantly shakespeare lowered his hands and looked up at him an you must think on somewhat think on this when they hang you for a traitor would you liefer hang as traitor to the king of spain or gainst old england id liefer not hang burbage said shakespeare laughed bitterly too late for already your complexion is most perfect gallowsas is mine own burbage glared at him damn you ay shakespeare nodded and so come then cullion burbage reached out and with frightening effortless strength hauled him off the stool and to his feet the player let him go then but he followed burbage back onto the stage hear me friends burbage boomed and his big voice filled the theatre from all over the building heads turned his way hear me he said again we give boudiccaand god help us every one he had better shakespeare thought will kemp gave burbage a mocking bow thou speakest well as always and how the hangman and the worms do love thee with a shrug burbage answered be it so then had i ordered king philip shown this day you might have said the same would you not sooner hang for an englishman shakespeare added his spirits beginning to revive now that the die was cast by way of reply kemp tugged at his codpiece tis better far to be well hung than well hanged go to shakespeare exclaimed as the company erupted in bawdy laughter after that the players went about their business with better hearts shakespeare had no doubt they still knew fearhe certainly did himselfbut they seemed more able to put it aside in a quiet moment he made a leg at will kemp the clown grabbed his crotch again groundlings began strolling into the open space surrounding the stage on three sides some of them waved to the players others to friends they recognized or to vendors already selling sausages and wine and roasted chestnuts folk more richly dressed took their places on benches in the galleries more vendors circulated there a gentleman in silk and velvet and lace his snowy ruff enormous and elaborately pleated passed through the growing crowd of groundlings to call to richard burbage how now im told you sell no places at the side of the stage bowing burbage nodded i cry your pardon sir but youre told true the spectacle we shall offer needs must be fully seen by all those places interfering with the view of the general we dispense with em today they shall again be sold come the morrow the gentleman still looked unhappy but burbages answer left him nothing upon which to seize he turned and went back towards the galleries burbage and shakespeare exchanged a look the players answer had been polite plausible and false the real reason the company was selling no seats on the stage was to keep aristocrats of spanish sentiment from drawing their swords and attacking the actors when boudicca went on in place of king philipwhich the signboards outside the theatre still announced shakespeare spied plenty of aristocrats in the galleries some few he knew to be of spanish sentiment about others who could say but even those englishmen who served the dons most heartily might do it for the sake of their own advantage rather than conviction if they saw the wind blowing in a new direction might they not shift with it they might the poet thought that had a corollary he wished he could ignore they might not too burbage waved the last few players out on stage strutting before the groundlings or chatting with them back into the tiring room shakespeare could smell the sharp stink of fright rising from many of them no doubt it rose from him as well burbage said be of good cheers lads speak the speech i pray you as you have learnt it let it come trippingly off the tongue and as you play bear one thought ever in your minds if all go well this day we are made men forevermore not one of us will lack for aught the rest of the days of his life he wanted the company to see the wind blowing in a new direction too by the way the players nodded they did but then will kemp stirred shakespeare could guess what he was going to sayif all went not so well the rest of the days of their lives would be few and filled with pain shakespeare caught the clowns eye and shook his head not now he mouthed kemp laughed and stuck out his tongue but he kept quiet somewhere in the distance hardly audible through the buzz of the crowd in the theatre a church bell chimed the hour two oclock richard burbage pointed to shakespeare will youll give the prologue no so much of shakespeare wanted to scream it but he couldnt not now he wondered what part of courage was no more than the urge not to look ridiculous in front of ones friends no small part if he was any judge he licked dry lips and nodded i will go then and god go with you burbage said something like quiet fell in the theatre as shakespeare slowly strode out towards the center of the stage he had never felt so alone he wished one of the trap doors through which ghosts appeared would open and swallow him up but no he was here what could he do but go on he stood still for a moment letting all eyes find him then into that nearquiet he said his most catholic majesty is dead meet that we here gather to mark his end i come to praise philip his tombs afar but his strong hand lies on us even yet as im but a scribbler this plays the thing wherewith to note the nature of the king imagine this stage britain long ago here comes boudicca to seek her vengeance gainst the romans who harshly cruelly whippd the queen of the iceni and ravishd both her young defenseless virgin daughters beginning with this struggle starting thence away to what may be digested in a play like or find fault do as your pleasures are now win or lose tis but the chance of war shakespeare withdrew to mostly puzzled silence punctuated by spatters of applauseno his prologue didnt match what the signboards outside promised as he withdrew he saw three or four men both from among the groundlings and in the galleries rapidly starting thence away no doubt they were off to sir edmund tilney of course the master of the revels had spies here to make sure the play presented matched the one advertised and approved but those spies wouldnt reach sir edmund not this afternoon shakespeare devoutly hoped they wouldnt anyhow jack hungerfords helpers the men who took the audiences money and a double handful of ruffians hired for the day were charged with letting no one leave the theatre till the play was done by then it would be too late for the dons shakespeare wondered or for us before he could fret any more out went a wordlessly chanting druid the boy actors playing boudicca and her daughters and richard burbage sword on his hip as caratach for better or worse it was begun no stopping now not till the end ye mighty gods of britain hear our prayers hear us you great revengers and this day take pity from our swords doubt from our valours said joe boardman who played boudicca he wasnt quite so good as tom would have been but he wasnt a catholic either excitement added life to his voice as he went on double the sad remembrance of our wrongs in every breast the vengeance due to rome make infinite and endless on our pikes this day pale terror sits horrors and ruins on our executions claps of thunder hang upon our armd carts and fore our troops despair and death shame past these attend em rise from the earth ye relics of the dead whose noble deeds our holy druids sing oh rise ye valiant bones let not base earth oppress your honours whilst the pride of rome treads on your stock and wipes out all your stories with a great waving of arms the hired man playing the druid responded thou great taranis whom we sacred priests armed with dreadful thunder place on high above the rest of the immortal gods send thy consuming fire and deadly bolts and shoot em home stick in each roman heart a fear fit for confusion blast their spirits dwell in em to destruction through their phalanx strike as thou strikst a tree shake their bodies make their strengths totter and topless fortunes unroot and reel to ruin epona boudiccas elder daughter took up the cry of condemnation against the roman occupiers o thou god thou feard god if ever to thy justice insulting wrongs and ravishments of women women sprung from thee their shame the sufferings of those that daily filld thy sacrifice with virgin incense have access hear me now snatch thy thunder up gainst these romans despisers of thy power of us defacers revenge thyself take to thy killing anger to make thy great work full thy justice done an utter rooting from this blessed isle of what rome is or has been the first murmurs rose from the crowd as people began to realize what sort of praise for king philip this was likely to be boudiccas younger daughter bonvica continued in the same vein saying see heaven o see thy showers stoln from thee our dishonours o sister our dishonours can ye be gods and these sins smotherd an attendant lit a fire on the altar before which the druid stood boudicca said it takes a good omen as caratach richard burbage took a step forward and drew his sword to pull everyones eye to himself his great voice would have done the same when he declared hear how i salute our dear british gods divine audate thou who holdst the reins of furious battle and disordered war and proudly rollst thy swarty chariot wheels over the heaps of wounds and carcasses give us this day good hearts good enemies good blows o both sides wounds that fear or flight can claim no share in steel us with angers and warlike struggles fit for thy viewing a wound is nothing be it neer so deep blood is the god of wars rich livery so let rome put on her best strength and britain thy little britain but great in fortune meet her as strong as she as proud as daring this day the roman gains no more ground here but what his body lies in now i am confident boudicca said they exited to the wailing of recorders but for that music vast silence filled the theatre as the players left the stage into that silence someone from the upper gallery yelled treason treason most foul you a scuffle broke out with a wild cry someone fell out of that gallery to land with a thud amongst the groundlings no one cried treason any more play on someone else shouted from that same gallery by god and st george play on a great burst of applause rang out awe prickled through shakespeare they do remember they are englishmen he thought on came the romans for the second scene of the first act when the audience took in their half spanish helms and corselets even the innocents and dullards whod missed the point of the play up till then suddenly grasped it and when one of those romans said and with our sunbright armour as we march well chase the stars from heaven and dim their eyes that stand and muse at our admired arms the hisses and catcalls that rose from all sides told just how admired spanish arms were back in the tiring room burbage said it doth take hold ay belike shakespeare dared a cautious nod it doth take hold here burbage amended what of the city beyond the theatre shakespeare could only shrug hoping robert cecil and his confederates had planned that as well as this burbage had no chance to stay and question him further he was on again in the next scene as it had in real life more than fifteen hundred years before the great rebellion of the iceni against tyrannical roman rule built on the stage a legionary officer cried on in despair the hills are wooded with their partizans and all the valleys overgrown with darts as moors are with rank rushes no ground left us to charge upon no room to strike say fortune and our endeavours bring us into em they are so infinite so everspringing we shall be killd with killing of desperate women neither fear nor shame eer found the devil hath ranked mongst em multitudes say men fail theyll poison us with their petticoats say they fail they have priests enough to pray us to nothing here destruction takes us takes us beaten in wants and mutinies ourselves but handfuls and to ourselves our own fears paint our doom a sudden and desperate execution how to save is loss wisdom dangerous swords pikes and halberds clashed against one another led by burbagecaratach playerbritons chased playerromans from the stage how the crowd roared and boudicca cried out too in exultation the hardy romanso ye gods of britain rust of arms the blushing shame of soldiers these men that conquer by inheritance the fortunemakers these the julians that with the sun measure the end of nature making the world one rome one caesar how they flee caesars soft soul dwells in em their bodies sweat sweet oils loves allurements not lusty arms dare they send these gainst us these roman girls is britain so wanton twice weve beat em caratach scattered em made themes for songs of shame and a woman a woman beat em coz a weak woman a woman beat these romans before richard burbage could deliver caratachs answering line someone said not too loudly one word elizabeth the name raced through the theatre excitement raced with it as if the mere mention of that name for ten years all but forbidden could remind everyone of what england had been before the spaniards cameand what she might be again shakespeare nodded to himself hed hoped for that to see what hed hoped come true what writer could ask for more and burbage as caratach let elizabeths name echo and reecho before saying so it seems a man a warrior would shame to talk so boudicca asked my valiant cousin is it foul to say what liberty and honour bid us do and what the gods let us no boudicca caratach shook his head so what we say exceed not what we do you call the romans fearful fleeing wights and roman girls the lees of tainted pleasures doth this become a doer are they such they are no more boudicca said do you dote upon em caratach shook his head again i love a foe i was born a soldier and he that in the head ons troop defies me bending my manly body with his sword i make a mistress yellowtressd hymen neer tied a longing virgin with more joy than i am married to the man that wounds me and are not all these romans ten battles i suckd these pale scars from and all roman ten years of cold nights and heavy marches when frozen storms sang through my iron cuirass and made it doubtful whether that or i were more stubborn metal have i wrought through and all to try these romans boudicca wouldnt listen to him of course there lay the tragedy in her overreaching herself in thinking she could drive the mighty roman empire from britains shores and do we likewise overreach ourselves with the spaniards shakespeare wondered he shivered an we do we die harder than ever the british queen dreamt of dying the play went on the romans hard pressed by the iceni went through agonies of hunger will kemps marcus did a clowns turn to make light of it he said all my cohort are now in love neer think of meat nor talk of what provender is hearty heighhoes are sallets fit for soldiers live by meat by larding up our bodies tis lewd lazy and shows us merely mortal it drives us to fight like camels with bags at our noses he capered comically before resuming weve falln in love we can whore well enough that the world knows fast us into famine yet we can crawl like crabs to our wenches fall in love now as we see example and follow it but with all our salt thoughts theres much bread saved and our hungers ended hands to his own large belly he left the stage shakespeare hurried up to him well played how not kemp said belike when im up on the gibbet the hangmanll give me the selfsame praise may you stand beside me to heart an you go to the gallows am i like to be elsewhere shakespeare asked an you go to the gallows i should like to be elsewhere the clown replied poenius the officer who would not send his legionaries to help suetonius cried out in despair as the britons advanced against his fellow romans see that huge battle coming from the hills their gilt coats shine like dragons scales their march like a tumbling storm see them and view em and then see rome no more say they fail look look where the armd carts stand a new army death rides in triumph drusus destruction whips his fiery horse and round about him his many thousand ways to let out souls huge claps of thunder plow the ground before em till the end ill dream what mighty rome was still more combat crowded the stage now instead of iceni routing romans the romans reviving routed in their turn the britons the groundlingsyes and the galleries toowailed in dismay as boudicca and her daughters and caratach mured themselves up in a last fortress to stand remorseless relentless roman siege poenius fell on his sword for shame in the fort boudicca raged against the soldiers who had failed her shrieking shame wherefore flew ye unlucky britons will ye creep into your mothers wombs again hares fearful doves in your angers fail me leave your queen desolate her hopeless girls to roman rape and rage once more cowards shame treads upon your heels all is lost hark hark how the cursed romans ring our knells from the balcony above the tiring room which did duty for the battlements of the fort epona spoke to the roman general suetonius hear me mark me well and look upon me directly in my face my womans face whose sole beauty is the hate it bears you see if one fear one shadow of terror one paleness dare appear apart from rage to lay hold on your mercy no you fool damned fool we were not born for your triumph to follow your gay sports and fill your slaves with hoots and acclamations you shall see in spite of all your eagles wings well work a pitch above you and from our height well stoop fearless of your bloody talons she cast herself down to death when shakespeare heard groans when he heard women weepyes and some men toohe knew that regardless of what happened outside the theatre hed done all he could in here meanwhile among the romans who besieged the britons stronghold will kemps marcus declared love no more great ladies is what i say no going wrong then for they hold no sport alls in the rustling of their snatchdup silks theyre made but for handsome view not handling their bodies of so weak and soft a temper a roughpacd bedll shake em all to pieces no give me a thing i may crush he illustrated with great lascivious gestures the crowd which had mourned the death of poor ravished epona now laughed lewdly at a soldier relishing more rape but a moment later the groundlings cheered when caratach and a last host of iceni sallied caratach cut down marcusand richard burbage likely enjoyed killing kemp if only in the play after that victory caratach said my hope got through fire through stubborn breaches through battles that were hard to win as heaven through death himself in all his horrid trims is gone forever ever now my friends ill not be left to scornful tales and laughter he threw himself at the romans surrounding suetonius and died fighting inside the fortress of the iceni hope died too as the romans below besieged them boudicca and bonvica stood on the battlement where epona had killed herself bonvica asked where must we go when we are dead strange question boudicca told her younger daughter why to the blessed place dear eversweetness and happiness dwells there will you come to me yes my sweet girl boudicca answered no romans i should be loath to meet them there no ill men boudicca promised that live by violence and strong oppression are there tis for those the gods love good men dearest mother then let us make an end bonvica said have you that dram from the kindly druid they drank poison together bonvica died at once boudicca whod let her daughter have the greater share to be sure of death lasted till the romans led by suetonius burst into the fortress and up onto the battlement you fool she told the general you should have tied up death when you conquerd you sweat for me in vain else see him here hes mine and my friend laughs at your pities and i will be a prophet ere i die look forward now a thousand years and more a royal infant heaven shall move about her though in her cradle yet doth promise upon this land a thousand thousand blessings which time shall bring to ripeness she shall be though none now living will behold that goodness a pattern to all princes living with her and all that shall succeed sheba was never more covetous of wisdom and fair virtue than this pure soul shall be all princely graces with all the virtues that attend the good shall still be doubled on her truth shall nurse her she shall be lovd and feard her own shall bless her her foes shake like a field of beaten corn in her days every man shall eat in safety her honour and the greatness of her name shall grow and make new nations she shall flourish in all the plains about her our childrens children shall see this and bless heaven thou speakest wonders suetonius said awe in his voice she will be your true and natural queen bred born and brought up amongst you so will you most naturally like british men defend her fight for her and not only guard her with danger of your lives but also aid her with your hands and livings you will fight for your country your dearest country wherein you shall be nourished it will be your native soil and therefore most sweet for what may be more belovd than your country dying boudicca managed a feeble nod and sent her last words out to a breathlessly silent theatre een so tis true oh i feel the poison we britons never did nor never shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror but when we do first help to wound ourselves come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them naught shall make us rue if britons to themselves do rest but true she fell back and lay dead shakespeare strode forward to the very front edge of the stage into more silence punctuated only by sobs he said no epilogue here unless you make it if you want your freedom go and take it he stood there waiting for perhaps half a dozen heartbeats this was even harder than when hed spoken the prologue if hed failed here suddenly without warning silence shatterednot into applause but into a great roar of rage at all that england had endured in the ten years since the spaniards came and forced isabella and albert onto the english throne had shakespeare been the foreign queen or king that roar would have made him tremble being who he was he stared out in wonder at the audience everything theyd held in for these ten long years now loosed itself at once crying spaniards dogs and other things far worse the groundlings turned on a handful of their own number known to like the invaders too well up in the galleries several real fights broke outmore of the upper classes those who could afford such places favored the spaniards and isabella and albert more struggling men and a couple of shrilly shrieking women too fell or were flung down amongst the groundlings their hurtling bodies sent the folk below sprawling and must have badly hurt some the groundlings punched and pummeled and kickedand no doubt robbedthe richer folk whod literally fallen into their hands they assumed anyone who was cast down loved the dons shakespeare wondered if they were right in the middle gallery the fanciest in the theatre an aristocrat in a fine doublet of glowing white silk made his voice rise above the din to the tower to the tower to free the queen he was a handsome man a few years younger than shakespeare with dark hair a sandy beard scanty on the cheeks but long on the chin and cut square at the bottom and red red lips to the tower and i will lead you as if on cue a sunbeam gleamed from the rapier he brandished to the tower to the tower to free the queen one man with firm purpose was plenty to fire all the others when the aristocrat descended the groundlings swarmed up to him and raised him on their shoulders whos yon gentry cove shakespeare asked the players on the stage behind him theyd come out to take their bows but the crowd full of a greater passion had all but forgotten them why know you not sir robert devereux richard burbage sounded surprised shakespeare only shrugged hed never worried much about recognizing aristocrats by sight he left that to burbage a socially more ambitious manindeed a climber if ever there was one and then edward the tiremans assistant now a budding actor who still wore his roman helmet and corselet raised his sword as devereux had done to the tower he cried to the tower to free the queen he ran past shakespeare jumped down off the stage and joined the roaring throng pouring out of the theatre eight or ten young players some whod portrayed romans and others iceni followed him allies now against the spaniards to the tower they shouted one after another the youth whod played epona threw down his wig and rushed after them still in a womans shift and then to shakespeares amazement and dismay burbage and will kemp tramped forward together both of them plainly intent on marching on the tower of london too shakespeare seized burbages arm hold dick he said urgently let not this wild madness infect your wit can a swarm of rude mechanicals pull down those gray stone walls the soldiers on emll work a fearful slaughter throw not your life away before burbage could answer will kemp did the soldiery on the walls may work a fearful slaughter ay an they have the stomach fort but think you twill be so a plot that stretcheth to the theatre surely shall not fall short of the tower shakespeare pondered that of course william cecils plansrobert cecils nowwent far beyond this production of boudicca the poet had seen that from the beginning hed seen it but he hadnt seen all of what it meant here kemp certainly saw more than he had burbage added having come so far will would you not watch what your words have wrought thus spake kit marlowe ofs return to london shakespeare said and much joy he had oft but burbage and kemp both jumped down onto the hardpacked dirt where the groundlings stood once more shakespeare discovered the desire not to seem a coward to his friends could push him forward where fear of death would have held him back cursing under his breath damning himself for a suicide and a fool he sprang down too another stageroman landed beside him and offered him a knife saying i can well spare it for i have me also this fine long sword my thanks shakespeare said what good the dagger would do against the arquebuses and cannon of the garrison in the tower he couldnt imagine having it somehow gave comfort even so only one narrow doorway led into and out of the theatre the better to keep cheats from sneaking in without paying the crowd took some little while to filter out through it shakespeare wondered whether the delay would stifle spirits but no shouts of to the tower and to free the queen and god bless good queen bess doubled and redoubled when at last shakespeare escaped the building he saw several thick columns of black smoke rising from different parts of london through the din and gabble around him the distant crackle of arquebuses and pistols going off and the deeper slower boom of cannon fire came to his ears the city was already rising against the occupiers said i not so will kemp bawled in his ear you did and you had the right of it shakespeare gave credit where it was due admitting what he could hardly deny roaring down towards bishopsgate the crowd from the theatre cried elizabeths name again and again ever louder ever more fiercely they called down curses on the heads of philip ii philip iii and every spaniard ever born they cursed isabella and albert too and every now and again one of them would bawl out a line or two from boudicca pride flowered in shakespeares breast i am father to this he thought not the sole father but father nonetheless they hadnt come far into the rickety clutter of tenements and shops and dives of bishopsgate ward without the wall when a constablenot walter strawberry but a younger thinner man with a redblond beardstepped into the middle of the street held up a hand and shouted stand there stand i say what means this unseemly brabble they showed him someone at the head of the baying pack stooped picked up a stone and flung it it caught the constable in the face shakespeare taller than most saw blood spurt as the constables nose smashed to ruin with a moan the man clutched at himself and sank to his knees the pack rolled over him punching kicking stomping stabbing by the time shakespeare went past the constable was hardly more than a red smear trampled into the stinking muck the poets stomach lurched he stumbled on fighting not to spew up his guts and i am father to that he told himself wishing he could find a sweet soothing lie instead not the sole father but father nonetheless people stared from windows and doorways even here murder was seldom done so openly even here curses were seldom cried so loud or from so many throats at once and if anything could draw shopkeepers and laborers robbers and thieves barmaids and trulls open murder and loud curses seemed the proper lodestones the crowd swelled as if by magic every step closer to bishopsgate raised more alarm in shakespeare the spaniards and wild irishmen standing guard at the gate would not let themselves be taken unawares as the luckless constable had done had he a wife children hed come home to them no more if they had time they would close the gates against this storm even if they didnt theyd surely stand and fight daylight was fading the sun sinking down through smoke towards westminster more than enough light remained though to show that bishopsgate stood open cheers rose from countless throats cheers and a renewed cry to the tower on to the tower blood splashed the gray stone walls of the gateway one spanish boot lay crumpled close by those were the only signs shakespeare saw that soldiers had ever stood here were they dead fled some dead assuredly he thought eyeing the bloodstains and that boot and wondering what had befallen the man whod worn it on to the tower to the tower to free elizabeth to free the queen those savage shouts grew louder as the crowd from the theatreand from the tenements beyond the wallsswarmed into london like a conquering army but how much like a conquering army shakespeare wondered and then wished he hadnt they werent the only swarm loose in the city more cries and curses rose some single spies some in battalions madness was loosed here maybe robert cecil had worked better than even he knew a don a don a new shout went up so might hunters have cried a fox a fox shakespeare got a glimpse of the spaniard saw horrified amazement spread across his face saw him turn and start to run and saw an englishman tackle him from behind as if in a shrove tuesday football match the spaniard went down with a wail he never got up again if the spaniards could have put a line of arquebusiers in front of the rampaging crowd from the theatre and poured a couple of volleys into it it would have melted away shakespeare was sure of that a line of armored pikemen might have halted it too even as things were groundlings and folk from the tenementssome still yelling about freeing elizabethbroke away to plunder shops that tempted them but no line of ferocious leanfaced swarthy spaniards appeared shouts and cries and the harsh snarl of gunfire suggested the dons were busy desperately busy elsewhere in london when chance swept shakespeare and richard burbage together for a moment the player said belike theyll make a stand at the tower likely so shakespeare agreed unhappily those frowning walls had been made to hold back an army and this thing he was a part of was anything but up tower hill where hed watched the auto de fe almost a year before a great roar a roar full of triumph rose from the men in front of him as they passed the crest of the hill and swept on towards the tower ditch and the walls beyond and when shakespeare crested the hill himself he looked ahead and he roared too in joy and amazement and suddenly flaring hope will kemp had been right right and more than right all the gates to the tower of london stood open after tenderly kissing cicely sellis goodbye lope de vega stopped in a nearby ordinary for his dinner and a cup of wine with which to celebrate his conquest the cup of wine became two then three and then four a conquest like that deserved a good deal of celebrating by the time he started off towards the spanish barracks the clock had already struck one that didnt worry him as far as he could remember he had nowhere else he needed to be as far as he could remember others though might remember further hed just turned into st swithins lane when a startled shout came from up ahead lieutenant de vega madre de dios senor what are you doing here at this hour oh hello enrique lope said im coming back to the barracks of course what else should i be doing now he meant it for a joke but captain guzmans servant stared at him and answered what else should you be doing seaor arent you going to play shouldnt you be playing don juan de idiquez in shakespeares king philip less than half an hour from now i was going up to the theatre to see you by god and all the saints sir i never expected to find you here don juan de idiquez lope gaped he said the name as if hed never heard it before in his life indeed for a moment that seemed to be true but then it was as if a veil were torn from in front of his eyes memory real memory came flooding back memory of why he should have been at the theatre and memory of why hed gone to cicely sellis lodginghouseto shakespeares lodginghouse in the first place he crossed himself not once but again and again at the same time he cursed as foully as he knew howmagnificent rolling guttural obscenity that left enriques eyes wider than ever and his mouth hanging open de vega didnt care he wanted a bath though even that might not make him feel clean again he wondered if anything would ever make him feel clean again that bruja that whoreshe bewitched me enrique she bewitched me and she swived me and she sent me on my way like a like a like an i dont know what and that means that has to mean i dont understand senor enrique broke in i dont understand any of this do you understand treason do you understand black vile filthy treason and treason coming soonsoon by god or she never would have de vega didnt waste time finishing he whirled and started back up st swithins lane where are you going enrique cried after him first to kill that puta lope snarled and then to the theatre to do all i can to stop whatever madness theyre hatching there even in his rage he realized he might notprobably would notbe able to manage that by himself he stabbed out a finger towards enrique as for you go back to captain guzman tell him to send a troop of men up to the theatre as quick as he can tell him its bad very bad as bad as can be run damn you enrique fled as if ten million demons from hell bayed at his heels lope started up towards bishopsgate at a fast purposeful stride halfway between a walk and a trot black fury filled him hed never imagined a woman could use him so mercenaries like catalina ibaaez he understood but what cicely sellis had done to him was ten a hundred a thousand times worse not only had she stolen a piece of him shed taken her pleasure with him afterwards to waste more of his time and to make sure he didnt get that piece back and i wouldnt have either if i hadnt run into enrique he thought savagely but i am myself again and shell pay oh how shell pay his hand closed hungrily on the hilt of his rapier hed just turned onto lombard street and passed the church of st mary woolnoth when he spied a spanish patrol ahead of him you men he called and gave them a peremptory wave come with me their sergeant recognized him what do you want with us lieutenant de vega we have places we need to check and were running late lope set his hands on his hips and i have a bruja to catch and treason to put down he rapped out which carries the greater weight gulping the sergeant stiffened to attention i am your servant senor youd better be come on and my god come with us the bells of st mary woolnoth rang out two oclock all across london dozens hundreds of church bells chimed the hour de vega cursed he should have been up at the theatre lord westmorlands men should be presenting king philip were they if they werent what were they giving instead he didnt know he couldnt know but he could guess and all his guesses sent ice racing along his spine and then all at once he had more things to worry about than lord westmorlands men someone on a rooftop flung a stone or a brick at the patrol it clanged off a soldiers morion the man staggered but stayed on his feet you all right ignacio the sergeant asked yes thanks be to godive got a hard head the soldier replied but wheres the cowardly son of a whore who threw that ill murder the bastard before the sergeant could answer a chamber pot sailed out of a secondstory windownot just the stinking contents but the pot too it shattered between two spaniards spattering the whole patrol with filth and then while they were still cursing that a pistol banged with a howl of pain a soldier slumped to the ground clutching his leg crimson blood streamed out between his fingers high and shrill and blazing with excitement a voice cried out in english death to the dons and as if that one voice were a burning fuse leading to a keg of powder a whole great chorus took up the shout deathdeathdeath to the dons in a heartbeat the cry echoed up and down the streets of london deathdeathdeath to the dons lopes mind went clear and cold as the ice hed imagined he felt suddenly the patrol that had seemed so reassuringly strong felt tiny and helpless as a baby he nodded to the sergeant this is it they are going to rise his own voice held eerie certainty the sergeant tried to peer up at all the windows overlooking the street smoke still eddied in front of one the shot had come from there but what odds the pistoleer still lingered slim slim he didnt order his men after the assassin as he would have without that daunting cry instead nodding to lope he asked and what do we do now senor we win or we dieits that simple de vega answered but it wasnt quite he looked around too as the sergeant had trying to see every which way at once plainly the patrol would never get to the theatre nor even to bishopsgate he wished that soldier hadnt been wounded he couldnt bear to leave the fellow behind but bringing him along would hamper them wed better get back to the barracks he said reluctantly well have numbers on our side there yes sir the sergeant sounded relieved now that he had orders he knew what to do with them josa manuel bandage pedros leg and get him up with his arms over your shoulders both soldiers knelt to do as he told them but one said we cant do much fighting that way sergeant well worry about that later quick now to punctuate the underofficers words another stone thudded down into the street it hit no one but could have smashed a skull if it had seeing it hearing it made lope acutely aware he wore a felt hat with a jaunty plume not a highcombed morion pedro howled again when they hauled him upright and the sergeant proved cleverer than de vega had suspected one of the soldiers supporting the wounded man was lefthanded so they both had their swords free even with his arms draped over them lets get moving lope said and they started back the way they had come deathdeathdeath to the dons the cry seemed to come from everywhere at once from near and far more stones and more reeking waste flew out of windows a furious trooper fired his arquebus at one of their tormentors but only a mocking laugh rewarded him and then the patrol had to pause while he reloaded an empty arquebus was nothing but an awkward club lope hated every heartbeat of delay how long before the englishmen nerved themselves to fight in the streets if they werent already elsewhere in london how long before weapons long hoarded in hope came out of hiding not long he feared and he didnt have enough men at his back half a dozen englishmen a couple armed with swords the rest with bludgeons came out of st mary woolnoth and formed a ragged line across lombard streetwhat do we do senor the sergeant muttered we fight if we have to but let me try something first lope answered in a low voice then in english he shouted stand aside in the name of the queen he hissed out a great sigh of relief when they did stand aside one of them doffed his cap and made a clumsy leg at de vega saying we cry your pardon sir but we took ye for a pack of stinking spaniards god bless elizabeth another englishman added they all nodded so did lope he led the patrol past them without another word if he spoke too much his accent would betray him and betrayal enough was already loose in london this day if they dared speak imprisoned elizabeths name if they believed he leading soldiers also spoke of elizabeth and not isabella if that was so treason ran far deeper than even de vega had dreamt behind him one of the englishmen said come lets to the tower and help to set her free their departing footsteps were quick and purposeful they thought they could do it whether they proved right or wrong their confidence chilled lope sergeant he said sharply si senor who garrisons the tower of london we or the english why some of each sir we both want to make sure elizabeth the heretic stays there till she dies eh the sergeant hadnt understood any of what lope or the street ruffians said in english de vegas dread only grew in times like these how far could any spaniard trust an englishman as he and the patrol turned down into st swithins lane a sharp volley of gunfire came from the south from the direction of the barracks he wanted to order a charge with the wounded soldier slowing everyone else and hampering two healthy men he couldnt englishmen swarmed up the street towards them they were fleeing not fighting no cries of death to the dons burst from their throats theyd met death and didnt like him when one of them spied de vega and his comrades he cried heres more o the foul fiends we are fordone but he and his friends pounded past before lope and his little force could hope to halt them bodies lay in the lane some unmoving some thrashing in pain spanish soldiers moved among them methodically putting to the sword any who still lived more spaniards pikemen and arquebusiers formed a line of battle in front of the barracks one of the soldiers with sword in hand looked up from his grim work and growled who the devil are you as lope led the patrol towards him senior lieutenant de vega lope answered the other spaniards face changed oh youre the fellow who knew this mess was coming pass on seaorpass on if we hadnt had a few minutes warning of trouble those damned englishmen mightve taken us unawares de vega is that you from one end of the line of battle captain guzman waved yes your excellency lope waved back god be praised youre all right guzman said when enrique came running back here with your report i feared wed never see you again i was about to go after you to the theatre when we were attacked ourselves never mind the theatre or me even lope far from the least selfcentered man ever born knew some things were more important than he was the english are going to try to free elizabeth from the tower if they do always the courtier guzman bowed to him i am the senior officer present right now i was going to hold the barracks against whatever they threw at us now youve given me something more urgent to do muchas gracias he shouted orders more spanish soldiers came tumbling out of the building and rushed up from the south a few hundred all told lope judged guzman said form a column boys we have to get to the tower and its liable to be warm work are you up to it yes sir the soldiers roared by the way they sounded no englishman could stop them or even slow them down baltasar guzman bowed again may we have the pleasure of your company senior lieutenant de vega of course your excellency but i have a wounded man here and leave him guzmans voice was hard and flat we cant bring him and we cant spare men to guard him im sorry but thats how it is will you tell me im wrong he waited for lopes reply lope had none and he knew it at his nod jose and manuel eased pedro to the ground what is he thinking lope wondered he shook his head better not to know captain guzman raised his voice to the tower fast as we can go for god and st james forward march for god and st james the soldiers shouted off they went a ragged regiment against a city to see them strut the city was the outnumbered one perhaps half a mile separated the barracks from the tower of london moving as fast as they could the soldiers might have got there in five minutes they might have had nobody between the one and the other had other ideas guzman marched the spaniards towards the river to upper thames street which became lower thames street east of london bridge and which led straight to the tower that the street close by the thames led straight to the tower though quickly proved to have been obvious to others besides him no sooner had his men turned into thames street and started east than bricks and stones flew down from rooftops and windows not the handful of them that had greeted lopes patrol in lombard street but a regular fusillade the missiles clattered from helmets and corselets men cursed or howled when stones struck home where they werent armored a soldier who got hit in the face crumpled without a sound a moment later another went down what do we do captain a trooper cried we go on guzman answered grimly if we stop and kill englishmen here we have great sport but we dont get where we need to go on time forward lope admired the noblemans discipline had he himself commanded the spaniards he knew he might have yielded to the sweet seduction of revenge against the cowards and skulkers who plagued them guzman had better sense just past the church of all hallows the less a barricade blocked thames street planks and carts and rubbish and rocks and dirt the englishmen behind it brandished a motley assortment of halberds and bills and pikes and swords two or three arquebus muzzles poked over the top aimed straight at the oncoming spanish soldiers death to the dons the englishmen shouted captain guzmans lips drew back from his teeth in a savage smile now we can come to close quarters with some of these motherless dogs he said give them a volley boys and then show them what a proper charge means the front rank of arquebusiers dropped to one knee the second rank aimed their guns over the heads of the first on the other side of the barrier the englishmen fired their few guns flames belched from the muzzles a bullet cracked past lope and smacked wetly into flesh behind him a soldier shrieked puffs of thick gray smoke clouded the barricade then captain guzman yelled fire the end of the world might have visited upper thames street the roar of twentyfive or thirty arquebuses was a palpable blow against the ears more smoke billowed its brimstone stink and taste put lope in mind of the hell to which he hoped the volley had sent a good many englishmen screams from in back of the barricade said some of those bullets had struck home baltasar guzman gave another order charge st james and at them asantiago the spaniards cried swordsmen and pikemen swarmed past the arquebusiers towards the barrier blocking their way they scrambled over it and tore openings in it with their hands the english irregulars behind the barricade chopped and hacked at them trying to hold them back a pistol banged then another the irregulars yelled as loudly for st george as guzmans men did for st james as the englishmen held them up at the barricade more bricks and stones rained down on the spaniards from the buildings on either side of thames street the pikeman next to de vega dropped his weapon and staggered back his face a gory mask but even with the help of the barrier the english couldnt stop guzmans men for long lope sprang up onto a cart and then leaped down on the far side of the barricade a halberdier tried to hold him off he rushed forward and ran the englishman through in the press a polearm was too clumsy to do much good after the irregulars lost the barricade the ones still on their feet tried to flee the spaniards cut and shot them down forward captain guzman shouted again and forward his men went the bulk of london bridge loomed to lopes right but before he and his comrades got even as far as the bridge another barricade loomed ahead this one looked more solid than the one theyd just overwhelmed and from the east englishmen rushed to defend it sunlight glinted off armor over there de vega cursed at least some english soldiers who had served isabella and albert were now on the other side the side of rebellion arquebuses and pistols bellowed more than had defended the first barricade a spaniard near lope whod turned his head at just the wrong instant staggered back half his jaw shot away blood fountained his tongue flapped among shattered teeth horrid anguished gobbling noises poured from that ruin of a mouth a volley captain guzman commanded but in the disorder after the first fight and pursuit the volley took longer to organize meanwhile those english guns kept banging away at the spanish soldiers in the street in front of them indifferent to the enemy fire the arquebusiers elbowed their way forward and into position some kneeling others standing they might have been one man pulling the trigger de vega wondered if he would have any hearing left at the end of the day crying asantiago the spaniards rushed at the second barricade the fight at the first barrier had been savage but brief the english hadnt had enough men there to hold the position long things were different here real soldiers with corselets and helmets of their own were far harder to down than irregulars had been they wielded pike and sword with the same professional skill as lope and his countrymen and the irregulars who battled alongside them seemed altogether indifferent to whether they lived or died if one of them could tackle a spaniard so another could stab him while he was down he would die not only content but joyous as before the english had set up the barricade between tall buildings stones and bricks and saucepans and stoolsanything heavy and small enough to go out a windowrained down on the spaniards pistoleers fired from upperstory windows too lope grabbed a morion someone had lost and jammed it onto his head it was too big it almost came down over his eyes he didnt care it was better than nothing he pushed his way forward trying to get to the barricade a wounded spaniard clutching at the spurting stumps of two missing fingers stumbled back past him out of the fight he slid forward into the place the other man had vacated and found himself next to captain guzman ah de vega guzman said as if they held wine goblets rather than rapiers can we get to the tower lope asked i hope so guzman answered calmly how many more barricades in front of us lope went on the captain only shrugged as if to say it didnt matter but it did especially if every one of them was held this stubbornly lope persisted should we try some different street to get there this is the shortest way guzman said he was right in terms of distance in terms of time in terms of effort and lives lost i beg pardon your excellency lope said but how much good will we do if we get there tomorrow with three men still standing i command here and i must do as i think best captain guzman replied if i go down and you take charge you will do what you will do and the result will be as god wills in the meantime we have a job to tend to here in front of us lope found no answer to that but pushing forward once more a dead spaniard lay just in front of the barricade lope scrambled up onto his corpse a man behind him shoved him onto a dirtfilled barrel blocking the street an englishman thrust at him he beat the spearhead aside with his blade a pistol ball whined malevolently past his ear if i stay up here ill surely die he thought he couldnt go back either shouting asantiago at the top of his lungs he leaped down on the far side of the barricade an englishman partly broke his fall he rammed his sword into the mans chest it grated on ribs the irregular let out a bubbling shriek and crumpled blood pouring from his mouth and nose lope had a bad moment when he couldnt clear the blade but then all at once it came free crimson almost to the hilt a santiago he yelled again and slashed wildly trying to win himself a little room trying most of all not to be killed in the next instant he wasnt the first spaniard down on this side of the barricade a couple of soldiers were down indeed and wouldnt rise again till judgment day but others like him cut and thrust and cursed and fought to clear space for their fellows to follow them an arquebusa spanish arquebuswent off right behind him from atop the barricade that bullet almost killed him too instead it smashed the left shoulder of the englishman with whom he was trading swordstrokes as the man yowled in pain lope thrust him through the throat and stepped forward over his writhing body here though more and more foes rushed into the fray shouting death to the dons and elizabeth and god and st george most of them were unarmored many of them were unskilled but their ferocity having sown the wind with ten years of harsh occupation the spaniards now all at once reaped the whirlwind if the englishmen could stop them from reaching the tower only by piling up a new barricade of their own dead flesh they seemed willingeven gladto do it a stone luckily a small one clattered off lopes snatchedup helmet he stumbled but kept his feet to go down here was all too likely to die he howled an oath when a knife slashed his left arm his own backhand cut as much instinct as anything else laid open the face of the burly man whod wounded him opening and closing his left hand several times lope found muscles and tendons still worked he laughed much he could have done about it if they hadnt he couldnt even bandage himself he had to hope he wouldnt bleed too badly the spaniards would gain a step lose half of it gain two lose one gain one lose it again then a dozen or so arquebusiers got up onto the barricade together and poured a volley into the englishagain a ball just missed de vega as wounded enemies toppled spanish soldiers pushed past them a sergeant tugged at lopes wounded arm he shrieked sorry seaor the sergeant bawled in his ear the fellow was also wounded hed had his morion knocked off and sported a nasty cut on his scalp gore splashed his face and his backandbreast what are your orders my orders lope shouted back where the devils captain guzman down sira thrust through the thigh the underofficer answered de vega grimaced a wound like that could easily kill the sergeant went on what now sir weve got more of these fornicating englishmen coming up behind us now and more and more on the rooftops too what do we do what can we do he sounded frightened for the whole spanish force till then lope had been too busy to be frightened for anyone but himself he called quick curses down on guzmans head if the captain hadnt taken them to the tower the most obvious way it might not have mattered at all de vega thought he couldnt change routes now he couldnt split his force either not when it was beset from all sides he saw only one thing he could do forward he said we have to go forward tell off a rear guard to hold back the englishmen behind us come what may we must reach the tower captain guzman had been right about that forward they went half a bloody step at a time every soldier they lost was gone for good fresh englishmen kept flooding into the fight even through the din of his own battle lope heard a great racket of gunfire from ahead from the direction of the tower of london he didnt know what it meant not for certain but he did know he misliked it mightily then an englishman he never saw clouted him in the side of the head with a polearmthis one unlike the fellow de vega had killed found room to swing his weapon even in the crowd the world flared red then black lopes rapier flew from his hand he swayed shuddered fell ravens the great black birds had always roosted on nested on the tower of london now careless of the swarms of live englishmen flooding into the tower the scavengers settled on the sprawled and twisted bodies on the battlements and in the courtyard most of the dead were spaniards but more than a few englishmen lay among them every once in a while the birds would flutter up again when someone pushed too close but never for long they hadnt enjoyed such a feast in years shakespeare shivered to see the ravens hed been sure the carrion birds would peck out his eyes and tongue and other dainties after he was slain and it might yet happenhe knew that too he had no idea how the uprising fared in the rest of london in westminster elsewhere in england here by the tower though all went well so his fears receded for the moment the bell tower people shouted shes in the bell tower they streamed towards it no need to ask who she was hardly any need even to call out her name not now were it not for her this throng never would have come to the tower beside shakespeare a graybeard said she was in the bell tower aforetimes too bloody mary mewed her up there forty years gone and more bloody mary amazement prickled through shakespeare who since the armada landed had dared use that name for elizabeths half sister no one the poet had heard not in all these years truly a new wind was blowing may it rise to a gale a mighty tempest he thought soldiers in armordented battered bloodsplashed armorstood guard at the base of the bell tower their spears and swords and arquebusesand their formidable presencekept people from rushing up into the tower to the rooms where elizabeth had passed the last ten years ruddy cheeks blue eyes beards of light brown and yellow and fiery red proclaimed them englishmen shakespeare wondered if any spaniards were left alive here he hoped not back keep back an officer yelled half the plume had been hacked off his high helm but his voice and his swagger radiated authority the crowd didnt actually move backimpossible with more folk flooding into the courtyard every minute but it did stop trying to push for ward in those circumstances that was miracle enough a peephole in the door behind the officer opened someone spoke to him through it he nodded the peephole closed the officer shouted again hear ye hear ye me her majestyll bespeak you anon from yon window he pointed upwards but bide in patience and all will be well her majesty again shakespeare felt the world turning changing around him since philip iis daughter isabella had been queen of england maybe isabella still thought she was but this swarm of englishmen thought otherwise god grant we be right elizabeth sir robert devereuxs voice boomed out even more full of command more full of itself than the officers elizabeth elizabeth come forth elizabeth at once the crowd took up the chant elizabeth elizabeth come forth elizabeth it echoed from the gray stone walls of the tower shakespeare shouted with the rest elizabeth elizabeth come forth elizabeth the rhythm thudded in him as impossible to escape as his own heartbeat the shutters of that window swung open the chanting stopped a sharpfaced grayhaired woman in a simple wool shift looked out from the window at the suddenly silent throng below staring up at her shakespeare at first guessed her a serving woman who would in a moment escort elizabeth forward when he thought of the queen of england he thought of her as shed been portrayed throughout her reign to be elizabeth she should have worn a magnificent gown she should have sparkled with jewels her face should have been white and smooth despite her years her hair a red that likewise defied time a glittering coronet should have topped her head but then she said i am here my own dear people of england you are come at last and i am still here implacable determination blazed from her every word even though most of her teeth were black god save the queen robert devereux shouted waving his rapier again the crowd took up the cry elizabeth raised her hand once more silence fell into it she said god hath preserved me unto this hour for the which i shall give praise to him all the remaining days of my life her voice seemed to strengthen from phrase to phrase shakespeare wondered how much shed used it these past ten years with whom had she spoken who would have dared speak to her she went on and i assure you i do not desire to live even one day more to distrust my faithful and living people let tyrants and foul usurpers fear i have always so behaved myself even in my long time of hardship and sorrow that under god i have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects thus i stand before you at this time not for my recreation and disport but being resolved in the midst and heat of this glorious uprising to live or die amongst you all never being made separate from you again her voice caught tears stung shakespeares eyes what had the imprisoned queen gone through here in the tower here in the hands of her enemies elizabeth the crowd shouted over and over again elizabeth elizabeth shakespeare joined it yelling till his throat was raw elizabeth raised her hand once more now we are begun anew she said i shall gladly lay down for my god and for my kingdom and for my people my honor and my blood even in the dust i know i have the body of a weak and feeble woman but i have the heart and stomach of a king and of a king of england too and i think foul scorn that spain or any prince of europe should have dared invade the borders of my realm or that isabella and albert falsely style themselves sovereigns thereof rather than any more dishonor shall fall on me i myself will take up arms this time the roar of the crowd stopped her a savage wordless roaring bellow that said she could have led them barehanded against all the hosts of spain and they would have torn the dons to pieces for her even shakespeare not the boldest of men looked about for a spaniard to assail though he was not sorry to discover none i am not so base minded that fear of any living creature or prince should make me afraid to do that were just elizabeth said when she could make herself heard again i am not of so low a lineage nor carry so vile a wit you may assure yourselves that for my part i doubt no whit but that all this tyrannical proud and brainsick invasion and occupation of my beloved england will yet prove the beginning though not the end of the ruin of that kingdom which most treacherously even in the midst of treating peace began this wrongful war spain hath procured my greatest glory that meant my sorest wrack and hath so dimmed that light of its sunshine that who hath a will to obtain shame let them keep its forces company and contrariwise who seeketh vengeance for great wrongs done and requital for the burthens borne in our long captivity let them go forward now with me and god defend the right she stepped away from the window for a moment shakespeare thought she cared nothing for the plaudits of the crowd as a man of the theatre he knew what a mistake that was but then the door behind the english soldiers at the base of the bell tower opened there stood elizabeth still in that simple colorless shift how they all roared there in the dying day that suddenly seemed a sunrise sir robert devereux dashed forward past the armored guardsmen to stand beside the queen bowing low he murmured something to her something lost in the din to shakespeare whatever it was elizabeth nodded and then the poet saw then everyone saw what it meant devereux stooped lifted her as lightly as if she were a toddling babe and set her on his bullbroad shoulders cheers and shouts redoubled shakespeare had not dreamt they could from that unsteady perch elizabeth once more raised a hand slowly quiet gained on chaos the queen said my loving people i might take heed how i commit myself to armed multitudes i might but i shall not i myself will be your general judge and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field as we overthrow and utterly cast down the vile usurpation which hath oppressed this my kingdom these ten years past i know already for your forwardness you deserve rewards and crowns and i do assure you in the words of a prince they shall be paid you another roar this time coalescing into a fresh shout of elizabeth elizabeth elizabeth from devereuxs shoulders she waved again little by little a new cry replaced her name deathdeathdeath to the dons and the smile stretching itself across elizabeths face when she heard that would have chilled the blood of any spaniard every born shakespeare shouted with everybody else as he shouted rewards and crowns ran through his mind he hadnt undertaken boudicca in hope of reward looking back he couldnt recall just why he had undertaken it save from fear of being slain should he refuse but hed already been handsomely paid and paid by the spaniards too for the play that never was if now elizabeth herself should look on him with favor if now this uprising triumphed which was as yet anything but assured sir robert devereux strode into the crowd crying forward now forward for st george and for good queen bess people swarmed forward not against the spaniards but towards him and elizabeth to call out to her to touch her simply to see her at close quarters devereux pushed on irresistible as if powered by a millrace to take elizabeth from the tower where shed languished so long and into her kingdom once more someone bumped shakespeare will kemp the clown made a lega cramped leg in the crushat him give you good den gallowsbait he said cheerfully go to shakespeare said meseems we are well begun here well begun ay and belike soon enough we shall be well ended too kemp jerked his head to one side made his eyes bulge and stuck out his tongue as if newly hanged with a shudder shakespeare said if the wind of your wit sit in that quarter why stand you here and not with the spaniards why kemp kissed him on the cheek think you youre the only mothers son born a fool in england he slipped away wriggling through the crowd like an eel making for the queen shakespeare didnt follow he simply stood where he was too much had happened too fast as things chanced elizabeth passed within a couple of feet of him their eyes met for a moment she had no idea who he was of course how could she when hed come to london only months before she was locked away but she nodded to him as if theyd been close for years anyone might have done the same but only a few only the greatest players could do it and make the people at whom they nodded feel theyd been close for years shakespeare was sadly aware he didnt quite have the gift richard burbage did so too in his twisted way did will kemp and so did elizabeth death to the dons shakespeare shouted and followed the little old woman who was his queen out of the tower out into london xiv when lope de vega first came to himself he didnt think he was awake at all he thought he had died and found himself in some stygian pit of hell slowly so slowly he realized he lived and breathed but he feared he was blind then he saw that the blackness all around lay in front of his eyes not behind them such blackness had a name he groped for it and groping found it night this was night he groaned and tried to sit up that was a mistake motion fanned the throbbing agony in his head his guts churned he heaved up whatever his stomach held only little by little did he also notice sharper pain from his left arm as from a cut had he been wounded there he couldnt remember not at first at first he had trouble remembering his name let alone anything else he had no idea why he lay in the middle of some london streetyes this was london that much he knewcovered in blood and now puke he had no idea who the corpses under him and around him and sprawling across his legs were either but that they were corpses he did not doubt no living mans flesh could be so cold more cautiously this time he tried again to sit the pain forced another moan from him but he succeeded crossing himself he wriggled away from the dead body on him but he could not escape them all they were too many and he too weak to move far yet why such slaughter who were these slain the why he could not recall not with bells of torment clanging in his head the who there not far away face pale and still in the moonlight lay the sergeant whod told him captain guzman was down he remembered that how guzman had come to fall though remained beyond him and not just guzman madre de dios lope whispered softly and crossed himself again the corpses piled around him were all spaniards scores of spaniards he shuddered his guts knotted anew though now he had nothing left in him to give back even as the spasm wracked him what had to be cold truth slid into his clouded wits they threw me here because they thought i was dead too at the moment he rather wished he were but then he saw a body with a slit throat gaping wide like a second mouth and another and another theyd made sure of a lot of men they hadnt bothered with him he breathed his heart beathis temples thudded each time his heart beat his eyes fell on another cut throat no he didntquitefeel like dying yet they the english it had to be the english theyd risen they must have risen but why still eluded him everything had been peaceful as far as he could remember he should have played juan de idiaquez in king philip at the theatre had he he didnt think so nothing was peaceful now along with the death stench of so many men he smelled more smoke than he should have even in smoky london the night was alive hideously alive with shouts and screams from far and near somewhere a block or two away a pistol banged the report made lopes head want to explode king philip the theatre shakespeare cicely sellis de vega stiffened the chain of associations took his thoughts down a road closed till then that puta he gasped that bruja shed bewitched him seduced him made him forget all about the theatre so that he went back towards the barracks instead went back towards the barracks and he cursed hed lost it whatever it was he tried to stand he needed three separate efforts before he could even then he swayed like a scrawny sapling in a storm a chorus of drunken english voices floated through the air deathdeathdeath to the dons the englishmen howled out laughter and obscenities then took it up afresh deathdeathdeath to the dons more gloating laughter lopes legs almost went out from under him he staggered over to a wall and leaned against it hed heard that chorus before hed been fighting his way towards the tower of london he remembered that and barricades in the streets and every damned englishman in the world running toward him and his comrades with whatever weapon he chanced to have and and we must have lost lope said explaining things to himself seemed to help by god and st james we must have lost theyd shouted santiago he remembered that too his throat was still raw with it but god and st james hadnt heeded them the tower of london even with his wits scrambled he knew who was kept there hed known that as long as hed been in england and just in case he hadnt those roaring drunken englishmen started a new chorus god bless good queen bess elizabeth free if she was shed draw rebels as the north pole drew a compass needle england had never been much more than sullenly acquiescent to the spanish occupation given time it might have become quieter but a rising now a rising now could be very bad and he knew it he laughed a small crackbrained laugh crackbrained indeed he thought through his pulsing pounding headache this rising plainly was already about as bad as it could get quiet footfallsthree or four englishmen coming up the street de vega froze into immobility the wall that half held him up was shadowed they didnt see him the thought of a live spaniard never entered their minds anyhow they intended plundering the dead they shoved bodies this way and that we are come too late one of them said sorrowfully too many others here before us we have but their leavings you will steal james an egg out of a cloister another replied by the way he said it he meant it as praise think you not youll find somewhat worth the having haply so james replied yet wheres the ironmongery they had about em gone lost as a town womans maidenhead we could have got good coin for casques and corselets and swords but see you any of the like i will rather trust a fleming with my butter or an irishman with my aquavitae bottle than those others to have spared the spaniards cutlery soldiers and scavengers robbed the fallen after battle they had since the beginning of time lope had done it himself here in england but never had he heard it so calmly so coldbloodedly hashed over heres a crucifixmight be gold another robber said moonlight flashed from a knifeblade as he cut it free the one called james remained gloomy saying mind me henry twill prove but brass when your glaziers gaze ont come daylight weret gold it had been gone long since but then he stooped and let out a soft grunt of pleasure or peradventure im mistook for heres a fine fat purse yet unslit the which i cannot say of this wights weasand off to the west a sharp volley of arquebus fire was followed a moment later by another and then by the deep boom of a cannon shall we cast down the dons and cast em out think you the man called henry asked what boots it someone else replied or the dogs tear the bear or the bear rend the dogs the rats in the wainscoting thrive they all laughed and then selfproclaimed rats stole away lope realized he had better leave too his comrades bodies would draw more plunderers and some might spy him he could not have fought a mouse let alone a rat and he discovered he had nothing with which to fight his rapier was gone he hadnt even noticed till that moment and when his hand went to the sheath of his belt knife sheath and knife had likewise vanished sure enough plenty of robbers had already visited the spaniards where do i go he wondered what do i do more gunfire off to the west decided him if there was still real fighting off in that direction he wouldhe mightfind his countrymen there and if he found englishmen before his countrymen he would likely also find his death he staggered up thames street weaving from side to side like a sot he made his way past two barricades now mostly but not quite torn down and past more bodies he still remembered little of the fight and nothing of the blow that had almost caved in his skull he wondered if he ever would little by little his wits did seem to be coming back to life things like a raging thirst and the vile aftertaste of vomit in his mouth began to register where before theyd been nothing but background to the thundering misery in his head the river he remembered lay only a block away he turned town an alley and made his way towards it at the best pace he could muster he would have outsped any snail a tortoise possibly not across the thames a great fireno twoblazed in southwark the light hurt lopes eyes as it might have after too much wine he looked downlooked down at himself for the first time since waking amongst the dead his stomach lurched yet again he was all over blood from head to foot he needed several heartbeats to figure out it wasnt all his it couldnt be if it were hed have had none left inside him how many others had bled on him while he lay senseless too many oh far too many he stumbled on towards the river when at last he reached it he sank to his knees at least as much from weakness as from thirst though he was very dry indeed he cupped his hands and brought water to his mouth it tasted of mud andblood he couldnt tell whether the blood was in the water or on his hands or on his face he drank and drank then splashed more water onto his cheeks and forehead the cold hurt dreadfully for a moment but then seemed to soothe he knew he should go looking for his countrymen again he knew but he was at the very end of his feeble strength he lay by the thames panting like a dog watching the fires on the far bank spread and spread deathdeathdeath to the dons that hateful chant rose up once more somewhere behind him if the english found him here they would give him the death hed almost had before he couldnt make himself care or move even in the midst of this madness boats still made their way across the thames and up and down it shouts of eastward ho and westward ho and ware you crusty botch of nature rang out as they might have at any hour of any day or night a large boat one with at least a dozen men at the oars came out of the west making for london bridge in the stern sat a man and a woman he slumped to one side she sat very straight and stiff as the boat passed by lope the rowers all pulling flat out to speed it down the river she said something in spanish de vega couldnt make out her words but the tongue was unmistakable she sounded furious the man answered in the same language but with a guttural accent more likely german than english the boat slid down the thames under the bridge and away to the east theyre free theyve escaped lope thought vaguely thoughhe had no idea who they were he tried to get to his feet tried and failed instead he sank down into something perhaps a little closer to proper sleep than to the oblivion from which hed emerged a little while before as london boiled around him he curled up on his side and snored shakespeare felt drunk though hed had no more than a couple of mugs of ale hastily snatched up and even more hastily poured down hed been up all through the wild night up and running and shouting and now and then throwing stones at spaniards now he stood in westminster watching the sun rise bloody through the thick clouds of smoke above london and southwark cries of death to the dons and elizabeth and good queen bess rang in his ears here and there spaniards still fought off in the distance a shout of asantiago was followed by a ragged volley of gunfire and several screams richard burbage clapped shakespeare on the back soot stained the players face sweat runneled pale tracks through it belike mine own seeming is the same shakespeare thought burbages eyes were redtracked but glowed like lanterns beshrew him if weve not broke em will he said you may have the right oft shakespeare said in slow weary wonder by god you may he yawned but where be isabella and albert weve none of us set eyes on em here i know that and it likes me not burbage answered they may yet rally dons and traitors to their side do we not presently bring em to heel he yawned too enormously three englishmen marched another better dressed than they up the street at swords point i tell you you do mistake me their captive said i have ever loved elizabeth ever reckoned her my rightful sovereign ever ever an infinite and endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner of not one good quality one of the men with a sword broke in thou art a general offense and every man should beat theeand will have his chance get on he shoved the fellow forward now commenceth vengeance shakespeare remarked now commenceth cleansing burbage said for lo the augean stables were as sweet rainwater falling from heaven set beside the mire of iniquity that was our england these ten years gone by let the river of revenge flow free through it he struck a pose as if declaiming on the stage shakespeare didnt argue with him if elizabeth triumphed anyone who argued against rooting out every last man who might have helped the spaniards and isabella and albert would endanger himself no less than someone arguing in favor of elizabeth and her backers after she went to the tower how many injustices had the dons and their english henchmen worked then a mort of em the poet thought and how many would the folk loyal to good queen bess work in return he sighed no fewer that mournful thought had hardly crossed his mind before another couple of men led another protesting prisoner past him and burbage i tell you gentles i am no spaniards hound but an honest englishman the fellow said blinking nearsightedly back at his captors he was thin and pockmarked and carried a broken pair of spectacles in his left hand hold shakespeare called to the roughlooking fellows whod seized him one of them held a pike the other a pistol shakespeare was acutely aware of having no weapon but the dagger the player had given him at the end of boudicca but he went on i know master phelippes to be true and trusty thomas phelippes leaned towards him peering peering ist you master shakespeare god bless you sir without my precious spectacles all past my nose is but a blur the man with the pistol swung it towards shakespeare the barrel suddenly seemed broad as a cannons bore go to or own yourself likewise treacher you detested parasitical thing the ruffian snarled this accursed wretch was secretary to the spaniards commanderthe which he denies not nor scarce can he being caught ins own den hard by the dons and you style him a proper man you pedlars excrement you stretchmouthed rascal how dare you showing anger to a man with a gun did not strike shakespeare as wise picking his words with care he answered i dare for that i know him to be one of lord burghleysnow one of robert cecilssurest and most faithfullest intelligencers as hed hoped those were names to conjure with the pistol wavered ever so slightly but the man holding it still sounded fierce as he demanded how know you this and who are you that you should know it answer quick now waste no time devising lies heard you not master phelippes whose loyalty i also avouch richard burbage boomed here before you stands none other than the famous will shakespeare whose grand boudicca yesterday helped light the fire gainst the dons the man with the pike nudged the pistoleer tis he wilf by my trothtis have i not seen him full many a time astrut upon the stage hell know whereof he speaks it were the gibbet for us did we harm one of crookback bobs men crookback bob shakespeare couldnt imagine presuming to call robert cecil any such thing to his vast relief though the man with the pistolwilflowered it well whos this cove with him then he demanded raw scorn filled the pikemans voice what know you not will kemp when you see him burbage turned the color of a ripe apple but wilfs eyes almost bugged out of his head will kemp he whispered if the two o them give this rogue their attestation belike he is no rogue after all he pushed phelippes not too hard towards shakespeare and burbage go with em you and praise god they knew you else you were sped oh i do praise him phelippes said rest assured good sir i do he groped for shakespeares hand and squeezed it come wilf said to the pikeman plenty of traitors undoubted yet to be smoked out they hurried up the street thomas phelippes blinked towards burbage then bowed low and gramercy to you as well master kemp he said i would not seem ungrate a grinding noise came from burbages throat his voice a strange sort of strangled scream he said i am not will kemp nor fain to be he neither plainly he wanted to shout with all the force of his mighty frame just as plainly he knew he must not for fear of bringing the armed ruffians back at the run in a low voice shakespeare said master phelippes i present you to my good friend and fellow player richard burbage after clasping burbages hand phelippes said i cry your pardon for i should have known you by your voice be your face and form never so indistinct to mine eyne let it go sir let it go burbage said gruffly theres reason you mistook me whereas that gross and miserable ignorance just gone he shook his head by jesu that god should go before such villains he muttered more unpleasantries these too low to make out how fell you into the hands of such brabblesome coves shakespeare asked thomas phelippes how sir as you might think phelippes answered i came hither yesterday knowing the die was cast and purposing if i might to make it into a langret for don diego flores de valdas shakespeare bobbed his head appreciating the figure if one were to cast a die in such straits as these a die not perfectly square would be the proper sort to cast phelippes let out a wry chuckle in the event confusion proved well enough compounded even absent mine aid what befell don diego shakespeare asked a formidable wight though he be a foe phelippes nodded formidable indeed when report reached him the fighting waxed hot he sprang to his feet buckled ons sword and fared forth to join it aa generals place is in the van quotha i know not if he breathe yet haply he had been wiser to stay behind so that the spaniards might have some single hand fully apprised of all that chanced throughout london and its surround burbage said haply so phelippes agreed but the donsand english soldiers too ill not denycall such a clerkly wisdom and do otherwise dispraise it when the bloods up in em they would spill it from their foes knowing they were reckoned whitelivered cravens for hanging back fear of ill fames worse cowardice yet though they see that not if don diego needs must away to the wars might he not have left some other to be the head and central wit of the spanish enterprise shakespeare said why so he did even without his spectacles thomas phelippes managed a sly sharptoothed smile the pockmarked little man bowed slightly your servant sir ho ho burbage thundered jovian laughter and how many dons went astray on that account perhaps a few phelippes chuckle meant to be selfdeprecating somehow seemed boastful instead ay perhaps a few you are an army in one man shakespeare said wondering how many other englishmen had aided this rebellion more few very few but would the chroniclers remember a man like phelippes would anyone write a play about the way hed helped the uprising shakespeare thought about that then shook his head phelippes role had been important yes but not dramatic in any ordinary sense of the word burbage asked know you where isabella and albert might be phelippes shook his head no and would i did for they might rally not only the dons but also englishmen of stout romish faith he looked about as if searching for the queen and king then laughed at himself they might stand beside me and id ken em not so sorry are mine eyne without assisting lenses what befell your spectacles shakespeare asked thomas phelippes laughed again this time in embarrassment a blush brought blood to his sallow cheeks the most prodigious bit of bungling any man might manage forsooththe undone laces of mine own shoon tripped me up whereupon i did measure my length upon the floor and the spectacles flying off he sighed i felt a proper fool but no help fort not until god grant me the leisure to seek replacement for my loss may that time come soon burbage said the which would signify our final victory oer the spaniards and all whod oppress us shakespeares stomach growled hed been running on nerves and little else since the afternoon before and was starting to feel the lack simple hunger doth oppress me he said i shall famish a dogs death burbage nodded resting both hands on his protuberant belly ay een so he said bread and meat and winefood fit for heroes or say rather none can long the hero play without em i pray youll lead me to em gentles for i am not fit to find em on my own phelippes said lets seek nourishment then shakespeare said and with good fortune well soon find ourselves in our aliment give over burbages groan had nothing to do with hunger he rolled his eyes up to the heavens muttering and they took me for clotpoll kemp but no more than shakespeare could he resist a quibble for he wagged a finger at the poet and added better fortune were to find our aliment in us they trudged through the streets of westminster past an englishman pulling the boots off a dead spaniard past several dogs feeding at another corpse past an englishman hanged from the branch of an oak a placard tied to the hanged mans body warned let them who served spain beware thomas phelippes was too shortsighted to see it and shakespeare didnt read it to him that might too easily have been phelippes dangling there before long they found an open tavern yesterday the proprietor had probably bowed and scraped to spaniards and to englishmen in their pay now he served out beer and cheese and brown bread with a hearty god bless good queen bess the hanged man swung not far away the taverner plainly a flexible soul did not care to join him and if as may be the dons cast us out again twill be buenos dias senores once more shakespeare thought with distaste but that distaste extended only to the man himself his provender was monstrous fine running feet in the street outside a cry of fled theyre fled by god theyre truly fled a voice cracking with excitementthen several voices as more took up the shout shakespeare and burbage leaped up from their seats mugs and chunks of bread still in hand they raced out to hear more thomas phelippes stumbled after them almost tripping over a stool wait burbage said in a great voice a voice that brooked no argument whos fled but the man whod brought the news shook his head elizabeth no lord love her shes here tis isabella and albert whore fled like thieves in the night we came upon a servant who packed em into a boat yesternight and watched em fare forth down the thames out of westminster out of london to save their reeky gore theyre fled another exultant whoop burbage and shakespeare stared at each other slowly solemnly they embraced shakespeare reached out and put an arm around phelippes too tears stung his eyes thus far our fortune keeps an upward course he said now are we graced with wreaths of victory i have great hope in that burbage said and i thomas phelippes agreed and i and even i shakespeare whispered perfect love saith john casteth out fear now i find me hope will serve as well or peradventure better he yawned till the hinges of his jaw creaked and now with hope in my heart i dare rest to burbage he said if thou canst wake me by two o the clock i prithee call me sleep hath seized me wholly but the player shook his big head he yawned too not i will being likewise fordone id liefer lay me down beside thee sleep the both of you and fear not phelippes said ill stand watch and wake you at the hour appointed a tiny recompense for the service you have done me i know but a first building stone in the edifice of gratitude sleep dwell upon your eyes my friends peace in your breasts gramercy shakespeare said not far away was a lawn on whose yellowing grass several englishmen already sprawled in slumber shakespeare and burbage lay down among them the poet twisted a couple of times he reached up to brush away a blade of grass tickling his nose then yawned once more and forgot the world lope de vega stirred muttered and sat up his head still ached abominably but he was closer to having his wits about him glancing up at the sun he blinked in surprise it was close to noon hed sleptor lain senselessthe clock around he shook his head and managed to do it without hurting himself too much more this felt restorative not merely blank like his previous round of unconsciousness an old woman coming along the riverbank towards him let out a startled cackle i thought you dead till you stirred she said her voice mushy and hard to understand because of missing front teeth not i lope answered what news he was glad he spoke english if she realized he was a spaniard she might try to make sure he was deadand in his present feeble state she might manage it too well youll know elizabeths enlarged she asked de vega nodded the old woman hadnt sounded certain he would know even that looking down at his blooddrenched clothes lope supposed shed had her reasons seeing him with some working wits though she went on and belike youll also know isabella and albert are fled one jump in front of the headsman no lope said but then a moment later softly yes that boat on the thames the night before when he was washing his face ill miss the dons not an they be truly routed the old englishwoman said vile swaggering coxcombs the lot of em yes lope said again meaning anything but the old woman nodded and went on her way de vega cocked his poor battered head to one side listening he heard very little no gunfire no shouts of death to the dons that had to mean london lay in english hands what do i do now he wondered he couldnt hire a wherry to take him out of the city following isabella and alberts example maybe theyd fled to gather strength elsewhere and try to return but maybe alsoand more likely he judgedtheyd got away just ahead of a baying pack of englishmen who would have killed them if theyd caught them the old woman seemed likely to be right about that the first thing lope did was drink again he was thirsty as could be he was hungry too but food would have to wait he splashed more water on his head the cold did a little at least to ease his pain staying upright was easier than it had been during the night deciding where to go was harder especially with his head still cloudy he let his feet take him where they would they may be the smartest part of me now he thought they carried him in the direction of the barracks from which spanish soldiers had dominated london for the past ten years before long he stumbled past a pile of bodies like the one from which hed emerged when he came back to his senses he shuddered crossed himself and went on no his countrymen didnt dominate this city any more just around the corner from that dreadful pile he almost stumbled over the corpse of a grayhaired englishman the fellow had been knocked in the head he hadnt bled much and what blood had spilled ran away from his body instead of puddling under it he wasnt far from lopes size a scavenger had already stolen his shoes and his belt pouch but he still wore doublet and hose lope stripped himan awkward business since hed begun to stiffenthen got out of his own bloody clothes the dead mans hose were a little too short but the doublet fit well not only was the outfit far cleaner than what de vega had worn it also helped make him look more like an englishman himself he wished he had a weapon of some sort even if only an eating knife then he shrugged which made his battered head hurt there would be more bodies in the street of that he was sure not all of them would have been thoroughly plundered not yet he soon acquired a dagger a good deal more formidable than an eating knife a few coins also jingled in his pouchnot so many as hed had before he was robbed while lying senseless but a few the englishman from whom he took them would never need to worry about money again lope used a couple of pennies to buy a loaf and a cup of ale the man who sold them to him gave him a hard look your way of speakings passing strange friend he remarked are you a spaniard was what he meant lope answered it wonders me i can speak at all some caitiff rogue did rudely yerk me on the knob wherefrom my wits yet wander ah the tavernkeeper relaxed and nodded ay belike a filchman to the nabll leave you crank for a spell well give you good day then een so de vega drained the ale and walked on tearing chunks from the loaf as he went a club to the head could indeed make a man act like an epileptic for a whileas he knew only too well half a block later he turned up st swithins lane as he walked past the london stone and spied the spanish barracks hope suddenly soared in him soldiers stood guard outside the entrance but when he drew nearer that hope crashed to earth as quickly as it had taken flight those big fairhaired grinning troopers were englishmen not spaniards god bless good queen bess a passerby called to one of them the man nodded his grin got even wider bless her indeed he said youll have seen good sir weve made a proper start at clearing the rats from their nest here with a wave and a grin of his own the passerby kept on his way he walked past lope without recognizing him for what he was as so many had already done the english sentries likewise paid no attention to him when he saw the corpses piled against the northern wall of the barracks he discovered what the soldier had meant by clearing the rats most of the bodies there belonged to servants for the spanish soldiers whod been in the barracks when the uprising broke out had gone off to try to hold the tower of londonand as lope knew had never got there their remains lay farther east but there was pedro the wounded soldier from the patrol lope had led back here and there lay enrique his clever head smashed in he too had come back here at de vegas orders and was that lope took a couple of steps towards the corpses to be sure he had to fight his right hand down when it started to rise of its own accordhe couldnt cross himself here not without giving himself away but that was diego poor fat lazy diego whod always been too indolent to threaten anyone or anything except his masters temper the englishmen hadnt cared theyd murdered him along with the rest of his countrymen theyd caught requiescat in pace lope murmured tears stung his eyes how anyone could have imagined sleepy diego needed killing well he would sleep forever now god have mercy on his soul that was a murmur too a murmur in english for safetys sake see you one there who galled you in especial an englishman asked lope had to nod again any other response would have betrayed him hating himself he went on behind him the englishman let out a gloating laugh he admired the corpses lope mourned where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar not one now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen unbidden the words from shakespeares prince of denmark rose in lopes mind he cursed under his breath hed been near hereoh farther up st swithins lane but only a stones throwwhen enrique smart as a whip enrique now dead as diego made him realize shakespeare was a traitor and cicely sellis when he thought of cicely sellis and what shed done with him to him he wished the blow hed taken had robbed him of even more of his memory he recalled that all too well shame blazed in him a selfdevouring flame but i can still have my vengeance he whispered hed been on his way for vengeance the day before when london erupted around him he might even have got it had he not chosen to bring the chancemet patrol with him who would have tried to stop one lone man no one most likely who would try to stop one lone man today no one or so he hoped up st swithins lane again then right into lombard street as hed done before past the church of st mary woolnoth he hadnt been far past it when church bells rang two o clock and hell broke loose he wasnt far past it today when they rang the same hour along the street towards him came a long column of dejected men their hands in the air captive spanish soldiers and officers their eyes dark and dismal in long sad faces flicked over lope he recognized some of them some of them no doubt recognized him no one said a word or gave a sign the laughing mocking english guards hustling them along took no notice of him as the last prisoners in the column tramped past de vega turned to look back at them what would happen to them he hoped they would be ransomed or exchanged not killed out of hand the spaniards hadnt murdered captives after their victories in could he dare hope elizabeths ragtag followers would remember he wouldnt know not for a while maybe not ever step lively you rumpfed ronyons an englishman called few of the captured men would have understood him but gestures and the occasional buffet steered them down st swithins lane lopes business lay in the other direction his right hand fell to the hilt of the dagger hed found he was too battered to step lively but nobody required it of him at the best pace he could manage he made his way east along lombard street towards bishopsgate towards his revenge shakespeare woke to someone shaking him he yawned and looked around trying to remember where he was and what he was doing here beside him richard burbage was sitting up also yawning and trying to knuckle sleep from his eyes thomas phelippes spoke anxiously your pardon gentles for it still lacks somewhat of two o the clock but i must away and thought you better roused than left to sleep past the hour you set me you must away shakespeare paused to yawn again he wouldnt have minded sleeping longer not at all wherefore phelippes didnt answer nicholas skeres who stood next to him did for that he is summoned presently to robert cecils side ah shakespeare nodded no phelippes couldnt very well refuse that summons to keep standing over a couple of players would master cecil see me as well skeres shook his head in due course belike but not yet that stung shakespeare had just reminded himself that he and burbage didnt stand so high in the scheme of things having scornful nick skeres remind him of the same thinghaving robert cecil remind him of the same thing through skeresmade him wish this westminster lawn would cover him up phelippes said mind you master shakespeare this signifies no want of respect for you or for all you have wrought for england but i standstood i had better sayhigh in the spaniards councils haply what i know o their secrets will aid in our casting em forth you do soothe me sir and in most gracious wise shakespeare said tom speaks sooth skeres said my principals men have been abroad seeking him since yesterday but in the garboil we found him not he saith we i myself ast chanced should not have found him neithershould not have found him living ratherwere it not for you twain in the kingdoms name gramercy by his tone by his manner he had every right to speak for england shakespeare found that as absurd as anything that had happened these past two mad days from phelippes tone he didnt lead guide i follow as best i may he told skeres by your mustard doublet shall i know youthat i make out plain spectacles or no the two of them hurried off together burbage heaved himself to his feet im away too will i must learn if winifred be hale and safe and the children his face clouded at the last word he and his wife had lost two sons in the past three years and of their surviving son and daughter the girl was sickly im with you as far as your house an youd have my company shakespeare said burbage nodded and gave him a hand to help him up brushing dry grass from himself the poet went on then to my lodging that the widow kendall may know i live yet and shall pay her rentand that i may sleep in mine own bed onward then burbage said as they started east from westminster the player shook his head and laughed ruefully id give much to know how this our uprising fares beyond london isabella and albert be fled aybut whither will they return anon an army at their backs or do they purpose taking ship for holland or spain there to preserve themselves i know not would i did shakespeare answered the inaudible and noiseless foot of time shall tell the tale bodies lay here and there along the strand and fleet street carrion birds rose from them in skrawking clouds as shakespeare and burbage walked past then settled again to renew their feast most of the bodies were already naked garments stolen by human scavengers there ahead of the birds holla what scene is this burbage said pointing at the long column of men emerging from ludgate and trudging towards him and shakespeare shakespeare shaded his eyes to peer through the cloud of dust the men kicked up why spanish prisoners an i mistake me not he said a moment later so many swarthy souls cannot be of english race you have the right of it burbage agreed when the head of the column came a little closer those guardsmensee you theyre surely englishmen een so shakespeare said one of the guards at the head of the column a huge fellow with butteryellow hair and beard who bore an oldfashioned cutandthrust broadswordno fancy rapier for him waved cheerfully at the two men from the theatre shakespeare and burbage returned the salute they left the road and stood on the verge as the prisoners shambled past shakespeare stared at the stream of sad dark faces seek you de vega burbage asked i do the poet answered id fain know what befell him why came he not to the theatre yesterday whatever the reason ill shed no tears oer him burbage said and in especial ill shed no tears oer the said absence nor oer its long continuance i trembled lest he burst in halfway through act three at the head of a company of dons crying agive over alls up i had me the selfsame thought shakespeare knew he would never remember that first production of boudicca without remembering the raw fear that went with it the fear he could smell in the tiring room he kept peering at the spaniards here though i see him not nor any other eh burbage said whats that shakespeare didnt answer hed been eyeing not only the captives but also their guards wondering if hed find ingram frizer among the latter having already encountered nick skeres he found the prospect of meeting another of robert cecils men not at all unlikely and the chances for robberyand perhaps for murder as wellshepherding a column of prisoners offered seemed right up frizers alley but shakespeare saw no more of him than of lope de vega he and burbage came into london through ludgate not far inside the gate on the north side of bowyer row stood a church dedicated to st martin two priests still in their cassocks had been hanged from the branches of a chestnut beside the church i served rome said a placard tied to one of them the placard tied to the other lewdly suggested just how hed served the pope burbage stared unmoved at the dangling bodies may all the inquisitors suffer the same fate he said in a voice like iron may it be so indeed shakespeare knew he sounded fiercely eager fostered by the dons the english inquisition had had ten years to force the faith of rome down its countrymens throats they played the tyrant over us let all their misdeeds come down on their own heads to haunt em he and burbage walked on for a few paces then the player said if elizabeth triumph herewhich god granthow many papist priestsll be left alive in a years time but a few and those all desperate lest the hounds take them shakespeare said burbage nodded plainly liking the prospect shakespeare sighed part of him would miss the grandeur of catholic ritual he knew better than to say any such thing he had not the stuff of martyrs in him hed likewise meekly accepted the romish rite after isabella and albert drove elizabeth from her throne old men here men of lord burghleys age would have seen their kingdoms faith changeshakespeare had to pause to count on his fingersfive different times from catholic to protestant to catholic to protestant to catholic and now back to protestant again how could a man have any real faith left after so many swings better not to say that either better not even to think it more dead priests either swung or lay in front of every church shakespeare and burbage passed after a while the corpses lost their power to shock custom hath made it in me a property of easiness shakespeares own words sounded inside his head then he and burbage came to st pauls what the rampaging english had done to the priests there any man who could have stayed easy after seeing that had to be dead of soul oh sweet jesu burbage mumbled he turned his head away shakespeare did the same too late too late he would spend years trying to forget and knew he would spend them in vain burbage dwelt in cordwainer street ward east of the great church his house stood not far from the red lion a wooden beast that marked a courtyard whose shops sold broadcloths and other draperies as he and shakespeare came up to the front door it flew open his wife dashed out and threw herself into his arms god be praised thourt hale winifred burbage cried politely adding and you as well master shakespeare she gave her attention back to her husband this past day a thousand deaths ive died knowing what thoudst essay dreading for that you came not hither she was a wellmade woman in her late twenties auburnhaired blueeyed worry now robbing her of much of her beauty burbage kissed her then struck a pose i am hale as thou seest what of thyself and of william and isabel we are well his wife seemed to be fighting to convince herself as well as him the broil commencing we kept within doors a don was slain yonder in front of master goodpastures she pointed across the street no sign of the body remained gathering herself she went on but for that all might have seemed to pass in some far country but twas real twas real she shivered so did shakespeare whod seen more than she of how very real it was he set a hand on burbages arm i praise the lord alls well with you and now i must away god keep you safe will the player said winifred burbage nodded in times like these that was no idle phrase but a real and urgent wish church bells chimed two as shakespeare started away from burbages house he shivered again had it been but a day since lord westmorlands men gave boudicca instead of king philip that seemed impossible but had to be true hed never known twentyfour more crowded hours on a normal day the company would be offering another play even now not today he hoped the theatre still stood if not how would he make his living like any player he worried about that despite the money hed got from lord burghley and from the dons for his two plays a man swaggered up the street with a featherbed over his shoulder a cage with several small frantically chirping birds in one hand and a pistol in the other how many englishmen had used the uprising as an excuse for rapine against their own folk that had hardly crossed shakespeares mind before a woman several blocks away screamed how many englishmen were using the uprising as an excuse for rape too they revel the night rob murder and commit the oldest sins the newest kind of ways he thought sadly here and there fires still smoldered had the wind been stronger much of london might have burned he started to cross himself to thank god that hadnt happened but arrested the gesture before it was well begun up till yesterday not signing himself could have marked him as a protestant heretic now using the sign of the cross might make him out to be a stubborn papist men of fixed habit men who could not quickly and easily adapt to changing times would surely die because others judged them to be of the wrong opinion it had happened before the last time ten years ago he turned up bishopsgate street and hurried north towards his lodginghouse less than a day earlier hed roared south down the same street towards the tower of london shouting deathdeathdeath to the dons and death had come to a great many of them since and to a great many englishmen as well yes death had had his day and shakespeare feared him not yet glutted turning left off bishopsgate street the poet made his way through the maze of side streets and stinking alleys to the widow kendalls house when he passed the ordinary where he often supped he murmured oh praise god to see it unharmed that likely meant kate was all right he almost stopped to let her know he was safe but yawning kept on instead tonight would do he desperately craved more sleep the front door to the widow kendalls house stood open shakespeare frowned that was unusual his landlady habitually kept it closed fearingwith some reasonthievery then a shriek rang from within the house shakespeare broke into a run jane kendall screamed again as he dashed through the front door and into the parlor cicely sellis held a stool in front of her as if she were a liontamer doing her best to keep at bay a man who menaced her with a dagger that almost made a smallsword altogether without thinking shakespeare tackled the man from behind the fellow let out a startled grunt the knife flew from his hand the widow kendall let out another shriek shakespeare noticed it only absently he bore the man to the ground as cicely sellis grabbed the dagger his foe tried to twist and strike at him but all his movements were slow and clumsy though anything but a fighting man shakespeare had no trouble subduing him and when he did de vega he exclaimed a great swollen livid bruise covered the left half of lopes forehead shakespeare marveled that anyone could take such a hurt without having his skull completely smashed no wonder the spaniard was slower and less formidable than he might have been almost as an afterthought shakespeare remembered he too had a knife he pulled it free and held it to lopes throat give over he panted cease your struggles else you perish on the instant de vega tensed for a final heave but then went limp instead i yield me he said sullenly when he stared up at shakespeare one pupil was bigger than the other wherefore came you hither the poet asked him and why your menace gainst mistress sellis wherefore lope echoed for to kill this bruja this witch this whore i am no mans whore cicely sellis said shakespeare noted she did not deny the other heaven be praised you came when you did master will the widow kendall said methought thered be foul bloody murther done in mine own parlor haply not had you helped more and wailed less the cunning woman told her voice tart jane kendall glared she looked as if she wanted to answer sharply but did not have the nerve shakespeare would have thought twice before angering cicely sellis too he pulled his attention back to lope de vega say on what mean you de vega hesitated then shrugged well why not what boots it now having heard you were seen consorting with robert cecil in the street i hastened hither yesterday to learn if you purposed treason despite your fine verses on his most catholic majesty shakespeare shivered so some spy had recognized robert cecil even with his beggars disguise by what flimsy threads the uprising had hung but they hadnt broken not quite shakespeare asked how hath this aught to do with mistress sellis why we chanced to meet in this very parlor lope answered as if shakespeare should already have known that we chanced to meet and she asking why i was come i spake the truth thinking her honest and so i am cicely sellis said by the widow kendalls expression her opinion differed but she held her tongue she bade me enter her chamber lope continued jane kendall stirred yet again yet again she dared do no more than stir she bade me enter her chamber the spaniard repeated and there she bewitched me by some foul sorcery she cast oblivion upon me made me to forget why id come hither made me to forget i was for the theatre bound there to play don juan de idiaquez at that the widow kendall did cross herself her lips moved in a silent paternoster cicely sellis only shrugged mommet came out of her chamber and wove around her ankles bending to scratch behind the cats ears she said twas but the same sleight i used to calm master street this easter past mommet purred he pushed his face against the cunning womans hand ah shakespeare said the most noncommittal noise he could make hed thought what she did to jack street then was witchcraft and no mere sleight his landladys fearfilled eyes said she thought the same and then lope went on and then he shot a furiously burning glare at the cunning woman and then she did lie with me in love to maze me further and lead me astray from my purpose in coming hither nor did she fail of hers reproach filled his voice for himself or for her shakespeare wondered belike both his own gaze flicked from de vega to cicely sellis and back again he hadnt expected to be so jealous of the spaniard jealousy wasnt what jane kendall felt so thou art a doxy then she spat at cicely sellis whore trull poxy callet oh be still you stale mouseeaten cheese the cunning woman replied your virginity your old virginity is like one of those french withered pears it looks ill it eats dryly the widow kendall stared popeyed with fury having had a husband she surely was no virgin and yet after what shed called the younger woman the word seemed to stick to her and in no flattering way calmly cicely sellis nodded to shakespeare ay i lay with him both you and he had made it pikestaff plain somewhat of no small import was afoot the which he must not let nor hinder i lay with him and thought of england of england lope yelped i on her belly fell she on her back and she bethought her of england marry what a liar thou art mistress sellis twas not of england but of thy he seemed to have lost the english word shakespeare did not supply it de vega miffed and more than miffed addressed his words to him i do assure you master will her caterwauls were like to those coming from the throat of this accursed beast her witchy familiar he jerked a thumb towards mommet the cat arched its back and hissed cicely sellis flushed by that shakespeare judged she likely had thought of other things besides england when she bedded lope and taken more pleasure than she cared to admit now but that didnt mean she hadnt thought of england and if shed kept the spanish officer from going through the papers in shakespeares chest she might have saved the uprising had the dons had even a few hours to make ready shakespeare didnt want to think about that he said one may do for love of country that which one would not else de vega howled the widow kendall sniffed the cunning woman nodded again was that relief on her face shakespeare couldnt be sure not least because up till now shed always been so much in control of herself that he didnt recall her wearing such an expression before i still say jane kendall began wait ant please you shakespeare said his landlady blinked he seldom presumed to interrupt her he went on you were wise mistress kendall to say not that which may not be mended for the times do change will you or nill you and it will go hard for those who change not with them the times would change if the rebellion succeeded he didnt know it would but the widow kendall didnt know it wouldnt and as one whod shown herself to be a devout catholic these past ten years she stood to lose perhaps a great deal if people she knew denounced her she licked her lips shakespeare could see that realization growing in her she must have seenthe dons had made sure all england sawwhat happened to stubborn protestants with a new spin of the wheel it would be the papists turn she exhaled with what might have been anger but said not another word cicely sellis nodded towards lope what would you with him master will she asked i shakespeare sounded startled even to himself hed never held a mans life in his hands before if he cut de vegas throat here in the parlor no one would think the less of him save possibly jane kendall on account of the mess it would make if he sighed and shook his head i have not the murtherers blood in me he said as if someone had claimed he did he acted but from duty and from loyalty to his own king let him be made prisoner to be ransomed or exchanged or otherwise enlarged as fate allow gramercy lope said softly i am your servant he managed a ragged chuckle and but for yon witch i should have made a splendid don juan de idiaquez that jerked a laugh and a nod from shakespeare ay belike he said and then twould like me one day to see king philip on the stage an you bide yet in england master lope the parts yours de vega gave him a crooked grin with our lord i say let this cup pass from me shakespeare had had that thought too come now shakespeare said gesturing towards the door with his knife i will give you over into the charge of those whose duty is to take captives for i know there be such men think not to flee neither you have yieldedand flight would prove the worse for you we english holding london before god i shall not flee as lope got to his feet he put a hand to his bruised head before god i cannot flee far but i would not even if i could i have seen your london wolves stand like greyhounds in the slips straining at the start and would not have them dog my heels lets away then shakespeare said by my troth ill give you into the hands of none others but them that will hold you safe until you may once more be set at liberty de vega nodded even that small motion must have pained him for he hissed and gingerly touched his head again shakespeare made a leg at jane kendall and cicely sellis farewell ladies his landlady dropped him an awkward curtsy by way of reply cicely sellis dipped her head murmuring i stand much in your debt master will and how would i have that debt repaid he wondered in the same coin she gave the spaniard he shoved lope lets away he said again sounding rough as a soldier he didnt have to take de vega far theyd just come out into bishopsgate street when a fresh column of captives shambled down from the north move along you poor cuckoldy knaves you louts you remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villains shouted the englishman at their head ay move along or twill be the worse for you you blackguards you virginviolators you inexcrable dogs most of the spaniards couldnt have understood a word of the abuse he showered on them but they did understand they had to keep moving shakespeare waved to that loud englishman calling bide a moment ive another don here for to add to your party well bring him on then the damned murtherous fatkidneyed rascal the fellow replied careless of whatever anguish it might have cost lope gave him a courtiers bow i am thy servant thou proud disdainful haggard he said it must have sounded like praise to the englishman youre a sweettongued losel eh he said belike the lickerish ladies think the same de vega nodded which the man didnt seem to expect he jerked a thumb towards the captives get in amongst em no trouble or youll be sorry for it i am already sorry for it lope replied but he took his place with the rest of the spaniards away they went down deeper into london as shakespeare turned back towards his lodginghouse a brisk spatter of gunfire rang out not too far away close enough at any rate for him to hear the cries of wounded men immediately afterwards the fight for london hadnt quite finished he couldnt tell whether the cries were in english or spanish men in torment sounded much the same in either language the sun was sinking fast though clouds and smokemore of the former and less of the latter than hed seen the day before most of the time he would have gone to the widow kendalls and then to his ordinary for supper hed already been to the lodginghouse the excitement with de vega had chased sleep from himand there stood the ordinary its door open and inviting when he walked in kate was setting candles on the tables and lighting them with a burning splinter one man had already taken his place near the hearth he was cutting up the beefsteak that sat on a wooden trencher in front of him will kate exclaimed and dropped the candles she was holding she ran to him took him in her arms squeezed the breath out of him and kissed him sweet will god be praised i see thee whole and hale she kissed him again a right friendly dive this said the man with the beefsteak a grin on his greasy face shakespeare ignored him holding kate kissing her he forgot about cicely sellis no that went too far he didnt forget about her but did put her in perspective she was a temptation a sweet one but no more kate were he not tied to anne back in stratford he would gladly have made her his wife he pushed that thought aside as he had to as you see me he said and passing glad to see thee now he kissed her the fellow by the hearth whooped neither of them paid him the least attention at last the kiss ended but they still clung to each other kate asked what wouldst thou my darling thou knowest full well what i would shakespeare answered what i will what i can what i may he shrugged thou knowest likewise the difficulties the impediments the obstacles before me i have not lied to thee he took a certain forlorn pride in that kate nodded he went on an i be able them to thrust aside ill dot in a heartbeat may it be so oh may it be so with all in flux who can say this or that shall not come to pass if elizabeth be free o the tower she is shakespeare said with mine own eyne i saw her leave it borne on sir robert devereux his shoulders well then kate said as if that proved something maybe to her it did who could have dreamt such a thing een a week gone by so great a miracle being worked for england why not a smaller one for us twain alone ay why not shakespeare agreed and kissed her once more that he remained alive and free to do it struck him as more than miracle enough right now when one of lope de vegas lovers caught him with another outside the bearbaiting arena in southwark hed thought the round wooden building so like a theatre in construction would remain forever the scene of his worst humiliation now here he was back at the arena and humiliated again the english were using it to house the spanish prisoners theyd taken he squatted glumly on the sandstrewn dirt floor where so many bears and hounds had died the beasts were gone taken away to another pit their stenches lingered the sharp stink of the dogs and the bears ranker muskier reek with so many captives packed into the place the commonplace smells of unwashed men and their wastes were crowding out the animal odors gray clouds gathered overhead if it rained the arena floor would turn to mud lope knew he would have to find himself a place in one of the galleries i should have done that sooner he thought but he hadnt had the energy hed been sunk in lethargy since taking the blow that almost broke his skull and especially since failing to avenge himself on cicely sellis after that failure nothing seemed to matter not far away one of his countrymen asked another in the name of god why does no one rescue us those who win rescue the other spaniard said if we are not rescued it is because we do not win that made much more sense than lope wished it did the first spaniard said but how can we lose to this english rabble we beat them beforebeat them with ease are they such giants now have we turned into dwarfs these past ten years our army is scattered over the country now the other man answered english soldiers were supposed to do much of the job for us so a lot of our men could go back to the netherlands and put down the rebels there oh yes oh yes the first captive said the english did a wonderful job of holding down the countrysidetill they turned on us like so many rabid dogs lope said and the netherlands have risen in revolt again too or so the english say just when we thought we had them quiet at last he wanted to shake his head but didnt even now more than a week after hed been struck down such motion could bring on blinding headaches after a moment he continued and who knows what philip iii will do once word of this finally reaches him neither of the other men answered for a little while at last one of them murmured ah if only his father were still alive his friend nodded so did lope cautiously philip ii would have had the determination to fight hard against an uprising like this that of course was not the smallest reason the english had waited till he was dead to rebel and everyone knew all too well that philip iii was not the man not half the man his father had been that night cannon fire off to the east interrupted lopes rest he wondered what it meant but no one inside the bearbaiting arena could see out hed just dozed off in spite of the distant booms when an enormous explosion much larger than a mere cannon blast jerked him upright and make him wonder if his head would burst as well after that the gunfire quickly diminished an almost aching silence returned having nothing else he could do he lay down and went back to sleep when the sun rose the englishmen who came in to feed their captives were jubilant some of your galleons essayed sailing up the thames said the fellow who handed lope a bowl of soursmelling porridge but we sent em back by god tails twixt their legs how i pray you lope asked he shoveled the porridge into his mouth with his fingers for he had not even a horn spoon to call his own how fireships the which we sent at em from just beyond london bridge the englishman answered the current slid the blazing hulks against your fleet sailing upriver the which had to go about right smartly and flee before em else they too had been given oer to the flames as indeed the san juan washeard you not the great roar when the fire reached her magazine the san juan lope crossed himself muttering an ave maria hed come to england in that ship and the san mateo de portugal lies hard aground the fellow added hard aground and captured i doubt not een you cockahoop donsll think twice or ever you try the like again he went on to feed someone else what does he say a spaniard asked lope i heard in amongst his english the names of our ships de vega translated he added i dont know that he was telling the truth mind it seems likely the other man said it seems only too likely would a lie have such detail a good one might lope answered though he knew he was trying to convince himself at least as much as the man with whom he was talking day followed day no spanish force fought its way into london at least as much as anything else that convinced lope the englishman had told him the truth the longer he stayed in the bearbaiting arena the plainer it grew that the english uprising was succeeding with the arena still full of prisoners some of the londoners usual sport was taken away from them escorted by armed and armored guards they began coming in to view the spanish captives lope suspected it was a poor amusement next to what they were used to maybe theyll set mastiffs on us instead of on the bears he thought he took care never to say that aloud when it first crossed his mind it seemed a bitter joke but the english might do it if only it occurred to them most of the men who came to see the spaniards showed them a certain respect anyone whod fought in war knew misfortune could befall even the finest soldiers the women were worse they jeered and mocked and generally made lope think the guardsmen were protecting his countrymen and him from them rather than the reverse and then one drizzly day he saw a blackhaired blackeyed beauty on an english noblemans arm the nobleman stared at the spaniards as if at so many animals in a cage so did his companion who laughed and murmured in his ear and rubbed against him and did everything but set her hand on his codpiece right there in front of everyone and he only strutted and swaggered and slipped his arm around her waist displaying to the world the new toy hed found slowly and deliberately lope turned away he might have known catalina ibaaez would make the best of whatever happened in england he could have told that nobleman a thing or two but what point besides sooner or later the fellow would find out for himself de vega did hope catalina didnt recognize him by now the beard was dark on his cheeks and jawline as well as his chin to her eye he should have been just one more glum and grimy prisoner among so many having her gloat over his misery would have been more than he could bear he watched her out of the corner of his eye she gave no sign she knew him a tiny victory but all hed get in here she laughed again a sound like tinkling bells and stood on tiptoe to kiss her new protector on the cheek chuckling indulgently he patted her backside lope prayed for a bear or even for mastiffs god must have been busy somewhere else for catalina and the englishman strolled out of the arena together xv as it had on that fateful afternoon six weeks earlier absolute silence reigned in the theatre into it joe boardman once more spoke boudiccas final lines we britons never did nor never shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror but when we do first help to wound ourselves come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them naught shall make us rue if britons to themselves do rest but true the queen of the iceni died again as he had then shakespeare strode for ward past boudiccas body as he had then he ended the play no epilogue here unless you make it if you want your freedom go and take it and as he had then he stood there at the front of the stage and waited for whatever came next what came this time was applause wave after wave of it from groundlings and galleries alike shakespeares eyes went to the velvetupholstered chair that had been set up in the middle gallery he bowed low to queen elizabeth she inclined her head by way of reply she had once more the outward seeming of a queen her gown glimmering with pearls her great ruff starched and snowy pale powder banishing the years from her face a coronet in place in her curly red wig yet to shakespeares mind shed never been more queenly than when she spoke all unadorned from the window in the tower behind the poet the players whod acted in boudicca came forward to take their bows at the earlier performance they hadnt got the plaudits they deserved the play had aimed at firing the audience against the spanish occupiers and met its aim even better than shakespeare dared hope that meant the players though went all but forgotten not now the audience clapped and stamped their feet and shouted and roared lord westmorlands men bowed again and again but the tumult would not die robert cecilnow sir robertwho sat beside elizabeth leaned towards her and spoke behind his hand shakespeare saw her smile and nod then she rose to her feet and blew the company a kiss along with everyone else shakespeare bowed once more lower than ever the din in the theatre redoubled at last after what seemed forever it began to ebb a trumpeter behind elizabeths seat winded his horn the sharp clear notes drew everyones attention elizabeth rose once more and said lord westmorland being a proved traitor and romish heretic who hath fled with the dons and the name of a former company of players having fallen into misfortunate disuse it is my pleasure to ordain and declare that the players here before me assembled shall be known henceforward and forevermore as the queens men betokening my great favor which for most excellent reason they do enjoy that drew even more applause than the play had once again shakespeare bowed very low so did all the members of the company behind him when laughter mingled with the applause shakespeare looked over his shoulder there was will kemp turning his reverence to the queen into a silly caper burbage looked horrified when shakespeare glanced up towards elizabeth in the gallery she was laughing maybe that said kemp knew her humor better than burbage did maybeperhaps more likelyit said the clown couldnt help clowning come what might the trumpeter blew another flourish he had to blow it twice before the crowd heeded him and quieted elizabeth said be it also known that i purpose rewarding the players of the queens men with more than the name alone the which is but wind and air good for vaunting but little else your valor in giving this play when the foul occupiers of our land would vilest treason style it shall of a surety be not forgot that i am queen again over more than mine own chamber i am not least through your exertions nor shall i never forget the same cheers rang out again some of them hungry not so much envious as speculative they shall have favor and wealth how can i dispossess em of those taking them for mine own shakespeare could all but hear the thoughts behind the plaudits had he been standing amongst the groundlings or even in the galleries such thoughts might have run through his head too consumption of the purse is so often incurable whod not seek a remedy therefrom one more trumpet flourish rang out trailed by robert cecil the queen descended from the middle gallery instead of leaving the theatre though she made her way through the groundlings towards the stage they parted before her like the red sea before moses in black velvet the younger cecil might have been her shadow behind her how may i ascend she asked shakespeare who still stood farthest forward of the company he pointed back towards the right thitherward lies the stair your majesty with a brusque nod she used the stairway to come up onto the stage sir robert remained at her heel fear gnawed shakespeare if anyone in the audience meant her ill he had but to draw a pistol and but no one did elizabeths confident even arrogant stride said she was certain no one would perhaps that confidence helped ensure that no one would perhaps shakespeare remained nervous even so the queen walked up beside him she looked out over the audience for a moment again seeming almost to defy anyone to strike at her then she said know master shakespeare you are much in my mind and heart for writing this boudicca in despite of the spaniards showing forth no common courage in the doing i was more afeared of ingram frizers knife than of the dons shakespeare thought sometimes though not all the truth needed telling here he could and did get by with a murmured your majesty i am your servant elizabeth nodded again just so and you served me right well in a way none other might have matched shakespeare knew a stab of grief for christopher marlowe but even kit had said he was best suited for this business then the queen added another sharp word one that cast all thoughts of marlowe from his mind kneel your maj shakespeare squeaked in surprise elizabeths eyes flashed awkwardly shakespeare dropped to his right knee your sword sir robert elizabeth said is ever at your service your majesty robert cecil drew his rapier and handed it to the queen by the way she held it she knew how to use it she brought the flat down on shakespeares shoulder hard enough to make him sway arise sir william she said dizzily shakespeare did to the cheers of his fellow players and of the crowd in the theatre queen elizabeth returned the rapier to robert cecil who slid it back into its sheath youryour majesty shakespeare stammered i find me altogether at a loss for words this i do now forgive in you for that you were at no loss whilst setting pen to page on this play which did so much to aid in mine own enlargement and englands freedom from the tyrants heel elizabeth replied the necessity of this action makes my speech the more heartfelt hoping you will measure my good affection with the right balance of my actions in gratitude for yours for the which i render you a million of thanks sweet is my inclination towards you whereby i may demonstrate my care of this we shall speak more anon she swept off the stage sir robert cecil once more following close out she went through the groundlings they cheered her as lustily as before and turned back to shout hurrah for sir william still dazed shakespeare bowed to them one last time before leaving the stage and had we given king philip and had the rebellion failed queen isabella might have dubbed me knight this day he thought at which spectacle these selfsame folk would have cheered no less and if they had given king philip and if isabella had knighted him would he be thinking elizabeth might have done the same had the company presented boudicca he shook his head not so much in denial as in reluctance to get caught up in the tangling web of what might have been going back to the tiring room was nothing but a relief he found no peace there players kept coming up to pay him their respects so did the tireman the bookkeeper the tiremans helpers and everybody else who managed to get into the crowded room some of them were really congratulating him more he judged were congratulating his rank that thought must have occurred to will kemp too after bowing lowfar too low to a knight or to a duke for that matterthe clown said ay by my halidom youre a right rank cove now and held his nose go to shakespeare said laughing tis the stench of your wit id fain rout from my nostrils had i more rank id be less had god himself less hed be more kemp said your quibbles fly like arrows at st sebastian shakespeare mimed being struck arrows by any other name would smell as sweet kemp retorted shakespeare flinched however fond of puns he was himself hed never looked to see romeo and juliet so brutalized loftily kemp added the same holds not for me naught holds for you richard burbage said coming up beside him nor honor nor sense nor decency ah but so that you love me dick alls well kemp cried and planted a wet noisy kiss on burbages cheek avaunt burbage pushed him away hard aroint thee mooncalf the clown sighed alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof he puckered up again good lord what madness rules in brainsick men burbage said i am not mad i would to heaven i were kemp replied for then tis like i should forget myself he capered bonelesslyand more than a little lewdly burbage looked ready to thwack him in good earnest give over the both of you shakespeare said will kemp gave him another extravagant bow id sooner be a cock and disobey the day than myself and disobey a knight half cock belike burbage said i yield to your judgment sweet dick for you of all men surely are all cock as well enough shakespeare shouted loud enough to cut through the din in the tiring room and make everyone stare at him he didnt care give over i said and give over i meant he went on the queen hath said we are to be rewarded according to our deserts and youd quarrel one with another tis foolishness tis worse than foolishness swounds tis madness did we brabble so whilst in the mist of terrible and unavoided danger we readied boudicca for the stage shaming them into stopping their sniping didnt work as hed hoped burbage nodded ay by my troth we did he declared kemp only shrugged me i know not ask of matt quinn shakespeare threw his hands in the air go on then he said since it likes you so well go on you were pleased to play on cocks strap spurs on your heels then and and tear each other ithe pit will kemp stirred shakespeare glared at him that quibble never got made as the players left the theatre burbage caught up with shakespeare and said there be times his big hands made a twisting motion as if he were wringing a cocks neck easy shakespeare said easy he roils you of purpose and i know it burbage replied natheless he doth roil me showing him which you but urge him on to roil you further if he prick me do i not bleed if he poison me do i not die have i not dimensions sense affections passions if he wrong me shall i not revenge the villainy he teacheth me i will execute and it shall go hard but i will better the instruction he is a clown by very nature shakespeare said it will out will he or no and he hath a gift the auditors do cherishas have you he added hastily the company is betterthe queens men are betterfor having both you twain the queens men burbages glower softened there you have me will a prize worth winning and we have won it and i needs must own he holp us in the winning he was when he remembered to be a just man when shakespeare walked into his lodginghouse he found jane kendall all fluttering with excitement is it true master shakespeare she trilled is it true is what true he asked confused are you sir william he nodded i am but how knew you that before his landlady answered she took him in her arms stood on tiptoe and kissed him on the cheek with her blasting and scandalous breath he would rather have had a kiss from will kemps lips he didnt say so he would have had no chance anyhow for she was off why i had it from lily perkins three doors down who had it from her neighbor joanna ball who had it from peg mercer who had it from her husband peter who had it in his shop in bishopsgate street from a wight returned to london from the theatre naught simpler i see shakespeare said and so in a way he did rumor ran so fast before long it would likely start reporting things before they happened as well it did not with boudicca he thought else the dons had found some way to thwart us sir william the widow kendall repeated fluttering her eyelashes at him to have a knight dwelling in mine own housedwelling so that he may pay his scot i should say fear not mistress kendall shakespeare said whilst i be no rich man still i am not poor neither have i ever failed to pay whats owed you never oncethe proof of which being you dwell here yet his landlady replied shakespeare hid a sigh she loved him for his silver alone the door to cicely sellis room opened out came the cunning woman with a roundfaced matron with a worried expression almost everyone who came to see her had a worried expression who that was not worried would come to see a cunning woman mommet bounded out and started sniffing shakespeares shoes which to his nose must have told the tale of where the poet had been rest you easy all will be well cicely sellis told her client that which you dread shall remain dark god grant it be so the other woman burst out it shall remain dark cicely sellis said soothingly an you betray yourself not by reason of your own alarums internal i would not the woman said i will not gods blessings upon you mistress sellis out she went seeming happier than she had a moment before shakespeare wondered what she didnt want revealed had she collaborated with the spaniards or had she simply taken a lover he was unlikely to find out if he were putting this scene in a play though what would he choose if he were putting this scene in a play he would be hard pressed to find a boy actor who could reproduce the terror and loathing on jane kendalls face as she stared at the cunning womanwhore she mouthed silently witch but she said not a word aloud cicely sellis paid her rent on time too she nodded now to shakespeare god give you good even sir william the widow kendall jerked that proved too much for her to bear how knew you ofs knighthood hussy she demanded these past two hours were you not closeted away with bell book and candle she had that wrong bell book and candle were parts of the ceremony of excommunication not the tools of the witch who might deserve it shakespeare knew as much by the glint of amusement in cicely sellis eye so did she she didnt try to tell her landlady so all she said was did you not call master shakespeare sir william just now and did not lily perkins bring you word of the said knighthood clucking like a hen the while i am not deaf mistress kendallthough betimes in your disorderly house i wish i were after a moment to take that in jane kendall jerked again shakespeare looked down at mommet to hide his smile the cunning woman had got her revenge for the widow kendalls mouthed whore when his face was sober again he nodded to her and said good den to you as well mistress sellis i do congratulate you you having done so much the honor to deserve cicely sellis said my thanks shakespeare answered may your fame grow and your wealth with it so that like any rich and famous man you may build your own grand house and need no longer live in any such place as this the cunning woman told him jane kendall jerked once more naughts amiss here she said shrilly an you find somewhat here mislikes you mistress sellis why seek you not other habitation for that i can afford no better cicely sellis said the same holds not for master shakesfor sir william no betters to be found jane kendall asserted cicely sellis said nothing at all her silence seemed to shakespeare the most devastating reply of all and so it must have seemed to his landlady too for she yelped why tis true as if the cunning woman had called her a liar to her face and cicely sellis was right he could afford finer than a onethird share of a bishopsgate bedchamber whether he wanted to spend the money for better was a different question he had in full measure the players ingrained mistrust of good fortune and fear it would not last how many men had he known who briefly flush spent what they had while they had it and then misfortune striking wished they hadnt been so prodigal too many far too many he didnt care to come out with that openly and so instead he smiled and said why how ever should i lay me down without jack streets nightingale strains as from some pomegranate tree to soothe mine ears and weigh my eyelids down nightingale cicely sellis shook her head a jackass braying through a trump of iron might make such sounds were he well beaten whilst he blew but assuredly no thing of feathers hes not so bad as that the widow kendall did her best to sound as if she were sincere indeed not hes worse by far cicely sellis said and master willsir williamlieth not behind stout doors which with distance do help the unseemly racket to abate but in the selfsame chamber that he be not deafened quite wonders me greatly the odd thing was shakespeare had meant what he said however appalling hed found the glaziers snores when street first moved into the lodginghouse they were only background noise to him these days know you sir william you are and shall ever be welcome here so that you pay the rent when tis due not to save her soul could jane kendall have omitted that qualifying clause i thank you shakespeare said dutifully he might have been less dutiful had he not known she would have told ingram frizer the same as long as whatever men the ruffian killed in the parlor were not themselves tenants of hers with autumn dying and icyfanged winter drawing nigh night came early shakespeare made his way through darkness to his ordinary sir william kate exclaimed when he walked into the smoky warmth and light she dropped him a pretty curtsy he started to ask how she knew as he had back at the lodginghouse then someone at a table by the fireplace waved to him there sat nick skeres and thomas phelippes will you sup with us sir william skeres called by the way he slurred his speech hed already drained the goblet in front of him a good many times shakespeare took a stool and sat down beside phelippes the sallow pockmarked little mans face was also flushed behind his new spectacles at first shakespeare thought the firelight lent him color then phelippes breathed wine into his face is it a celebration the poet asked naught less sir william by my troth phelippes said grandly more warmthmore expression generallyin his voice than shakespeare was used to hearing from him raising his goblet he called out to kate somewhat to drink here prithee my throats parched as the afric desert anon sir anon she answered as servers often did when they were in less of a hurry than their customers what sort of celeb shakespeare stopped he pointed first at phelippes then at skeres do i behold by any chance sir thomas and sir nicholas you do sir william nick skeressir nicholas skeres nownodded and giggled bravely done gentlemen shakespeare clasped hands with phelippes and skeres in turn hed suspected the one and feared the other whose appearances like those of a petrel foretold storms ahead but the storms had passed and the fear and suspicion with them theyd all been on the same side and their side had won that was plenty to make them a band of brothers at least for tonight kate set bowls of beef stew before skeres and phelippes my thanks sweetheart skeres said and leered at her shakespeare eyed his new brother as abel must have eyed cain but his jealousy passed when he saw kate ignoring skeres pointing to a bowl he asked thats this evens threepenny supper she nodded shakespeare said ill have the same then and sack for accompaniment another penny she warned as if he didnt know as much already be it so he said ill bring it you presently willsir william kate hurried off is not our hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench skeres watched her hips work as she went shes an honest woman shakespeare replied with some asperity she is a woman therefore to be won nick skeres ran his tongue wetly over fleshy lips shes beautiful and therefore to be wooed a dull thump came from under the table skeres yelped and grabbed at his ankle here what occasioned that he said thou jolthead seest thou not shes the poets phelippes hissed shakespeare didnt think he was supposed to catch that but he did skeres kept rubbing at the injured ankle but his face cleared i cry your pardon sir williami knew not he said shakespeare waved it aside kate brought him his goblet of sack saying supper in a moment he nodded watching skeres skeres watched the serving woman shakespeare nodded again this time to himself hed expected nothing else he trusted kate skeres he didnt think anyone would ever be able to trust sir nicholas skeres he raised his goblet your good health gentlemen he said and god save the queen they all drank god hath saved her indeed phelippes said likewise hath he saved this her kingdom that all feared lost for ever to the dons and to the priests kate set shakespeares bowl of stew before him this time skeres gaze didnt light on her bosom or her haunches the newly minted knight lifted his glass of wine heres to the cecils father and son he said without em he shook his head sine quibus non thomas phelippes said shakespeare nodded without the cecils there would have been no uprising he and skeres and phelippes drank a pity lord burghley lived not to see his grand scheme flower shakespeare said he was moses who led his folk to the promised land but to whom it was not given to enter therein but he died well pleased in his son the which was not given to philip of spain phelippes replied a philip still ruled spain of course but not the philip philip ii would always be the philip this i know full well having seen the kings despatches to don diego flores de valdas philip iii speaks no french he prefers to stay indoors playing the guitar he hath not learned the use of arms nor knows he naught of matters of state so spake his father the king god grant it be so that elizabeth may the more readily outface him shakespeare finished his goblet of sack and waved for another kate brought it to him the knife he used to skewer chunks of meat was the one hed got from the roman soldier at the theatre having regained her throne she hath methinks outfaced him thomas phelippes said for how shall he again bring england under the yoke why only by another armada hath he the will een with the will hath he the means by all ive seen nay and nay that was so reasonable so plausible and so much what shakespeare wanted to hear he wouldnt have argued with it for the world nick skeres saw something else without the dons to back em well revenge ourselves on the damned howling irish wolves too ay shakespeare nodded he rememberedhow could he forget the shivers isabella and alberts irish mercenaries had always raised in him let them have their deserts for bringing terror to honest englishmen what england had done in ireland never entered his mind he thought only of what england might soon do in ireland once more phelippes also nodded wisely that lieth already in train he said good shakespeare and skeres spoke together they might fall out on many things concerning irishmen they were of one mind kate brought more sack several times shakespeare knew his head would pound come morning morning would be time enough to worry about it though meanwhile meanwhile nick skeres emptied his goblet one last time got to his feet and burst into song the master the swabber the boatswain and i the gunner and his mate loved moll meg and marian and margery but none of us cared for kate for she had a tongue with a tang would cry to a sailor go hang she loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch yet a poet might scratch her wherere she did itch then to sea boys and let her go hang several people in the ordinary laughed a couple of men clapped their hands shakespeare spoke to thomas phelippes get this swabber hence forthwith ere he swab the floor he clenched his fists hed had enough wine to be ready to brawl if phelippes said no but phelippes answered and so i shall sir william he turned to skeres come along good sir nicholas youve taken on too much water your wit sinks fast water skeres shook his head no by god twas finest sherrissack all the worsewinell sink what floats on water phelippes steered him towards the door he nodded once more to shakespeare give you good night sir william and to you sir thomas so that you get him away shakespeare said skeres started singing again phelippes pushed him out the door and into the street kate came over to shakespeare that sir nicholas is truly a knight she asked methinks he is a knight indeed shakespeare answered i trust not his word alone but master phelippessir thomasi do credit whateer skeres might do hed not lie about such business the serving woman shook her head in bemusement a strange new world that hath such people int ay belike but after that careless agreement passed shakespeares lips he realized kates remark held more truth than hed first seen newly free after ten years under spanish dominion england could hardly help being a strange place those whod served the dons were paying for it those whod suffered under them were raised high few had dared trust very far under isabella and albert and a good many might not dare trust very far under elizabeth either kates thoughts stayed on the personal he had no call to sing of me so she said nor of you neither hes a cunning cove nick skeres but not so cunning as not to think himself more cunning than he is shakespeare said he watched kate work through that and smile when she got to the bottom of it she went off to bring supper to a couple of men at another table he waited patiently sipping wine till the last of the other customers went home then kate carrying a candle they walked up the stairs to her room as she began to undress by that dim flickering light she turned away from him all at once shy her voice low and troubled she said a player may love a serving woman but shall a knight in that cramped chamber one step took him to her he caught her in his arms under his hands her flesh was soft and smooth and warm he bent close to her ear to answer assuredly he shall ant please her that he do she twisted around towards him her kiss was fierce what thinkest thou she said his mouth trailed down the side of her neck to her bared breasts he lingered there some little while she murmured and pressed him to her ah sweet theres beggary in the love that can be reckoned he said he couldnt have told which of them drew the other to her narrow bed afterwards though she fought tears while he dressed when he tried to soothe her she shook her head thourt grown a great man she said wilt not find a grand lady to match thee why so have i done he replied and kissed her once more go to she laughed though the tears hadnt gone away thourt the lyingest knave in christendom and i love thee fort she got out of bed to put on her own warm woolen nightgown now begone and may thou soon come hither again sweet sir william alas that i go he said and took the candle stub to light his way downstairs he was almost back to his lodginghouse before pausing to wonder how his wife would greet the news of his knighthood when he did he wished he hadnt annes first worry without a doubt would be over how much money it was worth he shrugged what with one thing and another she wouldnt need to fret about that he had plenty to send back to stratford she and his daughters would not want past that past that anne wouldnt care and neither did he his head did ache when he got up in the morning a mug of the widow kendalls good ale with his breakfast porridge helped ease the pounding the reticent sun of late autumn was just rising when he started for the door sir william he might be but he had a play to put on at the theatre or so he thought till the door opened when he was still a couple of strides from it a toughlooking fellow with a rapier on his belt came in sir william shakespeare he said it wasnt a question even so shakespeare wondered if he ought to admit who he was after a couple of heartbeats hesitation he nodded asking what would you you are ordered to come with me ordered say you by whom whither by her majesty the queen to westminster the man snapped will you come or do you presume to say her nay i come shakespeare said meekly the theatre would have to do without him for the morning he got another surprise when he went outside a horse waited there to take him to westminster yet another armed man holding its head the beast looked enormous shakespeare mounted so awkwardly the bravo whod gone in to get him let out a scornful snort he didnt care he hadnt ridden a horse since hurrying back to stratford to say farewell to his son hamnet and he couldnt remember his last time on horseback before that he nodded to the toughlooking man lay on good sir and ill essay to follow be it so then the man said doubt in his voice he urged his horse forward with reins voice and the pressure of his knees against its sides shakespeare did the same his mount a goodnatured and welltrained mare obeyed him with so little fuss that by the time hed gone a couple of blocks he felt as much centaur as man the man whod held the poets horse brought up the rear on his own beast way make way the bravo in the lead bawled whenever they had to slow for foot traffic or other riders or wagons and carts make way for the queens business sometimes the offenders would move aside sometimes they wouldnt when they didnt shakespeares escort bawled other more pungent things outside the entrance to st pauls the head and quartered members of a corpse were mounted on spears they were all splashed with tar to slow rot and help hold scavengers at bay despite that shakespeare recognized the lean even ascetic features of robert parsons before he saw the placards announcing the demise of the catholic archbishop of canterbury sic semper tyrannis one of those placards declared wast for this you so long ate the bitter bread of exile shakespeare wondered wast for this you at last came home parsons might have answered ay he had the strength and courage of his belief no less than his foes of theirs and much good he got from them shakespeare thought a rook the bare base of its beak pale against black feathers fluttered down and landed on top of the dead churchmans head tar or no tar it pecked at parsons cheek more bodies and parts of bodies lined the road from london to winchester rooks and carrion crows and jackdaws and sooty ravens fluttered up from them as riders went past then returned to their interrupted feasting looking back over his shoulder at shakespeare his escort said may those birds wax as fat on the flesh of traitors as frenchmens geese crammed full with figs and nuts shakespeare managed a nod he feared feeble he rejoiced that england was free but revenge no matter how sweet at first grew harsh to him he saw the need he would have been blind not to see the need but he could not rejoice in it others many others felt otherwise as isabella and albert had before herand indeed as she often had before themelizabeth stayed at whitehall servitors whod likely bowed and scraped before philip iis daughter and her husband shot shakespeare scornful glances for his plain doublet and hose but their manner changed remarkably when they found out who he was elizabeths throne was offcenter on the dais till a few weeks before two thrones had stood there at the queens right hand on a lower chair sat sir robert cecil since he was small and crookbacked he had to tilt his chin up to speak to his sovereign making his lowest leg to queen elizabeth shakespeare murmured your majesty you may stand straight sir william god give you good day as elizabeth had been at the theatre she was armored against time with wig and paint and splendid gown only her bad teeth still shouted out how old shed grown i am your servant your majesty shakespeare said but command me and if it be in my poor power it shall be yours by my troth i the queens eyes remained sharp enough to pierce like swords under that stern gaze his words stumbled to a stop he hardly dared breathe then elizabeth smiled and it was as if spring routed winter i called you here not to serve me but that i might reward you according to my promise when i made you knight she said that you shall not want it pleaseth me that sir robert settle upon you the sum of she looked to cecil three hundred fifty pound he said gragramercy shakespeare stammered bowing deeply along with what hed got from sir roberts father and from don diego for boudicca and king philip he was suddenly a man of no small wealth i am ever in your debt not so but rather the reverse elizabeth said how joyed i am that so good event hath followed so many troublesome endeavors laborious cares and heedful undertakings you may guess but i best can witness and do protest that your success standeth equal to the most thereof and so god ever bless you in all your actions for myself i can but acknowledge your diligence and dangerous adventure and cherish and judge of you as your grateful sovereign what you would have of me ask and i will spare no charge but give with both hands honor here i love for he who hateth honor hateth god above shakespeare gaped did that could that mean what it seemed to he could name whatever he wanted in all the world and the queen would give it to him before he could begin to speak sir robert cecil did his voice dry as usual sir william i say this onlyseek no more gold of her majesty for she hath it not to give england yet being all moils and disorders i understand shakespeare hadnt intended to ask for more gold that would have been like asking for a fourth wish from a fairy who had given three a good way to lose all he might have gained he paused to gather his thoughts then spoke directly to elizabeth your majesty when a lad in stratford i made a marriage i do repent me of romish doctrines being once more oerthrownhe saw in his minds eye the rook landing on robert parsons tarred head outside st paulsyou may order it dissevered an it please you have you issue from the said union elizabeth asked two living daughters your majesty and a son now two years dead he answered hamnet poor hamnet i would settle on the girls mother a hundred pound of your generous bounty that they may know no want all the days of their lives a hundred fifty pound elizabeth said sharply shakespeare blinked he hadnt expected that kind of dicker but he nodded so did the queen she turned to sir robert let it be made known to clerks and clerics that this is my will to which they are to offer no impediment just so your majesty cecil said the queen gave her attention back to shakespeare here then is one thing settled be there more three wishes he thought again dizzily your majesty will know he said that whilst i wrote boudicca i wrote also another play this latter one entitled king philip elizabeth nodded i do know it say on sir william you pique my curiosity what would you in aid of this king philip shakespeare took a deep breath king philip the man is dead for which all england may thank a god kind and just by your gracious leave your majesty id fain have king philip live upon the stage what queen elizabeths eyebrows came down and together in a fierce frown hed startled her and angered her too this play you writ for the dons for the invaders and despoilers and occupiersshe plainly used the word in its halfobscene senseof our beloved homeland prayingi do hopeit would neer be given youd now see performed how have you the effrontery to presume this of me licking his lips shakespeare answered i ask it for but one reason that in king philip lieth some of my best work the which id not have go for naught would she understand all he had to make his mark on the world were the words he set on paper he marshaled no armies no fleets he issued no decrees he didnt so much as make gloves as his father had without words he was nothing not even wind and air instead of answering directly elizabeth turned to sir robert you have read the play whereof he speaketh cecil nodded i have your majesty sir thomas phelippes whilst in the employ of don diego made shift to acquaint my father and me therewith and what think you on it the queen inquired your majesty my opinion marches with sir williams though philip be dead this play deserves to live it is most artificial and full of clever conceits the queens eyes narrowed in thought philip did spare me where he might have slain she said musingly at least half to herself een if as may well be he reckoned the same no great mercy i being mured up behind tower walls and i pledged my faith to you sir william you should have that which your heart desireth wherefore let it be as you say and let king philip be acted without my hindranceindeed with my good countenance tis noble to salute the foe the same pricking against my honor not but conducing thereto again your majesty many thanks shakespeare said by your gracious leave here you show the world your nobleness of mind judging from her selfsatisfied smile that touched elizabeths vanity be there aught else you would have of me she asked him he nodded one thing more an it please you also touching somewhat upon king philip go on she said a spanish officer a lieutenant de vega was to play juan de idiaquez the kings secretary he being now a captive id beg of you his freedom and return to his own land de vega methinks i have heard this name aforetimes elizabeth frowned as if trying to remember where a tiny shrug suggested she couldnt why seek you this is he your particular friend my particular friend nay id say not so though we liked each the other as well as we might each being loyal to his own country but he is a poet and a maker of plays in the spanish tongue if poets come not to other poets aid who shall no one not in all the world de vega lope de vega queen elizabeths gaze sharpened i have heard the name indeed a maker of comedies not so the guards at the tower did with much approbation speak of some play of his offered before the usurpers this summer gone by following italian i could betimes make out their spanish your majesty i have found the same shakespeare said you are certain he is captive and not slain i am having taen him myself shakespeare said very well let him go back to spain and make comedies for the dons provided he first take oath never again to bear arms against england absent that oath captive he shall remain elizabeth turned to robert cecil see you to it sir robert assuredly your majesty cecil said this de vega is known to me not the worst of men coming from him that sounded like high praise a kind thought sir william to set him at liberty i thank your honor shakespeare said it were remiss of me also to say no word for mistress sellis a widow dwelling at my lodginghouse her quick wit amongst other things the poet thoughtbalked lieutenant de vega of learning we purposed presenting boudicca in place of king philip and haply of thwarting us in the said enterprise let her be rewarded therefor elizabeth said she asked sir robert cecil think you ten pound sufficeth peradventure twenty were better he said elizabeth haggled like a housewife buying apples in springtime fifteen she declared fifteen and not a farthing more sir robert sighed fifteen then just as you say your majesty so shall it be ay that well befits a queen elizabeths face and voice hardened as who should know more clearly than i having thrown awayupon my troth cruelly thrown away in harshest confinement ten years of this life i shall have back never again wherein not in the least respected was one single word from my lips for a moment she seemed to imagine herself still in the tower of london to have forgotten robert cecil and shakespeare and her guardsmen and the very throne on which she sat then she gathered herself be there aught else required for your contentment sir william your majesty an i may not live content by light of your kind favor i make me but a poor figment of a man shakespeare replied a courtesy worthy of a courtier the queen said which might have been praise or might have been something else altogether very well then you may go god bless your majesty shakespeare bowed one last time he doth bless me indeed elizabeth said for long and long i wondered but ay he blesseth me greatly shakespeare turned away so he wouldnt see tears in his sovereigns eyes rain pattered down on lope de vega it hadnt snowed yet for which he thanked god next to him another spanish soldier coughed and coughed and coughed consumption lope thought gloomily he was just glad the black plague hadnt broken out among his miserable countrymen no snow no plague such were the things for which he had to be grateful these days and his headaches came less often he supposed he should have been grateful for that too but he would have been more grateful to have no headaches at all on the other hand if he hadnt been thwacked senseless and left for dead he probably would have died in the savage fighting that had claimed so many spaniards hecautiouslyshook his head damned if ill be grateful for almost having my head smashed like a melon dropped on the cobbles an englishmanan officer by his baskethilted rapier and plumed hatstrutted into the bearbaiting arena lope paid him no special attention plenty of englishmen and women still came to the arena to look over the spanish prisoners as if they were the animals that had formerly dwelt here lope had seen catalina ibaaez on her englishmans arm only that once one more small very small thing for which to be grateful then the officer took out a scrap of paper and peered down at it shielding it from the rain with his left hand lope de vega he bawled wheres lieutenant lope de vega lope de vega stand forth i am here de vega got to his feet what would you sir come you with me and straightaway the englishman replied gods good fortune go with you senor the consumptive soldier said gracias lope said and then louder and in english i obey the officer led him out of the arena only a few feet from where lopes two mistresses had discovered each other the fellow said you are to be enlarged lieutenant so that you give your holy oath nevermore to bear arms against england and presently to quit her soil be it your will to accept the said terms and swear your oath before god sir you mean this you seek not to make me your jest lope asked hardly daring to believe his ears before god lieutenant no such wicked thing do i the english officer replied the order for your freedomprovided you swear the oathcomes from sir robert cecil by direction of her majesty the queen i ask again will you swear it right gladly will i de vega said by god and the virgin and all the saints i vow that if it be your pleasure to set me at liberty i shall never again take up arms against this kingdom and shall remove from it fast as ever i may doth it like you well enough sir or would you fain have me swear somewhat more twas a round romish oath but i looked for none other from a spaniard the officer said i am satisfied indeed lieutenant and declare you free god go with you lope bowed and with you for your generous chivalry he hesitated then let out an embarrassed chuckle i pray your pardon for a grateful mans foolish question but how am i to get me hence without a hapenny to my name for my purse was slit or ever i was taen did you ask me this i was told to give you these two good gold angels a pound in all after returning the bow the englishman set the coins in lopes hand sir william saith godspeed and and safe journey homeward sir william lope scratched his head i know none of that name and title but lord burghley may he rest in peace he made the sign of the cross the english officer started to do the same then abruptly caught himself and scowled he forgot he is a catholic no more de vega thought with amusement he dared not show the englishman said whether you ken him or no lieutenant he doth know you which beareth the greater weight oh that he know me assuredly and i do thank you for conveying to me his kind gift for not stealing it he meant the english officer had to think someone would check on him you are welcome the officer pointed north towards the wharves of southwark and across the thames london there belike youll find a ship to hie you to france or the netherlands a man strode towards the bearbaiting arena a tall fellow about lopes own age with neat chin whiskers and a high forehead made higher by a receding hairline there belike ill find a friend de vega waved and raised his voice to call will thought you to find me within youre come too late for theyve set me free god give you good day master lope shakespeare answered and if you be newenlarged he hath given you a good day indeed will you dine with me i would but i may not for i am sworn to quit england instanter whod grudge your going with a full belly shakespeare said to an ordinary first and thence the docks lope let himself be persuaded after the prisoners rations hed endured he couldnt resist the chance for a hearty meal half a roast capon washed down with rhenish wine made a new man of him though shakespeare had to lend him a knife with which to eat he stabbed the fowls gizzard and popped it into his mouth when hed swallowed the chewy morsel he said you do me a great kindness the more so as i would have slain you when last we met that was in another country shakespeare saidnot quite literally true as isabella and albert had fled the night before but close enough the english poet added and besides the witch lives yet a great sorrowful pity she doth live lope said none take it amiss you served spain as best you might shakespeare said mistress sellis did likewise for england puta lope muttered but let it go at broken wharf in london lieth the oom karl shakespeare remarked she takes on board woolen goods bound for ostend and sundry other flanders ports might she serve your need peradventure she might de vega sighed a swagbellied hollander ship by her name with a swagbellied hollander captain at the con id liefer not put my faith in such butanother sighbetimes we do as needs must not as likes us there you speak sooth as i well know shakespeare said ah lope said sits the wind so which reckon you the play under compulsion that which holp to free your heretic queen or that which would have praised a catholic king to his surprise shakespeare answered both nor knew i which would play nor which be reckoned treason until the very day truly truly the english poet said and lope could not help believing him that is a marvel ill not deny he said and rose to his feet shakespeare got up too the oom karl said you he asked shakespeare nodded lope had asked only for forms sake he remembered the name of the ship it might indeed serve him well ostend lay within the spanish netherlands from there he could easily find a ship bound for spain and home home even the word seemed strange hed spent almost a third of his lifeand almost all his adult lifehere in england what would madrid be like after ten years under a new king would anyone there remember him would that printer captain guzman knew have put his plays before the world that might help ease his way back into the spanish community of actors and poets he dared hope im for broken wharf then he said good fortune go with you shakespeare set a penny on the table between them here this for the wherryman to take you oer the thames my thanks lope scooped up the coin you english be generous to your foes i own this fine dinner and a penny from you master will and i have a pound in gold of some english knight to pay my way towards spain do you indeed shakespeare murmured he gave de vega an odd almost sour smile belike we think us well shut of you belike you should lope came around the table stood on tiptoe and kissed shakespeare on the cheek god guard thee friend spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman shakespeare said and gave back the kiss if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made just so lope left the ordinary without looking back when he got to the river he waved for a boatman waving in reply the fellow glided up he touched the brim of his cap whither would you sir broken wharf as close by the oom karl as you may de vega replied lets see your penny the wherryman said lope gave him the coinstamped he saw with isabella and alberts images well theyd fled england before him the wherryman touched his cap again his grin showed a couple of missing teeth broken wharf it shall be your honor and right yarely too he did put his back into the stroke and his heart into the abuse he bawled at other boats on the river he had to fight the current broken wharf lay some distance upstream from london bridge almost to st pauls as the wharf neared lope pointed to a threemasted carrack tied up there the oom karl he asked ay sir the same the wherrymans voice suddenly rose to a furious scream give way thou unlicked bearwhelp de vega far from the strongest of swimmers wondered if he could make it to the carrack after what looked like a sure collision somehow though his mans boat and the other didnt smash together he decided god might possibly love him after all the wherryman took it all in stride he glided up to the base of the wharf we are arrived sir good fortune go with you gramercy lope scrambled out of the boat he walked up the wharf towards the oom karl a tall man with a bushy blond beard and a gold hoop in one ear stood on deck calling orders in guttural dutch to the crew and cursing fluently in english at the longshoremen hauling crates and bundles aboard the ship god give you good day lope called to him also in english youre bound for ostend whats your fare a clay pipe clenched between the tall mans teeth twitched sa seaor were bound for ostend he replied in spanish as quick and confident as his english and dutch to catch lopes accent from so little he had to have a good ear as well as a clever tongue as for the faretwo ducats should do two ducats made ten shillingsthat would swallow one of lopes precious and irreplaceable angels i have english money he said returning to his own mother tongue ill give you five shillings no the fellow said his voice flat and hard a spaniard leaving englands in no place to bargain youll pay what i tell you and thank god and the blessed virgin it isnt more yes or no de vega knew he had no choice if he stayed here hed be fair game and how the englishmen would enjoy pulling him down once he got to ostend he could hope for the charity of his own countrymen there he nodded and choked out the word he had to say yes come aboard then and give me your money the blondbearded man said around his pipe were fully laden or near enough as makes no difference well weigh anchor and set sail when the tide turns alles goed kapitein adams a sailor said as lope handed the piraticallooking skipper his gold coin that was close enough to english to let lope follow it it also surprised him captain adams he asked youre an englishman i took you for dutch will adams at your service adams said in english and made a leg at him very much at your service now i have your angel he flipped the coin up into the air caught it and stuck it in his belt pouch will you go below now or stay on deck until we sail by your leave id liefer stay de vega answered as you wish so i told you after that captain adams went back to dutch the crew obeyed him as if he were one of their own countrymen before long the last longshoreman scurried off the carrack the sailors stowed the gangplank up came the anchors men straining at the capstans at bow and stern they brought in the lines that bound the oom karl to the wharf as she began to slide downstream with the current sails blossomed on her masts london bridge loomed ahead will adams skillfully steered the ship between two piers her masts missed scraping against the planking of the bridge by only a couple of feet had the thames run higher she couldnt have got free there beyond the bridge stood the tower of london lope stared at it as the carrack glided past then he looked east towards the north sea soon londonsoon all of englandwould lie behind him in spite of everything he was on his way home kates eyes got big and round a bill of divorcement she whispered ay shakespeare nodded i begged it of the queen and she gave it me he took her hands in his that being so art thou fain to wed me i will with all my heart i will dear will but she hesitated then nodded as if deciding the question had to be asked but what of your your lady wife in stratford what of your daughters there they shall not want not for nothing the queen hath settled on them a hundred and fifty pound shakespeare didnt mention that that was part of what shed given him he could wish it were otherwise but knew better than to complain never in all his dreams had he imagined getting so much of what he wanted kates eyes widened again a hundred and fifty pound jesu a princely sum in sooth but wherein lieth the justice they having more than thou when thou hast done so much for elizabeth and they naught fear not my sweeting for justice is done they have not more than i shakespeare assured her and her eyes went wide once more he nodded by my halidom kate tis true right glad was i to wed thee taking thee for no richer than any other player who might here chance to sup kate said ant be otherwise ant be otherwise why right glad am i and i shakespeare said he kissed her the kiss took on a life of its own they still clung to each other when the door opened and a customer came in the man swept off his hat and bowed in their direction as they sprang apart your pardon i pray ye i meant not to disturb ye you are welcome sir kate said as the fellow sat down what would you have some of what you gave your tall gentleman thered like me well he replied but belike he hath the whole oft that failing whats the threepenny supper this even mutton stew is it indeed well a bit o muttons always welcome the man winked at shakespeare kate squeaked indignantly shakespeare took an angry step forward the customer raised a hand nay sir nay mistress i meant no harm by it twas but a jest for mine own part i am one that loves an inch of raw mutton and i am wellprovided with three bouncing wenches id not quarrel over a foolish quibble shakespeare didnt want to quarrel either but he also didnt want to look like a coward in front of kate he sent her a questioning glance only when she nodded did he give the other man a short stiff bow let it go then many thanks sir many thanks for your kindness may i stand you to a mug of beer and your lady as well certes the stranger lifted his hat again cedric hayes at your service i am glad you see sir that where a man may fight at need tis not that he needs must fight hayes plucked a knife from his belt with a motion so fast shakespeare could hardly see it he flung the blade it stuck quivering in the planking of a window frame an instant later another knife thudded home just below it sblood shakespeare said any man who fought with you would soon repent of it belike for aye ah but you knew that not when you chose courtesy hayes rose went over to the knives so he could pull them free and sheathed them again tis a mountebanks trick i own but mountebank i am and so entitled tot might you show this art upon the stage master hayes shakespeare asked gladly would i show it wheresoever i be paid for the showing the knifethrower replied who are you sir and what would you have me do shakespeare gave his name proudly kate corrected him sir william shakespeare ah cedric hayes bowed very much at your service sir william i have seen somewhat of your work and it liked me well i ask again what would you have me do in some of the companys plays romeo and juliet and prince of denmark spring first to mindyour art might enliven that which is already writ an you show yourself trusty i shall write you larger parts in dramas yet to come i am not like to a trusty squire who did run away hayes said where i say i shall be i shall what i say i shall do that likewise most excellent shakespeare said know you the theatre beyond bishopsgate certes sir many a time and oft have i stood mongst the groundlings to laugh at will kemps fooling or hear dick burbage bombast out a blank verse burbage wouldnt have been happy to hear kemp named ahead of him shakespeare resolved never to mention that he said go you thither at ten o the clock tomorrow i shall be there and burbage as well well put you through your paces that we may know your different several gaits gramercy master shakespearesir william i should say hayes raised his mug a fortunate meeting your good health shakespeare said and he drank too after cedric hayes finished his supper he left the ordinary shakespeare got out pen and ink and paper and set to work what a relief to be able to write without having to fear the gallows or worse if the wrong person happened to glance over his shoulder at the wrong moment he didnt have to look up anxiously whenever someone new came into the ordinary either being able to concentrate on his work meant he got more done it also meant he did look up in surprise when a man loomed over him oh he said setting down his pen and nodding to the newcomer give you good even constable god give you good eden as well walter strawberry replied gravely may you obtain to paradise my thanks shakespeare said why come you hither before answering strawberry grabbed a stool from a nearby table and sat down across from the poet why sir why for that i may hold converse with you but convertings thirsty work and sohe raised his voice and waved to katea cup of wine and sprackly too anon sir anon she said and went back to whatever she was doing when the wine didnt arrive at once constable strawberry sent shakespeare an aggrieved look anon saith she yet she comes not am i then anonymous that she doth fail to know me shakespeare scratched his head was strawberry garbling things as usual or had he made that jest on purpose probably not not by his expression shakespeare gave kate a tiny nod she rolled her eyes but brought the constable what hed asked for i thank you he said grudgingly id thank you more had you come sooner theres the difference twixt our sexes kate agreed her voice sweet eh what mean you strawberry demanded kate pretended not to hear him shakespeare stared down at the tabletop so the constable wouldnt see his face strawberry muttered to himself then spoke aloud i thank god i am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offenses just so sir shakespeare said why are you come i asked aforetimes but you said not strawberry frowned maybe he had trouble remembering why hed come to the ordinary shakespeare wouldnt have been surprised but then his heavy features brightened methought youd fain hear the report from mine own lips better the report from your lips sir than from a pistol shakespeare said gravely but of what report speak you why the one i am about to tell of course the constable replied what is the point the gist the yolk the meat tis meet indeed i should tell you strawberry said and as for the point it lieth neath his hat kate muttered whats that whats that am i resulted swounds no good resultll spring from that i do declare spell out your meaning plain then shakespeare urged and so i shall by bowels and constipants constable strawberry said you have denied acquaintance with the felonious cove hight ingram frizer i do deny it still shakespeare said yes the two men he knew frizer had killed had died at the order of sir robert cecil or his father yes sir robert sat at elizabeths right hand these days but who could say how many others frizer had slain who could say how many hed robbed or beaten anyone who admitted knowing him was either a fool or a felonious rogue in his own rightconstable strawberry for once hadnt misspoken in describing frizer so as if the poet had avowed knowing frizer rather than denying it strawberry said belike you will rejoice to hear he is catched if he be the high lawyer and murtherer you say what honest man would not rejoice shakespeare said may he have his just deserts nay no marchpane no sweetmeats no confits for that wretch the constable replied he lieth in gyves in the clink and lieth also ins teeth in declaiming he hath done naught amiss an i mistake me not theres plenty a miss he hath done could give him the lie too i know not if truth be known i care not neither shakespeare said and in aid of misses i care but for one he smiled at kate she came over the stand behind him and set her hands on his shoulders ah sits the wind so walter strawberry asked shakespeare and kate both nodded he reached up and put his right hand on hers strawberry beamed much happiness to you thenand may you know no misfortune master shakespeare again shakespeare wondered whether he used his words cleverly or just blindly before he could decide kate said style him as is proper master constable he is sir william you sir a knight strawberry said i am shakespeare admitted marry i knew it not constable strawberry looked from him to kate and back again and marry you shall meseems welladay i do congregate you and wish you all domestic infelicity kate growled down deep in her throat now shakespeare forestalled her patting her hand he said i thank you in the spirit with which you offer your kindly wishes spirits not a bit of em sir williamtis wine before me strawberry got to his feet and now having come i must needs away good night good night he lumbered out of the ordinary the poet stared after him confused one last time was that good night good night or good night good knight or perhaps even good knight good night shakespeare decided he didnt care he stood up too and kissed his intended and forgot all about walter strawberry historical note for the spanish armada to have conquered england in would not have been easy king philips great fleet would have needed several pieces of good fortune it did not get a friendlier wind at calais perhaps one that might have kept the english from launching their fireships against the armada and a fallingout between the dutch and english that could have let the duke of parma put to sea from dunkirk and join his army to the duke of medina sidonias fleet for the invasion of england getting spanish soldiers across the channel would have been the hard part had it been accomplished the spanish infantry the best in the world at the time and commanded by a most able officer very probably could have beaten elizabeths forces on land had the spaniards won philip did intend to invest his daughter isabella with the english throne through his descent from the house of lancaster she had a claim to it he also did intend to marry her to one of her austrian cousins albert is the one she wed in real history in his plots leading up to the sailing of the armada philip was willing to seek the death of most of elizabeths advisers but wanted lord burghley spared thus i thought it legitimate to preserve him alive for purposes of this novel nicholas skeres and ingram frizer are two of the men who in real history killed christopher marlowe in what may or may not have been deliberate murder rather than a brawl over the bill at eleanor bulls ordinary at deptford on may frizer was the one who actually inflicted the deadly wound skeres by his record preferred con games to outandout violence the date above is old style the difference between englands julian calendar and the gregorian which in real history was not adopted in the englishspeaking world until plays its role in the story here edward kelley counterfeiter and alchemist was an associate of john deesand also like skeres and frizer and marlowe himself belonged on the fringes of the murky world of elizabethan espionage so did anthony bacon francis older brother who was indeed involved in a scandal pertaining to what the elizabethans called sodomy in france before the time of the armada francis himself had similar tastes though in real history they did not come to light till well into the seventeenth century very little of what is supposed to be boudicca and king philip is my own work i am not a true elizabethan blankverse beast as george bernard shaw called marlowe most of boudicca is taken from john fletchers bonduca a variant on the name of the queen of the iceni who is also widely though incorrectly known as boadicea fletcher was shakespeares younger contemporary and probably though not certainly his collaborator in henry viii the two noble kinsmen and the lost cardenio a prolific dramatist fletcher collaborated most frequently with francis beaumont my boudicca does not follow his bonduca in plot he had his purposes which are far removed from mine i have taken his lines out of order and out of context and have adapted them as i found necessary he did not give boudiccabonducas younger daughter a name i have supplied one he called judas the roman soldier i have named marcusi do not believe shakespeare would have been so unsubtle as to use that particular name other bits of the fictional drama here come from henry viii and shakespeares king john from marlowes tamburlaine both the first and second parts and from william averells an exhortacion to als english subjects the last of which i confess to casting into blank verse a measure of the importance of drama in the elizabethan world and its possible use in rebellions against the state is the presentation of shakespeares richard ii before the rebellion of the earl of essex sir robert devereuxessex wanted to use the play to show the people of london that a sovereign might be overthrown he failed but that he made the attempt is significant what purports to be king philip is made up of adapted bits and pieces of titus andronicus it is fortunate that spain and parma scan the same as rome and titus the merchant of venice henry viii and thomas hughes the misfortunes of arthur lope de vega holds a position in spanish literature not far removed from that of shakespeare in english he did in fact sail in the armada and was one of the lucky few to return safely to spain he had a lively time with women all through his life the alert reader will note cribs from shakespeare scattered through the pages of ruled britannia one of the pleasures of the research for this novel was reading all of shakespeares surviving work and fitting in phrases and lines wherever they would go there really was a woman named cicely sellis charged with witchcraft but she was not the same as the character in this book and did not live in london captain will adams is also a historical figure constable walter strawberry is not but his origins should be obvious
