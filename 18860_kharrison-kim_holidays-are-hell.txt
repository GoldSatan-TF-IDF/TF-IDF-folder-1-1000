holidays are hell by kim harrison lynsay sands vicki pettersson marjorie liu two ghosts for sister rachel kim harrison chapter i stuck the end of the pencil between my teeth brushing the eraser specks off the paper as i considered how best to answer the employment application what skills can you bring to inderland security that are clearly unique to you sparkling wit i thought twining my foot around the kitchen chair and feeling stupid a smile the desire to smear the pavement with bad guys sighing i tucked my hair behind my ear and slumped into the kitchen chair my eyes shifted to the clock above the sink as it ticked minutes into hours i wasnt going to waste my life eighteen was too young to be accepted into the is intern program without a parents signature but if i put my application in now it would sit at the top of the stack until i was old enough according to the guidance counselor like the recruiter had said there was nothing wrong with going into the is right out of college if you knew thats what you wanted to do the fast track the faint sound of the front door opening brought my heart to my throat i glanced at the sunsetgloomed window jamming the application under the stacked napkins i shouted hi mom i thought you werent going to be back until eight damn it how was i supposed to finish this thing if she kept coming back but my alarm shifted to elation when a high falsetto voice responded its eight in buenos aires dear be a dove and find my rubbers for me its snowing robbie i stood so fast the chair nearly fell over heart pounding i darted out of the kitchen and into the green hallway there at the end in a windbreaker and shaking snow from himself was my brother robbie his narrow height came close to brushing the top of the door and his shock of red hair caught the glow from the porch light slushwet dockers showed from under his jeans totally inappropriate for the weather on the porch behind him a cabbie set down two suitcases hey i exclaimed bringing his head up to show his green eyes glinting mischievously you were supposed to be on the vamp flight why didnt you call i wouldve come to get you robbie shoved a wad of money at the driver door still gaping behind him he opened his arms and i landed against him my face hitting his upper chest instead of his middle like it had when we had said goodbye his arms went around me and i breathed in the scent of old brimstone from the dives he worked in the tears pricked and i held my breath so i wouldnt cry it had been over four and a half years inconsiderate snot had been at the west coast all this time leaving me to cope with mom but hed come home this year for the solstice and i sniffed back everything and smiled up at him hey firefly he said using our dads pet name for me and grinning as he measured where my hair had grown to you got tall and wow hair down to your waist what are you doing going for the worlds record he looked content and happy and i dropped back a step suddenly uncomfortable yeah well its been almost five years i accused behind him the cab drove away headlamps dim from the snow and moving slowly robbie sighed dont start he begged i get enough of that from mom you going to let me in he glanced behind him at the snow it is cold out here wimp i said then grabbed one of the suitcases ever hear about that magical thing called a coat he snorted his opinion hefting the last of the luggage and following me in the door shut and i headed down the second longer hallway to his room eager to get him inside and part of our small family again im glad you came i said feeling my pulse race from the suitcases weight i hadnt been in the hospital in years but fatigue still came fast moms going to skin you when she gets back yeah well i wanted to talk to you alone first flipping the light switch with an elbow i lugged his suitcase into his old room relieved id vacuumed already blowing out my exhaustion i turned with my arms crossed over my chest to hide my heavy breathing about what robbie wasnt listening he had taken off his jacket to show a sharplooking pinstripe shirt with a tie smiling he spun in a slow circle it looks exactly the same i shrugged you know mom his eyes landed on mine how is she i looked at the floor same you want some coffee with an easy motion he swung the suitcase i had dragged in up onto the bed dont tell me you drink coffee half my mouth curved up into a smile sweat of the gods i quipped coming close when he unzipped a front pocket and pulled out a clearly expensive bag of coffee if the bland environmentally conscious packaging hadnt told me what was in it the heavenly scent of ground beans would have how did you get that through customs intact i said and he smiled i checked it his arm landed across my shoulders and together we navigated the narrow hallway to the kitchen robbie was eight years older than me a sullen babysitter who had become an overly protective brother who had then vanished fourplus years ago when i needed him the most fleeing the pain of our dads death i had hated him for a long time envious that he could run when i was left to deal with mom but then i found out hed been paying for moms psychiatrist plus some of my hospital bills we all helped the way we could and it wasnt like he could make that kind of money here in cincinnati robbie slowed as we entered the kitchen silent as he took in the changes gone was the cabinet with its hanging herbs the rack of dogeared spell books the ceramic spoons and copper spell pots it looked like a normal kitchen which was abnormal for mom when did this happen he asked rocking into motion and heading for the coffeemaker it looked like a shrine with its creamer sugar special spoons and three varieties of grounds in special little boxes i sat at the table and scuffed my feet since dad died i thought but didnt say it i didnt need to the silence stretched uncomfortably id like to say robbie looked like my dad but apart from his height and his spare frame there wasnt much of dad about him the red hair and green eyes we shared came from mom the earth magic skill i dabbled in came from mom too robbie was better at ley line magic dad had been topnotch at that having worked in the arcane division of the inderland security the is for short guilt hit me and i glanced at the application peeking out from under the napkins so robbie drawled as he threw out the old grounds and rinsed the carafe you want to go to fountain square for the solstice i havent seen the circle close in years i fought to keep the disappointment from my facehe had been trying to get tickets to the takata concert crap sure i said smiling well have to dig up a coat for you though maybe youre right he said as he scooped out four tablespoons glanced at me and then dumped the last one back in the bag you want to go to the concert instead i jerked straight in the chair you got them i squealed and he grinned yup he said tapping his chest and reaching into a pocket but then his long face went worried i held my breath until he pulled a set of tickets from a back pocket teasing me booger i said falling back into the chair brat he shot back but i was in too good a mood to care god i was going to be listening to takata when the seasons shifted how cool was that anticipation made my foot jiggle and i looked at the phone i had to call julie she would die she would die right on the spot how did your classes go robbie said suddenly his back was to me as he got the coffeemaker going and i flushed why was that always the second thing out of their mouth right after how tall youve gotten you graduated right he added turning duh i scuffed my feet and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear id graduated but admitting id flunked every ley line class i had taken wasnt anything i wanted to do got a job yet my eyes flicked to the application im working on it living at home while going to college hadnt been my idea but until i could afford rent i was kind of stuck here twoyear degree or not smiling with an irritating understanding robbie slid into the chair across from me his long legs reaching the other side and his thin hands splayed out wheres the bat i didnt see it in the drive oh crap scrambling up i headed for the coffeemaker wow that smells good i said fumbling for two mugs what is that espresso like i knew but i had to say something robbie knew me better than i knew myself having practically raised me it had been hard to find a babysitter willing to take care of an infant prone to frequently collapsing and needing shots to get her lungs moving again i could feel his eyes on me and i turned arms over my chest as i leaned back against the counter rachel he said then his face went panicked you got your license didnt you oh my god you wrecked it you wrecked my car i didnt wreck it i said defensively playing with the tips of my hair and it was my car you gave it to me was he yelped jerking straight rache what did you do i sold it i admitted flushing you what i sold it turning my back on him i carefully pulled the carafe off the hot plate and poured out two cups sure it smelled great but i bet it tasted as bad as the stuff mom bought rachel it was a classic which is why i got enough from it to get my black belt i said and he slumped back exasperated look i said setting a cup beside him and sitting down i couldnt drive it and mom cant keep a regular job long enough to get a months worth of pay it was just taking up room i cant believe you sold my car he was staring at me long face aghast for what to be able to dance like jackie chan my lips pressed together i was mad at you okay i exclaimed and his eyes widened you walked out of here after dads funeral and didnt come back i was left trying to keep mom together and then everyone at school found out and started pushing me around i like feeling strong okay a car i couldnt drive wasnt doing it but the gym was i needed the money to get my belt so i sold it he looked at me guilt shining in the back of his eyes you ah want to see what i can do i asked hesitantly robbies breath came in fast and he shook himself no he said eyes on the table you did the right thing i wasnt here to protect you it was my fault robbie i whined its not anybodys fault i dont want to be protected im a lot stronger now i can protect myself actually i looked at the application my fingers cold as i reached for it i knew he wouldnt approve but if i could get him on my side we might be able to convince momand then i wouldnt have to wait actually id like to do more than that he said nothing as i pulled the paper out like a guilty secret and shoved it across the table my knees went weak and i felt the hints of lightheadedness take over god how could i ever hope to be a runner if i didnt have enough nerve to bring it up with my brother the sound of the paper rasping on the table as he picked it up seemed loud the furnace clicked on and the draft shifted my hair as i watched his gaze travel over the paper slowly his expression changed as he realized what it was his eyes hit mine and his jaw clenched no he went to crumple the paper and i snatched it away im going to do this the is robbie said loudly are you crazy thats what killed dad it is not i was there he said so where were you feeling the hit he shifted to the back of the chair thats not fair neither is telling me i cant do something simply because it scares you i accused his brow furrowed and i grabbed my cup of coffee sliding it between us is this why youre so hell bent on those karate classes he asked bitterly its not karate i said and yes it puts me ahead of everyone else with my twoyear degree i can be a full runner in four years four years robbie i dont believe this robbie crossed his arms over his chest mom is actually letting you do this i stayed silent ticked robbie made a derisive noise from deep in his chest she doesnt know he accused and i brought my gaze up my vision was blurring but by god i wasnt going to wipe my eyes rachel he coaxed seeing me teetering in frustration did you even read the contract they have you forever no way out youre not even twenty yet and youre throwing your life away i am not i shouted my voice trembling what else am i good for ill never be as good as mom at earth magic ive tried flipping burgers and selling shoes and i hated it i hate it i almost screamed robbie stared clearly taken aback then ill help you get a real degree all you need is the right classes my jaw clenched i took the right classes and i have a real degree i said angry this is what i want to do running around in the dark arresting criminals rachel be honest you will never have the stamina and then his expression blanked youre doing this because of dad no i said sullenly but my eyes had dropped and it was obvious that was part of it robbie sighed he leaned to take my hand across the table and i jerked out of his reach rachel he said softly if dad was here hed tell you the same thing dont do it if dad was here hed drive me to the is office himself i said dad believed in what he did with his life he didnt let danger stop him he just prepared for it better then why did he let himself get killed robbie said an old pain in his pinched eyes hed tell you to expand on your earth witch degree and find something safe safe i barked shifting back damn it now id never convince mom i needed her signature on the application or id have to wait until i was nineteen that meant id be twentythree before i was actually making money at it i loved my mom but i had to get out of this house if dad was here hed let me i muttered sullen you think so robbie shot back i know so it was silent apart from my foot tapping the chair leg and the ticking of the clock i folded up the application and snapped it down between us like an accusation reaching for my coffee i took a swig trying not to grimace at the taste i dont care how good it smelled it tasted awful i couldnt believe people actually enjoyed drinking this stuff robbie stood startling me as the chair scraped and bumped over the linoleum where are you going i asked not home for five minutes and we were arguing already to get something he said and walked out i could hear him talking under his breath and the harsh sound of a zipper as he opened his suitcase his bedroom door slammed shut and the familiar stomp of his feet in the hall as he came back was loud i knew i was wearing that same unhappy ugly look he had when he dropped a heavy book on the table in front of me happy solstice he said slumping into his chair i waited not knowing what to say what is it a book he said shortly open it i scooted closer and tucked my hair behind an ear it was as big as a dictionary but the pages were thick not thin the stark brightness told me it was a new book but the charms in them id never even heard of them thats an eighthundredlevel textbook from the university in portland he said voice harsh now that you have your twoyear degree i wanted to ask if you would come out with me to take classes my head came up he wanted me to go out to the west coast with him mom too he added and then his expression shifted to pleading look at those spells rachel look what you can do if you apply yourself and invest some time if you go into the is you wont ever be able to do charms like that is that what you want lips parted i looked at the pages i was okay with earth magic but these looked really hard robbie i my words cut off and i stared at the page oh wow i breathed looking at the charm see robbie coaxed his voice eager look at that stuff its yours if you want it all you have to do is work for it no look i said shoving the book across the table and standing to follow it around see theres a charm to summon the wrongfully dead i can ask dad i can ask dad what he thinks i should do robbies mouth dropped open let me see that he said bending over the book holy shit he breathed long fingers trembling youre right he was wearing a smile when he pulled his gaze from the pages tell you what he said leaning back with a look i recognized the one he used to wear when he was getting me into trouble you do this spell to summon dad and ask him if it works you do what he says my pulse quickened you said it was an eighthundredlevel spell yeah so what i thought for a minute and if he says i should join the i s ill sign the application myself mom gave me your guardianship right after dad died i couldnt seem to get enough air it was a way out and if i cant do it what then then you come out to portland with me and get your masters so you can do every single charm in that book but you have to do the spell yourself front to back start to finish i took a deep breath and looked at it at least it wasnt in latin how hard could it be deal i said sticking my hand out deal he echoed and we shook on it chapter squinting i crouched to put my gaze level with the graduated cylinder knees aching with a familiar fatigue as i measured out three ccs of white wine it was this years pressings but i didnt think that mattered as long as the grapes had been grown here in cincinnati in effect carrying the essence of the land my dad had lived and died on my moms light laughter from the other room pulled my attention away at a critical moment and the wine sloshed too high she was cloistered in the living room with robbie under the impression that i was making a lastminute solstice gift and the kitchen was totally off limits which meant i was trying to figure out this crappy spell without robbies help see this was why i wanted to be a runner id be so damn good i could afford to buy my spells i grimaced as i straightened and looked at the toofull cylinder glancing at the hallway i brought it to my lips and downed a sip the alcohol burned like my conscience but when the liquid settled it was right where it was supposed to be satisfied i dumped it into moms crucible she had gone over it with a finegrit sandpaper earlier this afternoon to remove all traces of previous spells as if dunking it in salt water wasnt enough she had been thrilled when i asked to use her old equipment and it had been a trial getting everything i needed amid her overenthusiastic wantingtohelp interference even now i could hear her excitement for my interest in her area of expertise her crisp voice louder than usual and with a lilt i hadnt heard in a long time though robbie being home might account for that all on its own i leaned over the textbook and read the notes at the bottom of the page wine and holy dust are invariably the building blocks of choice to give spirits substance scratching the bridge of my nose i glanced at the clock this was taking forever but id do anything to talk to my dad again even if the spell only lasted until daybreak it was getting close to eleven robbie and i would have to leave soon to get a good spot at fountain square for the closing of the circle my mom thought robbie was taking me to the takata concert but we needed a whopping big jolt of energy to supplement the charms invocation and though we could find that at the concert the organization of a several hundred witches focused on closing the circle at fountain square at midnight would be safer to tap into i had really wanted to go to the concert and sighing for the lost chance i reached to snip a holly leaf off the centerpiece it would give the spell a measure of protection apparently i was going to open a door and holly would insure my dads essence wouldnt track anything bad in on the soles of his feet nervousness made my hands shake i had to do this right and i had to do it without mom knowing if she saw dads ghost it would tear her upsend her back to the mess she was in almost five years ago seeing dad was going to be hard enough on me i wasnt even sure by the description of desired results how substantial a ghost hed be if we both couldnt see him robbie would never believe that id done it right standing at the table i used my moms silver snips to cut the holly leaf into small segments before brushing them into the wine my fingers were still shaking but i knew it was nerves i hadnt done enough to get tired low fatigue threshold or not steadying the crucible with one hand i started grinding the holly leaves with all my weight behind it the lemon juice and yew mix i had measured out earlier threatened to spill as i rocked the table and i moved it to a nearby counter lemon juice was used to help get the spirits attention and shock it awake the yew would help me communicate with it the charm wouldnt work on every ghostjust those unrestful souls but my dad couldnt be resting comfortably not after the way he died my focus blurred and i ground the pestle into the mortar as the heartache resurfaced i concentrated on robbies voice as he talked to my mom about how nice the weather was in portland almost unheard over some solstice tv cartoon about jack frost he didnt sound anything like my dad but it was nice to hear his words balanced against moms again how long has rachel been drinking coffee he asked making my mom laugh two years i thought my arm getting tired and my pulse quickening as i worked crap no wonder my mom quit making her own charms since you called to say you were coming my mom said unaware it was my drink of choice at school as i struggled to fit in with the older students she is trying to be so grown up this last was almost sighed and i frowned i didnt like her in those college classes she continued unaware that i could hear her i suppose its my own fault for letting her jump ahead like that making her sit at home while she was ill and watch tv all day wasnt going to happen and if she knew the work what harm was there in letting her skip a semester here or there brow furrowed i puffed a strand of hair out of my face and frowned i had been in and out of the hospital so often the first four years of public school that i was basically homeschooled good idea on paper but when you come back after being absent for three months and make the mistake of showing how much you know the playground becomes a torture field robbie made a rude noise i think its good for her oh i never said it wasnt my mom was quick to say i didnt like her with all those damned older men is all i sighed used to my moms mouth it was worse than mine which sucked when she caught me swearing men robbies voice had a laugh in it theyre not that much older than her rachel can take care of herself shes a good girl besides shes still living at home right i blew a strand of my hair out of the mix feeling a tug when one caught under the pestle my arm was hurting and i wondered if i could stop yet the leaves were a gritty green haze at the bottom the tv went loud when a commercial came on and i almost missed my mother chiding him you think id let her live in the dorms she gets more tired than she lets on she still isnt altogether well yet shes just better at hiding it my shoulder was aching but after that i wasnt going to stop until i was done i was fine i was better than fine hell id even started jogging though i threw up the first time id run the zoo all those hills everybody throws up the first time but there was a reason there were very few pictures of me before my twelfth birthday and it didnt have anything to do with the lack of film exhaling i set the pestle down and shook my arm it hurt all the way up and deciding the holly was pulped enough i stretched for the envelope of roots id scraped off my moms ivy plant earlier the tiny little roots had come from the stems not from under the ground and the book said they acted as a binding agent to pull the lingering essence of a person together my head came up when the tv shut off but it was only one of them turning on the stereo jingle bells done jazz one of my dads standbys look its snowing again robbie said softly and i glanced at the kitchen window a black square with stark white flakes showing where the light penetrated i miss that you know theres always a room here for you head bowed over the mortar as i worked i cringed at the forlorn sound of her voice the spell had a pleasant wineandchlorophyll scent and i tossed my hair out of the way mom robbie coaxed you know i cant everyones on the coast it was just a thought she said tartly shut up and have a cookie my knees were starting to ache and knowing if i didnt sit down theyd give way in about thirty seconds i sank into a chair ignoring my shaking fingers i pulled my moms set of balances out of a dusty box i wiped the pans with a soft rag then recalibrated it to zero the wine mixture needed dust to give the ghost something to build its temporary body around kind of like a snow cloud needs dust to make snowflakes i had to go by weight since dust was too hard to measure any other way robbie had collected some from under the pews at a church while out shopping for a coat so i knew it was fresh and potent my breath made the scales shift so i held it as i carefully tapped the envelope the dust the wine and the holly would give the ghost substance but it would be the other half with the lemon juice that would actually summon him yewwhich was apparently basic stuff when it came to communing with the dead the ivyto bind it an identifying agentwhich varied from spell to spell and of course my blood to kindle the spell would combine to draw the spirit in and bind it to the smoke created when the spell invoked there wasnt anything that could make the situation permanent but itd last the night lots of time to ask him a question lots of time to ask him why guilt and worry made my hand jerk and i shook too much dust from the envelope please say i should join the is i thought as i alternately blew on the pile of dust and held my breath until the scales read what they should moving carefully to prevent a draft i got the tiny copper spell pot with the lemon juice and carefully shook the dust into it i breathed easier when the gray turned black and sank the box of utensils scraped across the formica table and i dug around until i found a glass stirring rod it was almost done but my pleased smile faltered when robbie asked have you given any thought to coming out with me you and rachel both i froze heart pounding what in hell we had a deal no she said a soft regret in her voice and i stirred the dust in with a clockwise motion paying more attention to the living room than to what i was doing dads been gone a long time robbie pleaded you need to start living again moving to portland would change nothing it was quick and decisive when she used that tone there was no reasoning with her rachel needs to be here she added this is her home this is where her friends are im not going to uproot her not when shes finally starting to feel comfortable with herself i made an ugly face and set the stirring rod aside i didnt have many friends id been too sick to make them when younger the girls at the community college treated me like a child and after the guys found out i was jail bait they left me alone too maybe moving wasnt a bad idea i could tell everyone i was twentyone though with my flat chest theyd never believe it i can get her into the university robbie said his voice coaxing id heard him wield it before to get both of us out of trouble and it usually worked ive got a great tworoom apartment and once shes a resident i can pay her tuition she needs to get into the sun more we had a deal robbie i thought staring at the empty hallway he was trying to work an end around it wasnt going to work i was going to do this spell right and he was going to sign that paper and then i was going to join the is no my mom said besides if rachel wants to pursue her studies cincinnati has an excellent earth magic program there was a telling hesitation but thank you did she tell you shes taking martial arts she said to change the subject and i smiled at the pride in her voice the lemon half was done and i reached for the mortar with the wine and holly mix she got her black belt not long ago my mom continued as i stood to grind it up a little bit more puffing over it i wanted her to tell you but she sold the bat to pay for it robbie finished glumly and i grinned yeah she told me mom rachel doesnt need to know how to fight she is not strong she never will be and letting her go on thinking she can do everything is only setting her up for a fall i froze feeling like id been slapped rachel can do anything my mom said hotly thats not what i mean mom he pleaded i know she can but why is she so fixated on all these physical activities when she could be the top witch in her field if she simply put the time in shes good mom he coaxed shes in there right now doing a complicated charm and shes not batting an eye over it thats raw talent you cant learn that anger warred with pride at his words on my skill my mom was silent and i let my frustration fuel the grinding motions all im saying he continued is maybe you could get her to ease up on trying to be super girl and point out how some guys like smart chicks wearing glasses as much as others like kickass ones in boots the reason rachel works so hard to prove shes not weak is because she is my mom said making my stomach hurt all the more she sees it as a fault and im not going to tell her to stop striving to overcome it challenge is how she defines herself it was how she survived now shut up and eat another damned cookie we get along just fine here my throat was tight and i let go of the pestle only now realizing my fingers had cramped up on it i had worked so hard to get my freaking black belt so the is couldnt wash me out on the physical test sure it had taken me almost twice as long as everyone else and yeah i still spent ten minutes at the back of the gym flat on my back recovering after every class but i did everything everyone else did and with more power and skill than most wiping an angry tear away i used the stirring rod to scrape every last bit off the pestle damn it i hated it when robbie made me cry he was good at it course he was good at making me laugh too but my shoulders were aching beyond belief and a slow lethargy was taking hold of my knees once more i had to sit down again disgusted with myself i sank into a chair elbow on the table my hair making a curtain between me and the rest of the world i wasnt that much stronger now than when they kicked me out of the makeawish camp i was just getting better at feeling it coming on and covering it up and i wanted to be a runner miserable i held my arm against the ache both inside and out but the spell was done apart from the three drops of witch blood and those wouldnt be added until we were at the square mom and robbie had lowered their voices the cadence telling me they were arguing pulling a second dusty box to me i rummaged for a stoppered bottle to put the potion in the purple one didnt feel right and i finally settled on the black one with the ground glass stopper i wiped the dust from it with a dishtowel and dumped the wine mix in surprised when i found that the holly and the ivy bits went smoothly without leaving any behind the lemon half was next and my fingers were actually on the copper pot before i remembered i hadnt mixed in the identifying agent stupid witch i muttered thinking i must want to go to the west coast and bang my head against the scholarly walls the spell wouldnt work without something to identify the spirit you were summoning it was the only ingredient not named it was up to the person stirring it to decide the suggested items were cremation dust hair hell even fingernails would do as gross as that was i hadnt had the chance to get into the attic this afternoon where dads stuff was boxed up so the only thing id been able to find of his was his old pocket watch on my moms dresser i glanced at the archway to the hall and listened to the soft talk between mom and robbie talking about me probably and probably nothing i wanted to hear nervous i slipped the antique silver watch out of my pocket i looked at the hall again and wincing i used my moms scissors to scrape a bit of grimecoated silver from the back it left a shiny patch and i rubbed my finger over it to try to dull the new brightness god shed kill me if she knew what i was doing but i really wanted to talk to my dad even if it was just a jumbled mess of my memories given temporary life my mother laughed and in a sudden rush i dumped the shavings in the soft curlings sank to the bottom where they sat and did nothing maybe it was the thought that counted i gave the potion another quick stir tapped the glass rod off and poured the mess into the glassstoppered bottle with the wine it was done excited i jammed the bottle and a finger stick into my purse the book said if i did it right it would spontaneously boil when i invoked it in the red and gray stone bowl id found in the bottom of a box the spirit would form from the smoke this had to work it had to my stomach quivered as i looked over the electriclit kitchen most of the mess was from me rummaging through moms boxes of spelling supplies the dirty mortar graduated cylinder plant snips and bits of discarded plants looked good strewn aroundright somehow this was how the kitchen used to look my mom stirring spells and dinner on the same stove having fits when robbie would pretend to eat out of what was clearly a spell pot mom had some great earth magic stuff it was a shame she didnt use it anymore apart from helping me with my halloween costume her tools banished to sit beside dads ley line stuff in the attic i dunked the few dishes i had used in the small vat of salt water used to purge any remnants of my spell setting them in the sink to wash later this had to work i was not going to the coast i was going to join the is and get a real job all i had to do was this one lousy spell dad would tell me i could go i knew it chapter the temporary lights of fountain square turned the falling snow a stark pretty white i watched it swirl as i sat on the rim of the huge planter and thumped my heels while i waited for robbie to return with hot chocolate it was noisy with several thousand people witches mostly and a few humans who were good with ley lines or just curious they spilled into the closedoff streets where vendors sold warmth charms trinkets and food the scent of chili and funnel cakes made my stomach pinch i didnt like the pressing crowd but with the fridgesized rock that the planter sported at my back i found a measure of calm it was only fifteen minutes till midnight and i was antsy that was when the lucky seven witches chosen by lot would join hands and close the circle etched out before the fountain the longer they held it the more prosperous the following year was forecast to be my name was in the hat along with robbies and i didnt know what would happen if one of us was drawn it would have looked suspicious if we hadnt added our names when we passed through the spell checker to get into the square i had known about the spell checker of course but id never tried to sneak a charm in before and had forgotten about it apparently a lot of people tried to take advantage of the organized yet unfocused energy that was generated by having so many witches together my charm was uninvoked undetectable unless they searched my pockets not like the ley line witch ahead of me that i had watched in horror while security wrestled him the ground it was harder to smuggle in all the paraphernalia a ley line spell needed all i had was a small stoppered bottle and a palmsized stone with a hollowedout indentation my heels thumped faster and in a surge of tension i wedged my legs under me and stood above the crowd toes cold despite my boots i brushed the snow from the ivy that grew in the small space between the rock and the edge of the planter i searched the crowd for robbie my foot tapping to marilyn mansons white christmas he had set up on the far stage the crowd over there was kind of scary fidgeting my gaze drifted to the only calm spot in the mess the circle right in front of the fountain some guy with city event blazoned on his orange vest darted across the cordonedoff area but most of the security simply stood to form a living barrier one caught my eye and i sat back down you werent supposed to be on the planters take a flier a man said his voice dulled from repetition he was the only person facing away from the circle as he moved through the crowd and i had prepared my nothanks speech before he had even gotten close but then i saw his have you seen me button and changed my mind id take a stinking flier thanks i said holding out my gloved hand even before he could ask bless you he said softly the snowdamp paper having the weight of cloth as i took it he turned away numb from the desperate reason for his search take a flier he said again moving off with a ponderous pace depressed i looked at the picture the missing girl was pretty her straight hair hanging free past her shoulders sarah martin human eleven years old last seen wearing a pink coat and jeans might have a set of white ice skates blond hair and blue eyes i shoved the flier into a pocket and took a deep breath being pretty shouldnt make you a target if they didnt find her tonight she probably wouldnt be alive if and when they did i wasnt the only one using the power of the solstice to work strong magic and it made me sick a familiar figure captured my attention and i smiled at robbie in his new long coat he had a hesitant stopandgo motion through the crowd as he tried not to bump anyone with the hot drinks besides the new coat he now sported a thick wool hat scarf and a pair of matching mittens that my mom had made for him for the solstice he was still in his thin shoes though and his face was red with cold thanks i said when robbie shuffled to a halt and handed me a paper and wax cup good god its cold out here he said setting his cup beside me on the planter and jamming his mittened hands into his armpits i scooted closer to him jostled by some guy youve been gone too long wimp brat a man in an orange security vest drifted past the way opening for him like magic i busied myself with my drink not looking at him as the warm milk and chocolate slid down the bottle of potion felt heavy in my pocket like a guilty secret i forgot tapping into the communal will was illegal i whispered robbie guffawed taking the top off his drink and eyeing me with his birdbright eyes brilliant green in the strong electric lights that made the square bright as noon you want to go home he taunted come to portland with me right now its freaking warmer he was getting me in trouble but thats what he did he usually got me out of it too usually i want to talk to dad i said wiggling my toes to feel how cold they were all right then he sipped his drink turning to shield me from a gust of snow and wind that sent the crowd into loud exclamations are you ready i eyed him in surprise i thought wed find a nearby alley or something the closer the better the more energy you can suck in the longer the magic will last there was that but a noise of disbelief came from me you really think no ones going to notice a ghost taking shape it suddenly hit me i was stirring a white charm in a banned area to get into the is this will look really good on my employment essay robbie gazed over the shorter people to the nearby circle i think youll be all right hes not going to be that substantial and thats assuming you do it right he added teasing shut up i said dryly and i wouldve bobbed him but that he was drinking his hot chocolate marilyn manson finished his really odd version of rudolph the rednosed reindeer and the people surrounding the stage screamed for more theyre drawing names robbie said watching the circle instead of the stage excitement slithered through me and as the crowd pressed closer i levered myself back up onto the planter wall no one would make me leave now for standing on it robbie moved so i could steady myself against his shoulder and from the new vantage point i watched the last of the names pulled from the informal cardboard box i held my breath both wanting to hear my name blared from the loudspeaker and dreading it another man with a city event vest put his head together with an officiallooking woman with white earmuffs the two spoke for a moment her head bobbing then she took the wad of names and strode to the stage where marilyn was blowing kisses and showing off his legs in black tights the crowd turned like schooling fish the noise growing as a path parted for her can you see robbie asked and i nodded bumping my knee against his back a wave of expectation grew to make my fingertips tingle with my back to that huge rock and standing above everyone i had a great view and i watched the woman stand at the stage and peer up at the band someone extended a hand to help her make the jump to the plywood a laugh rippled out when she made the leap and the woman was clearly flustered when she tugged her coat straight and turned to face the crowd marilyn handed her a mike giving her a word or two before the straitlaced woman edged to the middle of the stage im going to read the names now she said simply and the square filled with noise she glanced shyly behind her to the band when the drummer added to it robbie tugged at my coat and i missed the first namebut it wasnt me you should start now he said as he peered up his cheeks red and his eyes eager adrenaline spiked through me to pull me straight and my gloved hand touched the outside of my pocket now at least set it up while everyone is looking at the stage he added and i nodded he turned back around and applauded the next person here on our side of the square there were already two people standing in the middle of the circle flushed and excited as they showed their ids to security i glanced at the people nearest to me heart pounding actually robbie had picked a really good spot there was a narrow space between that big rock and the edge of the planter no one else could get too close and with robbie in front of me no one would see what i was doing the snow seemed to swirl faster my breath left me in little white puffs as i dropped the eggshaped red and white stone to the ground and nudged it into place the shallow dip in it would hold a potionsized amount of liquid it was one of my moms more expensiveand rarespelling utensils and id be grounded for a year if she knew i had it the last name was read and the crowd seemed to collectively sigh disappointment quickly turned to anticipation again as the last lucky few made their way to the circle to sign their name in the event book and become part of cincinnatis history i jumped when the big electric lights shining on the square went out expected but still it got me the tiny distant lights from the surrounding buildings seemed to shine down like organized stars tension grew and while the noise redoubled i dropped to a crouch before the stone and pulled my gloves off jamming them into a deep pocket i had to do this right not only so robbie would get me into the is but i didnt want to go to the west coast and leave my mom alone robbie wouldnt be so mean would he but when he frowned over his shoulder i didnt know my fingers were slow with cold and in the new darkness i twisted the groundglass stopper out gave the bottle a swirl then dumped the potion it silently settled ripples disappearing markedly fast i couldnt risk standing up and possibly kicking snow into it so i could only guess by the amount of noise that the seven lucky people were now in place hurry up robbie hissed glancing back at me i jammed the empty bottle in a pocket and fumbled for the finger stick the snap of the plastic breaking to reveal the tiny blade seemed to echo to my bones though it was unheard over the noise of the crowd then they went silent the sudden hush brought my heart into my throat they had started the invocation i had moments nothing more it was in latina blessing for the following yearand as most of the people bowed their heads i jabbed my index finger my fingers were so cold it registered as a dull throb holding my breath i massaged it willing the three drops to hurry one two and then the third fell staining the wine as it fell through the thinner liquid i watched breathing in the heady scent of redwood now emanating from it robbie turned eyes wide and i felt my heart jump i had done it right it wouldnt smell like that if i hadnt you did it he said and we both gasped when the clear liquid flashed a soft red my blood jumping through the medium mixing it all on its own behind us a collective sound of awe rose soft and powerful i glanced up past robbie a bubble of power swam up from the earth it was huge by circle standards the shimmering field of everafter arching to a close far above the fountain it spread before in the nearby distance the faint resonating of cincinnatis cathedral chimes swelled into existence as the nearby bells began resonating from the magics vibration not the bells clappers we were outside the circle everyone was it glittered like an opal the multiple auras of the seven people gave it shifting bands of blues greens and golds a flash of red and black glittered sporadically red evidence of human suffering that made us stronger and black for the bad we knowingly didthe choice we all had it was breathtaking and i stared at it crouched in the snow surrounded by hundreds but feeling alone for the wonder i felt the hair on the back of my neck pricked i couldnt see the collective power rolling back and forth between the buildingswashing gaining strengthbut i could feel it my eyes went to robbies they were huge he wasnt watching the stone crucible mouth working he pointed a mittened hand behind me i jerked from my crouch to a stand and pressed my back to the stone the liquid in the depression was almost gone sifting upward in a goldensheened mist and i held a hand to my mouth it was personshaped the mist clearly had a mans shape with wide shoulders and a masculine build it was hunched in what looked like pain and i had a panicked thought that maybe i was hurting my dad from behind us a shout exploded from a thousand throats i gasped eyes jerking over my brothers head to the crowd from the far stage the drummer beat the edge of his set four times to signal the start of the allnight party and the band ripped into music people screamed in delight and i felt dizzy the sound battered me and i steadied myself against the stone blame it all to the devil a shaky frightened voice said behind me its hell its hell before she falls holy blame fire i jerked eyes wide and pressing deeper into the stone behind me a man was standing between robbie and mea small man in the snow barefoot with curly black hair a small beard wide shoulders and absolutely nothing on him youre not my dad i said feeling my heart beat too fast well theres one reason to sing to the angels then isnt it he said shivering violently and trying to cover himself and then a woman screamed chapter streaker the woman shouted her arm thick in its parka pointing heads turned and i panicked there were more gasps and a lot of cheers robbie jumped onto the planter beside me and shrugged out of his coat my god rachel he said the scintillating glow from the set circle illuminating his shock it worked the small man was cowering and he jumped at a distant boom of sound they were shooting off fireworks at the river and the crowd responded when a mushroom of gold and red exploded peeking from around one of the buildings fear was thick on him and he stared at the sparkles lost and utterly bewildered here put this on robbie was saying he looked funny in just his hat scarf and mittens and the man jumped startled when robbie draped his coat over him still silent the man turned his back on me tucking his arms into the sleeves and closing the coat with a relieved quickness another firework exploded and he looked up mouth agape at the green glow reflected off the nearby buildings robbies expression was tight with worry shit shit shit he muttered i never should have done this rachel cant you do a damned spell wrong once in a while my heart dropped to my middle and i couldnt breathe our bet damn it this wasnt dad id done something wrong the man hunched before me in bare feet and my brothers new coat wasnt my dad i speculated hell was hot he said shivering this is ccold it didnt work i whispered and he fixed his vivid blue eyes on me looking like a startled animal my breath caught he was lost and afraid another distant boom broke our gaze as he looked to the snowy skies from nearby came a shrill him thats him right over there spinning i found the woman who had screamed earlier security was with her and they were both looking this way its an outrage to all decent folks she said loudly in a huff my eyes went to my brothers crap now what robbie jumped off the planter we have to go the small man was scanning the crowd a look of wonder replacing his fear at my feet robbie grabbed my moms stone crucible and jammed it in his pocket sorry everyone he said with a forced cheerfulness cousin bob what an ass did it on a dare ha ha you won bob dinner is on me i got off the planter but the manthe ghost maybewas staring at the buildings this fearsome catastrophe isnt hell he whispered and then his attention dropped to me youre not a demon his accent sounded thick like an old tv show and i wondered how long this guy had been dead robbie reached up and grabbed his wrist pulling its going to be hell if we dont get out of here come on the man lurched off the planter all three of us stumbled on the slick stone knocking into people wearing heavy winter coats and having red faces sorry robbie exclaimed all of us in a confused knot as he refused to let go of my wrist i squinted as the wind sent a gust of snow at me what did i do wrong i said too short to see where we were going the fireworks were still going off and people in the square had started singing me me me robbie cajoled shoving the ghost ahead of us why is it always about you rachel can you move it a little faster you want to end up at the is waiting for mom to pick you up for an instant i froze oh god mom she couldnt find out hurry up lets go i shouted pushing on the mans back he stumbled and i jerked my hands from him the sight of his bare feet in the snow a shocking reminder of where he had come from holy crap what have i done we found the blockedoff street with an abrupt suddenness the smell of food grew heavy as the crowd thinned my lungs were hurting and i yanked on robbies sleeve his face was tight in bother as he turned to me but then he nodded and stopped when he saw me gasping are you okay he asked and i bobbed my head trying to catch my breath i think they quit following i said but it was more of a prayer than a true thought next to me the man bent double a groan of pain came from him and i lurched backward when he started in with the dry heaves the people nearby began drifting away with ugly looks too much partying someone muttered in disgust poor uncle bob robbie said loudly patting his back gingerly and the man shoved him away still coughing dont touch me he panted and robbie retreated to stand beside me where we watched his hunched figure gasp in the falling snow behind us the party continued at the square slowly he got control of himself and straightened carefully arranging his borrowed coat and reaching for a nonexistent hat his face was almost too young for his short beard he had no wrinkles but those from stress silently he took us in as he struggled to keep his lungs moving his bright blue eyes going from one of us to the other robbie we have to get out of here i whispered tugging on his sleeve he looked frozen in his thin shirt with only his mittens hat and scarf between him and the snow robbie got in front of me to block the mans intent gaze im really sorry we didnt mean to do whatever we did he glanced at the square arms wrapped around himself and shivering this wasnt supposed to happen youll go back when the sun comes up still the man said nothing and i looked at his bare feet over the noise came an aggressive hey you my breath hissed in robbie turned to look and even the man seemed alarmed we need a cab my brother said grabbing my arm and pushing the man forward i twisted out of his grip and headed the other way we wont get a cab five blocks from here we need a bus robbie stared blankly at me and i yelled in exasperation the main depot is just over there they cant close it off come on stop a mans voice shouted and we bolted well robbie and i bolted the guy between us was kind of shoved along we dodged around the people with little kids already leaving headed for the bus stop it took up an entire block length buses leaving from downtown for all corners of cincy and the hollows across the river no one seemed to notice the small mans feet were bare or that robbie was drastically underdressed song and laughter were rampant there robbie panted pointing to a bus just leaving for norwood wait wait for us i yelled waving and the driver stopped the door opened and we piled in my boots slipping on the slick rubber robbie had shoved the man up the stairs ahead of me falling back when the driver had a hissy about the fare i stood a step down and fumed while robbie fished around in his wallet finally he was out of my way and i ran my bus pass through the machine hey the driver said nodding to the back of the otherwise empty bus if he blows chunks im fining you i got your bus pass number missy dont think i wont my heart seemed to lodge in my throat robbie and i both turned the man was sitting alone beside a center pole clutching it with both hands as the bus jerked into motion his bare feet looked odd against the dirty slushcoated rubber and his knees were spread wide for balance to show his bare calves uh robbie said making motions for me to move back hes okay hed better be the driver grumbled watching us through the big mirror every block put us farther from the square closer to home please i said trying not to look desperate were just trying to help him get home its the solstice the drivers hard expression softened he took one hand off the wheel to rummage out of sight beside him with a soft plastic rustle he handed me a shopping bag here he said if he throws up have him do it in there my breath slipped from me in relief thank you shoving the bag into a pocket i exchanged a worried look with robbie together we turned to the back of the bus pace slow we cautiously approached the man as the city lights grew dim and the bus lights more obvious thankfully we were the only people on it probably due to our destination being what was traditionally a human neighborhood and they left the streets to us inderlanders on the solstice the mans eyes darted between us as robbie and i sat down facing him i licked my lips and scooted closer to my brother he was cold shivering but i didnt think he was going to ask for his coat back robbie im scared i whispered and the small man blinked robbie took his mittens off and gripped my hand its okay his inhale was slow and then louder he said excuse me sir the man held up a hand as if asking for a moment my apologies he said breathily what year might this be my brother glanced at me and i blurted its nineteen ninetynine its the solstice the mans vivid blue eyes darted to the buildings now more of a skyline since we werent right among them anymore he had beautiful beautiful blue eyes and long lashes i would have given a bra size for if i had any to spare that is this is cincinnati he said softly gaze darting from one building to the next yes i said then jerked my hand out of robbies when he gave me a squeeze to be quiet what i hissed at him you think i should lie he just wants to know where he is the man coughed cutting my brothers anger short i expect im most sorry he said taking one hand off the pole ive no need for breathing but to speak and to make a body accept that is a powerful trial surprised i simply waited while he took a slow controlled breath im pierce he said his accent shifting to a more formal sound i have no doubt that youre not my final verdict but are in truth he glanced at the driver lips hardly moving he mouthed youre a practitioner of the arts a master witch sir the man wasnt breathing i was watching him close and the man wasnt breathing robbie i said urgently tugging on his arm hes dead hes a ghost my brother made a nervous guffaw crossing his legs to help keep his body heat with him we were right over the heater but it was still cold thats what you were trying to do wasnt it firefly he said yes but hes so real i said hushed i didnt expect anything but a whisper or a feeling not a naked man in the snow and certainly not him pierce flushed his eyes met mine and i bit back my next words stunned by the depth of his bewilderment the bus shifted forward as the driver braked to pick someone up and he almost fell out of his seat grabbing the pole with white hands to save himself you drew me from purgatory he said confusion pouring from him even as he warily watched the people file on and find their seats his face went panicked and then he swallowed forcing his emotions down i suspected i was going to hell i suspected my penance for my failure was concluded and i was going to hell ill allow it looks like hell at first observance though not broken and lacking a smell of burnt amber he looked out the window no horses he said softly then his eyebrows rose inquiringly and you bricked over the canal nasty swill hole it was are the engines powered then by steam beside me robbie grinned he sure uses a lot of words to say anything shut up i muttered i thought he was elegant this isnt hell pierce said and as if exhausted he dropped his head to show me the top of his loose black curls his relief made my stomach clench and burn i looked away uncomfortable thoughts of my deal with robbie came back i didnt know if he would think this was a success or not i did bring a ghost back but it wasnt dad and without dad saying yes to the is robbie would probably take it as a no worried i looked up at robbie and said i did the spell right my brother shifted as if preparing for an argument my eyebrows pulled together and i glared at him i dont care if it summoned the wrong ghost i did the freaking spell right pierce looked positively terrified as he alternated his attention between us and the new people calmly getting on and finding their seats i was guessing it wasnt the volume of my voice but what i was saying being a witch in public was a big nono that could get you killed before nineteen sixtysix and he had clearly died before then robbie frowned in annoyance the deal was youd summon dad he said and i gritted my teeth the deal was i would do the spell right and if i didnt i would come out to portland with you well look i said pointing theres a ghost you just try to tell me he isnt there all right all right robbie said slouching you stirred the spell properly but we still dont know what dad would want so im not going to sign that paper you son of a rachel he said interrupting me dont you get it this is why i want you to come out with me and finish your schooling he gestured at pierce as if he was a thing not a person you did a eighthundredlevel summoning spell without batting an eye you could be anything you want why are you going to waste yourself in the is the is isnt a waste i said while pierce shifted uncomfortably are you saying dads life was a waste you dumb pile of crap pierce stared at me and i flushed robbies face was severe and he looked straight ahead ticked the bus was moving again and i sat in a sullen silence i knew i was heaping more abuse on robbie than he deserved but i had wanted to talk to my dad and now that chance was gone i shouldve known i wouldnt be able to do it right and as much as i hated myself for it the tears started to well pierce cleared his throat embarrassed i wiped my eyes and sniffed you were attempting to summon your father he said softly making nervous glances at the people whispering over pierces bare feet and robbies lack of a coat on the solstice and it was i whom your magic touched i nodded fast struggling to keep from bawling my fool head off i missed him i had really thought i could do it i apologize pierce said so sincerely that i looked up you might should celebrate mistress witch you stirred the spell proper or i expect id not be here that i appeared in his stead means he has gone to his reward and is at peace selfishly id been wishing that dad had missed me so much that he would have lingered and i sniffed again staring at the blur of holiday lights passing i was a bad daughter please dont weep he said and i started when he leaned forward and took my hand youre so wan its most enough to break my heart mistress witch i only wanted to see him i said pitching my voice low so it wouldnt break pierces hands were cold there was no warmth to him but his fingers held mine firmly their roughness stark next to my unworked skinny hands i felt a small lift through me as if i was tapping a line and my eyes rose to his why he said his vivid eyes fixed on mine youre a grown woman but so small my tears quit from surprise im eighteen i said affronted then pulled my hand away how long have you been dead eighteen he murmured i felt a growing sense of unease as the small man leaned back glancing at robbie with what looked like embarrassment my apologies he said formally i meant no disrespect to your intended intended robbie barked and i made a rude sound sliding down from my brother the people who had just gotten on looked up surprised shes not my girlfriend shes my sister then robbies expression shifted stay away from my sister i felt the beginnings of a smile come over my face honestly pierce was a ghost and too old for me even if he was alive at least twentyfour id guess from the look at him all of him i flushed as i recalled his short stature firmly muscled and lean like a small horse used to hard labor glancing up i was embarrassed to see pierce as red as i felt carefully holding his coat closed if the year is nineteen ninetynine ive made a die of it for nearly a hundred and fortyseven years he said to the floor poor man i thought in pity everyone he knew was probably gone or so old they wouldnt remember him how did you die i asked curious pierces gaze met mine and i shivered at the intensity im a witch as much as you he whispered though robbie and i had been shouting about spells for the last five minutes but before the turn being labeled a witch could get you killed you were caught i said scooting to the edge of the bus seat as we swung onto a slick steep road captivated by his air of secrecy before the turn what did they do to you pierce tilted his head to give himself a dangerous air a murder most powerful id have no mind to tell you if youre of a frail constitution but i was bricked into the ground while breath still moved in my lungs buried alive with an angelic guard ready to smite me down should i dare to emerge you were murdered i said feeling a quiver of fear robbie chuckled and i thwacked his knee shut up i said then winced at pierces aghast look if hed been dead for a hundred and forty years id probably just cursed like a sailor sorry i said then braced myself when the bus swayed to a stop more people filed on the last being an angry unhappy woman with more of those fliers she talked to the bus driver for a moment and he grumbled something before waving her on and letting the air out of the brakes leaning back he shut his eyes as the woman taped a laminated flier to the floor in the aisle and two more to the ceiling take a flier she demanded as she worked her way to the back of the bus sarahs been missing for two days shes a sweet little girl have you seen her only on every tv station i thought as i shook my head and accepted the purple paper i glanced down as she handed one to robbie and pierce the picture was different from the last one the glow of birthday candles was in the foreground and a pile of presents in the back blurry and out of focus sarah was smiling full of life and the thought of her alone lost in the snow was only slightly more tolerable than the thought of what someone sick enough to steal her might be using her for i couldnt look anymore the woman had gotten off through the back door to hit the next bus and i jammed the flier in my pocket with the first one as the bus lurched into traffic i know who has her pierce said his hushed excited voice pulling my attention to him the lights of oncoming traffic shone on him lighting his fervent kind of scary expression driver he shouted standing and i pressed into the seat alarmed stop the carriage everyone looked at us most of them laughing sit down robbie gave him a gentle shove and pierce fell back coat flying open for a second youre going to get us kicked off i know where shes been taken he exclaimed and i glanced at the passengers worried the driver though already thought he was drunk and everyone else was snickering about the peep show lower your voice robbie said shifting to sit beside him people will think youre crazy pierce visibly caught his next words and closed his coat tighter he has her he said shaking the paper at robbie the man that beast that murdered me to death the very creature i was charged to bring to midnight justice hes taken another i could tell my eyes were round but robbie wasnt impressed its been almost two hundred years which means little to the bloodlusting foul spawn from hell pierce said and my breath caught vampire he was talking about a vampire a dead one crap if a vampire had her then she was really in trouble you were trying to tag a vampire i said awed you must be good even the is didnt send witches after vampires pierces expression blanked and he looked away not good enough i allow i was there on my own hook with the belief that pride and moral outrage would sustain me the spawn has an unholy mind for young girls which i expect he satisfied without reprisal for decades until he abducted a girl of high standing and her parents engaged my midnight services robbie scoffed but i stared figuring out what pierce was saying was fascinating seeing robbies disinterest pierce focused on me this child he said looking at the paper is the image of his preferred prey i confronted him with his culpability but he is as clever as a philadelphian lawyer and to pile on the agony he informed the constables of my liability and claimed knowledge of the signs pierces eyes dropped and i felt a twinge of fear for the history id missed by a mere generation liability was a mixedcompany term for witchwhen being one could get you killed i suspected spawn was preturn for vampire midnight services was probably code for detective or possibly an early inderlander cop philadelphian lawyer was selfexplanatory truly i was a witch he said softly and i could say no different the girl he murdered directly to protect his name that it was so fast was a grace her fair white body found in solstice snow and wept over she could no more speak to save me than a stick that i showed signs of liability about my person and belongs made my words of no account they rowed me up salt river all night for their enjoyment until being buried alive in blasphemed ground was a blessing this he said shaking the paper is the same black spawn he has taken another child and if i dont stop him he will foul her soul by sunrise to stand idle would be an outrage against all nature i stared at him impressed wow robbie crossed his arms over his chest kind of poetic isnt he pierce frowned looking at robbie with a dark expression i think hes telling the truth i said trying to help but the small man looked even more affronted what would i gain from a falsehood he said this is the same sweet innocence looking at me from my memory that damned spawn survived where i didnt but being dead myself mayhap i can serve justice now i expect i have only to sunup the charm will be spent by then and ill return to purgatory if i can save her perhaps i can save my soul he stopped blinking in sudden consternation at his own words and robbie muttered something i didnt catch i need to study on it pierce said softly as he looked out the windows at the tall buildings spawn are reluctant to shift their strongholds ive a mind that he is yet at his same diggings a true fortress apart in the surrounding hills alone and secluded apart in the hills alone and secluded was probably now high in property taxes and crowded right in the middle of a subdivision i have a map at home i said pierce smiled his entire face lighting up as he held onto the pole the gleam in his eyes had become one of anticipation and i found myself wanting to help him until the ends of the earth if i could see his thanks reflected in them again no one had ever needed my help before ever whoa wait up robbie said turning to face both of us if you know this vampire and think you know where he is fine but we should go to the is and let them take care of it i took a fast breath excited yes the is pierces enthusiasm faltered the is robbie looked out the window probably trying to place where we were inderland security he said pulling the cord to get the driver to stop they police the inderlanders not humans witches weres vampires and whatever his look slid to me and became somewhat wry my sister wants to work for them when she grows up i flushed embarrassed but if i couldnt admit it to a ghost maybe i shouldnt even try pierces free hand scratched at his beard in what i hoped was simply a reflexive action that was what my midnight profession was he said but it wasnt called such the is the bus swayed and squeaked to a stop pierce didnt move holding tight to the pole as robbie and i stood before the bus had halted i waited for pierce letting him walk between robbie and me as we got off the cold hit me anew and i squinted into the snowy night as the bus left you want to wait for a bus going back into town i said and robbie shook his head already on his cell phone im calling a cab he said looking frozen clear through good idea i said cold despite my coat mittens and fuzzy hat we need to go to the mall robbie said and i dont want to waste a lot of time the mall i blurted as we dropped back deeper into the plexiglas shelter what for then i winced you need a new coat phone to his ear and his face red from cold robbie nodded that and its going to be hard enough getting the is to believe were not nuts coming in with a naked man in a coat pierce looked mystified the mall i nodded wondering if hed let me pick out his clothes the mall chapter bored i sat in the comfy brown fabric chair beside pierce and shifted my knee back and forth the mall had been a success but robbie had pushed us from store to store inexcusably fast getting us in and out and to the is in about two hours pierce was now respectably dressed in jeans and a dark green shirt that looked great against his dark hair and blue eyes he still had on robbies coat and i swear he had almost cried when he was able to shift up a half size of boot with the ease of simply pulling another pair off the rack but for the last hour we had been sitting on the thirdfloor reception area doing nothing well pierce and i were doing nothing robbie at least was being taken seriously i could see him down the open walkway at a desk with a tiredlooking officer as i watched robbie took off his new expensive leather jacket and draped it over his lap in a show of irritation pierce hadnt said much at the mall spending a good five minutes trying to locate the source of the mood music until he got brave enough to ask i made sure we passed an electric outlet on the way to get him some underwear the food court had amazed him more than the electric lights though he wouldnt try the blue slurry i begged off robbie the kiddy rides made him smile then he stared in astonishment when i told him it wasnt magic but the same thing that made the lights work that was nothing compared to when he saw a saleslady in a short skirt becoming beet red he turned and walked out his head tilted conspiratorially to robbies for a quiet hushed conversation all i caught was a muttered bare limbs but robbie made sure we went past valerias crypt so he could see the same thing in lace men pierces silence deepened after finding an entire building devoted to inderland law enforcement but even i was impressed with the is tower the entryway was a fabulous three floors high looking more like the lobby of a fivestar hotel than a cop shop pierce and i had a great view of the lower floors from where we sat it was obvious that the designers had used the techniques of cathedral builders to impart awe and a feeling of insignificant smallness low lights on the first floor created dark shadows that set off the occasional burst of light acoustically the space was a sinkhole making what would be a loud chatter into a soft murmur the air carried the faint scent of vampire and i wrinkled my nose wondering if that was what was bothering pierce or if it was that we were three stories up a minor disturbance pulled our attention to the streetlevel entrance as two people witches i guess brought in a third the man was still fighting them his arms securely behind his back and fastened with a zipstrip of charmed silver it looked barbaric but bringing in a violent ley line witch was impossible unless they were properly restrained sure there were ways to prevent magic from being invoked in a building but then half the officers would be helpless too pierce watched until the witch was shoved into an elevator then he turned to me his expressive eyes were pinched when he asked how long have humans known about us and how did we survive giving them the knowledge i bobbed my head remembering pierces shock when two witches started flirting in the mall throwing minor spells at each other weve been out of the closet for about forty years his lips parted out of the closet a grin came over my face sorry we came clean uh we told them we existed after a virus hiding in tomatoesa sort of a plaguestarted killing humans it dropped their numbers by about a quarter they were going to find out about us anyway because we werent dying pierce watched my moving foot and smiled with half his face ive always been of the mind that tomatoes were the fruit of the devil he said then he brought his gaze to mine and gestured to take in the entire building this happened in four decades i shrugged twisting my boot toe into the tightlooped carpet i didnt say it was easy crossing his knees he rubbed his beard as if noticing not many men had them though very quiet since our shopping trip he had clearly been taking everything in processing it even his words few as they had been were starting to sound less odd your brother he said gesturing at him with his chin said you want to devote your life to this i smiled somewhat sheepishly the is yes a sudden worry pulled my brows together why you think i shouldnt no he rushed a daughters wish to follow in her parents occupation is proper startled he knew my dad had worked for the is i caught my breath until i remembered our conversation in the bus oh you heard that he ducked his head yes mistress witch and who am i to tell you the profession of protecting the helpless is too dangerous i live for it i felt a quiver of connection that he might really understand pierce though gave me a wry look lived for it he amended sourly used to arguing about my chosen profession i lifted my chin im stronger every year i said as if he had protested i mean markedly stronger you suffered an illness pierce asked seemingly genuinely concerned i nodded and then feeling some honesty was due added i still am sick sort of but im doing much better everyone says so i have more stamina all the time i attend classes to keep from slipping back and i havent been in the hospital for about four years i should have died so i really dont have any cause to complain but i want to do this damn it they cant keep me out because of my health i got a black belt and everything i stopped realizing not only was i babbling to the first understanding person id found but i was swearing too sorry i said twisting my foot again thats probably gutter talk for you pierce made a soft sound neither accusing nor affirming he was looking at my middle in a soft puzzlement youre passionate he finally said and i smiled in relief i knew he would be gone by sunrise but i didnt want to alienate him i liked him even if he was a ghost oh god i was not crushing on him im in the medical books you know i said trying to get his mind off my bad mouth the only survivor of rosewood syndrome he started turning from where he had been watching robbie argue with his interviewer you rosewood you survived i lost two sisters and a brother to that passed before they were three months are you sure thats what ailed you i smiled because there was no pain in him the hurt apparently was old thats what it was is modern medicine i suppose or all the herbal remedies they gave me at that makeawish camp for dying kids i was there for three years until they kicked me out when i quit dying so fast the wonder was stark in his gaze as he settled back as if not believing it youre a wonder mistress witch i scoffed and ran my fingernails to bump over the chairs fabric im not really a witch yet i havent gotten my license you can call me rachel pierces subtle fidgeting ceased and i looked up to find him staring in sudden understanding i warmed crap giving him my first name might be extremely intimate he certainly didnt seem to know how to react embarrassed i focused on robbie i uh am sorry for bringing you from your rest i said i was trying to call my dad see i had this bet with robbie i said dad my father would want me to put my application into the is and robbie said if he were still alive hed want me to get a higher degree in my earth witch studies so robbie challenged me to call him and ask if i could do it i promised id do what dad said if not id go with robbie and go to school for four more years i didnt figure on him being at peace i suppose i should be glad i said feeling guilty but i really wanted to talk to him miss rachel pierce said and my head came up when he took my hand dont weep for your father i expect hes at rest watching you and wishing you happiness you dont know that i said contrarily pulling away youre stuck in purgatory but instead of taking that as a brushoff he nodded as if he liked it you do know the intent behind your brothers challenge was to prove to you how skilled you are at earth magic so you will follow that path my mouth dropped open and i looked at robbie the dirt bag i whispered well im not doing it i said while pierce puzzled over the modern phrase we dont know if my dad would have approved or not so the deal is off im not going to portland im going to stay here with my mother and become the best damned runner since my dad crap im swearing again i thought then gave pierce an apologetic smile what do you think i should do the small man leaned forward startling me with his intensity i believe he said inches away that if you dont follow your passions you die slowly he was holding my hand again a slow quiver built in me and i pulled my hand away before i shivered outright the office chatter seemed to grow loud and pierce resettled himself my apologies he said clearly not sorry at all ive overstepped my boundaries yeah like i dont want you to its okay i said boldly meeting his gaze ive held hands with guys before and kissed them i wonder what its like to kiss a ghost god he had a beard it would probably be all prickly and nasty but maybe it was soft yanking my thoughts back where they belonged i looked down the open walkway to robbie he was clearly upset as he talked to the man his arms moving in sharp angry motions i wonder what theyre saying i murmured pierce still had that devilish look but i liked it let me see if i can commune with the everafter he said ive a mind to speak a charm to hear them though its wicked to do so but almost immediately his enthusiasm faltered i cant find a line he said touching his beard as if nervous being a spectre one might think it would be easier not forbidden well nuts to that i want to know what robbie is saying in a spontaneous motion i grabbed pierces wrist my focus blurred as i searched for the nearest ley line finding the universitys glowing in my thoughts a dusky red ribbon of power all witches could tap into regardless of where their talents lay reaching out a thought i connected to it warmth spilled into me in a slow trickle running to my chi and making my skin tingle forcing my vision to focus i looked at pierce my pleased smile faded crap id done it again the small man was staring at me as if i had just taken off all my clothes and was dancing naked on the desks so you can do the spell i said in a small voice and took a breath as if only now remembering how to breathe didnt you share lines in your time not often he said setting a hand atop mine so i wouldnt let go but im not there anymore thank you let me do the spell he steadied himself and while i felt like a whore on the corner he flicked a nervous gaze at me with his beautiful deep blue eyes well i prompted im not of a mind to hurt you he admitted then dont pull so much i said glancing at robbie god did he think i was a child um yes he stammered and i shifted my shoulders when i felt a soft draw through me youre fine i encouraged and he pulled more until my hair was floating from static intrigued i watched pierce close his eyes as if trying to remember something his lips moved and i heard the faintest hint of latin dark and alien sounding his free hand sketched a quick figure and then my ears popped a moment he said his hand atop mine tightening to keep me from breaking the link my gaze shot to robbie oh wow i breathed as his voice came clear as if i was listening to a phone wow yes pierce repeated smiling from behind his beard and we turned to listen but i know he took her robbie said forcefully his lips moving in time with the spoken words cant you just get a car out there or something the i s officer he was with had his back to us but i could see he was typing mr morgan i assure you were giving the matter our full attention are you my brother said shell be dead by sunup if you dont do something hes done this before he just made the mistake of taking someone who would be noticed this time the man in his wrinkled suit clicked a window on his computer closed one hand on the mouse he gave my brother a long look and you know this how robbie said nothing and i looked at the entry way floor when the vampire turned to see pierce and me mr morgan the man said his voice thick with dismissal ive taken twelve statements like yours over the past three hours were working on them in turn but you can understand we cant devote all our manpower to one missing child who is angry she isnt getting what she wants for christmas and has run away to her daddy im not a crank robbie said tightly my father used to work in the arcane division and i know real from fake this isnt a joke i breathed easier when the vampire focused on my brother again monty morgan he said and i nodded even as robbie did pierces grip on my hand twitched when the vampire stood the ghosts expression of concern surprised me wait here the officer said ill be right back pleased i smiled at pierce see i said feeling like we were getting somewhere but pierces brow was creased in a deep worry spawn he muttered and while i held his one hand he made a small gesture with the other i stifled a jump when the energy he was pulling off the line through me shifted his lips pressed tight he pointed to the is officer now bending to speak to another clearly higherup officer sir do you have a minute robbies interviewer said his voice clear i couldnt see the new mans face but his tone was bothered as he brought his attention up from his paperwork and said what its the missing girl the first officer said fingers moving nervously behind his back i caught a glimpse of the supervisors face when he turned to robbie it was smooth and nice looking despite his expression of annoyance young so he said shifting his feet the older man bent closer he knows things not released to the press the vampire went back to his paperwork the pencil skating across the form too fast for a human so he said again so hes one of morgans kids i felt a stir of satisfaction when the officer set his pencil down who the witch in arcane robbies interviewer prompted died about four years ago but my pride shifted to a stark fear when the vampire looked at robbie his pupils swelling to black crap i could see it from here he was vamping out but why morgans boy he murmured interested and my pulse quickened something was wrong i could almost taste it i thought he was out of state pierce let go of my wrist and i jumped when the connection between us broke my chi was suddenly overfull and i forced most of the energy back into the ley line i didnt let go of the line completely ready for anything i expect we should leave the small man said eyes darting over the three floors to linger on the buildings main entrance i rubbed my wrist to get rid of the remaining tingles whats wrong pierce eased to the front of the chair and held his coat closed its been my experience that instinct not what youve been taught is the clearest indicator of direction they have a mind that your brother is involved with the girls abduction and is finding reason to beg clemency by cooperating we need to pull foot wait up i said when he rose and drew me to a stand what about robbie as if having heard me my brother met my gaze his face was ashen behind him the two vampires were headed his way clearly frightened he mouthed go your brother wont come to any hurt pierce said and i fell into motion when he gripped my elbow and started us toward the wide stairway they will give him jesse until sure of his innocence but by that time the sun will be risen blame it all i should have been of a state to fix his flint myself i had no idea what he was saying but pierce had us on the first step before the first shout my head whipped around and i stumbled two brutish men were heading our way and with a little gasp i pushed pierce down faster a chime rang through the air and my skin prickled lock down someone shouted damnation pierce swore but our feet were still moving and we had passed the second floor without trouble my pulse was too fast and my lungs hurt but i wouldnt slow down we wouldnt be caught because of me apart from the two guys following us and the uniformed woman standing in front of the doors with her arms crossed over her chest everyone seemed content to watch actually they were moving back making room swell mistress witch pierce said his tone terse as we neared the ground floor my steps barely keeping up with his id respectfully ask that i might commune a line through you he glanced at me shocking me again with how blue his eyes were to help make our escape if there were another way i would use it i slid my hand into his gripping it firmly pull on a line he shot a bewildered look at me and i shouted commune with the everafter my breath hissed in as he did and i squeezed his hand to tell him it was okay power burned like ice as we found the first floor and i felt my tongue tingle pierce gathered himself and with a shout a headsized sphere of everafter enveloped his free hand that came through me i thought in wonder even as we continued to head for the doors pierce threw the ball the witch waiting for us yelped and dove for the floor green power edged in red and black hit the glass doors spreading out like slime a boom shook the air and almost sent me falling glass pushed outward in a silent cascade are you well miss rachel pierce said earnestly when my ears recovered i looked up as he steadied me with his grip tight on my elbow for an instant we stood focused on each other linked by way of the line and our need to escape my inner ear pulsed from the blast behind me shouts started to make sense past the shattered doors came the sound of traffic and the crisp cold of a winter night the witch on the floor looked up from around her fallen hair shocked wow i said and pierces concern eased satisfied i had my balance he let go of my elbow but kept our fingers entwined allow me mistress witch he said gallantly escorting me through the broken glass hey stop someone called my pulse raced and knowing my mom was going to give me jesse when she found out i nevertheless stepped elegantly over the jagged remnants of the door and onto the salted sidewalk a moment pierce said turning and i felt another strong pull through me when he ran two fingers across both the lintel and threshold of the wide doors and a green sheet of everafter swam up from the frozen slush sidewalk to seal everyone inside now we may depart he said exuberantly the light shining out from the is offices showing his good mood perhaps a carriage is in order he said whistling as if he had grown up in cincy but he had watched robbie do the same thing i fear we should make an unpleasant haste the ward wont last long and we must stay holding hands until then i grinned when he was excited he didnt stop to think what he was saying and was charmingly elegant maybe we should walk a few blocks so they dont know what cab we take i suggested otherwise theyll just radio ahead pierces brow creased and he waved away the cab that had pulled up like the music from the boxes he said and i nodded it was close enough then we walk he said with a last wave to the angry is officers behind the greentinted sheet of everafter he tightened his grip on my fingers and we strode down the sidewalk my pulse was fast and i felt breathless id never done anything like this before and i felt alive for the first time in my freaking life i felt alivethe adrenaline making me light and airy and my steps long and sure the snow drifted down peacefully and i wished that i could do this foreverwalk with a mans hand in mine happy and pleasantly warm with this alive feeling running through me he wasnt much taller than me and our steps were closely matched i glanced behind us at the retreating is building then shyly at pierce but his attention was on the buildings and storefront displays i eyed the colored lights and the happy people walking in the snow with lastminute solstice and christmas shoppers finding a final perfect gift no beggars he whispered well a few i said abruptly seeing the street in an entirely different way but theyre probably at the square partying pierce pulled our joined fingers up mine almost blue from the cold i cant keep communing withah pulling a line through you he said softly im not one born in the woods to be afraid of an owl yet to save that child with only my fists i expect is a fools errand do you know he hesitated attention flicking from a truck slushing past and back to me do you know a witchy woman or man i might procure ley line charms from oh i said brightly determined to keep up with him though my chest was starting to hurt of course hed need something seeing as he couldnt tap a line himself the universitys bookstore has an entire floor of ley line stuff im sure theyll have something magic studies in the university he asked and i nodded my free arm swinging but a frown creased his brow and leaning to me he whispered i would prefer a smaller shop if you know of it i dont have even a stick to barter with or a card of credit he added hesitantly as if knowing he hadnt gotten the words in the right order my eyes widened i dont have much money either cab fare is all pierce took a deep breath and exhaled no matter i will suitably impress upon the proprietor my desperate need his chin rose and a defiant gleam entered his eyes as we continued forward i will beg if they are honorable they will help beg eh i though fully believing he would get down on his knees before the night manager at the university bookstore who would promptly throw him out not pleased to be working on the solstice ive a better idea i said praying my mom would go for it my dads stuff was in the attic i knew my mom wouldnt be happy but the worst thing she could do was say no edging us to the curb i searched for a cab ill take you home i said leaning into the street in the universal language of cabbies you can look over my dads old ley line stuff he worked for the is he probably has something pierce drew me back from the curb and i blinked at him surprised his expression was pinched as he stood in the puddle of streetlight and falling snow elegant in his long coat and shiny new boots miss rachel no im not of a mind to endanger you anymore ill escort you home then go alone to the university if there are learned men there they will assist me i winced imagining all pierce would find right now would be halfdrunk students and solstice parties good god pierce i said when a passing cab saw us standing there and did a ubangy im the one that got you involved lighten up but he said and i twined my fingers more surely into his as the cab pulled up im involved youre not getting rid of me so get used to it pierces grip tightened on mine and then he relaxed thank you he said and in those two words i saw how lost he was he had until sunrise to save both the girl and his soul and i was the only one who could get him through this nightmare that i lived in chapter the cabbie drove away from my house slowly the sound of his car muffled from the piled snow in the hollows there would be bonfire parties and neighborhood howls but here on my street it was quiet pierces steps were almost silent next to mine as we left prints on the walk to the porch it had stopped snowing and i looked up at the redbottomed clouds through the cold black branches of the maple tree i had planted for my dad upon his death my throat closed and i touched it in passing i was glad he was at rest but it would have been nice to have had him back again as solid as pierce waseven if just for the night pierce hung back as i went up the three cement steps and twisted the knob to no avail my mom must be out i said swinging my bag around to look for my keys the porch light was on and her prints showed where she had gone to the garage and not come back maybe some lastminute shopping maybe down to the is tower to pick up robbie i had a bad feeling it was the latter this is a very beautiful house pierce said facing the neighborhood and the bright lights and snowmen keeping guard thanks i said as i dug in my jeans pocket for my house key most witches live in the hollows across the river in kentucky but my mom wanted to live here finding my keys i looked up to see a faint bewilderment in his gaze both she and my dad were in high school during the turn and i think she likes passively making trouble when she can get away with itlike living in a predominantly human neighborhood as is the mother so the daughter he said dryly my key was warm and i slipped it into the lock if you like only now did pierce come up the steps giving the street a last look before he did mom i called when i opened the door but i knew from the dull glow of light in the hall coming from the kitchen that the house was empty glancing at pierce on the threshold i smiled come on in pierce looked at the gray slush on his boots im not of a mind to soil your rugs so stomp your feet i said taking his arm and pulling him in shut the door before you let all the heat out the shadow of the closing door prompted me to flick on the hallway light and pierce squinted at it i hated the green color my mom had painted the hallway and living room pictures covered the passage to the kitchen pictures of me and robbie slices of our lives i glanced back at pierce who was still staring at the light but clearly making an effort to not say anything i hid a smile and wondered how much longer his efforts to not look unimpressed would win out over his curiosity you have so many rugs he finally said following suit as i stomped my feet thanks i said and i shuffled out of my coat his eyes finally hit the walls and he reached out and photographs in color youve seen pictures i asked surprised and he nodded ive had my picture taken he said proudly then reached out this is you its beautiful he said in awe the expression the artist captured is breathtaking none of gods landscapes has ever looked so beautiful i gazed at the picture he was touching in reverence and then away with mixed feelings it was a close up of my face among the fall leaves my eyes as green and vivid as all creation my hair bringing out all the shades of autumn clustered about i had just come back from a stint at the hospital and you could see that i was ill by my pale complexion and thin face but my smile made it truly beautiful my smile i had given to my dad as the shutter snapped thanking him for the joy we had found in the simple pleasure of the day my dad took it i said looking away come in the kitchen i said wiping my eye when i noticed it was damp i was supposed to die before him not the other way around i dont know how long my mom will be out i said loudly hearing his steps behind mine but if we can get what we need and leave it will be all the better forgiveness being easier to get than permission pierce entered slowly hesitating by the laminated table and taking in the ticking clock the cold stove and the doublepan sink as i dropped my coat and bag onto my chair you and your mother are alone he asked surprised at the amount of wonder in his voice i hesitated yes robbie is visiting from the west coast but he goes back next week his deep blue eyes came back from the ceiling california oregon pierce looked again at the cold stove undoubtedly guessing its use from the pot of solstice cranberry tea on it now scrummed over and cold your mother is very brave for raising you alone if he only knew how often it was the other way around she should shouldnt she i said going to the coffeemaker and peeking into the filter to find unused grounds you want some coffee taking off his coat pierce draped it carefully over a chair he checked his nonexistent tie then moved his arms experimentally as if taking in how warm it was im of a mind yes but does our limited time allow for it i flipped a switch and the coffeemaker started i kind of liked his extra words it made him sound classy yup you want to help me with the attic without waiting for an answer i went down the other hallway to the rest of the house pierce right behind me thats the bathroom there i said as we passed it my room is at the end of the hallway and my moms is across from it robbie has the front room though its more of a storage room now and the servants are in the attic he asked as i halted under the pulldown stairs servants i asked gaping at him we dont have any servants pierce looked as surprised as i felt but the rugs the photos the warmth of your home and its furnishings his words trailed off as his hands spread wide in question and i flushed when i got it pierce i said embarrassed im totally middle class the closest ive ever come to having a servant is winning a bet and having robbie clean my room for a month the mans jaw dropped this is middle class i nodded stretching up for the pull cord and putting my weight on it most of the city is the trapdoor barely moved and my arms gave out it snapped shut with a bang and i dropped back down on my heels disgusted pierce smoothly took the cord and stepped under the door he wasnt much taller but he had more muscle i can do it i said but my arms were trembling and i backed up while he swung the ladder down like it was nothing but then again it was pierce looked up into the inky blackness spilling cool air down onto us jumping when i flicked on the light sorry i said taking advantage of his surprise by pushing past him and up onto the ladder ill be right back i said enjoying the cooler air up here smelling of wood and dusty boxes the shush of a passing car from outside sounded odd and close arms wrapped around me i looked over the past boxed up and piled haphazardly about like memories in a persons brain it was only a matter of knowing where a thought was and dusting it off my eyes lit upon the stack of carefully labeled tomato boxes that had my stuffed animals a faint smile came over my face and i stepped over the halloween decorations to touch a dusty lid i must have had about two hundred of them all collected during my stints in and out of the hospital i had counted them my friends many taking on the names and personalities of my real friends that never made it out of the hospital that one last time i knew my mom wanted them gone but i couldnt throw them away and as soon as i got my own place id take them with me i lifted the first one and set it aside to find the box hiding under them it was my dads tucked away lest my mom throw it out in a fit of melancholy some of his best stuff i dug my fingernails into the little flaps to get a grip grunting when it proved heavier than i thought god what had i put in here anyway allow me came pierces voice from my elbow and i spun holy crap i exclaimed then covered my mouth feeling myself go red im sorry i didnt know you were up here pierces shock at my language melted into almost laughter my apologies he said and i shifted to let him to lift the box with enviable ease i like attics theyre as peaceful as gods church alone and apart but a body can hear everything the past stacked up like forgotten memories but with a small effort brought down and enjoyed again i listened to the cold night and smiled i know exactly what you mean watching my footing i followed him to the stairway he took the box from me and gestured i should go before him and flattered at the chivalry i did my shoulders eased as the warmth of the house slipped over me and i stood aside when pierce lightly descended he handed me the box to fold the ladder back up but he hesitated at the bare bulb still glowing in the attic without glancing at me for permission he carefully pushed the light switch down of course the light went out a delighted smile came over him and much to his credit he didnt play with the switch but shoved the collapsible ladder closed and back into the ceiling i watched his eyes travel over the lines of it as he did as if memorizing how it worked thank you i said as i went before him back into the kitchen with the box the coffeemaker was gurgling its last and pierce looked at it undoubtedly figuring out what it was from the rich scent that had filled the kitchen if that doesnt cap the climax he said almost missing the table as he set the box down it made itself ill get you some i said as i hustled to the cupboard it smelled great as i poured out two cups and i handed him one our fingers touching he smiled and something tightened in my chest god i am not falling for him hes dead but he did have a nice mischievous smile i hope im not making a mistake drinking this he said how real am i i shrugged and he took a sip eyeing me over the rim to make my breath catch god he had beautiful eyes his eyebrows shot up and jerking he started to violently cough oh golly i said remembering not to swear as i took the cup from him before it could spill im sorry you cant drink huh strong he gasped his blue eyes vivid as they watered really strong i set his cup down and took a sip of mine my mouth tried to pucker up and i forced myself to swallow crap my mom had filled the filter and the coffee was strong enough to kill a cat dont drink that i said taking his cup and mine to the sink its terrible no its fine i froze as he caught my hand i turned feeling his light but certain grip a slow quiver rose through me and i stifled it before it could show as a tremor i was suddenly very aware that we were here alone anything could happenand as the moment hung his silence and almostwords ready to be whispered that he was having thoughts tooi nearly wished it would he was different strong but unsure capable but lost he knew i had been ill and he didnt baby me i liked him a lot maybe and he needed my help no one had ever needed my help before no one especially someone as capable and strong as him its undrinkable i said when i found my voice and he took his cup from me if you made it its divine he said smiling like the devil himself and i felt my heart thump even as i knew he was bullshitting me his fingers left mine and my presence of mind returned i wasnt a fainting debutante to fall for a line like that but still to have a man drink nasty coffee to impress me was way flattering my eyebrows rose and i wondered how far he would go i had half a thought to let him drink the nasty stuff why thank you pierce i said smiling you are a true gentleman i turned to open the box looking over my shoulder in time to see him staring into his mug with a melancholy sigh ten to one he was going to spill it but there was an entire pot to refill his cup with the dust made my nose tickle as i unfolded the flaps a slow smile spread over me as i looked at the stash and saw my dad everywhere hed made many of his own ley line charms for work and being home sick most of the time some of my earliest memories were of him and me at the table while the sun set and he prepped for a night on the street apprehending bad guys i had my crayons he had his chalk and while i colored pixies and fairies hed sketch pentagrams spill wax in ley line figures and burn all sorts of concoctions to make mom wave her hands and complain about the smell secretly proud of him smiling distantly i ran a hand over my hair remembering how it would snarl up from the forces that leaked from his magic as he explained a bit of lore while he worked his eyes bright and eager for me to understand the soft scrape of pierce setting his cup down by the box jerked me from my memories and my focus sharpened is there anything here you can use i asked pushing it closer to him as we stood over it im more of an earth witch or i will be when i get my license miss rachel he said lightly his attention on the boxs contents as his calloused fingers poked around only a witch of some repute can summon those at unrest and only those of unsurpassed skill i expect can furnish them a body a faint smile crossed his eyes even one as transient as this one embarrassed i shrugged one shoulder it wasnt all me most of the energy came from the collective emotions of everyone at the square and whose idea was it to work the charm at the square he said taking out a handful of metallic disks and pins and discarding them into an untidy pile i thought back it had been mine to go to the concert and use the emotion to help strengthen the curse but robbies to use the squares instead robbies i guess pierce held a charm up to the light ah he said in satisfaction this i can use i looked at the thick silver washer with its pin running through it apart from a few ley line inscriptions lightly etched on it the charm looked like the ones hed set aside what is it the mans smile grew positively devilish this likely bit of magic is a noisy lock picker he said then set it beside his cup of coffee noisy pierce was again rummaging it makes an almighty force to jolt the door from its hinges he said lightly oh i peered into the box with more interest and held the flaps out of his way it was like looking into a box of chocolates not knowing which ones were good until you took a bite a pleased sound escaped pierce and he held up another charm his fingertip running over the symbols etched into it this one senses powerful magic perhaps its still working his gaze on the charm he pulled the pin the empty interior of the washerlike charm started to glow a harsh red pierce seemed surprised then he laughed land sakes im a fool you hold it he said handing it over i took it bemused when pierce backed up nearly into the hall a faint cramping seemed to make my palm twitch and the harsh red faded to a rosy pink i glanced at the box of ley line stuff and pierce shook his head coming back and taking it from me again it glowed brilliantly its functioning perfectly he said and the spell went dark when he put the pin back in place ive no mind to guess how effective it will be if its glowing like that from me and he set it gently on the table my lips parted and i looked at him and then the charms on the table youre triggering it i thought it was the spells pierce laughed but it was nice im a spectre walking the earth with a body that is a faint step from being real i expect that qualifies as strong magic flustered i shrugged and he put his attention back in the box this one is for calling familiars he said dropping it onto the table with the discards this one for avoiding people who are searching for you oh this is odd he said holding one up a charm to give a body a hunched back that has to be a misspelling i took it from him making sure our fingers touched yeah he was dead but i wasnt no its right i said its from a costume my dad used to dress up on halloween halloween pierce asked and i nodded lost in a memory for trickortreat id be the mad scientist and hed be my assistant we would go up and down the halls of the hospital my emotions gave a heavyhearted lurch and i swallowed down a lump wed hit the nurses desk in the childrens ward and then the old peoples rooms i didnt want to talk about it and my fingers set it down sliding away with a slow sadness it seemed pierce understood since he was silent for a moment then said you look the picture of health miss rachel a fair spirited young woman grimacing i picked up the charm and dropped it back into the box yeah well try telling my brother that again he was silent and i wondered what his nineteenthcentury morals were making of me and my stubborn determination he said i was spirited but i didnt think that was necessarily a good thing back then this is one id like to take if i might pierce said as he held up a rather large palmsized metallic amulet it detects people within a small space cool i said taking it from him and pulling the pin does it work again that cramping set my hand to feel tingly and odd the entire middle of the amulet went opaque two dots showing in the middle us apparently still works i said replacing the pin and handing it to him you may as well have it ive got no use for it thank you he said dropping it into his pocket with the noisy lock picker and this one it also creates a distraction i grinned another boom spell boom he said then nodded getting it yes a boom spell they are powerful effective i have the understanding to set one unaided but i need to commune with the everafter to do it this one will suffice i had a feeling that most of the spells he was putting in his pocket were ones he knew how to do unaided i mean hed blown the doors in the is tower and then set a ward over them i hadnt minded his using me to draw off the line which made the next step of wanting to go with him easy i mean i could really help him not just this tourguide stuff pierce i said fingering the charm to make a hunchback the mans attention was in the box but he seemed to know where my thoughts lay as his next words were there is no need for you to accompany me miss rachel it has nothing to do with your health and everything to do with me resolving this on my own he pulled out a charm this is a likely one as well momentarily distracted i leaned until our shoulders touched what is it pierce slid down a few inches to put space between us it allows a body to listen upon a conversation in a room set apart my eyebrows rose so thats how they always knew what i was up to he laughed the masculine rolling sound seeming to soak into the corners of the kitchen like water into the dry sand bed of a stream the house had been so empty of it and hearing it again was painful as our lack was laid bare your father was a rascal pierce said not aware i had been struck to the core and was trying to blink back the unexpected tears you say that like its a bad thing i quipped why is this hitting me so hard i thought blaming it upon my recent hope to talk to him again oh look i said my hand diving in to pull out a familiar spell whats this doing in here this is my moms pierce took it from me our fingers touching a shade too long but his eyes never flicked to me its a ley line charm to set a circle but unlike the ungodly rare earth magic equivalent you need to connect to a line to use it my mother is terrible at ley line magic i said conversationally as pierce collected all the discards and dumped them in my moms included my dad used to make all her circles for her she used to set this when she still made his earth magic charms for him i saw him stiffen when i reached back in the box took out my moms amulet and placed it around my neck i can tap a line it will work for me no he said facing me you arent coming ive forbidden it my breath came out in a scoff you forbid it i said tilting my head up look pierce i said hand going to my hip you cant forbid me anything i do what i want i have forbidden you from accompanying me he said as if that settled it im thankful for what you have done and that youre letting me borrow your fathers spells shows how gracious and honorable your spirit is now prove it and stay home as you should you little chauvinistic pig i exclaimed feeling my pulse race and my knees start to go weak trying to hide it i crossed my arms over my chest and leaned against the counter i can help you and you know it just how are you going to get there mr man from the past walk it in the snow its got to be at least fifteen miles pierce didnt seem to be fazed by my temper which ticked me off all the more he calmly shrugged into his long coat and folded the box closed may i still take these he asked eyebrows high i said you could i snapped and im coming too thank you he said dropping the last into a pocket i will try my best to return your fathers belongs to you but its unlikely he turned to go me tight behind him you cant just walk out of here i said my legs shaking from fatigue damn it i hated being like this you dont know where youre going i know where he was before its unlikely hes moved we were in the hall and i nearly ran into pierce when he stopped short at the door eyeing the handle youre going to walk i said in disbelief he opened the door and took a deep breath of dry chill air ive a mind to yes the cold hit me and i held my crossed arms close now for warmth the world is different pierce were out and its harder to find just one of us now that seemed to give him pause i will find him he said and he stepped out onto the snowy stoop i have to my soul and the girls both depend upon it you wont find them before the sun comes up i called after him god what is it with men and their pride then i expect i should run then i expect i should run i mocked in my thoughts then came out on the stoop pierce i said and he turned there was a whisper of hidden heat in his eyes shocking the words right out of my head i blinked at him stunned that it was there and directed at me he wasnt amused at my temper he wasnt bothered by it he respected it even as he told me no thank you miss rachel he said and i stumbled back my eyes darting from his for an instant when my heel hit the frame of the open door i cant endanger you any farther he leaned in and i froze my heart pounded i found my hands against his chest but i didnt push him away you are fiery and bold he whispered in my ear and i shivered like a fey filly who knows her own thoughts and wont be broke but by her will i dont have a mind to be delicate about it if i did i would court you long and lovingly living for the hour when i would earn your trust and your attentions i have but this night so my words must be bold at the risk of offending you and being handed the mitten you didnt i said not knowing what my gloves had to do with it tension had me stiff but inside i was a quivering mix of anticipation id give anything if youd kiss me i said i mean i said when his tilted his head to look at me his eyes wide in shock ive kissed guys before its like a handshake these days i lied just wanting to know what his lips on mine would feel like almost required if youre leaving he hesitated and my shoulders slumped when his fingers began slipping away ah the devil take it he said suddenly then rocked back before i knew what he was doing he curved an arm around my back setting his free hand against the door frame by my head he leaned in and as i took a startled breath his lips found mine a small noise escaped me and my eyes flew wide i stood there on my porch in the cold and electric light and let him kiss me too shocked to do anything else his lips were cool but they warmed against me and his beard was soft his hand at my back kept me to him protective and aggressive all at the same time it sent a tingling jolt to dive to my middle settling low and insistent pierce i mumbled nearly driven to distraction by the sudden passion but when he threatened to pull away i wrapped my arms hesitantly about his waist hell i had been kissed before but they were bad kissers all groping hands and sloppy tongues this was exquisite and it plucked a chord in me that had never been touched he felt it when my desire rebounded into him and with a soft sound that held both his want and restraint he putted away our lips parted and i stared at him shaken to my core damn he was a good kisser you are a most remarkable woman he said i thank you humbly for the chance you have gifted me to redeem my sins redeem sins yeah i stood there like an idiot as he took the stairs with a purposeful gait until he reached the shoveled walk unhesitating he turned to the left and picked up the pace to run damn i swallowed trying to shake it off arms going around myself i glanced up and down the quiet snowhushed street to see if anyone was watching no one was but i imagined pierce had looked before he pinned me to the door like that and kissed me senseless damn i whispered then took a deep breath to feel the cold slip in to replace the warmth he certainly knew what he was doing not only had he gotten me to stay but i wasnt angry with him at all must be a charm charm yeah he was charming all right like that changed anything pulse fast i went inside i flicked off the coffeemaker and then seeing the dusty box sitting there like a red flag waving in the breeze i scribbled a quick note for my mom telling her robbie was at the is and that i had fled with someone i had met at the square who knew who had taken sarah i had the car and was going to help him id be back about sunrise i looked at it then added love yourachel i shivered as i stuffed an arm into a coat sleeve i was going to help a ghost rescue a missing child from a vampire god a dead vamp probably this is what you want to do for a living i muttered as i snatched up a set of keys my fingers trembling if you cant do it now you may as well go to the coast with your brother no way i felt alive my heart pounding and my emotions high it was a great sensation and it stayed with me all the way out to the garage a spring in my step i yanked the garage door up and into the ceiling with a satisfying quickness i usually had to have my mom do it as i strode to the drivers side my fingers traced the smooth lines of the beatup volkswagen bug i had bought with what had been left over from selling the bat it ran most of the time i got in feeling how stiff the vinyl seats were from the cold the temperatures had been dropping steadily now that the snow had stopped and i was freezing please start i begged then patted the steering wheel when it sputtered to life tell me i cant come i whispered turning to look behind me as i backed out with a tinny puttputt of a sound okay i didnt have a real license yet but who was going to give me a ticket on the solstice scrooge still riding the high i putted down the street lights on and scanning the sidewalk i found him two blocks down he was still running but he was in the street now probably after finding too many of our neighbors hadnt shoveled their walks i rolled my window down and pulled up alongside of him he glanced at me then stopped with a look of ambivalence i grinned sorry for ruining your farewell speech i really liked it you want a ride you can drive he said his eyes tracing the cars odd shape of course i can it was cold and i flicked the heat on the almostwarm air shifted my hair and i saw him look at the drifting strands making me wonder what it would feel like if he ran his fingers through it he stood in the freezing night not a puff of breath showing as he stood to look charming in his indecision its powerfully difficult to run and not try to breathe at the same time he finally said do you know the streets to the east hills i nodded and my grin grew that much wider his head down dejectedly he came around the front the lights flashing bright as they hit him i stifled my smile when he fumbled for the latch finally figuring it out and getting in he settled himself as i accelerated slowly you will stay in the carriage when we get there he grumbled stomping the snow from his boots and i just smirked yeah right chapter faint on the cold air was the singing of christmas carolers obvious now that id turned the car off my car door thumped shut the sound muffed from the mounds of snow the plows had thrown up and i breathed slowly pulling the crisp night deep into me above the stars looked especially sharp from the dry air it had gotten cold icecracking cold the faint breeze seemed to go right through my coat it was about four in the morning only inderlanders and crazy humans were up this time of night which was fine by me pierces door shut a moment behind mine and i smiled at him over the car he didnt smile back his brow furrowed in an expression of coming nastiness while he paced around to my side i leaned against the cold metal and gazed at the house we had parked across from we were way up in the hills in the better parts of town where the welltodo had lived ever since inclinedplane railways had made it easy to make it up the steep inclines the house in question was older than that making it remote and lonely in pierces time it was a monster of a house clearly added to and rebuilt along with the times with multiple stories turrets and a wraparound porch of smooth river rocks old money big trees and a fantastic view of cincinnati bright christmas decorations were everywhere flashing in an eerie silent display the sound of pierces shoes crunching on the frozen slush jolted me into motion and i pushed off the car and headed to the wide porch i would request you retire into the carriage and wait he said from beside me i kept my eyes forward as we crossed the street its called a car and you can request all you want but its not going to happen we reached the shoveled sidewalk and pierce grabbed my wrist i jerked to a stop startled at the strength he was using forgive me miss rachel he said lips pressed thin and tight youre full of grit but i simply will not be able to live with myself if harm comes to you because of me my own anger stirred then its a good thing youre not alive huh shaking his head he started to tug me back to the car im sorry for using my advantage to force you truly i am here comes the himhoistingmeoverhisshoulder bit with me kicking and screaming as he locks me in my own car not going to happen let go i threatened as he pulled me a step i mean it pierce let go or youre going to be in a world of hurt but he didnt glad now i didnt have on mittens i yanked him to a stop spun my wrist with a loopdeloo motion into a modified acrobat twinhold on his palm stepped under his arm and flipped him into a snowbank he hit it with a puff of snow staring up at me in surprise land sakes how did you do that he stammered eyes wide in the low street light i stood over him with my hands on my hips utterly satisfied try to lock me in the car again and ill show you pierce started to get up and i reached to help him making a grunt he accepted rising to brush the snow from his long coat with sharp bothered motions im going in there i said nodding at the house miss rachel he started and i took a step forward getting into his face this is what i want to do with my life i said i have a circle amulet im not helpless and you cant stop me shifting on his feet he started to look annoyed rachel im schooled for this and you still ended up dead i shot back thats my very argument a body can see its too dangerous i made a face and he took both my hands in his adding sincerely i know youre of a mind to help youre a brave courageous woman but you mustnt kick this vampire is several hundred years dead and you are eighteen consider it logically i rather liked his fingers in mine but i pulled away not wanting him to make me into putty again logically i said starting to get cold yes lets look at this logically training or not you dont have anything but a few trinkets to help you if you cant tap a line you dont have a chance to rescue that girl without me and you know it he hesitated and i surged ahead at the worried slant to his eyes tell me you dont need me i said pointing that being able to tap a line isnt going to make the difference between saving her or not tell me that pierces gaze went to our feet then rose i cant he said firmly then im coming with you again i started for the door pierce walked a step behind slow and ponderous now i have to watch for you too i heard him mutter but i didnt care i was going i slowed to slip my hand into his he started and i tapped a line energy flowed coolly into me to make my hair start to float around the edges of my hat and i gave his fingers a squeeze its going to be all right i said firmly and i shivered when he pulled a thin trace of power into himself we were almost up to the wide porch with its stylized christmas tree when i realized his intent was to storm the front uh shouldnt we go in the back door or something i asked and he smiled youve listened to too many adventure tales they never expect the front door still i said as he knocked briskly the front door he said glancing askance at me and tugging his coat straight they undoubtedly have made note of our presence and it looks foolish to be caught skulking behind the trash bins i jumped at the rattle of the doorknob a surge of adrenaline and my pulse quickened i stood wideeyed beside pierce as the door opened to show sarah standing alone and beautiful in an elegant dress of old lace her face was pale but her look of fear set one of my worries to rest she hadnt been bitten and bound yet pierce saw her and he smiled and sometimes its that easy sarahs mouth opened its a trap she shrilled still standing there help me with a thump my heart tripped into overdrive i stumbled back when two men in black came from around the doorframe one yanked sarah inside the other reached past the threshold and before i could find the breath to scream jerked us over the threshold now i shrieked finding myself skating across the hardwood floor to slide into the wall in a crumpled heap a loud ow pulled my head up and i found pierce askew on the stairway leading to the upper floors i got to my feet tense and hunched sarah was gone but i could hear her crying her sobs grew fainter but never disappeared a door slammed pierce rose and tossed his black hair out of his eyes his lips were pressed together and he seemed mad at himself more than anything else the remaining man a vampire by the glint of fang and telltale grace was fronting him i stumbled to stand against the wall and he focused on me dont touch me i said feeling a faint pull from his charisma and a lot of fear pierce touched his lip surprise widening his eyes when his hand came away red with blood inform your master i wish to parlay he said his words almost laughably formal we have a small gentlemanmatter standing between us wheres the girl i blurted thinking i could hear her under my feet somewhere the vampire between us and the door smiled chilling me id be more worried about your own neck little witch he said to me but looking at pierce clearly the greater threat christopher pierce shouted and i felt a wash of dizziness come out of your hole you disgusting spawn we have a matter of early interment to discuss the vampire moved i pressed against the wall as he took a toofast step to pierce and smacked him pierce i shouted as the small man fell backwards into the stairs again leave him alone i shouted at the vampire standing at the foot of the stairs the vampire smiled do you have a mommy little girl will she cry for you fear slid down my spine pushing out the fatigue and the dizziness i stood alive for what seemed like the first time too bad it was about to end right when it was getting good pay me mind not her said pierce picking himself up again the vampire took one step to me and pierce pulled a charm from his pocket i had an instant to prepare and then he pulled the pin the front hallway shook in a boom of sound i cowered as the chandelier swayed and the windows in the door blew out falling into a ball i crouched in the corner where the wall met the stairway feeling my ears throb someone touched my shoulder panic gave me strength wideeyed i turned to strike stopping at the soft pull of ley line running through me pierce exhaling in a wash of relief i found him close and worried he crouched beside me and fingered another amulet grit your teeth and close your eyes he said forgive me if its too much i nodded hunching down i tried to become one with the floor my breath caught as a silverlined ribbon of everafter iced through me to leave the taste of tinfoil in my veins the soft presence of pierces body covered mine sheltering me a second boom of sound pulsed over us and in a visible cloud the scent of dust and broken wood rose coughing i looked up as pierce slipped his hand in mind and helped me stand the vampire was out cold against the wall beside the door but even more startling was the fourfootwide hole in the floor between us pierce peered into my eyes striking me silent with how concerned he was are you well did i hurt you i shook my head theres a hole in the floor pierce pulled me to it ill catch you i held my breath as he nonchalantly stepped off the edge of the floor and dropped from sight from across the room came a soft groan and the vampire moved pulse hammering i sat on the floor and dangled my feet here i come i warned him then dropped i stifled a shriek but it came out as a yelp when he caught me and we fell in a tangle of arms and legs we were in a lower living room with soft carpet and lighting and expensive paintings on the walls an entertainment center stood in one corner there were two doors one beside us the other across the room youre heavier than you look pierce puffed and i scrambled off of him yeah well youre a lousy catch i glanced up at the hole in the floor then back to the tvs there were a couple of them and my lips parted when i recognized a black and white shot of my little car looking funny out there against the expensive estates closer to the house was the imprint in the drift where pierce hit it made me glad wed come in the front a frightened whimper caught my attention together pierce and i looked to a far corner dusky with a soft light my hope withered to nothing as i saw sarah in the grip of a small man dressed in casual sophistication his silkclad arm was wrapped around her covering her mouth tears marked her face and she was terrified gordian pierce the vampire said in a soft almost feminine voice you should have stayed dead i pressed back into pierce then realizing it made me look afraid i rocked forward i was still holding his hand i was telling myself it was so he could do his magic but the real reason was i was as scared as sarah you havent changed pierce said a new accent coloring his words still the same nancy boy forcing your putrid self on little girls i see sarah made a heartbreaking sound and the vampire christopher i guess stiffened his knuckles went white where he pressed his hand over her mouth i saw you in the ground he said bitterly you shouldnt be here pierces hand clenched on mine in a bitter anger your first mistake was putting me in blasphemed ground he said shortly it left me in a mind to return eliminating your filth of existence is worth postponing heaven for christophers chin rose and a snarl curved his lips up i knew he was several hundred years old but he looked thirty witch magic at its finest good he said shoving the girl to a nearby couch where she collapsed to sob ill enjoy hearing your screams again between the beautiful thumps of dirt hitting your casket i felt a chill imagining it pierces hand on mine went damp with sweat mine probably you foul bastard pierce said his voice shaking i will not leave without the girl intuition and the shifting of light pulled my attention to the hole in the ceiling look out i cried pulling pierce and myself back when the two vampires from the front door dropped down pierces free hand started making gestures behind his back and my pulse raced to make me lightheaded smiling like death they started to advance no their master shouted and they hesitated let them stand he flicked his eyes to one who had carried sarah down here earlier you man the outside grounds he said then turned a disparaging look at the other you mind the stairs from outside i dont want to be disturbed he turned to pierce and me and i thought i heard the small man beside me mutter a curse i enjoy trespassers the vampire said the law is going to see you dead again pierce all you have brought to me is more terror to lap up what a timely gift thank you he nodded curtly at the two vampires and they slipped away one through the door and stair behind us the other jumping straight up the hole in the floor sarah was still crying and the twin clicks of two doors shutting were ominous great i think it was about to get ugly believe me pierce whispered his hand giving mine a quick squeeze i flicked a look at him then back to the vampire what pierce angled to get in front of me hes going to kill me but im already dead trust me as soon as he thinks im dead ill move against him get the girl out please i didnt want to leave him here i wouldnt pierce but his fingers slipped from mine a jolt of line energy burst in me as i took the entire line myself pierce had been siphoning off of me and i hadnt even known it stumbling back i barely saw pierce jump away from me shouting curses at the vampire lips curled to show his teeth christopher went to meet him pierce no i shouted from where i had fallen to one knee transfixed when they met the man didnt have a chance my heart pounded in fear as they grappled the vampire finding his neck and sinking his teeth pierces groan struck through me and i almost panicked this cant be happening i whispered this cant be happening i jumped when the girl darted across the room a white shadow fleeing she clutched at me her tearstreaked face pleading up at me get me out she whispered as if afraid he would hear please get me out i looked at pierce slack in the vampires grip the animal hung over him sickening me help me she sobbed trying to drag me to the door but i knew what was behind it jaw clenched i pried her grip off my arm and shoved her behind me give me a minute i muttered my heart was pounding too fast and my knees were going weak striding to the nearest wall i lugged a picture from it staggering at its unexpected weight get off him i shouted dropping it on the vampire glass cracked and it slid off his back snarling the vampire let pierce fall turning with a look on his face to send a ribbon of fearlaced adrenaline through me slowly i backed up maybe i shouldve taken my chances with the vampire behind door number one his mouth red with pierces blood the vampire started for me hunched and looking as if he was in pain stupid foolish witch he said wiping his mouth and then licking the blood from his hand your species will thank me for taking you out before you can breed the too smart and the too stupid are all culled first i dont know which one you are stay back i said hand raised as i almost tripped on the rug from behind me the girl gasped my gaze darted to pierce as he moved hope surged and sensing it the vampire turned around how many times do i have to kill you he snarled when pierce pulled himself upright and with a dark grimace tugged his coat straight his neck was clean not a mark on it i didnt understand i had seen blood but had it been real he was a freaking ghost once was enough and i expect it will be your undoing god willing the man said raggedly and my breath came in with a hiss when a ball of green everafter swirled into existence between his two hands he flung it at the vampire the vampire lunged sideways and the green red and black mass smacked into the wall harmless my shortlived hope vanished and i looked at pierce across the living room i knew it had been everything he had stored in his chi he had gambled everything on that one throw there was nothing left he was helpless unless he could reach me and refill his chi and there was a vampire between us christopher seemed to know it and he started to laugh i may not be able to kill a ghost he said in perverted glee but i can still tear your fucking head off i backed to the door with the girl nothing left pierce had nothing left but those stupid ley line charms of my dad i felt my expression go slack in thought the ley line charms my hand went up to grip the charm around my neck it would make a circle only i could break sarah and i would be safe but pierce pierce saw my hand trembling as it gripped the spell use it rachel he said falling into a crouch invoke the amulet i tried to swallow failing i pulled the charm from around my neck the chain catching my hair and tugging free the vampire lunged to catch pierce he cried out in pain hey prissy face i shouted voice trembling youre a pathetic excuse of a bat you know that cant get your fangs wet without a glass of milk come and get me he doesnt have any blood in him the vampire turned and hissed and my stomach did a flipflop shit rachel no pierce cried but the vampire tossed him into a wall like a rude book i winced when he hit and slid down to stare at me in fear trust me i mouthed and he scrambled up but he was too far away and he knew it pulse hammering i fell into a crouch and beckoned the vampire to me youre nothing but a sorryassed hideintheground child molester i taunted and the vampire went almost choleric im going to kill you slow he said advancing slowly great i said estimating the distance between us but first catch this his hands flew up as i pulled the pin and threw the amulet it thumped into the vampires grip and he sneered at me i smiled back and as smooth and pure as water a wash of goldtinted everafter flowed up and around him trapping him no the vampire screamed throwing the amulet but it was too late my eyes widened and i fell back in shocked awe as the vampire seemed to devolve into a raving lunatic hammering at the barrier between us almost spitting in frustration howling like a mad thing he threw himself against it over and over and it held shaking i leaned against the back of a couch stupid ass i muttered miss rachel pierce cried out and i blinked when he grabbed me spinning me to face him his hands were heavy on my shoulders he looked me up and down his blue eyes searching me are you well i blinked again at him the adrenaline was wearing off and i was feeling woozy sure yes i think so the girl screamed and a vampire dropped into the room through the hole in the ceiling from behind the other door the thumping of feet said the other was coming too drawn by christophers furious shouts pierce took me in a brief surprising hug youre grit rachel pure grit he said rocking me back but you should have used it to save yourself and the girl all they have to do is throw you into the bubble and it will fall nonsense i said hearing my words slur just pull some more power from me and blast them back to hell his eyes widened and he held me upright as the door behind us opened to show the second vampire the girl was at our feet sobbing i might have joined her but i had a feeling i was going to pass out soon anyway damn it i hated this i was just kidding myself that i could do this for a living i pushed from pierce unsteady as i put my hands on my hips and looked from one vampire to the other i felt like i was drunk faint through the broken ceiling came the wail of sirens you all better go i said boldly sounding like john wayne to my ears or my friend here will blast you all to hell he can do it cant you but pierce was watching the monitors with the strength of hope in his grip as he held me upright i wavered as the two vampires exchanged a knowing look the master vampire trapped in the circle hesitated in his tantrum going whitefaced when his two servants gave him a short nervous bow dont leave me the master vampire shouted hammering on the invisible barrier i will hunt you down and take your last blood then kill you again i smirked muscles going slack pierce caught me with a little grunt on the monitor were several is cruisers a news van and lord help me my mother in her buick robbie got out first having to be restrained from storming the house on his own thats the is i said my words running into each other in a soft slow drawl i left my mother a note shes probably got half the force behind her blinking i struggled to focus on the two vampires dont mess with my mom shell kick your ass the two vampires looked at each other and as their master howled they levered themselves back out through the ceiling there was a faint thump of feet overheadand they were gone i think im going to pass out i said breathless and pierce eased me to the carpet my head lolled and the edges of my sight grayed im sorry i started to babble feeling light and airy i shouldnt have come down here im no good at this you are exceptional at this pierce held my hand and fanned me with a magazine but please miss rachel dont pass out stay with me at least a little longer if you succumb your circle might fall thats not good i mumbled struggling to keep my eyes open but damn it i had overtaxed my body and it was shutting down when the adrenaline had flowed it had been fantastic i had been alive and strong i felt normal now all that was left was the ash of a spent fire and it was starting to rain rachel it was close and i pulled my eyes open to find pierce had cradled my head in his lap okay i breathed are you okay yes he said and i smiled snuggling in so i could hear his heartbeat maybe it was mine stay with me he said just a few minutes more theyre almost here distantly i heard the sound of thumping feet overhead and loud voices the heater clicked on and the warm breeze made my hair tickle my face pierce brushed it off me and i opened my eyes smiling up at him blissfully holy shit a deep voice said theres a hole in the floor the girl revealed us with a little sob standing under the hole she peered up screaming get me out of here someone get me out of here my god its the girl another man said damn he was telling the truth just a little longer miss rachel pierce whispered and i closed my eyes again but a icing of fear slid through me almost waking me up when my moms voice cut through the babble high pitched and determined of course robbie was telling the truth you smartassed agents think youre so clever your crap doesnt stink but you couldnt spell your way out of a paper bag thats my mom i whispered and pierces grip on me tightened rachel she called her voice getting louder then get your sorry ass out of my way rachel are you down there my god she circled a vampire look what my daughter did she got him she got him for you you lazy bastards ignore my kids when they come to you huh i bet the news crew would like that you either drop the charges on my kids or im going out there and give them what they want i smiled but i couldnt open my eyes hi mom i whispered my breath slipping past my lips and then to pierce i added dont mind my mother shes a little nuts he chuckled raising my head and rocking me i expect a body would have to be to raise you properly i wanted to laugh but i couldnt so i just smiled there was the brush of wind against me as people moved about us someone had finally gotten sarah out of here and the sound of twoway radios and excited chatter had replaced her blubbering im sorry i said feeling like id failed them someone needs to circle him im passing out rest pierce whispered they have him let your circle down miss rachel ive got you i could hear a faint call for an ambulance and oxygen and i had a fading thought that i was going to spend the last half of my solstice in the hospital but we had done it and with that i let go of the line and let oblivion take me satisfied to the depths of my soul chapter they say when youre ten you think your parents know everything at sixteen youre convinced they know nothing at all by thirty if you havent figured out they really did know what they were doing then youre still sixteen after watching my mom work the is like a fish on a line i was suitably impressed that she knew everything in the freaking world smiling i tugged the wool blanket tighter around me and scooted my folding chair closer to the small fire robbie had started in the backyard my mom was beside me pointedly between my brother and me as we toasted marshmallows and waited for sunrise i hadnt been outside very long and my breath steamed in the steadily brightening day it was a few hours past my normal bedtime but thats not why my arms shook and my breath was slow damn i was tired id fully expected to wake up in the hospital or ambulance and was surprised when i had come to in the back of my moms car still at the crime site wrapped in an is blanket i had stumbled out looking for pierce to find myself in a media circus robbie and i had stood in the shadows and watched in awe as my mother worked a system i hadnt even known existed through her deadly serious threats disguised as scatterbrained fussing she not only managed to get the charges against me for willful destruction of private property dropped but got them to agree that i didnt have anything to do with their doors being blown out much less fled their custody with an unknown person the is personnel were more than happy to give my mom whatever she wanted if she would keep her voice down seeing as three news crews were within shouting distance apparently the vampire id helped bring in had a history of such kidnappings but because of his clout hed been getting away with it for years i hated to go along with the shush work but i didnt want a record either so as long as my mother robbie myself and the girl kept quiether parents being placated with enough money to put sarah through the university and therapy of her choicethe vampire would be charged with kidnapping not the stiffer crime of underage enticement it didnt bother me as much as id thought it would he was still going to jail and if vampire justice was like any other kind hed probably wake up one night with a wooden spoon jammed through his heart vampires didnt like pedophiles anymore than the next guy so robbies and my trip to the is had been dulled to an anonymous tip making the is out to be the heroes whatever along with the notoriety went any charges they might file against me mom had grounded me though god i was nearly nineteen and grounded what was up with that of pierce there had been no sign no one remembered seeing him apart from my mom a sigh shifted my shoulders coming out as a thin mist catching the pink light of the nearing sunrise rachel my mom said reaching to tug the blanket closed around my neck thats the third sigh in as many minutes im sure he will be back i grimaced that she knew where my thoughts were then searched the sky and the strips of clouds throwing back the sun in bands of pink id known hed be gone by sunrise but i wished id had the chance to say goodbye no i said bobbing my marshmallow in and out of the flame he wont but thats okay my mom gave me a sideways hug he looked like he really cared who was he she asked and a hint of alarm slipped through me i didnt want to ask in front of the is because he rushed off as if he didnt want to be noticed she huffed taking my stick with the nowburning marshmallow i dont blame him she muttered as she blew the little fire out they would have probably tried to pin the entire kidnapping on him i dont like vampires always shoving their nastiness under a rug or onto someone elses plate fingers gingerly taking the burnt marshmallow off she smiled her eyes brilliant in the clear light in witch years she wasnt that much older than me always dressing down to make herself match the other moms in the neighborhood but the morning light always showed how young she really was so was he someone from school she prodded a small smile dying to come out i gestured for her to eat the sticky black mass if she wanted it and while she was occupied i glanced nervously at robbie he was ignoring me just a guy i met at the square i offered my mother huffed again and thats another thing missy she said but it was robbie who got the thwack of the back of her hand on his shoulder you said you were going to the concert robbie shot me a black look aw mom i had to scalp the tickets to get your solstice gift it was a lie but she accepted it making happymom sounds and giving him a marshmallowy kiss on his cheek thats where we met pierce i said to give some truth to the story if we hadnt helped him no one would you did the right thing my mom said firmly if i toast you a marshmallow will you eat it honey i shook my head wondering if she knew exactly how we had made his acquaintance probably seeing as by the time i got into the kitchen all evidence of my spelling had been boxed up and was back in the attic robbie took the stick and put a new marshmallow over the fire he liked them so light brown it was almost not worth doing so i imagine your little adventure has cured you of wanting to go into the is he asked and my head jerked up shocked he would bring it up in front of mom i stared at him from across the suddenly still figure of my mom no silent my mom eased back into her chair and out of the way of the coming argument look at you my brother said after a cautious glance at our mom you passed out you cant do it thats enough robbie mom said and i flicked my gaze at her surprised at her support but robbie turned in his seat to face her mom we have to look at it logically she cant do it and you letting her believe she can only makes it worse i stared at him feeling like id been kicked seeing me floundering robbie shifted awkwardly rachel is a damn fine witch he said suddenly nervous she stirred a level eight hundred earth magic arcane spell mom do you know how hard those are i couldnt do it if she goes into the is its going to be a waste besides they wont take her if she passes out at the end of a run it had been an arcane spell he hadnt told me that surprise kept my mouth shut but it was that damned fatigue that kept me in my seat and not pummeling him into the snow he told her he never said he wouldnt but it was an unwritten rule and he had just broken it you put a level eight hundred arcane spell in front of her my mom said crisply and i paled remembering her equipment used without her knowledge robbie looked away and i was glad i wasnt under her angry expression i can get her into a great school he said to the ground the is wont accept her and to keep encouraging her is cruel cruel i thought tears starting to blur my vision cruel is throwing my hopes in the dirt cruel is giving me a challenge and when i meet it telling me i lose because i fell down after it was done but he was right it did matter that i had fainted worse yet the is knew it they would never let me pass the physical now i was weak and frail a weak prissy face i sniffed loudly and my mom glanced at me before turning back to my brother robbie can i have a word with you mom now her tone was sharp booking no complaint get in the house yes maam pissed he stood dropped his marshmallow and stick into the fire and stomped inside i jumped when the screen door slammed sighing heavily my mom took the stick out of the fire and rose i didnt look at her when she handed the marshmallow to me it was all out now and i couldnt even pretend i had the ability to do what i wanted do what made my blood pound and make me feel alive ill be right back she said giving my shoulder a squeeze i was saving these for the sunrise but i want you to open them nowbefore the day begins her thin but strong hands drew from her coat pocket a card and small present which she set into my lap happy solstice sweetheart she said and single tear slipped down my cheek as she followed robbie into the house i wiped the cold trail away heartbroken it just wasnt fair i had done it i had summoned a ghost though not dad i had helped save that little girls life so why was mine in the crapper setting robbies marshmallow to burn i took off my mittens and ran a cold finger under the seal of the card eyes welling i opened it up to find my is application signed by my mother blinking furiously i shoved it back in the envelope i had permission but it didnt mean anything anymore and what are you i said to the box miserably a set of cuffs ill never get to use it was about the right size i stared at the brightening pink clouds and held my breath exhaling the fog from my lungs seemed to mirror my mood foggy and dismal setting the envelope aside i opened the box the tears got worse when i saw what was in it cradled in the black tissue paper was dads watch miserable i glanced back at the silent house she knew what spell i had done she knew everything otherwise why give me the watch missing him all the more i clenched dads watch in my hand and stared at the fire almost rocking in heartache maybe things would have been different if he had shown up i was glad he was at peace and the spell wouldnt work on him but damn it my chest seemed to have a gaping hole in it now a warm sensation slipped through me and startled i sniffed back my tears and sent my eyes to follow a small noise to the side yard a pair of hands was gripping the top of the wooden fence and as i wiped my face a small man in a long coat vaulted over it pierce oh hi i said wiping my face in the hopes he couldnt tell id been crying i thought you were gone i dried my hand on my blanket and folded my hands in my lap hiding my dads watch and my misery all at the same time pierce looked at the house as he approached boots leaving masculine prints in the snow after seeing your mother at that spawns house i had a mind to heed the better part of valor a faint smile brought my lips curving upward despite myself she scares you like a snake to a horse he said shuddering dramatically he glanced at the house again and sat down in robbies spot i said nothing noting the distance i couldnt find your home he said watching the fire not me the drivers of the public carriages ah buses wont be moved by pity and it took me a space to figure the yellow book i sniffed feeling better with him beside me yellow pages nodding he looked at the still burning wad of robbies marshmallow yes yellow pages a man of color took pity on me and drove me to your neighborhood i turned to him aghast but then remembered he was over a hundred years dead its polite to call them black now or africanamerican i corrected and he nodded they are all free men there was a big fight about it i said and he nodded eyes pinched in deep thought i didnt know what to say and finally pierce turned to me why are you so melancholy miss rachel we did it my soul is avenged and the girl is safe im sure that when the sun rises i will go to my reward a nervous look settled in the back of his eyes be it good or bad he added it will be good i said hurriedly my hands gripping the watch as if i could squeeze some happiness out of it im thrilled for you and i know you will land on the good side of things promise you dont look thrilled he muttered and i scraped up a smile i am really i am i said its just thatits just that i tried to be who i wanted to be and i my throat closed as if by admitting it aloud there was no way it could happen i cant do it i whispered fighting the tears i watched the fire forcing my breathing to stay even and slow yes you can pierce protested and i shook my head to make my hair fly around no i cant i passed out if you hadnt been there i would have passed out and he would have gotten away and it would have been all for nothing oh rachel pierce slid to my mothers chair his arms went around me and he gave me a sideways hug giving up my pretense i turned into him to make it a real hug burying my face in his coat i took a shaky breath smelling the scent of coal dust and shoe polish he had a real smell but then id heard most ghosts did its not bravery you lack he said his words shifting the hair on the top of my head thats the most important part the rest is incidental real strength is knowing you can live with your failure that sometimes you cant get there in time and that your lack might mean someone dies it was cleverness that captured the vampire not brute strength besides the strength will come it sounded so easy i wanted to believe him i wanted to believe him so bad it made my chest hurt will it i said as i pulled back to see his own eyes damp with tears i used to think so but im so damned weak look at me i said derisively wrapped up like a baby my knees going shaky when i get up to turn the tv channel im stupid to think the is would want me i should give it up and go out to portland to be a earth witch set up a spell shop and my eyes started to well again damn it and sell charms to warlocks i finished kicking a snow clod into the fire pierce shook his head thats the most dang fool idea ive heard since having ears to hear with again and i expect ive seen and heard a few fool things since you woke me up if i might could talk to the dead id ask your father and i know what he would say his language was slipping again he must be upset i looked up from where my kicked snow had melted dampening out the fire to show a patch of wood you cant know that i said sullenly youve never even met him still he smiled his blue eyes catching the brightening light i dont need to i expect a man who raised a young lady with such fire in her would have only one answer do what your heart tells you a frown pressed my lips together im too weak i said as if that was all there was to it nothing is going to change nothing i didnt want to talk about it anymore my hands were cold and i dropped the watch in my lap to put my mittens back on hey pierce said seeing it thats mine my mouth dropped open but in a moment i looked at him in understanding no wonder the charm didnt work its your watch i hesitated before it was my dads maybe i can try again i said but he was shaking his head clearly wanting to touch it no he said youre his daughter and your blood that kindled the charm is a closer bond than a bit of metal and fancy if he had been in a position to come he would have an eager light was in his eyes and licking his lips he asked may i silently i handed it over pierces smile was so beautiful that it almost hurt to see it its mine he said then quickly amended pardon me i meant that it once had been i expect it was sold to pay for the stone they used to keep me from rising up to avenge my wrongful death see here he said pointing out a dent i did this falling into a post to avoid a nastytempered nag of a horse i leaned to look finding a small comfort in his history i wonder if my sweethearts silhouette is still in it he said turning it over my eyebrows rose when he wedged a ragged fingernail into a tiny crack and whispered a word of latin the back hinged open and a folded paper fluttered to the ground thats not it he said with a sigh and i picked it up handing it to him what is it i asked and he shrugged handing me my dads watch to unfold the offwhite scrap of paper but then my heart seemed to stop when the scent of my dads pipe lifted through my memory rising from the paper itself pierce didnt see my expression and he squinted at the words my little firefly he said and tears sprang into my eyes as i realized who had written them i write this on the evening of our day in the leaves as you sleep youre still a child but today i saw the womantobe in you pierces words cut off and he brought his gaze to my swimming eyes this is for you he said extending it his expression looked tragic as he shared my heartache read it to me i said catching a sob please pierce shifted awkwardly then began again today i saw the womantobe in you and you are beautiful my heart breaks that circumstance will probably keep me from seeing you reach your full strength but im proud at your courage and i stand in awe at the heights you will achieve when your strength builds to match your spirit i held my breath to keep from crying but my head started to hurt and a hot tear slipped down dont be afraid to trust your abilities he said voice softening youre stronger than you think never forget how to live life fully and with courage and never forget that i love you pierce drew the paper from his nose and set it in my lap its signed dad i sniffed smiling up at pierce as i wiped my eyes thank you little firefly he questioned trying to distract me from my heartache it was the hair i think i said bringing the paper to my nose and breathing deeply the faded scent of pipe smoke thank you pierce i said giving his hand a soft squeeze i never would have found his note if it hadnt been for you the young man smiled running a hand over my hair to push it out of my eyes it isnt anything i did apurpose maybe i mused smiling brokenly at him the spell to bring my dad into existence had worked after allthe only way it could his love bending the rules of nature and magic to bring me a message from beyond his grave my dad was proud of me he was proud of me and knew i could be strong that was all i had ever wanted and i took a gulp of air i was going to start crying again and searching for a distraction i turned to find my moms gift my mom signed my application i said fumbling with the envelope beside me with a sudden resolve im going to do it pierce my dad said to trust in my abilities and im going to do it im going to join the is but when ii turned back to him with my signed application he was gone my breath caught wideeyed i looked to the east to see the first flash of redgold through the black branches from across the city came the tolling of bells celebrating the new day the sun was up he was gone pierce i said softly as the paper in my grip slowly drooped not believing it i stared at where he had been his footprints were still there and i could still smell coal dust and shoe polish but i was alone a gust of wind blew on the fire and a wave of heat shifted my hair from my eyes it was warm against me comforting like the touch of a hand against my cheek in farewell he was gone just like that i looked at my dads watch and held it tight i was going to get better my stamina was going to improve my mom believed in me my dad did too fingers shaking i folded up the paper and snapped the watch shut around it holding it tight until the metal warmed taking a deep breath i sent my gaze deep into the purity of the morning sky the solstice was over but everything else everything else was just beginning about the author born and raised in tornado alley new york times bestselling author kim harrison now resides in

rudolph lynsay sands chapter beth jill peered down the stairs that disappeared into darkness and frowned shed looked everywhere in the house for her errant niece before noticing the crackedopen door to the basement now she stood on the landing biting her lip as she peered into the black pit and wondered if her niece could possibly be down there her brother kyle had obviously forgotten to lock the door that was unusual with all the experimental equipmentincluding the molecular destabilizerhe housed in the basement he was fanatical about locking it however it wasnt locked now surely a toddler wouldnt go down into the dark on her own though a faint rustle from the stillness below answered the question beth was definitely down there and shouldnt be she could get hurt flipping on the light she started down calling beth honey you arent supposed to be down here come to aunt jill your breakfast is ready pausing on the bottom step jill waited for some sound to give away the girls location but there was nothing her gaze slid around the room skating over gleaming metal surfaces and glassfronted cupboards containing all sorts of scientifictype paraphernalia shed never been down here before but it looked just like shed imagined like every lab shed ever seen when she visited her brother at work a faint scraping sound drew her gaze to the far corner of the room and jill peered toward the large glass chamber that took up the end of the basement it held the molecular destabilizer kyle had spent so much of the last five years rebuilding and the door into the small glass room was open alarm rising in her jill hurried toward the open door beth enough you arent supposed to be down here your mommy and daddy will be mad she said firmly when she reached the door without receiving an answer she added pleadingly come out honey your breakfast is ready the only answer was another rustle this time from behind the machine breathing out a sigh jill approached the front of the destabilizer it was huge stretching from one wall to the other there was no room to slip between the machine and the wall to peer behind it that left crawling under the table set up below the telescopelike apparatus that the beam shot from at least jill thought it probably came from there she was no scientist but didnt see anywhere else it could come from she eyed the crawl space under the table unhappy at the prospect of crawling under it but seeing no alternative she had to get beth back upstairs cursing kyle for carelessly leaving the door unlocked jill started to climb under the table pausing when she bumped it and it shifted slightly noting it was on wheels and could move in and out she straightened and wheeled the table out of the way to make more room then crawled into the space to peer behind the machine beth she said with relief the child was sitting in the narrow space between the machine and the back wall spying jill she giggled and clapped her hands with glee it was a grand game to the tot jill was less entertained she was very aware that she was now kneeling directly under the destabilizer beam exactly where beths mother claire had been when a crazy coworker determined to try the molecular destabilizer on humans had zapped her claire had survived the exposure to the destabilizer as had kyle when hed run into the beam to pull her out but now the two of them were different they could both shift their shapes taking on the facial features and body shape of others a cool trick to be sure and one jill had first thought she might like herself but that was before shed heard kyles fears the destabilizer had done what it was meant to made their molecules unstable and changeable but they werent sure how unstable and feared the possibility of the cells collapsing leaving them to die in a puddle of human slime or worse yet not die but be alive and aware as a puddle of human slime that possibility was enough to kill any desire to be zapped that thought in mind jill started to lift her head to glance nervously toward the beam but instead cried out as pain shot through her skull and everything went black jill moaned and slowly opened her eyes at first she didnt know where she was she stared at the dim bulb overhead then blinked and lowered her gaze as she felt a soft patting on her cheek beth she whispered the child was seated on the floor beside her patting her cheek a worried look on her little face jill offered her a reassuring smile and then sat up her gaze sliding around the glass chamber as she tried to sort out what had happened she recalled coming down in search of beth crawling under the machine and then lifting her head and bang unbearable pain had hit her obviously shed slammed her head into the telescope thing and knocked herself out brilliant she always had been the clumsy one in the family when beth made a gurgle of sound jill got carefully to her feet much to her relief while she felt a little weak she didnt appear to be suffering any other side effects from the encounter letting her breath out slowly she glanced down to her niece then carefully bent and picked her up the action made her woozy and she stood still for a moment hugging the child close until her head cleared again once she felt steadier jill started across the basement to the stairs she had just put her foot on the first step when she heard a car engine and the crunch of tires on gravel pausing she glanced toward the nearest window at the top of the basement wall just in time to see the bottom of a blue car moving past kyle and claire were home and she had a few choice words for her brother about leaving the basement unlocked scowling jill carried beth upstairs and into the dining room she set the child in her high chair and was spooning cereal into her mouth by the time the front door opened and claires laughter drifted up the hall i love you too claire was chuckling and thats why we arent getting a motorcycle ah honey think how cool it would be to ride down the highway on the back of a hog the wind in your hair and and my maternity top flying over my head claire interrupted dryly jill smiled at the mental picture claire was more than seven months pregnant with their second child very close to giving birth and showing it jill had been a little surprised that they were continuing to have the date nights that gave her the opportunity to babysit her niece but it seemed the pregnancy wasnt cooling their ardor your coat would hold your maternity top down andoh hey jill kyle interrupted himself as the couple reached the dining room door still trying to talk her into getting a motorcycle jill asked with amusement her brother had been trying to talk claire into getting one when they left for their date the night before try being the key word claire laughed as she entered the room and picked up her daughter lifting the child high in the air she blew a raspberry on her cheek and cuddled her close hello beautiful were you a good girl for your aunt jill she was a very good girl jill assured her and then turned a scowl on her brother as she added unlike her father who left the door to the basement unlocked so that nosy little miss could crawl down there what kyles eyes widened in shock as claire turned an alarmed glance his way i locked it i always lock it well apparently last night you forgot jill assured him i put beth in front of the television this morning while i got her cereal and when i came back she was gone the door to the basement was open and shed managed to get down there jill frowned even as she said the words and then added i dont know how she got down there on her own those stairs are pretty steep for a twoyearold but i found her down behind the molecular destabilizer there was a moment of silence as all three of them peered at beth and then claire turned a concerned gaze his way and kyle sighed i was sure i locked it he said apologetically then added but we cant take a chance ill go to the hardware store and get one of those locks that lock automatically when a door closes ill do it right after i bring our bags in claire smiled and reached out to squeeze his hand then withdrew it quickly to grab for her daughter as beth suddenly leaned toward the bowl of cereal on the table and made disgruntled sounds shes hungry let me finish feeding her jill suggested ill do it claire said setting the child back in her high chair i know you want to get to the shop for that parade this morning oh jills eyes widened with alarm and she shot to her feet shed forgotten all about the christmas parade this morning it was starting on the street where she had her store and she along with many of the other storeowners was expected to help with it its after ten oclock and you said you had to be there by eleven claire reminded her then gave a laugh and added i cant believe you forgot you were so excited that mr handsome shoes was playing santa mr handsome shoes kyle asked with bewilderment hes the guy who opened a shoe store next door to jills clothing store six months ago claire explained hes apparently very good looking all the women in town are gaga over him but hes only showing interest in your sister are you two dating kyle asked with a frown why havent you mentioned him before is there something wrong with the guy we arent dating jill said quickly and then scowled at him as she added and there is nothing wrong with nick claire smiled faintly and said they arent dating officially but they do have lunch together every day and have exchanged store keys in case there are problems a shoe store owner huh kyle asked slowly and then added and youve exchanged keys but only eaten lunch together every day for six months he arched an eyebrow then pursed his lips and said hes got to be gay kyle claire cried with dismay but jill just scowled at her brother and hurried out of the room heading for the spare room to collect her things nick or mr handsome shoes as claire called him couldnt be gay she just wouldnt believe it she was already half in love with the man jill frowned she was sure shed know if he was but while nick was always charming and interesting and seemed to enjoy being with her hed never taken that step to move the relationship from friendship to actual dating maybe he was gay her shoulders slumped at the possibility wouldnt it be just her luck to fall for a guy who couldnt possibly have any interest in her as anything more than a friend she didnt have a great track record with men lately sighing unhappily she snatched up her purse and overnight bag and headed out of the room if he were gay then today was going to be a total bust the only reason shed agreed to play mrs claus to his santa in the christmas parade was to spend more time with the man in the hope that he would finally move the relationship to the next level it had been bevs idea bev owned and operated a hair salon further up the street she was also the friend she tended to moan to the most about nick bev seemed to think nick was just shy in charge of the parade preparations it was bev who had suggested that seeing each other away from their stores and actually playing mrs claus to his santa might be just the push nick needed to get him over his shyness and make him ask her out ever hopeful jill had decided to give it a go and it seemed to be working he hadnt yet asked her out butwhere on the lunches they were prim and proper sharing their thoughts but careful not to invade each others spaceat the meetings for the parade theyd been much more relaxed both of them laughing and joking as they worked at the preparations there had also been a good deal of accidental touching going on hands meeting as they each grabbed for the same item bodies brushing as they passed and last night as theyd worked on the preparations theyd been left alone in bevs kitchen for several minutes and jill was positive nickd been about to kiss her before jay one of the elves had entered interrupting them jill had been disappointed at the interruption and was hoping today hed actually finish what hed nearly started claim the kiss and ask her out it was their last chance before the parade was over and they went back to their rushed lunches in the middle of busy work days sending up a quick prayer that nick asked her out today jill started downstairs pressing close to the wall as kyle started up with suitcases in hand have fun with mr gay shoes he teased as she rushed past jill stuck out her tongue and kept going pausing only long enough at the dining room door to wish claire a good day before rushing out of the house her knapsack over one shoulder and purse over the other jill had parked on the street when shed arrived the night before to prevent blocking in claire and kyles car when they went to leave or being blocked in by it when they returned unfortunately the closest empty parking spot shed found had been halfway up the street now she hurried up the sidewalk her thoughts already on the day ahead and nick distracted as she was jill was nearly at her car before she noticed the man leaning against the front grill of her little toyota pausing abruptly she watched with a frown as the man straightened to face her he was tall darkhaired not bad looking but there was something about his mouth and eyes that made him look hard and cold she was instantly wary can i help you she asked her hand tightening on her bags the only thing she could think was that it was his house shed parked in front of and he didnt care for her parking there is it about my parking here parking here he echoed with bewilderment then seemed to understand flashing a smile that didnt reach his eyes he said oh of course you dont know who i am im john heathcliffe i used to work with your brother jill stiffened the hair on the back of her neck suddenly standing on end as she recognized the name of the crazy coworker who had zapped claire with the destabilizer youve heard of me he said with apparent pleasure what do you want she asked her gaze slipping back the way shed come you didnt think id zap you with the destabilizer and then just leave you alone he said with amusement jill jerked her head back around zap me with the destabilizer she echoed blankly wondering what on earth was he talking about he shouldnt even know about the destabilizer no one knew kyle had rebuilt it in his home as for zapping her with it the only encounter shed had with it was banging her head as she jill frowned as she suddenly recalled the flash of light that had accompanied the pain before shed blacked out you zapped me she asked in a choked voice john nodded with a wicked grin that quickly turned bitter did kyle really think id let him just take the machine away from me i worked on the original prototype as long as he did its as much mine as his he proclaimed taking a step toward her dr cohen may have believed that nonsense about it not working and allowed him to talk him into shutting down the experiment but i cant believe kyle really thought i was stupid enough to swallow it you zapped me with the destabilizer jill repeated faintly john nodded appearing amused by her stunned state and then announced once the project was shut down i started to watch kyle i saw the materials he brought into the house and realized he was rebuilding it some nights i even watched through one of the basement windows as he worked he smiled with disdain kyle really should have covered the windows it was rather silly of him not to i suppose he thought it was private enough with the high fence around the property but anyone could climb the fence and look in like i did jill remained silent her mind still reeling under the possibility that shed been hit by the shapeshifter beam she found herself suddenly doing a silent selfassessment checking to see if she felt different she didnt shed felt a little weak directly after waking up in the basement buther thoughts stopped dead as she realized shed woken up in the middle of the basement floor nowhere near the destabilizer you pulled me out from under the machine she asked uncertainly john nodded once id estimated youd been exposed long enough i turned it off you collapsed like a limp noodle he shrugged i had to be sure i hadnt given you too much and accidentally killed you but i couldnt take your pulse all crumpled under the machine as you were jill stared at him with disbelief he was standing there admitting that he hadnt been at all sure the beam wouldnt have killed her and hed gone ahead and zapped her anyway why would he do such a thing now john continued if youll just come with me well go to my house and i can start running tests on you tests she asked with surprise yes why else do you think i zapped you youre going to be my guinea pig are you nuts jill cried tugging her arm free of the hard hold he suddenly had on her wrist stay away from me or ill tell my brother okay as threats went it was pretty lame jill thought as soon as the words left her mouth but let it go and merely pushed past him to get to the drivers door of her car before she could get it unlocked he was there grabbing her by the arm again i said youre coming with me he snarled trying to pull her away jill didnt think she just reacted allowing her selfdefense classes to kick in she struck backward sharply with her elbow driving it into his stomach she then turned and drove her knee sharply into his groin john collapsed on the street groaning in agony one hand clutching his stomach the other cupping his groin leaving him rolling around on the pavement jill unlocked the drivers door threw her bags in and leapt inside she hit the button to lock the doors the moment the door closed and then struggled briefly with her keys her hands were shaking and by the time she managed to turn on the engine john was crawling to his feet beside the car hey he lunged for the drivers door even as she shifted into drive and hit the gas he thumped furiously against the side window as she tore away up the street eyes shifting between the street and the rearview mirror jill reached for her purse she opened it onehanded felt around until she found her phone and glanced in the rearview mirror as she pulled it out only to curse again as she spotted a black van rushing up the street behind her she knew it was john mouth tightening jill pushed her foot down harder on the gas and raised the phone in front of her eyes she needed to call kyle she didnt know what else to do jill was afraid to call the police and bring them into the matter she didnt know how much damage the man could do to kyle if he blabbed about the machine in his basement she should have just pulled into kyle and claires driveway and made a run for the house unfortunately the car had been pointing in the opposite direction also unfortunately she wouldnt be calling her brother for advice shed forgotten to recharge her phone again the battery was dead cursing jill tossed it aside and glanced in the rearview again the van was gaining on her she needed to lose the crazy idiot and either drive back to claire and kyles or find a phone calling seemed her safest bet jill didnt really want to lead trouble back to claire and kyles door she didnt know just how crazy john heathcliffe was or what hed do where to call from was the problem jill suspected her house would be high on john heathcliffes list of places to look even if he didnt already know where she lived all he had to do was look in a phone book to find her address he might overlook her shop though she thought in fact he might not even know about it hed said hed been watching her brothers house not that hed been following her around her store might be a safe place to go to call kyle mouth thinning with determination jill tightened her hold on the steering wheel and increased her speed she then suddenly spun the wheel taking a sharp and abrupt right that almost saw her car on two wheels managing to maintain control she shot up the street watching the rearview mirror as much as the road ahead yes she breathed with relief when she saw the van shoot past the end of the street wheels squealing as he tried to bring the vehicle to a halt to follow her jill was already turning left down another street by the time he managed to bring his car around jill lost sight of him as soon as she turned the corner and her attention was again divided between the rearview mirror and the road ahead grateful it wasnt a busy area the last thing she needed was to hit someone in her efforts to escape her pursuer when there was still no sign of the van behind her before she turned up the next street jill felt her shoulders relax the smallest bit but she continued to drive a little faster than she should and continued to take turns right and left and right again to be sure shed lost the man before heading for her store due to the parade the streets around her store were all blocked off the closest jill could park was in the lot at the end of the road from where the parade was to launch it was blocked to the public today open only for parade participants to park there were several tents set up at one end for everyone to don costumes and do their makeup jill bit her lip as she gazed over the floats and costumed people milling about as she parked her car if she hurried to the store called kyle and then changed into her costume there was really no reason she couldnt come back and be a part of the parade as planned surely kyle could handle john she reasoned it wasnt like there was anything she could do besides shed committed herself to the parade and had her costume in her knapsack she could hardly just leave them without a mrs claus but she had to make that call first jill decided as she got out of the car slipping past the tents without running across anyone she knew jill hurried up the street to her store she unlocked the door slid inside and headed straight for the phone a curse slipped from her lips when her call was answered by the answering machine she listened to her brothers recorded voice frowning as she tried to sort out where kyle and claire could be kyle had mentioned going to the hardware store but surely claire was still there feeding beth her gaze slid to the clock on the wall and she frowned as she realized that while the store was only fifteen minutes from claire and kyles house shed wasted almost half an hour making sure shed lost her pursuer claire could very well have finished feeding beth and headed out for some lastminute christmas shopping kyle jill said when the beep finally sounded i need to talk to you i she paused to worry her lip as she realized he wouldnt be able to reach her her cell phone was dead and shed be on a parade float nowhere near a phone for the next hour or so letting her breath out on a sigh she said ill try calling again later but its important unsatisfied with the message jill hung up and turned to peer out the front window of the store stilling when she spotted john heathcliffe crossing the street headed straight for the front door of her shop cursing she whirled away from the counter and hurried out the back door then started up the alley behind the shops her mind racing it seemed john hadnt just been watching the house he must have followed her around and learned where she worked when hed decided he needed a guinea pig jill what on earth are you doing here i was just heading to my store to try to call you you arent even dressed yet oh bev jill swallowed guiltily as the woman hurried up the alley to her i you can explain while you dress bev interrupted firmly catching her arm and steering her toward the back door of her salon you dont understand jill murmured glancing nervously up and down the alley sure john was going to pop up at any moment i cant be in the parade the hell you cant bev snapped getting the door unlocked she dragged her inside the dark shop do you know what i went through to make sure you would be mrs claus every unattached female shop owner on this street wanted to play the part to get their hands on nick yes but no buts she said firmly flipping on the light and pushing her toward the ladies room get in there and change but jills protest died on a sigh as she found herself pushed into the bathroom and the door pulled closed behind her dress bev repeated firmly through the door the parade starts in five minutes and you will be in it without waiting for further protest she added i have to go back and chase a couple other people down when youre ready leave through the back door and just pull it closed it locks automatically when jill didnt respond right away bev added grimly dont let me down jill i went to great lengths to see you in this role and ill never forgive you if you leave me without a mrs claus all right she said wearily and heard the soft thud of the shop door closing biting her lip jill opened the door and peered out she couldnt be in the parade the mrs claus costume was a sedate little red dress with faux fur trim a cute little santa hat and red shoes unfortunately there was no mask and shed be easily recognizable to john should he see her going past on the parade float that was the last thing she needed she didnt think hed drag her off in front of everyone but he was crazy who knew but she couldnt let bev down either and she really didnt want to miss out on this opportunity to spend time with nick either cursing under her breath jill paced to the front of the salon her gaze moving up the street to her own store there was no sign of john butjill stiffened as she realized she wasnt at all sure shed locked the front door of the store when shed entered john could be in there right now searching for her oh she couldnt do this and she couldnt not do it she needed to hide until she could get a hold of kyle but where her gaze landed on one of the magazines in the waiting area of the hair salon two dozen of them littered the coffee table most of them were hair books but the rest were all celebrity and womens magazines that customers could peruse while awaiting their turn in the chair the one that caught her attention was a christmas issue of a fashion magazine it featured a very sexy brunette mrs claus in a short formfitting red velvet number with white fur trim jill stared at the picture recalling the day claire had been zapped by the destabilizer beam and changed into several images from a magazine if she could do that too well the best place to hide was often in plain sight wasnt it grinning she picked up the magazine and hurried back to the bathroom closing the door she concentrated on the woman on the cover claire had told her that shed simply focused on the image and wished shed looked like the picture and her body had changed jill now tried to do the same thing she stared hard thinking she wanted to look like it needed to look like it had to look like it but nothing seemed to happen she didnt feel any sudden tingle or anything tossing the magazine aside with frustration she sagged back against the wall and glared at herself in the mirror freezing when she found a stranger glaring back but i didnt feel a thing she murmured raising a hand and touching her face eyes widening with disbelief as the brunette mirrored her actions it really was her shed shifted she was the magazine mrs claus well mostly the fur trim was sticking out from under the collar of her tshirt she stared at herself for a moment and then began to laugh even as she began to rip off her clothes as had happened with claire her body had taken on not just the other womans features but the shape and color of her clothes as well her own clothes looked bulky on top removing the last bit of clothing jill paused and stared at her new self she was a brunette with a slim figure that made her smile but the smile faded to a frown as she realized the costume was clingy and far too sexy for a parade meant for families and children concentrating on the hem she tried to think it a little longer relief coursing through her when it suddenly lengthened dropping from midthigh to knee length it was still rather form fitting but would have to do jill decided she had to get moving and now it was safe to even if he did see her on the float john heathcliffe would never recognize her she thought with satisfaction jill hurried from the bathroom and out of the shop pulling the door closed as ordered she paused long enough to be sure it had locked as bev said it would and then hurried up the alley to the parking lot at the end of the street there were people everywhere in the parking lot elves human reindeer toy soldiers snowmen and people in band uniforms the elves were made up of a combination of children and little people jill was reminded of the presence of several of the dwarves in the parade when someone goosed her and she whirled to find herself staring down at a grinning little man in an elf costume only the cigar hanging from his lips ruined the image of one of santas elves jay she said on an exasperated sigh whatever indecent proposal hed been about to offer died on his lips and his eyes widened briefly but then he grinned and said i see my reputation precedes me who are you cutie and why are you dressed up like mrs claus thats jills gig jill blinked in surprise shed quite forgotten that she didnt look like herself at the moment until the man had spoken up now she forced a smile and said jill was called away a family emergency im standing in for her hmmm jay didnt look impressed nick isnt going to like that he wont she asked faintly nah hes sweet on our jill everyone knows that except maybe jill herself he added wryly then tilted his head and asked so whats your name cutie name she echoed blankly her thoughts on his claim that nick was sweet on her jay laughed yeah you know what most people call you jill flushed it hadnt occurred to her that shed need a name her gaze swept around the parade grounds as she sought her mind for a name to offer him her eyes landed on one of the painted carolers on the side of the third float the singer held a sheet of music titled the first noel relaxing jill offered a smile noelle noelle huh jay reached up taking her hand to lead her toward the nearer of the tents set up in the parking lot well come on noelle lets go introduce you to nick and give him the bad news that jill backed out on him he wont be a happy guy chapter yo jay called out as he led jill into the tent nick found your mrs claus though not the one you were looking for it was late enough that mostly everyone had changed and vacated the tent there were only a couple of people still inside one of them was nick already dressed as santa and pacing a worried expression on his face the worry dropped away to be replaced with a warm smile at jays announcement but that died away to confusion as his gaze landed on jill who are you wheres jill jill had a family emergency jay answered for her noelle here is standing in oh nick said and then asked with concern a family emergency but jills all right isnt she jill hesitated in truth she wasnt all right at all shed been zapped by a madman and turned into a shapeshifter that the madman was now hunting intending to cage up and perform horrible experiments on there was nothing all right about her at the moment she couldnt tell nick that though so she forced a smile and nodded shes fine good nick said with a sigh and then glanced to the tent flap as bev sailed in okay everythings ready to go we just need you two on the float bevs expression was pinched and anxious as she entered but became completely alarmed when her gaze landed on jill who are you this is noelle bev nick answered for her jill had an emergency and asked noelle to take her place bev scowled see if i do that girl another favor after all the trouble i went to pausing she peered over noelle with pursed lips well that costume wont do this is a family parade there are kids out there jill glanced at herself the costume was more suitable for a bachelors party she supposed youll have to wear this bev moved in front of her to do up the clasp of the red cape shed just placed on her shoulders jill ran a hand down the capes white fur trim and frowned isnt this santas we have both a heavy one and a lighter one so that were covered whether its cold or warmer its cold today so old saint nick here is wearing the heavier one youll have to make do with the lighter one finished with the clasp bev stepped back to peer at her critically she didnt look pleased but said itll have to do but youre going to be cold in that costume jill should have given you the one we made i swear shes going to hear about this whirling to the tent flap she snapped come on you two the parade is already five minutes late in starting jill breathed out a little sigh and silently cursed john heathcliffe as nick led her out of the tent the parking lot was still full of people rushing about but now they were all headed in the same direction toward the row of floats parked at the edge of the lot jill and nick joined the herd making their way to the middle float that held the small wooden building with the sign santas workshop on it it was a shed really but quite charming with all its decorations and left plenty of room for the big black bag with giftwrapped boxes falling out the fake reindeer standing around and santas chair there were already several people on the float not one of them taller than four feet santas elves up we go nick urged as they approached the steps that had been wheeled up to the side of the float murmuring a thank you jill scampered up the stairs her gaze slipping nervously around the parking lot as she went eyes searching for john while he shouldnt be able to recognize her as she was she couldnt help fearing that he would this way cutie jay said cheerfully leading her toward santas chair you and nick stand here and smile and wave thanks jay jill murmured following him no problem he grinned widely and then wiggled his eyebrows and said so if you arent doing anything later maybe we could get together and i can show you why us elves are so popular with the ladies scram jay nick said firmly joining them at the chair ah come on nick dont be such a spoil sport the elf complained why should you get all the babes anyway i thought you were interested in jill dont take it out on me because she stiffed you today and didnt show jill glanced sharply at nick her heart leaping with hope when she saw the blush on his face it seemed he was interested in her but then why hadnt he done anything about it ignore him nick suggested hes a rude little bugger but has a good heart for the most part so you arent interested in jill she asked unable to help herself nick was silent long enough she didnt think hed respond but then he muttered like i said just ignore him she was frowning over that when he said i dont know how much jill explained to you but the deal is there are boxes of candy canes and treats in the shed there are two trays one out here he gestured to the large tray overflowing with candy canes and toys on the small table beside the throne then waved to the workshop and one inside that the elves are supposed to use to keep the tray loaded we throw them to the crowd jill nodded theres also a gas heater in the shed to warm up by if you get too cold but try to stay on deck as much as possible the kids want to see mr and mrs claus okay his glance at her costume suggested he suspected shed spend more time in the shed than out of it feeling selfconscious and stupid jill tugged the cape tighter around her more to hide than because she felt cold the truth was jill wasnt feeling as cold as she knew she should it was almost at freezing temperature and she should have been shivering in the chill air but wasnt claire and kyle hadnt seemed to suffer from the heat or cold like other people since being zapped though so she supposed it had something to do with that a shout from the end of the parking lot drew her attention bev was at the head of the first float in the parade waving her arms and gesturing were about to start nick said you might want to hang onto this to keep from losing your footing when the float starts moving youll get used to the motion quickly but the first movement might startle you jill moved to his side and took hold of the back of the chair knowing he was right her gaze slid over the float as they waited to move forward noting that everyone was now on board there were six elves on their float three were children of store owners whod volunteered to be elves and the other three were adults jay and two of his friends both little people like himself the float started forward sending everyone swaying where they stood once in motion however jill quickly adjusted and was able to stand unaided okay nick asked as she released the chair back shed been clinging to jill nodded and offered a smile fine good he scooped out a handful of candy canes and whatnot from the tray and passed them to her just smile wave and toss treats to the kids they worked in silence at first smiling and waving and throwing candy but jill found herself repeatedly glancing toward nick this wasnt how shed expected the day to go every time they were together they tended to chat up a storm shed rather expected this day to go the same the two of them laughing and chatting and sharing secret smiles as they tossed the candy and waved but she wasnt jill today she was noelle and nick didnt seem interested in talking to her jill supposed she should be glad after all shed taken on the appearance of a model most men would be drooling over yet nick hardly seemed to notice she was there they were perhaps halfway through the parade when jill began trying to strike up a conversation with nick she pointed out a child on the side with reindeer horns on and a glowing red nose but while nick smiled faintly it didnt lead to anything she tried again several times but the man just wasnt receptive he was polite enough but cool in his responses until jill finally just gave up the flirty attempts and decided to try the direct approach would you like to go out for dinner after the parade she asked suddenly and was amazed at herself for having the courage to do so it seemed being someone else gave her courage shed never had as herself jill had never been the sort to ask men out she always waited for the man to ask which was perhaps why she never ended up dating anyone she was really interested in now she waited for nicks answer wondering why shed even asked she didnt want to date him as stickthin model noelle she didnt even want him to like stickthin model noelle she wanted him to like her jill as herself look you seem like a nice woman noelle nick said gently but jay was right i am interested in jill she sucked in a breath hed just said the one thing guaranteed to make her the happiest girl in the parade maybe even the town here he stood rejecting a woman with the face and body of an international magazine model for little old jill she could have kissed him her glee lasted for a very brief moment and then it was pushed out of her brain by questions if he was interested in her why hadnt he asked her out was he just using that as an excuse for him to let noelle down easy and if he wasnt interested in noelle or jill at least not interested enough to ask her out maybe god kyle couldnt be right nick wasnt gay was he what jill blinked her thoughts away to see that nick had stopped throwing candy to stare at her he was frowning under his fake beard as he took in the expressions her thoughts were scribbling across her face and obviously wanted to know what was behind them she realized jill hesitated but then blurted if youre so interested in jill why havent you asked her out she saw his mouth tighten between the white mustache and beard and was sure he was going to tell her to mind her own business so she quickly blurted were friends and ive been worried about her you seem to be stringing her along eating lunches with her showing interest but not too much interest never asking her out jill watched the play of expressions on his face then impulsively added her brother thinks youre gay gay nicks eyes widened in alarm yes he thinks thats why you havent asked jill out she murmured quietly and then added if you are you should just tell her so shed still be friends with you but you shouldnt string her along like this nick was frowning now and looking a bit put out jill waited wondering if hed tell her to go to hell or actually respond at all but then he heaved out an exasperated sigh and said im not gay she felt every muscle in her body relax at this news jill had told herself she didnt believe he was but the possibility had bothered her ever since kyle had brought it up his answer eliminated the problem however now she just had to find out whyif he was interested in herhe hadnt asked her out the easiest way was to ask so she did then why havent you asked her out nick pursed his lips and then said because i havent been free to do so jill blinked at this simple explanation not free like how god he wasnt married was he oh dear god if shed gone and fallen for a married guy i was in the middle of a divorce when i opened the store next to jills ive been waiting for the divorce to go through before asking her out besides i didnt want a rebound relationship the first year after separating from my wife i dated around a lot but then i realized i was picking women who were all just like my exwife i decided it would be best to take a year off from dating give myself that time to deal with all the issues from my marriage decide what i really wanted in a partner and then consider dating again the next time i marry i want it to really be until death do us part i suppose there were lots of women youve been interested in during that time she murmured yes he admitted there are a lot of attractive women in the world yes she agreed with a frown but none of them were as interesting to me as jill is she stiffened her ears suddenly pricking nick grimaced and shook his head before continuing i was halfway through that promised year when i opened the shop here and met jill suddenly keeping to that year was hard i actually like jill it isnt just sexual interest with her shes normal and sane and funny and smart and sexy everything ive ever wanted in a woman jill sucked in a breath at this news her heart suddenly bursting with hope actually i think this year business turned out to be a good thing for us he said quietly it forced me to be a friend to her first and through that ive found we get along great we work well together as a team we like many of the same things he shrugged i didnt even know that much about my wife when i married her and while i was sure two years ago that i would never marry again i think id be willing to risk it with jill if she was interested oh im sure shed be interested jill assured him with a grin she felt like her heart was bursting he liked her and he thought she was funny smart and sexy i guess well see when i ask her out when will that be jill asked with excitement i mean when is the year up both the year and the divorce were final yesterday i signed the final decree last night nick admitted and then gave a dry laugh and actually i had it all planned to ask her out today jill had to grab onto santas chair to keep from jumping up and down with glee and squealing nick continued i was going to invite her to my sisters christmas party after the parade that way thered be no nervous firstdate jitters just a relaxed invitation to join me at my sisters i even invited the others in the parade along too so she wouldnt feel pressured oh jill breathed thinking he was the most thoughtful man in the world if hed asked her out on an actual date the first time she would have been over the moon until the firstdate jitters set in then she would have spent whatever time there was between his asking and the actual date fretting over what to wear what to say desperate to have everything perfect god what a clever man he was his way was so much more relaxed if he invited her with a bunch of people she would have been relaxed thinking it was just a group thing and damn jills happiness turned to dismay as she realized that john and his craziness had completely screwed up everything there wouldnt be any relaxed first date because she wasnt here her first date probably finally their first kiss too jill had been fantasizing about that first kiss for so long she doubted the real thing could live up to it she would have liked to find out though dammit why had john chosen today of all days to act like a crazy prick and zap her if not for him shed be herself up here and she so wanted to be herself right then say why is that guy coming out of jills store jill let go of her thoughts and glanced around with confusion nick was peering to the left of the float and she followed his gaze noting that theyd reached their street of stores the parade was almost over at the end of this road they would pull into the parking lot and disband her gaze slid along the storefronts until she found her own and she stiffened as she spotted the man now turning away from the door of her store john heathcliffe his gaze slid over the people on the street and then across the floats passing by until it landed on her where it froze eyes widening with incredulous recognition no he couldnt recognize her jill thought with dismay she didnt look anything like herself he seems to know you who nicks words died as he turned curiously toward her and suddenly froze jesus he breathed his wide eyes eating her alive jill where did you come from what she peered at him with confusion and then realized hed called her jill glancing down she jerked the cape closed with a squeak of alarm as she saw that shed changed back to herself and now stood on the float with nothing but the cape covering her she was herself and naked how she wondered frantically and then realized that shed been standing there wishing she was herself her body had obviously listened and of course john had recognized her that thought forced any concern for her nudity from her mind and she jerked her eyes back to the bane of her existence jill wasnt at all surprised to see that john heathcliffe was now pushing his way through the crowds fighting to get to the float jill whats going on where did noelle go nick was obviously struggling with confusion but she didnt have the time to explain i have to go she muttered and tried to turn away but he caught her arm wait a minute he said how i cant explain right now nick please let me go hes coming hell get me she cried panic choking her throat as she saw john break out of the crowd and stumble onto the street next to the float behind their own as slow as the parade was moving it wouldnt take him long to reach their float and be on her but the parade nick said its done were nearing the end of the street now she pointed out tugging at her arm please nick glanced around and saw that they were indeed nearing the parking lot where they would disband they had two more stores to pass frowning he glanced back to her frantic face then toward john who was now running behind the float reaching for the edge to boost himself up mouth tightening nick began to urge her toward the front of the float okay lets go what jill glanced at him with surprise as he hurried her to the opposite end of the float from where john was trying to board youre coming with me like you said the parade is over he pointed out with a shrug and i dont know whats going on but i want to oh jill breathed unhappily not at all sure she could explain everything to the man shed have to explain about her brother and his wife and the molecular destabilizer and that wasnt her secret to share besides she wasnt sure she wanted to he said he liked her because she was normal and sane and she had been until that morning now she was anything but normal once he found that out would nick lose interest in her hey what do you think youre doing buddy jill glanced back over her shoulder at that shout from jay to see him and the other two adult elves converging on the spot where john now hung off the float his upper body was on it and he was struggling to pull his legs onboard a struggle made more difficult as the three little men began kicking and hitting him while the children playing elves pelted him with candy canes from a safe distance jump jill jerked her gaze back around just as nick leapt from the float pulling her with him biting back the scream that leapt up her throat jill concentrated on trying to land on her feet but she was off balance and landed wrong her ankle twisted out from under her and she fell are you all right nick asked with concern kneeling at her side jill nodded then glanced down and blushed selfconsciously as nick suddenly tugged her cape down to cover her upper thighs you really have to explain this to me he muttered lifting her to her feet jill didnt comment concentrating on holding the edges of the cape together as he set her upright come on nick tugged her quickly through the crowd it took her a minute to realize he was leading her back to his store then they were there and he was retrieving keys from his pocket and unlocking the door jill shifted from foot to foot and glanced anxiously back toward the float cursing when she saw that john was now standing on it surrounded by angry elves he was ignoring them however his attention fixed on her inside nick caught her arm and tugged her inside the dark shop he saw us jill said anxiously moving to peer out the window toward the float as nick locked the door again i know hes probably headed here then nick said grimly and caught her arm to urge her away from the window we wont have much time time for what jill asked with despair it seemed to her they didnt have any time at all she should be headed out the back door that very minute and without nick he wasnt the one john wanted and should be safe so long as she wasnt with him im calling the police startled out of her thoughts jill glanced around wildly and realized that nick had drawn her to the stores back room and released her to move around the desk and pick up his phone lunging forward she pressed down on the phone receiver hanging up on him even as he started to punch in the number what are you doing he asked with surprise no police she said her voice panicky dont be ridiculous jill he pushed her hand out of the way this guy is obviously bothering you or something the police his words died and he lifted a disbelieving expression to her as she suddenly ripped the cord out of the phone im sorry she said at once but i cant let you call the police i cant explain but this doesnt affect just me but my family she glanced down at the cord still in her hand and dropped it with a sigh ill replace that i promise where are you going nick hurried around the desk after her when she opened the door between the back room and the shop im going to wait until hes looking in the front door and then slip out the back door hell leave you alone then and come after me youll be safe are you crazy nick pulled her away from the door and into the middle of the back room real anger on his face now you must be if you think im going to let you draw him off so im safe while you try to handle this on your own he doesnt want you jill pointed out on a sigh this is they both fell silent and turned to glance to the front of the store as they heard someone try the door as they watched john released the knob and used his hands to frame his face against the window trying to see inside he cant see us nick murmured its dark back here jill bit her lip watching john with the same fascination shed watched a snake about to strike she then became aware that nick had moved away from her what are you doing she asked in a whisper as he moved back to the door between the front and back of the shop then her attention shifted back to the front door as john began to tug at it again as if he could force it open by sheer will nick paused too she noted but her attention was on watching john try to open the door then the scientist suddenly stopped and moved away on the sidewalk trying to look nonchalant they understood why when a police officer appeared in front of the store and approached him jill supposed the officer had spotted him working at the door and briefly hoped that hed arrest him or something which would leave her and nick safe and free but the officer merely spoke to him for several minutes then turned and continued along the sidewalk jill supposed there wasnt really anything he could arrest him for trying a door wasnt an offense the cop must be keeping an eye on him nick murmured when several moments passed after the policeman moved out of sight and john didnt return to his efforts with the door he was merely leaning against the telephone pole out front his gaze fixed on nicks storefront it looks like hes decided to wait out front for us to try to leave until he remembers there are back entrances and tries that jill said unhappily youre right nick muttered and suddenly pushed the door between the back of the store and the front closed wed better be quick hurrying to her side he caught her arm and urged her toward the back door well slip out through the alley and he paused and turned to frown when jill didnt budge but held her ground we have to move quickly jill not like this santa and mrs claus are too conspicuous hed spot us a block away like this she pointed out nick peered from her red cape to the padded santa costume he wore and sighed youre right jill was about to point out as patiently and gently as she could that it was safer for her to go alone when he suddenly brightened i keep a change of clothes here in case of spills or such theyre in my office you can wear those what about you she asked with a frown unlike you i have jeans and a tshirt on under here he said dryly ill just strip off the costume and beard oh she was silent for a minute then nodded yes go find the clothes the moment he disappeared into his office jill headed for the back door despite what shed said she had every intention of slipping away shed be doing them both a favor the man had said one of the things he liked about her was that she was normal and sane if that was so hed hardly be interested in her once he knew the truth of what shed become there was nothing normal or sane about being a shapeshifter no it was better this way she decided unhappily shed get out of his life before she forced him to break her heart by rejecting her jills hand was on the doorknob to the back door when she spotted the calendar on the wall next to it pausing she stared it was open to december and showed a couple walking down the city street in warm winter gear jill glanced from the picture down to herself and back shed be less noticeable in the calendar womans face and outfit than as herself and as much as she wanted to spare herself the humiliation of explaining everything to nickif she even couldshe didnt wish to do so at the expense of getting caught and caged up for the rest of her life by a madman shifting to look like the calendar girl seemed her safest route and it would only take seconds jill assured herself shed be changed and gone before nick got back decision made she released the door knob and concentrated on the picture imagining herself looking like that woman wanting it needing it jesus jill blinked and glanced toward the door to nicks office a small gasp slipping from her lips as she spotted him standing frozen in the doorway he was beardless and in only his street clothes the clothes hed sought for her a bundle clutched to his chest but it was the shock on his face that concerned her she glanced down at herself not surprised to see that she had changed successfully to the calendar girl her only wonder was whether hed been there long enough to see her change or if his shock was at finding a stranger in the room jill he said with disbelief how did you do that well that answered her question she supposed her shoulders sagging hed seen her change now he knew how unnormal and unsane she was it was all so unfair she thought miserably up until this morning her life and everything about her had been boringly sane and normal well except for her brother and claire and beth now because of one idiot mad scientist everything was topsy turvy and any hope of romance with the one guy shed really liked in a long time was screwed you changed from yourself to this in like a heartbeat nick tossed the clothes hed collected onto the nearest box and began to walk around her surveying her from every angle the only thing that didnt change is the cape reminded of the cape and knowing she couldnt wear it out of the store for fear of tipping off john to who she was jill slid it off and draped it over the clothes on the box noelle was wearing that cape he said suddenly jill stiffened and watched unhappily as he put things together in his head then you were wearing it he went on slowly then you turned into someone else wearing the cape jill let her breath out on a resigned sigh shed always known he was intelligent it was one of the things shed liked best about him she shouldnt be surprised hed put things together so quickly youre like a what do they call them shapeshifter despite watching him figure it out right in front of her she still felt a bit shocked when he said the words she supposed shed imagined that hed need her to give him the explanation for what exactly she now was capable of doing dont look so surprised i watched star trek growing up he murmured continuing to examine her then added i didnt think shapeshifters were real though neither did i jill muttered under her breath she really hadnt thought such things were possible not even when kyle had explained their work to her she hadnt believed right up until claire had got zapped and turned into brad cruise does it hurt to change like that no she said warily he didnt look like he believed her but merely asked can you do it again when her expression became surprised he said apologetically i know its rude to ask at least i think it is but even though i saw it once its hard to believe jill felt her tension return when he suddenly went silent a frown claiming his mouth she had a feeling hed just thought of something and it was obviously something that didnt please him she realized why when he said i told youwhen you were noelle i told you im sorry jill said at once i mean im not sorry you told me im glad you like me i like you too but im sorry i let you tell me she paused and sighed then finished unhappily of course now that you know this you might not be interested anymore and ill understand if thats so but a noise from the front of the store made her pause they both peered to the closed door between the two sections of the store then nick hurried to it cracked it open and peered out jill was just moving to join him by the door when he closed it again and turned to hurry back to her the cop must be gone that guy whos following you is trying to pick the lock we have to go nick grabbed her hand as he moved past drawing her to the back door jill allowed him to drag her out of the store but reached up to grab a long winter coat off the rack by the door as she went she wasnt cold and appeared to be wearing winter gear but nick wasnt he was now wearing only jeans and a tshirt hed need the coat she waited patiently as he locked the door then handed him the coat and said i have to get to my brother why is this guy after you nick asked as he shrugged into the long coat is it because of what you can do does he know youre a shapeshifter oh he knows all right hes who turned me into one she said dryly turning to lead the way up the alley only to find her hand caught as he whirled her back around nicks expression was shocked what jill was silent for a moment arguing within herself as to whether she should explain everything or not this wasnt just her secret her brother his wife who happened to be jills best friend as well their daughter would be affected by this on the other hand nick was risking himself to help her and the cat was already out of the bag so to speak it only seemed fair to explain but they had to keep moving if john got the door unlocked and got inside the store it wouldnt take him long to realize that theyd slipped out the back and then hed be out here after them taking nicks hand jill turned and started up the alley she paused only long enough to send out a silent apology to her brother then quickly explained about her brother and claires courtship the experiment theyd been working on and then everything that had happened that morning so your brother and his wife were among the scientists working on a molecular destabilizer this john creep zapped her your brother got zapped pulling her out of the beam and they both suddenly found themselves able to shift shape jill nodded i get why they told their boss this dr cohen that the machine didnt work and convinced him to break it down its obviously dangerous but then why on earth would he rebuild it in his own basement he asked with disbelief kyle and claire are worried their cells might now be unstable or there might be other problems they cant foresee kyle wanted to test the effects on animals with faster metabolisms they have no idea what pitfalls or problems could be in store for them or beth and he wanted to find out and hopefully find ways to avoid them she explained but then why did he bother to convince the company he worked for that the original didnt work he wasted years rebuilding this new one wouldnt it have been faster to just admit that he and his wife had been zapped and were changed he reasoned he would have been able to experiment right away jill frowned he didnt realize it would take so long to rebuild it and he thought it was too dangerous to let them keep working on the original he was afraid of what theyd do with such technology he also feared once they realized he and claire had been zapped the two of them might end up the lab animals being experimented on nick nodded in understanding and then said that john fellow probably took your niece downstairs and placed her behind the machine to get you under the beam jill glanced at him with a start as they paused at the mouth of the alley i hadnt thought of that do you really think so nick shrugged he tricked your sisterinlaw under the beam and he admitted to you that he wanted to zap you to have someone to experiment on it probably isnt just a happy coincidence that you ended up knocked out under the beam jill supposed it was too much of a happy coincidence john probably had taken beth downstairs and used the child to get her under the beam youre right we cant go to the police nick said suddenly drawing her gaze again he was looking grim and determined we cant risk revealing all this to the authorities and having you and your family locked up in cages to be experimented on well have to deal with this ourselves i need to talk to kyle jill said quietly i tried to call him earlier but there was no answer at the house he and claire must have taken beth and gone to get new locks for the basement door or something i need to talk to him to figure out what to do yes we can nicks hand suddenly tightened on hers startled jill glanced up to see him looking past her they were standing at the mouth of the alley and a glance over her shoulder made her suck in a sharp breath as she spotted john weaving his way through the crowd toward them chapter he must not have been able to pick the front lock jill said with alarm more likely the cop scared him off again so hes coming around to try the back nick said dryly we have to hide jill said anxiously catching his hand and trying to pull him away but he stayed still we dont have to hide you already are hiding he pointed out his gaze moving over her face with fascination jill frowned at his expression she liked this man and didnt want him to see her as some weird creature but it seemed thats what she now was pushing the concern aside for the moment she said nick we have to hide hes been watching kyle and i think me too he may have seen me with you he might know who you are and then know im me despite she gestured vaguely to the form shed taken nick scowled at this possibility but then suddenly smiled what she asked with bewilderment her gaze shifting nervously between his expression and the approaching john fortunately hed been slowed by a group of teenagers goofing around and taking up most of the sidewalk he was still two buildings away trying to weave his way around the kids they say the best place to hide is in plain sight nicks words brought her head back around and she opened her mouth to ask what he was thinking only to gasp in surprise when his lips descended on hers jill stood still in his arms for a moment and then clutched at his upper arms as he suddenly backed her up against the brick wall of the building behind them she felt the hard textured brick press into her back and was reminded that while she might appear dressed in winter gear it was all just her it was her skin pressing into the cool brick jill shuddered as his hands slid around her waist to her back before dropping down to cup her bottom gasping she rose up on tiptoe as he cupped her there and drew her tight against his body under the coat his jeans brushed erotically against the naked flesh of her legs and hips and the cotton of his shirt rubbed softly across her breasts making her nipples tingle moaning under the erotic assault she clutched at his shirt front as his tongue urged her lips apart and slid between them shivering as desire rippled through her jill slid her arms around his waist under the coat then she let her own hands drop down to his bottom and urged him harder against her unable to stop her hips from undulating against him nick groaned and ground harder still then slid one leg between both of hers forcing a gasp from her lips as his clothcovered thigh rubbed against her get a room the muttered comment was john heathcliffes as he passed them to enter the alley jill recognized his voice and instinctively started to pull away from nick seeming to realize that she was about to end their kiss and unintentionally reveal his face nick rubbed his thigh against her more firmly then slid one hand to her breast and squeezed gently to recapture her attention it worked his touch drove all thought of others from her head and drew a moan from her throat as she arched into both caresses nick smelled and tasted so good and he felt wonderful his body taunting hers from beneath his clothes jill forgot where they were and that they were hiding from anyone and wished they were both naked without barriers between them shed waited so long for this kiss and shed been wrong her fantasies hadnt been better no fantasy could live up to this molten heat and passion the man was on fire burning her up with his kisses and caresses it made her wish they were alone somewhere that she was herself and they were both naked without his clothes between them mommy why is that lady naked never mind virginia dont look come on jill heard the exchange but it didnt really register until an excited stir erupted around them and nick suddenly stiffened and drew away to peer down with shock dread suddenly a stone in the pit of her stomach jill tore her gaze from his to glance down at herself much to her horror shed somehow shifted back to herself and now stood there on the street naked for all to see and they were all seeing several people were now yelling others laughing and still others just gawking at her nicks mind was acting more quickly than hers jill didnt notice his releasing her and shrugging out of his coat she was still staring stupidly down at herself when he suddenly forced her arms into the coat and drew it closed around her in the next moment they were weaving their way through and around groups and couples then nick suddenly tugged on her hand and they headed down a side street where are we going jill gasped struggling to keep her feet the parking lot my cars there he said jill glanced anxiously behind them at first she thought theyd given john the slip by veering down this road but then she heard an alarmed cry and saw a lady stumble into the street and her gaze narrowed on where the woman had come from sure enough johns head popped briefly into view hes still behind us she told nick wondering why she wasnt out of breath jill wasnt the most athletic person her life revolved around her shop for the most part and she spent a lot of hours there leaving very little time for other things including exercise yet this race wasnt leaving her breathless as she knew it probably should another cry drew her gaze over her shoulder and alarm raced through her as she realized john was gaining on them the problem was that nick was trying to avoid people weaving through the crowds to avoid jostling anyone john on the other hand was charging through the crowd like a football player sending people stumbling and sprawling in his wake hed soon catch them at this rate hes gaining on us she gasped to nick and he suddenly veered to the left dragging her through the door of a store can i help you a clerk asked as they charged past just looking nick called out before dragging jill behind a rack of sunglasses he stopped so abruptly then jill nearly knocked them both over slamming into him do you see him she asked as nick stuck his head around the rack and peered toward the front of the store did we lose him im not sure hethere he is he interrupted himself and eased back a bit to make himself less conspicuous as he watched the front window of the store whats he doing jill asked anxiously hes stopped on the sidewalk out front nick said a frown tightening his lips as he watched hes looking around the street he must realize we ducked into a store jill said with a sigh yes but he doesnt know which one jill shifted and drew his coat closer around her as they waited to see what john would do oddly enough she felt more naked now with nicks coat on than she had when shed actually been naked but looked dressed she thought that was strange is there something i can help you find jill glanced around sharply a sales clerk had approached eyeing them as if they might be shoplifters not surprising she supposed they were acting oddly after all iwe were justumm her gaze slid to nick for help she was at a complete loss as to what to say to explain their behavior were just looking nick assured her and dragged jill to the next row to get them away from the woman jill immediately picked up one of the boxes on the end display to look silently praying the woman would go away she was so busy trying to look interested in what she held it took a moment for her to realize it was a box of condoms ribbed for her pleasure flushing she set the box back and asked whats he doing now hes still in front of the store nick said on a sigh it doesnt look like hes going to move until he figures out where weve gone jill glanced nervously toward the store clerk and noted that the woman was staring narrowly at her naked legs and feet the phrase no shirt no shoes no service immediately ran through her head and she felt panic begin to claim her she was positive the woman was going to throw them out at any moment we cant stay here she hissed to nick the store clerk is already suspicious its just a matter of time before she throws us out nick glanced toward the woman then picked up a box of condoms and turned it over as if reading instructions he then leaned out to glance to the front of the store his unhappy expression told her john was still there we cant leave until he leaves and we cant stay jill said firmly glancing at the clerk out of the corner of her eye she was sure the woman was just working up the nerve to handle them we have to separate she decided what nick peered at her with alarm but he knows im with you now it doesnt matter what form i take hell follow you if theres anyone with you we need to let him see us and then separate he isnt interested in you hell follow me but once im away from you i can change form and give him the slip she pointed out urgently expression grim nick gave a reluctant nod how jill leaned past him to see that john stood on the sidewalk at the opposite end from the entrance she pictured the storefronts on this street in her mind and then turned to ask the store clerk theres a bookstore next door isnt there the clerk seemed startled by the question but nodded its on this side of the store she gestured to the right of them the clerk nodded again thank you jill turned to nick well go out pause long enough for him to see us then ill duck into the bookstore next door while you take off up the street hell follow me im sure ill slip into an aisle and quick change to give him the slip nick nodded slowly ill head to the parking lot my vehicles a big red suv meet me there after you give him the slip jill smiled rather than be relieved to be free of her he was arranging to meet up with her again she wanted to grab him and plant a big kiss on his lips unfortunately they didnt have time ill head for the parking lot as soon as i can how will i know its you nick asked with a frown jill grinned and simply said ill tell you right he glanced to the front of the store before turning back to ask ready jill took a deep breath and then nodded as ready as ill ever be okay squeezing her hand he drew her back the way theyd come using the aisles to hide them until theyd reached the door john was still there but his attention was turned in the other direction as they slipped out of the store rather than head off right away nick urged her toward the door to the bookstore theyd nearly reached it when john turned and glanced in their direction there was one moment when all three of them froze then nick took off running jill immediately rushed into the bookstore a glance back as the bell above the door jangled showed john hurrying after her leaving nick to escape as shed expected heart pounding jill rushed up the first aisle then took a sharp left and headed for the back of the store glancing up each aisle she passed jill didnt see john but she saw a lot of other people there seemed to be someone in every aisle she passed which made those aisles useless to her she could hardly shift in front of witnesses jill was starting to panic when she reached the last aisle andmuch to her relieffound it unoccupied her relief was shortlived she hurried up the aisle wildly scanning the books on display in search of a picture of a person she could turn into it only took a second for her to realize she would have no luck here the aisle was filled with christmas items cards calendars and childrens books all featuring elves doves santa rudolph almost every last one was drawn or a cartoon image that was useless to her at least she didnt think she could turn into a threedimensional lifesized cartoon image and even if she could john would know at once it was her there were only two images that were of actual living creatures one was a set of cards with a cute little puppy on it while jill knew she could probably take on the shape she somehow didnt think shed be able to shrink in size to be the creature besides it was cute and cuddly and pretty much defenseless against someone like john her gaze slid to the second image and she stared at the card featuring a real reindeer wearing a glowing red rudolph nose despite the pressure of the moment jill couldnt help but wonder how on earth the photographer had got the reindeer to stand still long enough to put the nose on let alone wear it long enough for pictures to be taken watch it mister the womans voice made her glance anxiously up the aisle she had no doubt the woman was speaking to john he was probably barreling up the stores center aisle like a bull as hed done on the street pushing people out of the way as he went and he wasnt far away hed be here any moment panic a highpitched whistle shrieking in her head jill turned in a circle what to do what to do john would be here any moment and she was trapped what to do her gaze slid desperately back to the image of the reindeer hed know it was her of course hed hardly imagine a reindeer got loose from the parade and wandered in to pick out christmas cards on the other hand shed have a lovely pair of antlers to hold him off with which was more than she had at the moment could she hey jill winced and glanced around again that shout had been much closer than the last frighteningly close turning determinedly back to the cards jill stared at the image of the rednosed reindeer and closed her eyes in that moment she really wanted to be the reindeer it was big would be fast and had large antlers to hold john off a gasp brought her eyes open and she peered to the end of the aisle where john stood a stunned look on his face the red bulb glowing at the end of her now very elongated nose was her first clue that the shift had worked glancing down she found herself staring at two hoofs sticking out of nicks coat sleeves well you clever little minx john breathed suddenly i never would have imagined you could do this he was moving toward her easing his way as if she was a vicious animal which she supposed she could be now by rolling her eyes upward jill could just see the tips of the long pointy antlers now crowning her head they looked deadly and she briefly fantasized about charging at the man and goring him as payback for all the trouble hed caused her but it just wasnt something she could bring herself to do when she had other options and she did taking advantage of one of those options now jill turned to hurry up the aisle away from him unfortunately her brain was trying to run like a human with two legs and she was now on all fours the new body shape was odd and awkward and left her floundering clumsily for the first few steps the coat didnt help matters much either her clumsy hooves kept catching on it as she tried to move a sudden jerk on the back of the coat told her john had grabbed it fortunately in all their rushing about jill hadnt had time to do it up now she struggled to free herself her feethoovescoming free and allowing the long coat to slide off her back get back here john yelled but she was away reaching the end of the aisle jill turned sharply to the right intending to head for the front of the store but she hadnt taken her new body into account her front hooves turned abruptly on command but her back legs were slower to react and slid out from under her so that her hind end slid along the floor to the side jill cursed under her breath as she saw john rushing up the aisle toward her hed be on her in a minute forcing herself to concentrate on her new bodys movement she managed to regain her feet and immediately charged for the front of the store jill didnt consider the problem the door could be until she was nearly to it she was just starting to realize that she wouldnt be able to work the door knob when the bells jangled as it was pushed inward by someone entering it was an older woman who was smiling on first pushing the door open but who blanched in horror and threw herself to the side slamming the door against the wall and pinning it there with her body when she saw what appeared to be a huge reindeer charging toward her jill put on a burst of speed and exploded out onto the sidewalk screams and shouts erupted around her and jill soon rued that shed changed at all the antlers were deadly and she wasnt used to them she could hurt someone very badly if she werent careful fortunately she wasnt the only one to realize the peril her new shape could cause and everyone was scrambling to get out of her way turning in the direction of the parking lot she broke into a run as the bells on the door behind her chimed she didnt have to glance around to know it must be john jill get back here he roared and she grimaced at the fury in his voice did he really expect shed just docilely allow him to lock her away for his experiments the man was mad she thought as he called her name again jill thats rudolph a childs voice corrected him scornfully then added run run rudolph the bad mans coming jill was already running but put on a burst of speed at the cry the more accustomed she became to this new shape the more swiftly she was able to move and everyone was very accommodating in making way for her they were spreading before her and then closing quickly behind her to stare after her with amazement which had the added benefit of slowing john down she quickly left him behind unfortunately all this attention had its disadvantages and when she heard someone shouting out to call the police or animal control she knew she had to get herself somewhere out of sight and change again quickly the problem would be what to change into if she changed back to herself shed be left naked and that was hardly helpful a rush of relief ran through her as she broke out of the last of the crowds and found herself on the edge of the parking lot it was full of people milling about still in their costumes the parade was over and its members were now laughing and chatting in groups with the relief and excitement that follows a successful venture fortunately they were mostly congregated around the tents and no one seemed to notice her appearance at the edge of the lot dont let it get away does anyone have a rope we can lasso it and hold it until the police get here jill glanced around at that comment startled to see that some of the people from the crowds had decided to give chase she should have realized that would be the case that some civic minded men would decide to catch the wild reindeer running loose in the streets before it harmed someone but the possibility hadnt occurred to her cursing she turned sharply and charged for the end of the parking lot where the parade members had parked when they reached the cars she began to weave through them aware that the men had begun to spread out trying to surround her pausing between two vans jill tried to decide which way to go but glanced to the side when a muffled bark caught her ear she blinked in surprise as she found herself face to face with a beautiful husky the dog had climbed right up onto a box on the seat of the van he was in he stood framed in the window peering at her with what seemed more to be curiosity than anything else do you see it jill glanced behind her but while the voice sounded close there was no one there i think it went around that van someone answered as jill turned back to peer at the dog again knowing she didnt have much time she concentrated on the animal wanting desperately to look like it no one would bother her as a husky theyd hardly notice her with their attention on finding the reindeer hey boy a hand landed on her rump rubbing there and bringing her eyes open as two men moved up on either side of her between the vans the reindeer couldnt have come this way the dog would have stopped it the second man said as the first man ran his hands over the white fur now cresting jills body shed shifted successfully and was now a husky yeah he must be back further the first man agreed straightening and turning back the way theyd come lets backtrack jill released a breath as the two men disappeared around the van as relieved that the one man wasnt touching her anymore as she was that theyd been fooled by her shapeshifting the fellow may have thought it was a dogs furry back hed been running his hand over but it had felt to jill like his hand was coursing over her naked skin a scratching sound drew her attention back up to the van window and she smiled at the husky as he rubbed his paws over the glass of the window as if to say she should let him out to play with her another time she thought and hurried toward the opposite end of the parked vehicles searching for the red suv where nick was supposed to be waiting for her she was relieved when she spotted it and even more so when she saw that nick was there waiting for her as promised some of that relief faded however when she saw that he wasnt alone bev was there and judging by her stance and the high angry pitch to her voice she was in the midst of giving him hell for something im sorry bev nick said apologetically as jill reached the back end of the suv but it was an emergency and we were on the last leg of the parade there were only a couple of stores left to pass before the parking lot when we had to leave thats another thing bev said first jills here then she has to go and that noelle woman took her place then suddenly jill was there on the float and someone said she was stark naked under the red cape what the heck is going on i cant really explain just now bev i wish i could but nick let the word trail away as he glanced worriedly across the parking lot obviously searching for her or anyone rushing his way jill supposed since he had no idea what she was going to look like his action and her own thoughts reminded her that while she may have escaped the concerned citizens hunting the runaway rudolph john was probably heading their way and might know it was her when he saw her with nick hey bev where do you want us to put the costumes bev turned toward the elf who had come around the suv ill finish with you later she said over her shoulder to nick as she started away and when you see jill you tell her i have a few choice words for her too jill waited until the pair were gone then hurried to nicks side leaning against his leg to get his attention oh hello fellow he murmured bending to give her a pat i dont suppose youve seen a beautiful redhead that may or may not be herself have you jill smiled at the words beautiful redhead and then said its me she frowned as her words came out very badly slurred her jaws were now long and narrow and her tongue felt huge and unwieldly she supposed she was lucky to be able to speak at all dogs didnt jill nick asked with amazement and knelt to catch her jaw in his hand he looked her over with disbelief how why its a long story she said trying very hard to speak clearly we have to get out of here john she paused as nick suddenly straightened and peered over the roof of the suv the curse that slipped from his lips told her all she needed to know john had caught up chapter come on nick moved to the drivers door opened it and waved her in jill immediately bounded into the vehicle scampering over the drivers seat to the passenger side where she peered anxiously out the window she wasnt made any less anxious to see that john heathcliffe was no more than twenty feet away and moving fast she glanced back to nick as he settled in the drivers seat and slammed his door closed watched him start the engine then turned back to the window again john was running now and had cut the distance in half are the doors locked she asked nervously a click sounded as he shifted into gear and the doors automatically locked then the suv jerked forward jill scrabbled to keep her balance on the passenger seat as nick accelerated watching anxiously as john burst forward shouting as he slammed his fists into the side of the vehicle its all he managed though before they were tearing out of the parking lot leaving him behind do up your seat belt nick ordered as he steered them up the road jill turned to him with disbelief to see his gaze shooting between the road ahead and the rearview mirror which showed the parking lot behind them how exactly do you suggest i do that she asked dryly nick glanced at her and frowned cant you change back to yourself certainly if youd like to drive through town with a naked woman in the front seat the smile that slowly curved his lips suggested it wasnt something hed mind sighing jill dropped to her haunches on the passenger seat and raised one paw to the door to help balance herself nick was silent for a moment but now that they were safely away from john his gaze was moving between the road and where she sat moving uncomfortably under his inspection she peered into the side mirror on her side of the vehicle noting that the road behind them was empty john wasnt following yet i dont see him she murmured no nick glanced in the rearview mirror again hopefully by the time he gets his own vehicle and tries to give chase well be far enough away he cant find us jill kept her gaze fixed on the side mirror until they turned a corner without seeing johns black van appear she relaxed a little bit then and tried to think what she should do now after a moments thought she glanced to nick i need to call my brother of course my cell phone is in the glove compartment when jill peered at the glove compartment but made no move to try to open it nick gave a short laugh sorry i wasnt thinking ill get it for you he murmured pulling to a stop at a red light he leaned sideways reaching past her to open the glove compartment and retrieve the phone in question he started to hand it to her then paused and shook his head i guess i better dial for you jill smiled faintly but forced herself to stop when she realized her tongue hung out of her mouth when she did probably not the image she wanted to convey whats his number nick asked as the light turned green jill rattled off the number and watched as he eased the car forward through the lights his concentration split between the phone and the road ahead once finished he didnt hand the phone to her but placed it to his own ear and listened to it ring the answering machine has picked up he said after a moment a frown curving his lips what do i say jill heaved a sigh just hang up they must still be out nick flipped the phone closed and set it on the seat beside her jill stared at the phone with frustration for a moment and then said they probably wont be out much longer if you dropped me off there i could wait for him to get back and no way nick said firmly your brothers house is probably the first place this john guy will look jill grimaced but didnt argue now that hed said it she realized it was true and shed rather avoid running into john heathcliffe again and your place would probably be his next stop nick added before she could suggest it as an alternative jill frowned and peered out the window startled when she saw the huskys face reflected turning away from the image she said well i have to wait somewhere you cant just drive me around until my brother and his wife return home if claire and beth have gone too they could be doing lastminute christmas shopping they could stop for lunch or even a matinee movie and be gone for hours then well have to wait hours he said firmly im not leaving you alone to be caught by that john guy but youre supposed to be meeting the rest of the parade crew at your sisters place she reminded him yes he said and smiled suddenly so thats where well go well go to my sisters party you can keep calling from there im not exactly dressed for a party jill pointed out dryly nick glanced at her his smile deepening before he said conversationally you know i would have killed to have a talking dog as a kid jill grunted not amused although i probably would have picked a terrier i always liked terriers best terriers are small she pointed out when he glanced at her with confusion she pointed out i can shift my shape but i dont think i can shrink it down to the size of a terrier oh he peered at her curiously and then said so i suppose shifting into a mouse so i can slip you into my pocket to enter my sisters house is out huh ha ha she said dryly and then heaved a sigh and slumped on the passenger seat resting her head on her front paws with dejection i guess ill have to go as a dog it wasnt how shed imagined a first meeting with his family would be nick glanced at her dejected state and frowned before turning his attention back to the road when he turned right several moments later and the suv bounced slightly as it went over the lip of a driveway jill sat up and peered around curiously expecting to see that theyd arrived at his sisters house instead she found herself staring out at the large parking lot of a mall what are we doing here she asked with bewilderment as he steered the car down the ramp into underground parking theres something i need to pick up before we go to my sisters nick answered as he pulled into an empty parking spot in the back corner of the complex turning off the engine he glanced at her with concern will you be all right here by yourself for a few minutes yes of course she murmured her gaze sliding over the other cars it was winter and cold out but there werent many people around either coming or going from vehicles jill supposed when it got cold or inclement workers of the shops in the mall who started first thing in the morning took up the majority of spaces in the underground parking nick had probably been lucky to find an open spot ill be as quick as i can he assured her and then slipped out of the truck jill watched him walk across the parking lot to the elevators that would carry him up into the mall itself then relaxed back on the seat a little sigh slipping out her mind was filled with thoughts worrying mostly about where john was was he back at her store searching it checking her house to see if shed gone there or he might be headed to kyles house expecting her to head there for help that last thought made her sit up anxiously she wished shed been able to reach her brother something bumped against her paw as she shifted and she found herself peering down at the cell phone nick had left on the seat with her and stilled she should try the house again if john were headed that way who knew what hed do to her brother and his family jill pawed at the phone and even managed to flip it open using her paws and nose but punching in the numbers was impossible the keypads were just too tiny growling in frustration she peered around the parking garage again but now that she worried that john was heading to kyle and claires she was overwhelmed with the desperate need to call there she peered around the suvs interior searching for a pencil or something she could hold in her mouth and use to punch in the numbers but there didnt appear to be anything like that her gaze slid to the elevator in time to see the doors open as it disgorged a couple of people neither of them were nick jills gaze slid back to the phone she had to call her brother if she changed back to herself she could shed also be naked jill shifted on her paws trying to decide what to do she couldnt show up at nicks sisters house naked she needed to warn her brother naked brother the two words began to alternate in her mind growling with frustration she turned on the seat and peered into the back of the suv hoping to find something to help her out of this situation she sighed with relief on spotting the red plaid throw folded neatly on the back seat perfect she thought happily she could change back into herself wrap herself in the blanket and call her brother then she could wear the blanket to kyles sisters where he could slip in and maybe borrow her something to wear that way she could try calling kyle right away and hopefully warn him before john got there the plan had its flaws but it was better than nothing she told herself besides she simply couldnt sit there doing nothing while her family might be in danger mind made up jill leapt between the two front seats into the back dropped onto the floor in front of the seat and closed her eyes just wanting to be herself had been enough to cause the shift while shed been on the float and on the street so thats what jill concentrated on she wanted to be herself she repeated that refrain in her mind several times then cautiously opened her eyes and peered down relieved when instead of black fur she found herself staring at her own pale flesh yes she breathed and snatched up the folded blanket only to freeze as it dropped open and she saw that it wasnt a blanket at all but a plaid scarf a large scarf to be sure measuring perhaps five feet long and a foot wide but still just a scarf jill closed her eyes briefly and groaned she should have examined it before carrying out the change she should have really it was too late for should haves jill told herself firmly and forced herself to examine the scarf it wasnt a blanket but it was large for a scarf and would just have to do she shifted the material around in her hands considering the best way to cover the most she could with the scrap of cloth finally she wrapped it around the back of her neck brought both sides down over her breasts and then tucked the ends of the material between her legs this covered all the vital spots but just barely unfortunately it was the best she could do and it was too late to change her mind she didnt have a picture of the dog or anything else to change back into now grimacing jill leaned around the back of the front seat and tried to snatch up the phone but it was further away than shed thought and all she managed to do was brush it with her fingertips and send it slipping off the seat onto the floor in front perfect she muttered to herself and rose up enough to peer around the parking garage fortunately there didnt appear to be anyone around to witness it so muttering under her breath jill quickly climbed between the front seats into the front of the vehicle then dropped onto the floor there to keep out of sight as she searched around for the phone it took her a moment to realize shed sat herself on it but then she found it flipped it open and punched in her brothers number as had happened every time before this the phone rang several times before being picked up by the answering machine jill hung up as soon as she heard her brothers recorded message and then stared at the phone unhappily wishing shed bothered to memorize his cell phone number unfortunately with it programmed into her cell phone shed never taken the trouble to memorize it why bother when all she had to do was hit contacts find her brothers name and hit dial now she peered absently around what she could see of the car interior from her position running numbers through her mind trying to recall it by memory she was sure it ended with or maybe growling with frustration jill lowered her head then jerked it back up in surprise when the drivers door suddenly opened nick peered in frowning when he didnt see her on the passengers seat then froze when he spotted her on the floor you changed back he said with surprise im really worried that john might go to kyles i wanted to try calling him again jill explained apologetically drawing her knees closer to her body to help cover up her near nudity oh nick hesitated glanced around the garage behind him then stepped up into the vehicle dragging a large shopping bag with him as he settled in the drivers seat and pulled the door closed he then glanced at her again only to pause and blink is that my scarf youre wearing oh jill glanced down at herself selfconsciously and drew her knees even closer still to her chest it was the only thing i could find in here he bit his lip she suspected to keep from grinning and then said well i guess its a good thing i picked this up then jills eyebrows rose as he now offered her the bag hed brought with him what is it she asked rather than take the bag a dress he answered quietly i thought maybe youd prefer not being a dog the first time you met my family or borrowing clothes i thought you might rather change back into yourself and wear this to my sisters house oh jill breathed and then lifted shining eyes to his he was such a thoughtful man so smart and clever and caring god she could love this man maybe already did shed known him for six months this certainly wasnt the first time hed shown this considerate caring side hed shown her that and much more since moving into the store next door hed proven himself funny and smart and insightful and sweet yes she might very well love the man and he apparently liked her back hed admitted to her when she was noelle that he was more interested in her than in any other woman since leaving his wife maybe if you keep looking at me like that jill let her thoughts die and blinked at nick his expression had gone serious his eyes hot and intense it reminded her of those few passionate moments at the end of the alley of his arms around her his mouth on hers his hands sliding over her body and she wanted to experience all that again this time as herself in her own body not a body borrowed from a calendar if i keep looking at you like that what she asked softly nick was silent his gaze slipping down over her taking in the bit of cloth shed tried to place so strategically and the expanse of flesh it didnt cover jill felt his gaze like a caress goose bumps began popping up on her skin and she shivered where she sat her eyelids growing heavy and her mouth parting on a little sigh suddenly he was leaning forward seemingly unable to stop himself from pressing his lips to her invitingly open mouth jill breathed out a little sigh as his mouth covered hers and she began to struggle to get her arms free of the cramped space shed put herself in so that she could touch him she wanted to wrap her arms around his neck and press her body to his as she had at the mouth of the alley but was trapped by her position briefly then nick suddenly caught her by the arms and lifted her up onto the seat jill murmured her relief and gratitude into his mouth as she slid her arms around his shoulders uncaring that the movement had dislodged the scarf revealing anything he cared to see nick cared though breaking the kiss he pulled back slightly and peered down over her and she followed his glance noting that her nipples were already hard and erect eager for his touch as if unable to stop himself nick reached out and ran one finger lightly over the exposed tip then bent his head to cover it with his lips jill cried out and arched on the seat her hand drifting into his hair and holding on as he suckled but it was too much too quick and she found herself tugging at his hair urging him back up to kiss her nick gave in to the demand and covered her mouth with his quickly deepening the kiss with a thrust of his tongue his hand replaced his mouth at her breast caressing and teasing the hard peak and making her writhe and moan beneath him that seemed to cut loose the last of his restraint because nick groaned deep in his throat and propelled himself forward pushing himself out of his seat and forcing her back against her own as he came over her she felt the leather against her back then the seat suddenly collapsed beneath her and she found herself flat on her back with nick on top his hands roaming her body as his mouth pillaged hers jill gasped and arched as his hands closed on her skin each claiming a breast and this time didnt protest when nick broke their kiss again and moved his mouth away to begin a trail down her neck ive wanted to do this for so long he breathed against her throat as he moved lower you dont know how hard its been not to kiss or touch you all this time jills answer was to arch and whimper with need as his lips trailed over her collarbone and began to crest the curve of her breast how many times ive sat eating my lunch thinking how beautiful you are how much i wanted to touch you and taste you and his words died as he reached her breast once more and covered her nipple sucking it into his warm wet mouth so that his tongue could swirl around it jills entire body seemed to tighten up in reaction this time one hand clawing at his shoulder the other tugging viciously at his hair trying to make him kiss her again nick ignored the silent demand this time and simply suckled harder as one hand moved to cover her other breast and tease the nipple there jill opened her mouth to beg him to stop it and kiss her again then nearly bit off her tongue when she felt his other hand begin sliding up her thigh a little alarmed at how out of control she felt and at how quickly this was all going jill caught his shoulder and tugged hard relieved when this time he gave in to her and slid up her body to kiss her jill kissed him back passionately but wanted more she wanted him kissing her suckling at her breast and she wanted to have him inside her she wanted it all frustrated by the clothing separating them jill began to tug at his shirt dragging it out of his jeans with more desperation than finesse the moment it was loose she slid her hands under the material and hungrily ran them over his bare flesh but it wasnt enough shed wanted him for so longforever it seemed nowand need was exploding inside her making her demanding as her hands slid down to his jeans and began to tug insistently when the jeans didnt slide down his body she changed tactics and managed to squirm her hand into the waistband and find him with her fingers nick groaned into her mouth his hips instinctively thrusting into the caress as she touched him god he gasped and pressed his mouth to her neck now one hand sliding down along her hip as he ground against her jill pressed a kiss to his forehead and ran her fingers over him again in the next moment nick had shifted them both to their sides facing each other he then used one hand to catch her by the back of the neck and pull her face forward for a masterful kiss as his other hand went searching as his tongue thrust into her his fingers found the hot wet core of her and began to explore jill cried out into his mouth and bucked against his seeking hand her own fingers squeezing hard around him she thought shed explode any minute was almost desperate to do so then laughter hit her ear and startled her back to awareness of where they were it had the same effect on nick and he suddenly stilled too they pulled slightly apart and stared at each other briefly then nick raised his head and peered out the window when he didnt say anything she rose up to peer out as well and bit her lip as she saw a pair of young men coming from the direction of the elevator and starting along the row of cars toward them it was enough to have jill and nick scrambling he shifted back into the drivers seat and picked up the bag to drag out the dress hed purchased as jill slid back to the floor and out of view of the windows she began to don it without even really looking at it managing to tug it on and down over her hips in record time here nick leaned down toward her and jill stilled unsure what he was doing until he straightened away with the price tag in hand jills gaze flickered over the tag and she smiled with gratitude then pushed herself up out of the small floor space and onto the seat tugging the dress down over her hips and upper legs as she went a glance out the window showed the two young men just passing by the suv not seeming to even notice them inside she watched them walk to a car several down from their own then let a little sigh slip from her lips part of her resented the interruption of what she and nick had been doing but another part was confused shed liked the man for ages and wondered why hed never made a move but now things seemed to be moving in high gear it was a bit overwhelming are you all right nick brushed his hand lightly over her cheek his expression concerned when she turned to peer at him forcing a smile she nodded iyes its all just a little intense he suggested quietly when her voice faltered jill nodded solemnly intense was a good word for it another word was overwhelming nick leaned forward and kissed the tip of her nose then hugged her comfortingly it will be all right he murmured by her ear its just that weve been seeing each other for six months and all these feelings have built up and he paused to clear his throat then said im sorry if i was rushing you jills breath came out on a soft laugh you arent rushing me i mean its all rather overwhelming but you didnt do anything i didnt want and frowning she took a breath and admitted i want you i really do im hard pressed not to ask you to make love to me right here and now but theres so much going on so much to worry about im worried about what john heathcliffe is doing right now about whether kyle and claire are safe and shh i know nick hugged her a little tighter and rubbed her back soothingly i know its all happening at the same time i think thats one of murphys laws or something but we can handle all this together well go to my sisters where youll be safe in a crowd of people you can keep calling your brother and his wife until you get through to them and well take care of this heathcliffe character then well deal with the us part of the equation okay jill smiled into his shoulder and nodded theyd handle it together and then deal with the us part of the equation it had a nice ring to it okay she whispered into his shoulder and he pulled back slightly to peer at her we are going to deal with the us part though jill he reassured her solemnly as if she might think he was just putting her off we have something special here and my year is up my divorce is final and im now free to pursue you like i want to jill smiled at his expression and then whispered its about time pursue away nick grinned and then kissed her again before saying we should get moving yes jill whispered settling back in her seat and doing up her seatbelt nick started the engine and then pulled out of the parking spot but jill wasnt paying attention her gaze had dropped to the dress she wore and she was examining it with surprise it was a simple black cocktail dress simple classic stylish and tasteful this is nice she said with surprise nick grinned dont sound so surprised i happen to have good taste sorry jill laughed then added uncertainly but isnt it a bit dressy for a casual afternoon party nick shook his head the first part of the party is casual but then most people will leave and at about eight pm my sister is having a dinner party oh jill managed a smile then its perfect you have good taste his eyes caught on her lips briefly and then he cleared his throat and turned his attention back to the front as they pulled out of the parking garage jill found her eyes slipping over his mouth and hands recalling their moments of passion and decided to distract herself she said it was nice of your sister to hold a party for the parade people there was nothing nice about it he said with a wry smile sue started out having the party for the people she and her husband work with at the psychiatric hospital but when she found out about you she told me to invite you along i pointed out that it might be uncomfortable for you to have our first date be a party with my family so she opened it up to everyone in the parade too he shook his head then went on the afternoon is an open party with drinks and snacks for employees of the hospital and parade members and then at eight its a proper sitdown dinner with her her husband my brother and his wife and us he cast her an apologetic glance sorry about that jill merely shrugged she already knew from their talks that his sister and her husband were both psychiatrists and that his brother was a policeman with a baker for a wife in fact she knew a good deal about his whole family and even many of his friends theyd talked a great deal these last six months the sister arranging things to meet her didnt surprise her so much as the fact that the woman knew about her nick had been talking about her to his family what did you say that made her want to meet me she asked curiously nick was silent so long she didnt think he would answer but then he admitted that i was pretty sure you were the one jill blinked the one she echoed faintly nick didnt respond until they reached the first set of lights braking then he met her glance and said quietly weve been friends for six months jill i know everything about you the only thing i didnt know was whether wed be sexually compatible he glanced to the light and back and then added of course its pretty obvious now that wont be an issue jill flushed but merely smiled and reached over to squeeze his leg this day was turning out to be more than shed ever expected all shed hoped for was being asked out on a date and possibly a first kiss she was getting much more than that it was as if the last six months of their lunches and platonic friendship had been dating without it actually being called that and without kissing or anything else now they were moving ahead at an amazing rate from friends to almost lovers and being the one she shook her head with amazement if it werent for john heathcliffes antics this would be the most perfect day she could imagine here we are nick announced and then blew out a whistle it looks like were the last to arrive well be lucky to find parking anywhere nearby jill didnt comment but was just recalling that she was barefoot when nick said by the way there are shoes in the bag too she glanced at him with surprise and then caught up the bag from where it lay discarded on the floor and retrieved a pair of dressy black shoes her eyes widened with surprise as she noted the size nick grinned i own a shoe store love i can guess a shoe size at a glance and am usually right she smiled at the claim and slid on the shoes as he parked then leaned over and kissed him on the cheek thank you she whispered and meant it he was very thoughtful others might not have thought of stopping to get her clothes let alone shoes but he had his consideration was one of the things she liked about him but there was so much more too nick smiled and reached out to squeeze her hand affectionately then opened his car door lets go time to face the lions chapter good lord the two of you must be freezing come in jill smiled at nicks sister as she opened the door to them but then her eyes ran curiously over the large entry taking in the gleaming hardwood floors and cream walls the room was beautiful and made more so by the tasteful christmas decorations where are your coats maggie asked as she closed the door behind them we lost them at the parade nick murmured oh people nowadays maggie tutted with a scowl you cant leave anything alone for a minute anymore she shook her head well never mind ill loan you both coats before you go thanks mags nick said giving her a hug youre a sweetie yes i am and dont you forget it maggie laughed as he released her she then turned to beam at jill hi im maggie nicks sister and you must be jill the smart funny lovely lady who owns the clothing store next door to nick jill flushed with embarrassment her lips tipping wryly as she said i take it nick has mentioned me then mentioned you maggie laughed its been jill this and jill that for six months i was beginning to think the divorce would never be over so we could meet you you know nick said scowling at his sister if i hadnt already told jill what i thought of her id be really embarrassed right now i knew youd tell her before you got here youve been chomping at the bit for the last couple months im surprised you managed to wait until the divorce was signed maggie said with an unrepentant grin and then added i plan to help the two of you along by telling jill all sorts of things today nick rolled his eyes apparently not surprised at the threat oh well if youre just going to embarrass me i think ill go find jill and me a drink will you be all right for a minute he asked running a hand down her arm she nodded and he pressed a kiss to her cheek whispering she means well jill smiled at the claim as he turned away dont hurry back maggie called after him and then turned to jill with a wide smile nickys told me so much about you i feel i know you already of course thats how i knew he was serious about you it is jill asked eyes wide nick had said as much earlier but it was still startling to hear it from his sister as jay had said it seemed everyone had known he liked her except for her maggie considered her expression solemnly then murmured it must have driven you wild these last six months eating lunch together every day his seeming to like you but never making a move she grimaced i know it would have driven me mad when jill merely smiled crookedly maggie said im afraid he had to if michellehis exwifehad caught wind that he was seriously interested in someone shed have dragged her feet on the divorce to get more money just to make him miserable ah jill felt her shoulders relax while shed believed what nick had said shed wondered why once hed decided she was the one hed still held to his determination not to reveal his feelings until the year was up now she understood she is a horrible woman grasping greedy and spiteful she shuddered and added nicky would never tell you that but im not as nice she was horrid she must have had some redeeming features jill murmured though she was actually pleased to hear this poor opinion of the first wife nick doesnt seem the sort to marry someone like that he was younger and she was a model always flying off to some shoot or other she grimaced with her around so little we were all fooled once they were married though she dropped out of modeling was around and couldnt uphold the image of the sweetheart for long still out here nick asked as he approached up the hall pausing at jills side he handed her a glass of eggnog and then glanced from one to the other so has my sister scared you off yet jill smiled faintly and shook her head afraid not i guess youre stuck with me lucky me he murmured slipping an arm around her as he sipped his own drink you make such a cute couple maggie commented with a pleased little sigh maggie love all three of them glanced up the hall as a man poked his head around the door a small frown on his face do we have any more club soda i cant ill find it maggie called out interrupting him and then said lou this is nicks friend jill jill my husband lou hello jill greeted him with a smile hi jill lou grinned then gave nick a thumbs up nice one maggie shook her head as he disappeared back into the room then smiled at nick and jill you two should join the party ill catch up with you later thanks for the warning nick teased ha ha maggie muttered as she walked away and then paused and turned back to say oh i almost forgot some of the parade people beat you here most are in the back room though there was one fellow hanging out in the front room watching for you nick frowned at this news watching for me no it was jill he asked about jill was aware of nick stiffening next to her even as ice slid down her back what did he look like nick asked dread in his voice about your height and build dark hair intense eyes and a bit cold maggie answered frowning now as well he followed a group of parade people in i thought he was with them but theyre all hanging around together and hes sticking to himself is there a problem nicks gaze locked with jills but he shook his head no im sure its fine maggie lou sent me to ask if you have any ginger ale all three of them glanced up the hall to see another male peering around the door frame he looked like an older version of nick and jill knew at once that this must be his brother mac the police officer the way his gaze was moving over her rather than focusing on maggie made her suspect lou had mentioned her presence and hed come for a look see at nicks friend mac jill jill our brother mac maggie announced telling her shed been right she then continued up the hall saying ill find the ginger ale and club soda at the door she paused and glanced back to add ill catch up to you two later jill waited until the pair were out of sight before turning anxiously to nick you dont think the guest waiting for me is john heathcliffe do you i dont know nick said with a frown i suppose he could have overheard the others talking about the party while he was in the parking lot and then followed a group of them here and entered on their heels jill bit her lip at the prospect shed just begun to feel safe again look nick said suddenly i think you should wait in the library while i walk through the house and check out the guests if hes here well leave before he knows youve arrived if not we can relax and enjoy the party okay when jill nodded he urged her to a pair of double doors and ushered her inside you can use the phone to try to call your brother while im gone ill be quick he assured her as he pulled the door closed turning away jill moved to the telephone on the desk and quickly punched in her brothers number she wasnt surprised when the answering machine picked up again and almost hung up but then changed her mind and said kyle where are you i need to talk to you its really important ill call again she hung up shoulders sagging and head dropping unhappily to her chest this was the best and worst day of her life as much good was happening as bad but all together it was exhausting and beginning to wear on her the sound of the door opening made her straighten abruptly jill didnt want nick seeing her looking as defeated as she felt taking a breath she forced a smile and turned only to freeze when she saw john heathcliffe moving quickly toward her eyes widening jill swiftly shifted around the desk placing it between them leave me alone im not going with you of course you are john started around the desk toward her no shes not nick countered from the doorway his mouth tightened at johns surprised expression and he said i saw you slipping in here what happened you saw us arrive and what hid in the coat closet to wait until jill was on her own ignoring the question john continued around the desk dont interfere im taking her with me the hell you are nick rushed forward catching johns wrist before he could touch jill he then swung at him with his other hand balled into a fist but the scientist grabbed his wrist before he could land the blow and the two men began to struggle they were about the same size and apparently equal in strength because at first they simply crashed first one way then the other neither of them able to pull free or land a blow but then john suddenly released the hold he had on nicks wrist and reached into his pocket all the breath seemed to leave jills lungs when she saw the gun he pulled out the paperweight shed picked up from the desk a second before suddenly seemed as effective as a toy and jill glanced around wildly for something else anything else even as she peered around though she was wishing she was still the reindeer shed gore the man but good were she still the reindeer with those long deadly antlers in the next moment she was jill hadnt closed her eyes and hadnt spent several moments concentrating as shed thought she had to shed just wanted it and suddenly the paperweight was slipping from her mutating fingers and she was dropping to the floor as her body shifted to reindeer form the sound of tearing cloth accompanied it and jill grimaced knowing her lovely dress was being ruined by the new shape unable to do anything about that she glanced to the two men again relieved to see that rather than shoot nick john was swinging the gun at his head she immediately launched herself forward a frustrated growl slipping from her lips as nick fell under the blow before she reached his attacker john cried out in surprise when she rammed her antlers into his backside he crashed to the floor the gun slipping from his hands and skittering across the hardwood to come to rest under the desk he didnt go after it but instead scrabbled across the hardwood himself trying to get away from jill and her antlers jill let him go and peered at nick relieved when he stirred and moaned john could have killed him with that blow that thought brought her anger roaring back and she lifted her head to glower at john despite the fact that she was rudolph in a torn dress john whimpered and pulled himself into a ball before she could go after him the door to the library crashed open and instinct made her drop to her belly on the floor to hide behind the couch who the hell are you lous voice was sharp and demanding where are jill and nick mac added the question assuring jill that neither she nor nick were visible from the door they would be though if the men moved further into the room she realized and closed her eyes concentrating on being herself nicks hand on her arm drew her eyes open a moment later to see that he was awake and she was herself once more smiling at him worriedly she helped him to his feet then grimaced when she glanced down to see the state of her dress this shapeshifting was obviously going to be hell on her wardrobe what on earth is going on here maggie pushed her her way through the crowd that had gathered in the door and hurried around the couch to join them her worried eyes sliding from nick to jill and back as if unsure who was in the worse state nick youre bleeding and jill her voice trailed off helplessly as she took in her torn dress are you all right when jill nodded maggie turned her attention back to nick to fuss over his head wound nick suffered it until mac shifted impatiently by the door and demanded what the hell is going on nick how did you get hurt and why is jill all beat up and who the hell is this guy he added gesturing to where john was just getting back to his feet jill lifted her head slightly she wasnt really beat up her dress was a mess and her hair was probably a bit tangled but other than that she was fine nick slipped an arm around her waist drawing her to his side as he said this guy is john heathcliffe he attacked jill and was trying to force her to go with him he hit me over the head with his gun when i tried to stop him the word gun was like an alarm bell mac stiffened his eyes narrowing on john no doubt searching for the weapon in question he dropped the gun i think it slid under the desk jill said helpfully take a look and see if its there lou but dont touch it if it is mac said positioning himself in front of the door in case john had any hopes of leaving that way lou moved to the desk and dropped to one knee to peer under it he straightened a moment later and nodded solemnly indicating there was indeed a gun there the mans a nut nick said at once he thinks jill is a witch or something when jill glanced at him with confusion nick squeezed her hand reassuringly not a witch a shapeshifter you fool john snapped right whatever nick said with a meaningful look at his brotherinlaw and he wants to kidnap her take her back to his home and torture the evil out of her he probably has a cage and everything the cage is just to keep her from escaping john said quickly and i wouldnt torture her just study her im a scientist and we need to experiment on her do empirical studies to see how her cells respond to various stimuli like cold heat or being cut off cut off jill squeaked with horror john nodded yes painful but necessary ill have to cut parts off and see if they change on their own or die and see if the appendage will grow back or your cells simply displace to replace it well ive heard enough mac said dryly hmmm lou murmured the psychiatrist came to his wifes side and whispered something that made her nod and move silently out of the room the moment she was gone lou offered john a smile these sound like fascinating experiments john science has always fascinated me would you tell me more he moved carefully forward as he spoke his movements slow and cautious his expression nonthreatening john frowned looking uncertain but it seemed keeping this all to himself for so long had been terribly difficult he was eager to tell someone i have a whole list of experiments i wish to try he blurted excitement edging into his expression i need to test her in cold temperatures and hot to see if it affects her ability to change and see if she can now withstand freezing temperatures better than normal people i had a huge walkin freezer installed for that one he admitted proudly jill shuddered at the thought cutting parts off freezing her none of it sounded appetizing she was doubly glad shed escaped him that morning jesus nicks soft horrified whisper drew her gaze to see that hed gone pale it seemed he was equally distressed at the tests shed barely escaped yes of course lou was saying solemnly his gaze moving to the door as maggie slid back into the room she nodded at her husband and his gaze then slid meaningfully to mac before he put a hand on johns shoulder to turn him away walking him toward the windows he said i can see how these would all be necessary tell me more jill watched as maggie and mac started to move silently forward it wasnt until they moved past her and nick that she spotted the syringe the woman held in the hand that had been behind her back since entering eyes widening as understanding sank in she glanced back to john as the man continued his explanations well he was saying ill have to see how chemicals affect her now too poisons radiation etc we have to know just how her cellular basis has been altered andhey john tried to whirl around but lou and mac both grabbed him and held him in place as maggie pushed down the plunger on the needle shed just jabbed into his arm what are you doing stop that john tried to struggle free but it was too late maggie had finished administering the shot and now backed away leaving the two men to hold the struggling scientist its all right john lou was saying soothingly this is just something to help you relax i dont need to relax what did you give me he asked his eyes widening with horror as his words began to slur as i said its just something to help you relax but you said you understood you wanted to hear about he gasped as his legs suddenly gave out if not for mac and lou holding him he would have fallen she was sure but the men were holding him and shifted their holds to catch him under the arms and half drag half carry him to the couch i am most interested in hearing what you have to say john lou assured him and well have plenty of time for you to tell me all your plans and tests at the hospital when you wake up wake up hospital johns voice was soft and confused then his eyes blinked closed and he appeared to go to sleep well mac said straightening slowly away from the now unconscious man its handy your being the head of a psychiatric hospital lou i cant think of a better candidate for the place hmm lou nodded solemnly the man is obviously delusional has he always been jills eyes widened as the two men turned in her direction in question she quickly shook her head and said i dont know i dont know him ive heard of him but never met him before today how did you hear of him mac asked with a frown jill glanced nervously at nick when he nodded encouragingly and squeezed her hand she said carefully he worked with my brother several years ago on some experiment but it didnt work and they closed down the lab hmm lou turned back to the man well his attacking you plus what he said here is enough to lock him up for seventytwo hours observation i suspect what he says once he wakes up will be enough to keep him locked up for a while at least until we can find a drug treatment plan that will stabilize him and rid him of the delusion that youre a witch or shapeshifter or whatever it is but why you mac asked quietly jill glanced sharply at the officer and swallowed thickly the man was looking suspicious and she suddenly felt terribly guilty though she had nothing to feel guilty for if hes never met you before why did his delusion fixate on you mac asked squeezing her hand again nick jumped in to say jill didnt know him but he told her that hed been watching her brother kyle for a while and her as well didnt he jill he prompted yes she nodded quickly this morning when he first tried to kidnap me he said hed been watching my brother kyle and his family since the project ended all those years ago and started following me after he saw me leaving and er finally decided that i was the one he should turn into a shapeshifter and experiment on he tried to kidnap you this morning mac asked with surprise did you make a report ino ii tried to call my brother right afterward to tell him but there was no answer and i had promised to be in the parade she let her words fade to silence knowing how lame they sounded she thought it was a joke nick said helping her out then gave a laugh and a shrug what else was she supposed to think she recognized his name from when he worked with her brother but he was claiming she was some creature and he was going to lock her up and experiment on her he shrugged she thought it was a joke it was only when he tried to get on our float at the end and then started chasing us around that either of us took it all seriously ah lou nodded as if that all made perfect sense even mac relaxed a bit though he wasnt looking wholly satisfied the ambulance is here jay announced from the doorway and jill shifted uncomfortably as she was reminded of the presence of all the partygoers none of them were looking at her with anything but sympathy however right lou said drawing her attention back to the two men by the couch lets get this fellow on his way to being settled in the hospital then shall we nick drew jill back out of the way as the ambulance attendants entered with a gurney they lifted johns unconscious form onto the wheeled bed strapped him down and then took him out with lou mac and maggie following jill felt her shoulders sag as the room immediately began to clear nick drew her against his chest how are you holding up shall we leave and go someplace and relax jill nodded with relief my place id like to bathe and change nick smiled wryly as he took in the ruined dress she wore it didnt last long but it did look good on you while it lasted jill smiled faintly and leaned her head into his chest for a hug murmuring i suspect it may be a good thing that i own a clothing store and i a shoe store he agreed with a grin and she glanced down to see that shed lost her shoes once more wrinkling her nose she peered around the room and then slipped from under his arm to move around the couch a relieved sigh slid from her lips when she spotted the shoes hed bought her here they are she announced bending to pick them up and slip them on so its only your clothes my coat and this dress that were lost or ruined in todays excitement nick commented not bad all things considered yes i could be locked in a cage right now being burnt or frozen she said with disgust and shook her head at the madness not to mention cruelty of johns heathcliffes plans for her not so long as i live and breathe nick assured her quietly and slid his arm around her again the moment she straightened jill didnt know if it was because he was finally free to do so or simply a reaction to the fact that hed nearly lost her to john heathcliffe and his madness but nick seemed to need to keep her close now and was always touching her he had his arm around her as he made their excuses to his sister and promised theyd come back in the next day or so for a meal then held her hand in the suv all the way to her place once theyd reached her home the touching took on a different tone nick started out just trying to be caring by running her bath while she collected a robe and towel but then his efforts to help her get the ruined dress off saw them liplocked this time there were no sudden bursts of laughter or talking to force them apart and they ended up making love right there on the bath mat a memorable first time to be sure a memorable second time followed when he joined her in the bath they were out and drying off when the phone rang pulling on her robe jill left the towel for nick and rushed out to the end of the hall to answer the phone jill are you all right i got your message when we got back it was followed by a bunch of hangups i worried might be you yes the hangups were me too jill admitted with a little sigh glancing over her shoulder to see nick walking up the hall to join her with only the towel wrapped around his waist she smiled softly and relaxed back against his chest as he stepped up to wrap his arms around her from behind whats happened kyle asked worriedly you sounded pretty upset in the message jill opened her mouth to speak and then closed it again as all she had to tell him rolled through her mind this was going to be a long conversation and jill simply wasnt up to that right now all she wanted was to collapse into bed and sleep in nicks arms and she decided she could john heathcliffe was safely locked up for at least seventytwo hours tomorrow morning she would get up bright and early and go over to her brothers house and tell him everything for now it would wait jill kyle asked whats happened what were you calling to tell me she opened her mouth but again paused this time because nick had started to nibble at her neck even as his hands slid around to tug her robe open so his hands could run freely over her body i called to tell you jill paused on a soft gasp as nicks hands closed over her breasts then finished breathily mr handsome shoes isnt gay mr handsome shoes nick asked with amusement pinching her nipples lightly for punishment you were calling to tell me mr handsome shoes isnt gay kyle asked with disbelief and jill heard claire squeal in the background and then cry he finally asked her out didnt he rather than answer either question jill laughed and pushed nicks hands away saying im coming by tomorrow for breakfast nice of you to invite yourself kyle said dryly trust me you owe me jill responded just as dryly fending off nicks roaming hands as she added i might be bringing nick if he wants to come and believe me you owe him too we have quite a bit to tell you i heard that claire cried obviously having picked up another phone in the house you cant say something like that and then just leave us in suspense what do you have to tell us tomorrow jill said firmly and hung up hmm mr handsome shoes nick murmured as she turned in his arms and slid her own around his neck no wonder your brother thought i was gay if youve been calling me that i didnt she assured him pressing her body close to his claire did he grinned you talked about me to claire did you and you talked about me to your family she pointed out reaching down to undo the towel around his waist yes maybe we should have done a little more talking with each other jill laughed at the claim and began to press kisses to his chest talking is all we did buddy its the other things we should have done more of oh such as he teased smiling jill pulled away and caught his hand as she began to back her way down the hall come with me and ill show you smiling kyle allowed her to lead him into the bedroom murmuring somehow

filthy feet of a man in a wrinkled black suit the air reeked cigarette smoke cheap cologne a multitude of unwashed bodies that had circulated through the room for hours upon hours for days on end the scents made sixs nose run her eyes itch and though she had held her job for only minutesby her watch anyway which was atomic in nature and government issuedher brief tenure here was more than enough as far as she was concerned the other girls who worked in this placelegitimately without pretensedeserved medals not that six had met any of them as per the agreement with the massage parlors ownerwho according to his file had long ago given up his chinese name for the ridiculous foreign moniker of lucky john six had remained virtually locked inside this small room forced to massage the feet and bodies of one man after another if any of those paying guests asked for a different girl lucky john was to insist all the others were busy and if he did not do exactly thator if any one of the men discovered sixs true identitythe repercussions had been made quite clear police clear prison clear end of life clear six rolled her shoulders glancing at the man reclining in front of her on the wide red chair his eyes were closed his breathing deep and even not asleep but certainly relaxed his face was broad and flat a large mole replete with long black hair made a target of his chin a toothpick jutted from between his lips six slid her thumbs along the arch of his foot pushing between his toes she pinched hard on the bone he jerked grunting and she applied more pressure the man opened his eyes and kicked at her six allowed his big toe to connect with her chin though she angled her head just enough to make it a glancing blow bitch he growled slapping the padded arm of his chair with one hard palm careful as six was supposed to be deaflike all the other girls of lucky johns massage parlorshe did not respond merely ducked her head allowing her straight black hair to fall loose past her face hiding the grim flat smile that passed fleetingly across her mouth just outside the rooms painted bamboo door six heard footsteps quick then slow accompanied by lucky johns shrill voice the man beneath her hands tensed so did six the door opened six glimpsed lucky johns distraught expression his eyes large and focused entirely on herstupid of him a sure giveaway if these men were in any way observant and paranoidbut her view of the old pimps quick retreat was obscured by a broad chest and skinny tie and then there was another man in the room and the door closed with a quiet click six glanced up and met a flat gaze cold as the thick black ice covering the old concrete of her first training installation a gymnasium near the peoples hall in beijing where she had studied alongside the countrys olympic hopefuls before being culled young no older than five she still remembered she remembered training on that ice out in the blast of arctic wind toughening herself knowing she had to be stronger than the others and for a different reason entirely the newcomer stared at her six dropped her gaze but not before observing other oddities such as the mans utter foreignness a purely physical difference that nonetheless revealed some kind of asian ancestor through nothing more than the turn of his dark eyes and the prominence of his cheekbones there was a hint of red in his hair though white man enough running through his veins six could still feel him watching her when he shifted slightly turned to the man reclining on the chair and said i told you not to call me chenglei his mandarin was spoken perfectly without accent smooth tones full of the north and its soft curves an elegant voice more cultured than criminal certainly educated six continued massaging the foot in her hands it jerked once then stilled but you came i came because youre trouble said the foreigner i came because i keep my eyes on trouble trouble chengleis foot twitched again look to yourself then look and regret i have no regrets all you had to do i told you no you did chenglei said but we found another and he did not say no the menace in those words was unmistakable though six did not understand their meaning nor did she need to she was not an interpreter just muscle a soldier though at the moment even that did not give her pride too much distraction she could feel the listening wire taped between her breasts it had been warm part of her but now the thin casing was coldshe was coldthe whole room like ice all the heat sucked away in one breathtaking punch that made her shudder with more than a chill six could see her breath her breath clear and white as a ghost puffing from her mouth inside a room where the thermostat was set for sweat her hands stilled around chengleis foot she stood up neither man looked at her she backed away just enough and took a slow deep breath so cold her throat hurt the newcomers gaze flicked in her direction then settled again on the old man there are no others chengleis smile was strained he resembled a fat slab of pork sprawled on his reclining chair six watched his hands his white knuckles his fingers twitching toward his sides she recalled his file old surveillance videos she knew the signs six moved fast she grabbed chengleis creeping hand and yanked him off his chair using his momentum to slam two fingers into his throat he started choking spit flecked her cheek she wiped it away reached beneath his suit jacket and removed one gun silencer already screwed on very illegal life imprisonment just on that alone but for everything else on his file she could shoot him now and no one would complain the room was still cold six quickly checked chenglei for more weapons then dumped the wheezing man back on his chair she looked over her shoulder and met a dark hard gaze blown cover but better than shots fired chenglei had been intending to kill this man and she needed answers do not try to run she said quietly i dont run said the man over there six pointed on your knees hands above your head palms and forehead flat against the wall no he said gaze flicking to chenglei whose gasps were quieting this isnt over i am with squad twelve six said in a hard voice it could be over with a bullet if you do not obey me no he said again but this time she knew he was not talking to her she stepped sideways cautious and turned to look at chenglei his skin was blue cold blue corpse blue the flesh around his mouth cracking and flaking his eyes were wide open unblinking and his chest was very still not breathing six stared she had not hit him hard enough for that she had not done anything to cause the rapid physical reaction she was witnessing which suddenly reminded her of forensics class time spent in the militarys morgue learning how to understand death to create death on an endless supply of corpses cold air cold bodies decaying on a schedule only chengleis schedule appeared to be accelerating in a most unfortunate manner his eyes were caving into his skull as was his mouth lips shrinking inward shriveling you need to leave said the man right now run i do not run growled six echoing his words what is this a disease of some kind sars had created enough difficulties it still did despite government attempts to suppress the disease and keep it out of the media but that was nothing more than some advanced flueasy to comprehend what she was seeing now was something else entirely biological weapons she thought that is what this is all about the wire taped to her chest transmitted a live feed just one word and this place would be overrun by military her team was in place ready quarantine was not an option they had discussed but it would be just as easily delivered brutal swift the cleanup efficient no questions asked six opened her mouth to give the order the man held up his handas if he knew what she about to doand though she did not trust him there was something in the urgency of that movement that made her hesitate that and the look in his eyes he stared at her as though he could see right into her heart and as such could speak to her heart and what she heard in his eyes was wait please wait so she did feeling a momentary hush that fled with the cold the air warmed a flush of heat that curled over her skin and made her nose run she ignored it stared at the man tried to watch chenglei at the same time which was why she saw his body twitch just once in a manner as subtle as flexing three muscles in his eyelid his finger his naked toe hes alive six whispered horrified from man to cadaver to a ghost in a shell she tried to imagine a similar fate and it terrified her hes sick poisoned wrong said the man and it occurred to six that he should really be facedown on the ground unconscious and drooling one tap against his head would do it she had strong bones good technique except she could not move against him choice instinct she wanted him able to talk she needed information right now more than she wanted to be safe more than she wanted to prevent any attempt to escape no chance to ask questions though chenglei moved again this time fast so fast that it was not until much later that six found herself able to recall any details of what happenednot the flash of his teeth not the darkness of that shriveled mouthbecause in that heartbeat when chenglei moved all six had was training instinct and it saved her life she ducked pivoted low on her right foot spinning then launched herself sideways so hard she was able to kick off the wall into the air gymnastics martial arts a body hardened by years of repetition and exercise no expense had been spared to turn her into something that could move fast with accuracy she saw a blur pass close gray as dirty ice and found her feet again ready to fight she did not have to chenglei was in the corner backed against the wall the young man stood in front of him hands outstretched lips moving in a low rambling chant that made the hairs rise on the back of sixs neckas did the sight of chenglei only minutes before he had reminded her of a greased wrinkled pigbut the fat was gone sucked dry clothes hanging from his frame like rags tied to a line flapping flapping stiff and cold all bone now sinew less evenonly a hint of his eyes remained only a taste of a mouth only a grinning skull hissing like the sizzling lines of fireworks burning so effortlessly on the street six forced herself to step close the young man did not stop chanting she glanced at him wary and had to bite down hard on her tongue despite the warming air of the room his breath still puffed white six stared she did not rub her eyes she did not call herself crazy she knew her mind her training her lack of imagination the young man looked at her and though his chanting did not falter she heard his voice inside her head clear and strong go he said please she almost did instinct primal but she stayed still swallowing hard and touched her blouse to feel the wire running beneath one connection lifeline she wondered how much the others had heard what they made of it she wondered why she did not call them in she looked again at the man beside her she could see his eyes past the white ghost mask black eyes with a hint of red like his hair standing stark and hot an intense gaze rocking down to her heart too much six turned her focus on chenglei looked hard deep and found nothing human nothing comparable not even to an animal there was too much hunger in that face too much violence tell me she whispered to the man at her side he ignored her still chanting she touched his arm flinched as her fingers burned with electric shock little lightningin her head as well she saw a memory not her own a pit of bones and flesh the mans voice faltered chenglei lunged six knocked the young man out of the way and took the blow dropping and rolling backward kicking up she caught chenglei in the chest but not before his head snapped close his gaping cracking mouth sucking the air around her face terror cut as did disgust she felt a tug inside her mind a violent yank like her soul had strings and then chenglei was kicked off slammed into the wall not before his hands flung out though his nails were long they scraped her cheek six snarled and rolled on her stomach grabbing the gun she had taken from him she fired it was a good shot she caught him in the forehead he went down but only on one knee six fired again struck what was left of his right eye the bullet passed through his head into the wall she heard screaming outside the room apparently she was not the only girl in the massage parlor who still had her hearing chenglei hissed she glimpsed a tongue inside his mouth a hand touched her shoulders and she rolled again bringing up the gun it was the other man eyes dark face white he crouched over her one hand was outstretched against chenglei the other hovered above her face she saw writing on his palm a circle back away six rasped no he murmured its too late for that he touched her she tried to shoot him in the shoulder but her finger refused to pull the trigger and she could not kick him off before his hand grazed her hand the effect of his touch was immediate terrifying her body stopped working as did her voice muscles locked trapped buried alive in her own body all she could do was stare into the mans eyes fighting with all her heart all her mind you are dead she told herself everything for nothing not yet whispered the man leaning close enough to kiss and then he did kiss her softly on the lips his mouth was unfamiliar but hot like raw ginger six found she could close her eyes she did not want to but she could not keep them open she could not see at all she could not hear and when some time later her body was lifted and carried by two strong arms all she could do was wait and imagine and plan you are dead she told herself again but until then fight fight to kill fight to win chapter joseph besud was a quiet man of middling youthbarely out of his twenties hardly worth being called thirtyand while he had been educated in some of the finest schools in europe and america the most enlightening aspects of his life had come from moments such as the one quite literally at hand there was nothing after all like carrying the dead weight of an elite counterterrorist officer to make one appreciate the finer things in life like having a car he was rather less appreciative of the vampires hunting him but he knew better than to complain about those parts of his life that could not be changed and really given that it was the holidays he thought he could muster a little good cheer he was still alive after all whether he lasted long enough to make it home to his familys spring festival dinner was another matter entirely the woman was small but heavy all muscle joseph could still taste her lips kissing her had been unnecessary but no one had to know that but him frankly given that she was probably going to attempt murder or arrest after he released her it was best that he take his chance while he still could she was cute and tough he liked that the wire taped between her breasts was no longer functional it had been like that from the moment he stepped into the room one look into her eyes and he had known what she was why she was there it complicated matters though if chenglei and his cronies had found someone else to do their dirty worksomeone like himthen his life had surged beyond complicated into pure unadulterated chaos no one paid joseph or the woman in his arms any attention he made sure of it a simple mind trick easy to accomplish given the festivities no one wanted to pay attention to anything but themselvesor the small bombs in their hands firecrackers were technically illegal inside shanghai but as with most of chinas regulations the laws were merely guidelines unless someone said otherwise and given the deafening blasts rocking the streets and sidewalks no one was saying a word not one that could be heard anyway he made it to the cara tiny red mini cooperbeeped it open and tucked the woman inside the passenger seat again he tried to search her mind to find a name but all he came up with was a number six nothing else no memories of early childhood unless images of some cold concrete dorm counted to joseph they did not he wanted warmth love some sign of normalcy anything to humanize this woman all he found was solitude duty and an unbending sense of honor which meant one thing only she was going to be very difficult to deal with he got in the car started the engine and putted out of the alley beside lucky johns massage parlor inside his head he sensed the edge of an inquisition sixs team growing restless with her silence it was a sign of their faith in her that they had waited so long to check on her status he could feel it the men trusted her had learned to trust all the women in her unit squad twelve chinas first allfemale counterterrorist team twelve women handpicked trained by the very best little had been spoken of them in the media which made sense but there was enough government pride in their formation that some publicity had been generated enough to instill fear the women were dangerous they meant business good to know he was skilled enough to take one of them down though he suspected her distraction was the cause of that a distraction that concerned him in more ways than one he was not comforted that a vampire had almost managed to get the best of six not at all not when the creatures were working with terrorists now joseph drove fast but traffic was terrible too much activity in the streets the world was redred lanterns red lights red banners etched in gold new years eve the edge of spring festival time for a new start time to chase the monsters back with sound and fury fireworks making violence and beauty joseph glanced at six her face was more delicate than her body high cheeks large eyes shining hair a scratch on her cheek broken skin which was to use the american colloquial a real bummer he opened himself for a moment checking the surrounding area for anyone following them and when he found nothing snapped his fingers sixs eyes flew open her mouth moved she could not turn her head but her gaze flicked sideways to his face and stayed there stop the car she said hoarsely sorry joseph said its not safe he felt her consider an impressive list of threats where is chenglei dead really dead joseph gripped the wheel a bit harder i finished killing him alive would have been better six licked cracked lips he is a terrorist he could have answered questions i suppose you will have to do im no terrorist you were meeting one thats not the same thing i refused to work for them you might have noticed that part if you were listening to our conversation i was her eyes narrowed joseph tried not to be intimidated what did he want with you bombs plans biological weapons joseph bit back a bitter laugh no though i suppose that last one comes closest indeed six said with such menace joseph thought briefly of paralyzing her vocal cords again and what i saw what chenglei became is that a new weapon something that will be used on the chinese people joseph said nothing he was talking too much dumping her on some sidewalk suddenly seemed like a good idea followed by running like hell mongolia was always a good place to hide as was russia on the other hand he was in deep now deeper than before so was six even if she did not realize it yet everyone is in danger joseph finally said not just the chinese the chinese are all i care about she said flatly he shrugged fine then the chinese are in danger happy beijing and shanghai go boom six stared at him she was very good at it you think this is funny of course not he snapped wondering how one look could make him feel like an asshole six pressed her lips into a hard line who are you joseph he reached over and shook her limp hand and you i do not answer the questions of criminals he raised his eyebrows compliment me again i love it six growled joseph bit back a smile he had never heard a woman growl not really it was kind of sexy even if it was an indication of how much she wanted to rip out his throat a car cut in front of him joseph slammed on the brakes and horn a boom rattled the car he heard screams of laughter somewhere near and glimpsed sparks rising into the sky he opened his mind again searching for threats felt a tickle something inhuman on the move youre in danger he told six really she said dryly what a remarkable surprise not from me joseph replied gruffly from men and women like chenglei his associates he noted a subtle shift in her eyes interest i am always in danger from such individuals there is no difference now youre wrong joseph reached out and very gently touched the scratch on her cheek youve been poisoned that makes all the difference in the world her eyelid twitched explain joseph had to look away her reaction did not surprise him not entirely though its effect was powerful tough woman real tough he hoped it would be enough the tickle in his brain intensified incoming close and fast not something he was used to but this whole situation was out of hand unexpected rivals were terrible for carrying out long uneventful lives joseph bit the inside of his cheek and glanced at six she still watched him her expression inscrutable im not your enemy he said your word is not enough she replied my word and my actions itll have to be enough joseph held her gaze for one brief moment we are going to help each other six you and me you know my name not your real name joseph said quietly but then im not even sure you know that again her eyelid twitched where are you taking me someplace safe no such thing exists six told him no place ever she was right of course joseph sighed pessimist realist trust me joseph said or dont but listen thats all i ask you are not saying anything i want to hear story of my life he thought and pulled off the main road away from the gutter and digital advertisements of several large shopping complexes he smelled grease exhaust his stomach rumbled they were near the french district the street rolled into a treelined avenue where the architecture was full of quiet clean lines there were some bars all lit up but the fireworks remained howling and cackling with each ignition a ball of fire shot into the sky exploding too low sparks rained down the crowd of men and women huddled just outside an iron gate joseph saw bottles of liquor he heard screams the sensation of being hunted overwhelmed i may have to free you joseph said are you going to hurt me if i do yes six said he blew out his breath any way i can convince you not to no six said absolutely no he was close to home no parking though joseph had to settle for a spot some distance away not terribly ideal he got out walked to the passenger side and opened the door six could not turn her head to look at him not for lack of trying though he could feel the force of her will pushing and pushing against the compulsion if he let her sit long enough it was possible she might be able to break it joseph had never met anyone quite so strong or stubborn if you scream he told the back of her head you know i can make you stop and if i simply talk talking is good joseph unbuckled sixs seatbelt and hefted her up into his arms his back hurt he needed to lift weights ask me anything you want how long have you been a terrorist joseph stopped and gave her a look six sighed fine so you are not a terrorist perhaps i can believe that i am not convinced anyone else will though no one else is going to get close enough to need convincing joseph walked fast his apartment building was a block away besides im going to help you catch the people youre looking for once i do that youll hopefully be so distractedand appreciativeyou wont ever think of hunting down poor me unlikely six narrowed her eyes and how will you help if you know somethinganythingit merely substantiates your guilt joseph ignored her the tickling in his brain was worse he turned searching this was a residential neighborhood not close to any major shopping center though the tourist trap of xin tian di was certainly within walking distance still there were quite a few people on the street young women mostly dressed in skinny jeans and narrow jackets tall boots stacked with sharp heels bodies backlit by bursts of sparks firecrackers spitting and hissing into the road dancing beneath the tires of cars bicycles scooters dripping exhaust what is wrong six asked quiet he murmured listening hard he hugged six close not even thinking of it until the scent of her hair drifted into his nose he became aware of roses warmth it disconcerted him for a moment distracted his mind which suddenly wanted more of six less of everything else bad timing he felt the rush before he saw it and ducked low dropping six on the ground releasing the compulsion that bound her he expected her to be ready and she was rolling the moment her muscles were free and she got on her feet so fast he almost got knocked out before he could explain no need though a black audi screeched to a full stop on the road beside them doors slammed open vampires emerged there were three of the creatures making the air cold as ice around their bodies no way to know for certain how they looked when fully human but like chenglei the flesh had sucked away until all that remained were skeletons racked by skin hissing as though a great black wind lived inside their mouths ugly bastards unfortunately they also had guns guns pointed directly at him joseph never saw six move one moment she stood beside himand in the next she vaulted off the hood of a car managing a onetwo blow with nothing but her feetpractically walking on headscatching the last creature in the face with her fists as she came down whirling through the air like a dancer she was beautiful a blur almost as fast as the vampires themselvesand joseph wondered if it was just their surprise that was letting her go so far or if she was truly that good he flung out his hands and a low rumble rose from his throat splitting tones like the deep hum of a long mountain horn the vampires went still six grabbed their guns and backed away she did something with her hands two of the guns fell into sundry parts the third she tucked into the back of her pants alongside chengleis weapon six glanced at him a question in her eyes her breath puffing white in the cold air joseph did not answer not with his voice not with his mind he edged forward staring at the vampires matching gazes as his voice coiled hard around them channeling his will the vampires were empty on the inside but with enough spark left that it was hard to bind three at a time so hard joseph did not notice the tickle at the back of his skull until it was almost too late six saved him he felt her move against his back heard flesh smack something cracka hissand then she danced into sight with a vampire hopping and lunging skin white as ice hollow and brazen josephs voice remained strong but it was an effortnor did he try to extend his control to the fourth vampire he did not dare he reached over his shoulder beneath the neck of his shirt touched steel listened to the hiss of a sharp edge as he pulled the long dagger free he felt like his heart was going to fly out of his chest he had never been attacked like this no one in his family had not for years joseph cut off heads chanting as he killed the vampires could not fight him but he felt no remorse cold blood in this case made no difference not when he knew the alternative their flesh was brittle crumbling into clumps of thick ash no bulky evidence the remaining sparks of their souls fled six still fought she did not shoot the guns in her possession she merely used her fists and feet never staying in one place long enough to be touched but her opponent was a vampirefastand she was only human joseph saw her make a mistakeone pause a second too longand he changed the chant trying to save her life too late the vampire grabbed her but joseph felt no pull no internal strike to sixs life instead the creature stared at the scratch on her cheek and touched it with its tongue delicate savoring the taste she struggled face twisted with disgust joseph pressed harder with his words and the vampire holding her finally froze six wriggled free slamming her fist so hard into the creatures chest its sternum snapped the vampire paralyzed could not even flinch six backed off joseph did not try to touch her he glanced up and down the street there were people on the sidewalk staring cars had stopped in the road beyond them all a rain of sparks and fire flooded the night a series of hard bangs rocking the air joseph could feel the explosions in his chest the sensation felt right at home with his pounding heart joseph did his best he altered the chant once again isolating everyone he could see turning his will on them spreading a compulsion to leave forget to remember only as a dream he glanced at six and found her watching him then the people who obeyed without questions turning and walking away cars started moving again he still held the long dagger in his hand six glanced from it to the vampire frowning she touched her cheek her eyelid twitched i need answers she said and joseph sensed she was not entirely speaking of her old investigation we both need answers he told her silently and six gave him such a sharp look he wondered if she heard his mental voice he had wondered earlier too at the massage parlor he had never been able to speak inside another persons mindnot outside the family at any rate it required a strong connection but even if he did agree with six this was not the place to ask questions nor did he have the skill to force the vampire back into its human body that could only be done by choice joseph cut off its head six was not fast enough to stop him though he cheated just a little by slowing her down he thought she might have tackled him otherwise instead six watched that wiry body collapse on itself and blow away in the wind the ashes mixed with street trash she turned on him furious why did you do that i told you i needed answers i could have questioned it joseph kicked at the clothes left behind on the sidewalk too much time involved we need to leave this place is too exposed not your decision i am calling in my team six reached for the wire beneath her shirt then hesitated looking at him you disabled it didnt you there was also a tracking device they would have already been here by now if it was working joseph shrugged sheathed the dagger and walked to the abandoned car which was blocking traffic and generating some very loud honks joseph wondered how much the drivers had seen if any of them had taken pictures with mobile phones not that it mattered cameras never did well with him the car doors were still open he hesitated thinking about his apartment with its nice safety featureslike walls and doorsand then strode around the sleek hood and slid into the drivers seat six leaned into the passenger side and gestured get out she ordered you are ruining evidence just a little he admitted the keys were still in the ignition joseph started the car six stared what are you doing parking this thing if i leave it here the police will come in case you have forgotten she said coldly i am the police in fact i have far more authority than the police and i am better trained so arrest me joseph said take me in try to explain everything youve seen accuse me of terrible crimes that wont help you catch your terrorists nor would it save her life he stared at the scratch on her cheek the skin was flushed slightly swollen six slid into the car she sat for a moment staring at him dark eyes sharp you just killed people i suppose joseph said warily recalling the feel of steel cutting through flesh the crackle of papery skin its complicated though id hoped you would know that by now sixs jaw tightened no other warning she grabbed his throat before he could blink and squeezed so hard he choked he grappled with her hands but her fingers were like iron he struck at her face she grabbed his wrist and pinched fire ran up his arm he would have cried out if he had a voice her expression never changed you need your vocal cords to control me i could just rip them out with my fingers i could do some other things to your body nothing pleasant joseph had no doubt of that six was stronger than he had imagined i understand he said using his mind to speak to her he was not entirely certain the message would go throughhe still thought those earlier moments might be flukesbut a furrow formed between sixs eyes and she licked her lips joseph remembered kissing her felt like a lifetime past he wondered if he would ever get another chance i heard you she said softly how its a skill like any other he told her feeling inside his chest an unfamiliar sense of panic and warmth you know how to do things i dont i know how to do things you dont six leaned back she did not let go of his throat though her ringers loosened just a fraction making it easier for him to breathe and those things what chenglei became the jiangshi hopping ghosts vampires no such thing she said immediately tales of old stupid men who do not know better then call them a virus if that makes you happy think of them as your biological weapon your terrorists either way you know theyre dangerous you cant ignore that sixs jaw tightened joseph did not look away he studied her eyes as closely as she studied his and felt her thoughts press against his mind he tried not to listen he did not want to still he knew a moment before she acted that her fingers were going to loosen once again and he fought the urge to rub his throat as her hand slid down to press hard against his chest drive she said if you try to paralyze me i will rip out your throat what about destroying evidence the car is still evidence im not turning myself in he said keeping his hands in his lap six narrowed her eyes all i want are answers you will drive i will talk you will speak only when spoken to yes maam he muttered and put the car in gear he tapped the accelerator and drove down the street he took a right at the first intersection weaving around pedestrians and motorcycles and other cars running the red light paper lanterns had been strung across the road he saw in front of the shops men and women sweeping furiously with their brooms cleaning out the bad luck making way for good he wished it were that easy six said what are you how do you control people i use my mind he said who taught you were you part of a government program joseph almost laughed my family taught me so what you do is genetic somewhat six remained silent the surrounding buildings became larger newer opulent in their modernity glittering shopping centers and sidewalks crammed with young people shanghaithe largest mall in the world a city devoted to business and commercialism shallow but pretty joseph had a weakness for bright lights especially now when most of them were red for the new year holiday there were fireworks here too set off by kids laughing and screaming in front of monstrous hanging billboards decorated with foreign celebrities hawking watches and designers sixs fingers tapped her thigh you called them jiangshi hopping ghosts like in the stories not quite like the stories joseph replied those creatures are not lost souls you cant stop them with a block of sixinch wood at the threshold of a homethey are not scared of sunlightand you cant hide from them by holding your breath that is fantasy all of it is fantasy she muttered but if i were to pretend it is not then what of the rest that theyre dangerous that they kill by stealing a persons life essence joseph gritted this teeth that unfortunately would be true its why i call them vampires western folklore vampires steal blood world folklore joseph corrected her and blood is the same as life no different from energy six studied him her hand was still on his chest her palm felt warm how do you know all this did your family teach you joseph glanced at her yes and these creatures what do they want with you and what do they have to do with the terrorists chenglei was unexpected he interrupted that man was not always a vampire in fact the last time i saw him he was very human he worked in conjunction with a terrorist organization run by members fresh out of central asia indonesia and xin jiang business matters a money man no ethical qualms either chenglei himself was not a native chinese he was born in jakarta his uncle could be considered one of most radical clerics in southeast asia i know most of this six said we had chenglei under surveillance for quite some time we wanted his contacts you didnt get them i assume some not enough tonight after seeing who he was meeting with i planned on bringing him in permanently ah joseph said too late now not that you need to worry i suspect everyone youre looking for will be easy enough to find and why is that joseph sighed because the man the vampires recruited wants me dead and youre becoming one of them chapter when six was only five years old she remembered quite clearly being led into a small office that was extraordinary in its luxury two wooden chairs with patched cushions on the seat a dark wide desk covered in pens and paper one lamp a small ink painting of a tea pot and best of anything a window with a view beyond the gray concrete walls of the gymnasium training center she remembered caring more about that view than the people she had been brought to see there were three adults in the office two men one woman all wearing dark pants and dark jackets buttoned just so with their short collars straight and pressed flat against their throats the men wore caps the woman had black hair shot with silver cut to her chin six had never seen any of them before thats the one said the woman her family none her name none our recruiter found her in shandong province a year ago the village was feeding her she wandered there from the hills they called her six because that was the date they found her skills some no artistry but shes fast the woman knelt in front of six she poked the girls forehead with one hard finger it hurt she began to do it again six knocked her hand away the woman tried once more time faster six stepped out of reach her hand raised again the woman smiled good she said well take her six remembered the woman she remembered that the woman never had a name she was simply aunt the aunt who ran a small school for girls where in addition to being taught reading math and science they were also educated in a variety of physical activities many of which involved hurting people or at least people wrapped in layers of protective padding the real fighting came later when she was thirteen but what struck six as she sat in the passenger seat of a strange car beside a strange man with her hand pressed against a strange chest was that for the first time in twenty years she remembered what it felt like to be herself again the self she had been as a child hungering for more knowing her place and dissatisfied with it looking and looking for that high view of something beyond her life she had lost that she had forgotten that but now she remembered and it was the only reason she did not subdue the man at her side it would have been easy despite his skills she had a sense of him now somewhat ruthless but not hard not toward her but she wanted more more than answers what she had stumbled upon was a mystery beyond that which she had set out to solve and the outcome mattered she had a chance to see over the wall she had a view but the view now was not enough six studied the man his face was full of planes and angles shadows dancing over his skin as the lights of the shopping district flickered burned his expression was mildly stressed his mouth set in a hard line six remembered the taste of his lips you said earlier that i had been poisoned six touched her cheek it hurt the skin felt hot she recalled the wet tip of a tongue and suppressed a shudder poisoned by a scratch thats all it takes joseph said so you believe i will become like them six could not say the word not jiangshi not vampire joseph looked at her it was the compassion in his eyes more than his words which convinced her she barely heard him as he said i can stop it i can help your body stop it six tried to see past the surface of his eyes to something deeper more full of truth she imagined she caught a glimmer of something honest but she did not know if she could trust it what are you joseph grimaced she pressed her palm harder on his chest warning him but he surprised her he took his hand off the wheel and covered her fingers her wrist he had a large hand it felt strong he did not try to pry away her fingers and she did not move too much was at stake you could make him stop touching you but she did not other men had touched her hand in a far more intimate manner but this was different this felt like he was offering comfort and that was new what i am is complicated joseph said quietly but the most accurate name is necromancer six stared you raise the dead josephs hand tightened its not so much a resurrection of the physical but of the spiritual the imprint of the soul which is not the soul but just the memory of it its almost as good as the real thing though especially if you want information and you are being hunted because of this im being hunted because i refused to do this for money for terrorists how the vampires got involved is another matter entirely that makes no sense to me it made no sense to six either none of it did she pulled her hand away from his chest josephs expression turned puzzled you dont think ill try to paralyze you again six wondered the same thing i can still disable your voice before you begin to chant i know what to look for now youre overestimating yourself she pointed to a side street park the car is the military waiting there was some humor in his voice six merely looked at him trying to remain unaffected joseph held her gaze a moment longer than she was comfortable with and then pulled down the street she had indicated away from the lights and press of cars and people fireworks spat peach blossoms made of paper fluttered from lines over the road six saw red everywhere made her heart hurt for a moment she had few friends but those she knew had still managed to take time off to return home for the new year one rare week spent with family six had never done that she had never celebrated new year spring festivalit was always on her own or around men and women who had somewhere to be but could not go never much happiness there where is your family six asked are you going to hurt them no i was just curious he parked the car at the side of the road the street attendant an old man in a blue uniform wandered close joseph pulled out his wallet they live all over mongolia beijing london right now my parents are in xian i was going to fly there to visit my mother is cooking her dumplings for the holidays maybe some red bean cakes can she also summon the dead no joseph said thats my fathers skill and his family they got out of the car the old man had his pad of receipts ready before joseph could pay six dragged out her identification card hidden in a narrow pouch inside her pants the old man took one look at it nodded his head like there were swinging weights attached and backed off fast ah power joseph said sardonically its heady isnt it you would know better than i six replied she felt her two stolen guns press against her lower back hidden beneath her blouse their weight was a comfort the corner of his mouth curled what are we doing here really its not safe you know there are people hunting me hunting you maybe and i cant imagine your superiors would appreciate you running off like this without checking in and with a suspicious character such as myself you are testing me six said concerned by those very issues but unable to step back to lay down her desire to know more to hold on to the old lost feeling of hunger we are here because i said so joseph shrugged and turned around he started walking six matched his pace watching his throat his mouth any sign that he might turn on her she also watched the people around them remembering chengleiso human so warm shriveling into a monster before her eyes if it could happen to him no one was safe not even her not now that is what you will become a voice whispered inside her head monster josephs pace faltered six took a deep breath assuming for a moment that i believe youwhich is debatablewhat possible use could terrorists have for the spirits of those who are already dead how in any way does that support their cause joseph shoved his hands in his pockets heres one example you want some information from a toplevel official but you dont have the time or opportunity to get it order an assassination murder the man or woman you want then question the dead you dont have to be close to the corpse and souls even the memories of souls dont lie not ever six thought of the foreign ministers wife you said that was just one example joseph glanced at her his eyes dark serious a necromancer despite the title can also control the living i think youve seen some convincing demonstrations of that six looked away toward the road staring at the cars and people ten years ago shanghai had been an ordinary city not terribly large or advanced still some farms still some quiet now though it was all light and flash and thunderand not just because of the new year celebrations money had been poured into this city vast amounts of money and pride and hard work it had been a beautiful effort and still was six tried to imagine all of it gone blown away laid to waste and rubble it was a possibility part of the message recently received intelligence reports confirmed that certain extremist cells had begun to focus not just on the west but on any example of capitalist success and china despite all words to the contrary was very much a capitalist nation the iron rice bowl had become a fleeting memory hardly worth contemplating certainly there were enough people out shopping to indicate that times were indeed better and those better times had to be protected you could make someone carry a bomb she said quietly i could he said just as quiet and you did not have to paralyze me earlier you could have just forced me to follow you true joseph stepped close forcing her to crane her neck but feeling captured is one thing violated another i took a guess at what you would prefer neither six placed her hand on his chest to push him away i prefer my freedom he caught her hand holding it to him the warmth of his skin traveled through her she tried to remember the cold he had created but it was a distant fleeting memory she did not pull away im going to help you he said gently were going to help each other six no she replied unable to look away from his eyes you were right i should not be here with you i dont see you kicking my ass no kicking men like you should not be allowed to live really josephs mouth curved into a slow smile six remembered the hot taste of ginger the spice of his lips i can think of better uses for me than killing she pulled her hand away from his chest do you have any idea who your rival might be who would want you dead no joseph said dont know where to find him either unlike some people i know we dont run around with tracking devices taped to our chests six narrowed her eyes and are you certain you know nothing else about the organization that tried to hire you you seemed knowledgeable enough about chengleis circumstances you could have told the police who would have believed me besides i had no names no proof no locations no desire to get involved i didnt think ever that they would find someone to take my place i cant even imagine how they managed it the first time discovering what i could do was supposedly an accident i dont believe in accidents six said especially those that happen twice in a row they knew how to find you i agree joseph said i can only think that the vampires told them and how would they know they know i get around that must be why they infected chenglei because they knew i would answer his request for a meeting easy target so you hunt these creatures the ones who arent careful you would be amazed at how many of them work in hospitals around the dying its easy for them to siphon off energy there patients are already weak problem is with a vampire around theres no chance of getting stronger and no one notices no one sees them for what they are why would they they usually look exactly like you and me shifting as they have in front of us and in public is extremely rare they did it for a reason then to make a point that theyre not afraid of being caught no she said softly clarity becoming instinct fear because they are not afraid of people knowing they exist joseph sucked in a quick breath they have a reason not to care anymore six imagined the temperature dropped it was a good reflection of the way she feltcold so coldand she found herself speaking secrets things she should not say because in her gut she knew joseph was the man who would understand she leaned close we were warned something was going to happen the government intercepted a message a death but it made no sense only we knew it was related to terrorist activity in the region a new cell that we have been unable to track except through remote contacts like chenglei its the holiday joseph said urgently voice dropping into a hush theres no better time but what do those creatures receive from the bargain freedom people to feed upon and where do you come in why pass on your name if that is what happened why ally themselves with a group that would hire someone who hunts and murders their own kind i dont know joseph said grimly but we dont have much time to find out a day at the most why a day joseph hesitated because after that youll start changing six forgot how to breathe you said you could help me yes but josephs voice was cut off by the loud wail of a siren they turned but six already knew what she would see she recognized the sound and for the first time in a long while she was not happy to hear it a black audi with military plates pulled to a quick stop beside them there were two women in the front seat familiar faces joseph murmured how six looked at him i did not the women got out of the car slow and easy as graceful as wolves taller than six though just as lean hard eyes thin mouths street clothes that were plain and cheap ying six said to the woman on the left who had a thin scar tracing the edge of her lip she glanced right to her companion the prettier of the two xiu six they said in unison and she could not help but feel a thread of unease pass through her heart it startled her that emotion she could not understand it not when she had known these women almost her entire life six found herself edging in front of joseph how did you find me xiu stopped luck accident ying added of course now that weve found you xiu said we have some questions ying finished no six protested silently not yet time is running out but she said nothing and listened to joseph sigh chapter joseph had never thought much about what it would mean to spend time in a chinese prison but now that he was actually in one he really did not know what all the fuss was about the cell might not be all that clean but there was a toilet and a bedalbeit without a mattressand while the naked springs were rather tough on his spine at least he was there alone and not in any danger of becoming a poor mans version of some brokeback bitch although a drink would be nice he also wanted to see six he worried about her it surprised him just how much he worried out on the street at the moment of their separation he had felt inside her a terrible uncertainty a lack of faithnot in him but in the people she worked with she was afraid of losing something something no one else would understand and that uneasiness had filled him as wellthough for a different reason entirely he had after all been the one associating with a known terrorist flunky that and they had confiscated a very long dagger which no doubt carried the trace dna of quite a few individuals which frankly meant that he might as well assume the firing squad position and start thinking about all the people his vital organs were going to save the lights had been turned off in his cell there were no bars just walls and a door inlaid with a narrow strip of wireencased glass joseph did not mind the darkness he lay on his springs with his hands behind his head eyes closed and searched the surrounding area with his mind he found very little of interest mostly a keen desire to be home with family the occasional bout of despair lust in the other prisoners ungodly fear and resignation he looked for six he thought about her eyes as he searched the darkness of them the hard warmth that had finally at the end begun to soften when she looked at him he thought a smile might be next just one smile he wanted to see that very badly this is not the time to be thinking about a woman you can never have six is not for you even if you want her to be but joseph found her he caught a hint of her spirit and pulled himself along the line of her heart he tried to see through her eyes but could not her mind was strong he settled for listening to the edge of her thoughts and sensed a defensive posture anger and worry he could not help himself he whispered her name he did not expect her to notice his presence but once again her ability to perceive his mental voice surprised him he felt her stillness and then quietly i hear you relief filled him are you okay i will be fine you still alive no one has come to question me soon she said i am being reprimanded for not bringing you in more quickly they think it is suspicious what have you told them only what i think they will believe which is very little i have tried not to implicate you in anything nor do they know who you are your lack of identification or fingerprints in any file has disconcerted them you know my name i pretended not to know that surprised him thank you can i ask why six did not answer but he picked up the tendril of a thought one word believe joseph heard footsteps clicking down the hall and he split his focus trying to identify who was coming and why he discovered xiu on the end of his thoughts though it was hard to get a read on her mind like six her thoughts were slippery hard to listen to for anything more than the most basic emotional impressions in this case determination satisfaction a hint of eagerness great he was about to get his ass handed to him xiu is coming he told six any advice xiu she sounded genuinely surprised she never handles prisoner questioning she does not have the temper for it what do you mean she doesnt have the temper for it six his cell door opened xiu stepped inside she appeared unarmed but joseph was not fooled he stood holding his ground watching her face studying her mind he found nothing helpful all he knew for certain was that she was not a vampire but that was little comfort xiu was pretty her face however lacked sixs blunt honestyand bet eyes held a sly light that he disliked immediately not straight or true he felt her cruel streak the moment he looked at her joseph sixs tentative voice filled his head surprising him what is happening hold on he said wary i dont know yet i am coming she said immediately xiu stepped deeper into the cell it was small her movements brought her quite close again joseph refused to back away small defiance he knew it was not worth much hello stranger murmured the woman that is your name yes if you like he said pouring power into his voice hoping to hook her he did not his power slid over her mind washing off so easily that for a moment he wondered if he had any kind of gift at all stranger stranger said the woman again how interesting that you are here very interesting he replied carefully even more wary now i dont quite understand the reason why treason she said easily aiding and abetting men who wish to destroy this country and take precious lives ive done nothing of the sort you are calling me a liar then xiu smiled no need to waste your energy on denials i know what you are i know who you are joseph said nothing this was not a fight he could win not like this he pushed harder with his mind skin puckering with the sudden chill a side effect he drew more energy from the roomenergy that was heatand continued searching for a way into xius thoughts a process interrupted when she coldcocked him in the face her fist moved fasthis only warning was her blatant emotion and he was able to twitch backward a flinch the movement saved his teeth but his nose flashed pain he tasted blood felt the hot dripping rush from his nostrils xiu hit him again he tried to fight back but the odds were so uneven he might as well have been trying to take a swing with his arms and legs cut off he could not even entertain the idea of biting her ankles she was simply too fast too strong like six training so long and hard that fighting was the same as breathing so he took the risk he had to he opened his mouth and began to chant low soft tones a rumbling roar as soft as distant thunder the language of his grandparents of the steppes and endless skies vocalizing was unnecessary when using his powerslanguage was not the same as willbut it made a difference to his strength his focus except nothing happened joseph could not reach inside her heart a barrier stood around her spirit with not even a tendril free to control she might as well have been made of stone xiu stood back from him smiling now this is quite interesting a puzzle joseph stopped chanting his throat hurt who are you just a girl xiu said but there was something in her forced giggle that was so not girlish so much a parody that joseph took another hard look at the edges of her mind and found something so startlingand so obvioushe wanted to slip his head underneath her boot for an added stamp of stupidity you are not xiu joseph said slowly standing swaying not xiu said the woman pursing her lips but xiu enough i think enough to get close to you joseph besud and to certain information i need joseph shut his eyes he could feel the possession now that he knew what to look for another mind layered over the womans a natural barrier made by virtue of there being one too many people inside a single body so youre the new hire joseph said all of this to help terrorists murder people all of this said the possessed woman to help myself you arent much of a necromancer are you enough of one that you want me dead that was part of the bargain struck with the vampires nothing more liar joseph thought xiu smiled professional secrets mr besud you cannot blame me for wanting to be the only man of my kind to be honest i never thought about what that would mean until i was introduced to this latest opportunity joseph shook his head who the hell are you no one xiu said her voice taking on an odd multitonal quality inside his mind no one you need to be concerned about any longer she leaned forward her smile turning sly nor do you need to be worried about six and her imminent transformation i have plans for that one joseph threw himself at xiu he was no match for her strength but he did not expect to fightjust to touch to get his hand on her bare skin that was all he needed physical contact always made him stronger she let him get close though the smile on her face turned into a scream as josephs fingers grazed her cheek and he shoved a mental spike against the other necromancers barrier stabbing it again and again with his mind he felt a crack caught the edge of another heart and tried to latch on to track to hunt xiu slammed her fist into his groin joseph staggered throbbing waves of pain spinning lights in his eyes he tried to straighten to fight but another blow caught him in the chest and the impact was so fierce he went down like a rag doll limp he crawled struggling to stand his body made fun of him xiu knelt just out of reach her eyes were dark furious a poor trick mr besud go to hell joseph muttered all he could taste was blood perhaps xiu whispered leaning close or perhaps i will bring hell here to you joseph heard running he felt a familiar heart the cell door slammed open six entered joseph met her gaze he could not read her expressionsmooth coldbut he felt the edge of her mind and her emotions were neither xiu rose slowly six good of you to join me six said nothing she stared only at joseph her gaze traveling from his face and body to the blood on the floor her jaw flexed her eyelid twitched no joseph thought grim not good at all at thirteen years of age faith had become something of a cornerstone in sixs life though she rarely thought of it as such simply her existence ran on routine the steady ticking of a clock that parsed out chores and exercises and studies like some endless heartbeat running concurrent to the one inside her chest and which could not be stopped or slowed not at risk of ending her existence and then one day her faith changed the clock began ticking to a different beat it began early she rose for breakfast with the other girls and aunt was there waiting she picked three six xiu and shu led them beyond the school walls to a white windowless van they got in aunt sat up front beside the driver another of their instructors the van drove for thirty minutes and when it stopped six emerged blinking in the sun staring at a tall brick structure the size of a warehouse no windows only one door aunt made them go in she said i will return later to let you out and then the darkness closed around the three girls and they heard the lock turn they realized soon after that they were not alone they realized too that they had been brought there to die six remembered she remembered men three times her size moving in the darkness hunting her she remembered fighting them she remembered killing them she remembered the taste of that first death how happy she was for it how proud because she was still alive unharmed fierce the need to survive was stronger than anything she could name she remembered too the screams shu broken leg cornered six had found her saved her she found xiu too but later very close xiu could have gotten there first saved shu some pain but she had not she had left the girl used her as a distraction so she could run and hide there were nine men total nine bodies at the end of the day when aunt came to unlock the door she looked at each one examining the way they died the killing blows she said not a single word no praise no apology she took the girls home shu healed returning to the old routine xiu and six did not aunt moved them on and here we are six thought staring across the small cell at the other woman who watched her with a strangers eyeseyes that six knew almost as well as her owneyes that had betrayed her down in the debriefing room when xiu had implied to the station commander that six might be capable of inappropriate behavior that she might give up her duty for a man words to kill a career words enough to ostracize blacken send awayor worse to put her in prison a woman with her skills after all could not be allowed to run free if there was not the utmost faith in her honor and integrity a woman like her after all would make a dangerous enemy walk away walk away said a tiny voice inside her mind it is not too late walk away and save yourself do this and your life will be over you will lose everything six gazed down at josephs body covered in blood beaten his eyes were still strong though cold and dark and hard and he looked at her as if he could see straight into her heart as though he could see and did not mind to see and it struck her how much that meant how vitally important it was that someone someone know her know her for more than some badge know her for more than a weapon i know who you are joseph said inside her mind his eyes shifting darker softer i know you six i do not know you she replied youll learn he said we both will six tore away her gaze and looked at xiu you had no authority to question this man i have all the authority in the world xiu said smoothly as do you though i am surprised to see you here ying said the truth six interrupted that the wire went dead and i disappeared that she did not know what happened you on the other hand embellished also the truth xiu replied or do you deny it that you might give up your duty for a man for joseph six said nothing the other woman smiled joseph tried to stand six did not look at him part of her wondered how he had let xiu hurt him so badly his throat appeared unharmed the air was cold inside her mind she heard his voice again quick and urgent careful six xiu is not the woman you know her mind has been taken over by another my rival he is here to gather information for his employers and kill me sick heat flushed through sixs body is there a way to drive it out of her im sorry joseph said all you can do is make xius body uncomfortable for him six steeled herself uncomfortable she could do that no use wasting time either she lunged fists striking fast hard xiu dodged and whirled kicking off the wall coming back at six with enough speed to break bone six cut sharp to the right and jammed two fingers into xius kidneys the woman grunted but did not go down she spun again her knee catching six in the gut her elbow connecting with her jaw six dropped kicking out xiu blocked her heel but six twisted fast feinted and managed to catch her other knee bone cracked her leg bent backward xiu screamed six knocked her down with a hard fist pounced landing on her chest pressing her elbow against xius throat she tasted blood and spat it out on the possessed womans face let her go she muttered now go where rasped xiu and her eyes were indeed strange unfamiliar into you there will be room enough before long your soul is going to run away from your body girl in a day youll be nothing but a shell no joseph said staggering close no i wont let you have her six gritted her teeth and you cannot have xiu either not alive anyway and she pressed even harder on the womans throat cutting off her air xius eyes bulged her face turning purple as she grappled and writhed six refused to let go she was careful not to crush her windpipe but her strength was inexorable and xiu finally went limp six very cautiously eased off her heart pounded there was a ringing in her ears did it work is xiu alone in there yes he whispered staring at her are you okay no she said looking at him no i am not six leaned close to check on xiu she was still breathing though the next time she looked in the mirror it would be an ugly sight there was also a very good chance that six had just ended her colleagues career in squad twelve a broken knee was not an injury someone like xiu could fully recover from it would be easier for the military to replace her with a younger newer woman two women she thought you just ruined yourself as well fear crushed down on her heart she could hardly breathe with it six had just ended her own life twenty years of knowing nothing else and nownow joseph touched her he wrapped his arms around her shoulders and tugged her close until her back pressed against his chest and the rise and fall of his breathing mirrored her own he felt strong solid and it was a comfort no matter how unfamiliar or small his mouth pressed against her hair everything will be fine he murmured six turned to face him searching his eyes how can you say that how can you believe a grim smile touched his mouth because i just do because i just do another kind of faith a new clock six touched his lips with her fingertips his blood was still wet she stood on her toes and kissed him tasting the hot metallic burn the spice of ginger his mouth was hard as were his arms as he crushed her close and tight six broke away breathing hard she glanced down at xiu then bent close rummaging through her pockets she found keys and took them come she said to joseph we have to leave now she went to the cell door and peered out there were no guards in the hall no one had heard xiu screamor if they had no one wanted to investigate the members of squad twelve were not known for needing help it was a reputation they encouraged six stepped into the hall and took josephs arm head down look weak beaten oh yeah difficult he muttered they walked down the long tiled corridor past gray metal doors marked with numbers six heard groans coming from inside some of the cells she thought about joseph being beaten and clenched her jaw kept her gaze straight and narrow one turn in the corridor and the cellblock gate appeared two guards in full military uniform stood on either side of the heavy metal door another man sat at a desk that held only one phone and a sheaf of papers all of them stared at joseph i am moving the prisoner six said agent xiu will be along when she is finished cleaning up do not disturb her until then shall i call ahead for a transport vehicle asked the man at the desk who very carefully maintained no eye contact that will not be necessary six said a request for transportation would go through the main switchboard and be automatically routed to the other members of her squad in fact i would ask that you not call anyone about this prisoner it is a very sensitive matter of course he said and reached behind him to dial in the combination of the electric lock he hit a red button and the door clicked open one of the guards held it for her six stopped and took his sidearm she did not ask he did not protest simply stared into the air above her head he was very young eager to please six hoped none of them would be punished too severely for letting her escape with joseph they passed through the cellblock door and entered another corridor that split into three directions security cameras hung from every corner but six knew they were manned by lowlevel guards who would know only her face and nothing else her face would be enough to grant free passage until xiu was discovered or until six and joseph ran into any other members of the team they took the stairs joseph gave her a questioning look when they started walking up this building is only three stories tall six explained quietly but there are six sublevels beneath it we are on number three his mouth twitched i dont rate a six how disappointing not really she let herself smile that level is the morgue they reached the main floor without incident six heard a great deal of activity beyond the corridor but where they stood was the hall used only by the janitorial staff six and joseph were able to exit through the back door without incident sloppy security six thought she had never paid much attention to just how sloppy until now and it embarrassed her she had taken too much for granted twenty years training to be the best riding on the laurels of elitismand now all of it gone with the realization that she had still be vulnerable in other ways it was a taste of humility that she really did not need the night air was cool and damp the military offices sat in the center of a walled compound most of it was parking lot filled with military vehicles and the occasional bus on the other side was a small training ground six heard men laughing followed by the hiss of a burning fuse three seconds later a ball of sparkling flame shot into the air rushing high above the trees lining the wall six heard a whine followed by a sharp explosion she could have shot her gun and no one would have noticed six hit the electric lock on the key chain an audi beeped back she and joseph ran for the car she put him in the backseat they drove out without being stopped the guards at the gate took one look at her face and waved her on six pulled into traffic hit the accelerator and theregone we have only an hour she said to joseph and was stunned to hear her voice shake she gripped the wheel harder maybe less xiu will wake up eventually i do not know if anyone will hear her shouts but i would prefer to assume the worst i know someplace we can go joseph said its in suzhou no one will be able to find a connection to me there you forget no one knows who you are you think fine she said and then we need a plan we joseph said i like the sound of that you should not she snapped all it means is trouble i have just ruined my life for you joseph was silent for a long time the car engine hummed fireworks crackled against the road six had to swerve to avoid hitting some children playing with sparklers im sorry he finally said softly i am truly and i am grateful but six he stopped and sighed was it a life you really wanted it was the life i had she replied flatly what more is there a strong hand reached from the shadows to touch her shoulder you know the answer to that i can feel it in your heart her eyes burned people forget how to choose not you he murmured not you maybe not she thought but choosing right was another matter entirely chapter at four oclock in the morning the road to suzhou was mostly empty and six gunned the audis a engine into a highspeed chase of nothing but ghosts just outside the city though she took an exit to a rest area and parked the car cabs idled on the other end of the lot she could see the drivers playing mahjong on a makeshift table there are some bottles of water back there she said to joseph you should wash off the worst of the blood maybe take off that shirt youre wearing too why do i get the feeling that were dumping this fine piece of machinery because we are she replied and got out of the car inside the trunk she found some spare clothes money and a tool kit all standard issue she dug around for a screwdriver and after making certain no one was watching removed the cars plates she tucked them inside a plastic sack that had very recently contained maps and then went around to take josephs bloody shirt she tossed him a new one and stuffed the old inside the sack with the plates there was a garbage can nearby six dumped everything inside it would not stay there long someone would dig through eventually for scrap and find the contents of the bag but hopefully the discoverer would keep his or her mouth shutand if notthen she and joseph would be long gone or as gone as finding that terrorist cell would take her she and joseph six shuddered she really was thinking of them as a team and him still a stranger she knew nothing about joseph nothing but what her instincts were telling her it should not have been enough and yet here she was breaking the law not just for him she reminded herself there is a lot at stake here too much sometimes you must do the wrong thing in order to make right six thought of her debriefing the commander had not listened to her warnings about the terrorist cell not truly intelligence officers had already said that an attack might be imminent and six was saying nothing new nothing they could use nothing she thought she could share not without sounding crazyor ruining josephs life so she had ruined her own instead joseph approached his hair was scruffy his eyes hooded but the blood was gone and the shirt strained quite nicely over his shoulders the rough voices of the cab drivers and the rumble of engines drifted close i was thinking he said slowly xiu only could have been possessed during a moment of close contact touching even not only that but her possessor wouldnt have been able to stay in her body for more than a day any longer would be dangerous lingering increases the possibilities of becoming stuck xiu has been in shanghai all this time her possessor might be there as well sixs cheek hurt she touched it lightly and felt dizzy joseph touched her arm we need to take care of that he said the rest first she replied it cant wait joseph told her six pulled away xiu would not have logged her movements though i can tell you that she was supposed to question some bankers who work with chenglei their office is near the bund its a start he said but it can wait until morning right now all that matters is taking care of you unless you want to end up like those creatures no she said trying to ignore the pure fear that accompanied that thought talking helped i still do not understand what they are or what they do it resembles magic but i know it must be science joseph looked at her as though he knew exactly what she was feeling but all he said was magic and science are not mutually exclusive one looks much like the other if you dont know the difference in this case vampirism is similar to a disease it affects the appearance although that can be maintained by choice it gives strength speed but it also makes the victims hungry six looked away are they evil would i become evil joseph hesitated all your emotions your empathy and compassion your capacity to love would be suppressed if there is a place in the human brain where those things live it gets shut off all that remains is something hollow but you can stop it she hated the sound of her voice the thread of fear that crept into it but joseph did not seem to mind nor did he look at her with pity all he did was squeeze her shoulder and drag her close to press his lips upon her forehead she let him other men had kissed her but it felt different with joseph more alive they left the audi and walked to the cab drivers the men did not want to break up their game but six offered a onehundreddollar note apart from the fare to the first person up and ready joseph gave directions and after a while their cab left the freeway for the industrial zone a modern area of wide treelined roads modern sculptures and vast corporate headquarterssome of which seemed to have been designed in some architects odd dream closer to the city core the scenery changed water became the influence canals and bridges splitting roads the buildings too retained a classic charm unlike shanghai the suzhou city planners had attempted to maintain the feel of old china in its appearance the new years celebration was in full swing here as well even in the wee hours of morning men were still setting off fireworksalbeit halfheartedly red lanterns swung gently over the roads and all the shop doors were plastered with red banners covered in wishes for good luck in the coming year joseph had the cab driver drop them off in the middle of a tiny shopping district no one else was out except for the occasional pop and bang the air was quiet joseph led six down a side street they had to cross a bridge over one of the canalswater lapping gently against the stonesand then he guided them left into a wellworn neighborhood where the walls felt high and the streets narrow and the air grew more still and hushed the deeper they traveled a good place for a trap six thought but she could do nothing but keep her senses open ready alert it was second nature but she paid special attention not wanting to take anything for granted it was odd though the more she concentrated the more that came into focus where there had been silence now there was noiseso much noisebuilding into a crescendo of men talking pans banging children crying farts and coughs and pissing in a can she heard sex she heard heartbeats she heard joseph breathe somethings wrong she murmured and her voice sounded like a roar inside her ears she stopped walking and held her head joseph moved close he covered her hands with his and the warm pressure of his fingers moving across her skin threading into her hair felt good enough to ease the discomfort bearing down on her eardrums when he pulled her against him she did not resist she pressed her forehead against his chest and closed her eyes his heartbeat was a roar of thunder it is starting she whispered whatever it is i can feel it your cheek has healed joseph said her hand flew up fingers running over skin the scratch was gone no pain no flush i am afraid she said and it was like hearing herself speak another language she had never said those words not out loud but the crush of her fear was so full and thick she had to express it she had to tell someone or scream im here joseph told her speaking into her mind six im here youre not alone i am always alone she told him unable to stop the words that sprang so easily into her mind i have always been alone not anymore he promised tugging up her chin he kissed her gently lips brushing against her mouth with such sweetness she held on to the feeling with all her strength fighting for it suddenly terrified it might be the last time she ever felt that way about another human being she remembered chenglei those other creatures she had faced on the street hollow and shriveled brittle with their hunger for another persons life not the men and women they had been born to be do not let me forget how to feel she said to joseph pulling back just enough to look into his eyes i have never asked for anything from anyone but please make me feel a tremor ran through his body six promise me joseph kissed her he dragged six off her feet and pressed his mouth hard against her mouth dragging from her a groan of pleasure as he kissed the fear out of her body replacing it with a liquid heat that made her writhe and twist against him her leg curled around his hip her arms snaking around his shoulders binding him tight and when he backed off for just a moment she traveled with him kissing him again dragging his bottom lip between her teeth joseph shuddered one hand trailed up her waist sliding beneath her blouse her breath caught as he touched her ribs and then the swell of her breast a fingernail grazed her nipple she gasped joseph set her down she felt his hard heat press through his pants against her belly which only made it more difficult to let go when he stepped back breathing hard we should move he said roughly its not safe here which should have been her line six swallowed a deep breath she was losing her head she had to be careful or she just might lose more she had been a survivor too long to toss it all away now she followed joseph a short distance to a small gate covered in red banners on either side were two pots full of water and tall bamboo a peach blossom lantern hung from the iron knob joseph pulled a small key from his pocket and fit it into the gate it swung open with a tiny rasp that was met with an answering creak from inside the house they hardly had time to walk through the gate when the door beyond the small courtyard opened an old woman poked out her head she peered at them both but it was joseph she smiled at finally she said youre home but what a surprise i thought you would be going north for spring festival change of plans joseph said pulling six behind him wenxia this is six six my very good friend wenxia she looks after this place for me when im away which is all the time said the old woman she moved back into the house with a pronounced hobble six looked down and had to take a moment to reconcile her vision wenxias feet were terribly small hardly the size of a fist your feet she said without thinking they were bound wenxia paused and glanced over her shoulder i came from a traditional family they thought it would help me find a rich husband and it did but not much else im sorry if we woke you joseph said wenxia waved him away i was cooking and a good thing too we will eat well today my boy dumplings and candy joseph kissed the top of the old womans head six and i have been traveling all night we need to rest you know where your room is wenxia hesitated her gaze flickering to six joseph raised his brow and a smile touched the old womans mouth she turned around humming and left the room six watched her go then looked at joseph she is your family there are many different kinds of family he said leading her up the rickety stairs but yes shes mine and im hers and its all good i met her a long time ago through my father she really was rich but everything was taken from her during the cultural revolution a mob killed her husband right in front of her strung him up from a tree then she and her son were sent north for reeducation on one of the state farms where is her child now dead he cut his hand on something rusty it happened early on shes been alone for a long time joseph pushed open a door at the end of the hall he stood in the entrance unmoving looking at his hands you know if youre not comfortable theres another room six hid her smile and pushed him gently aside the room was small and dark filled with richly carved antiques that gleamed and smelled of lemon oil a large window looked down over the canal they had passed over she could see more of it now the sun was rising joseph did not turn on any lights he moved behind her sliding his arms around her waist and tugging her close he kissed the back of her neck first we make you well he murmured then we see about everything else sound good yes she said and allowed herself to be drawn to the bed they sat together on the mattress joseph made her lie down and then leaned over her body his eyes dark his mouth set in a hard line six did nothing but study his face it had been a long time since she had allowed herself to be in a position so vulnerable to even be alone with a man for such an extended period of time let alone rely on one in any capacity outside her work it was not as uncomfortable as she thought it might be or maybe she had been around the wrong men either way joseph made her feel safe and that was rare indeed this could be easy or it could be difficult he told her softly youve been infected six a body can reject that poison but sometimes it doesnt want to she struggled with her fear i cannot imagine that it happens joseph trailed his finger down her cheek but not this time you are very confident joseph gathered up her hand and pressed it to his lips are you ready what do i do just be yourself he said quietly be yourself six and do not let go of that six closed her eyes she felt joseph enter her mind like a hand dipping beneath still water it was an odd sensation she knew he must have done it before but this was the first time she was aware and it was profoundly intimate a part of her feared the contact wanted to censor herself but she remembered his voicebe yourselfand she took that to heart and let herself simply be and for a moment she felt the world open up inside her mind her life spreading before her in all its infinite moments no sadness just wonderment but then the pain began and six forgot serenity josephs mother had always impressed upon her son the importance of telling the truth but of course his mother had never been able to keep any friends past the shelf life of an honest answer and so joseph had learned through example that the occasional white lie was sometimes appropriateand indeed necessaryto keeping the people he cared about happy in sixs case it involved a particular omission on the subject of pain as in vast unending quantities of pain most definitely as he had been told on the level of giving birth to a baby the size of a large watermelon and then discovering that you were having twins joseph saw no need to add to sixs burdens unfortunately he forgot to take into account the fact that she was an incredibly strong woman prone to committing violent acts and that as the person she would blame for causing her pain he might just be be in for a little of it himself what are you doing to me she gasped this is part of the process he said now try to relax six glared at him and grabbed his hand she was not a screamer she was a squeezer and she refused to let go it was difficult for joseph to focus past the pain he was quite certain she was crushing bones he managed however by sinking deep enough into sixs mind that the discomfort became a distant thing less nagging than a mosquito bite and there held in the darkness he began to heal her the process was different for everyone or so he had been told in his experience he had brought back only two from the brinkanother omission he did not think six needed to know aboutand on both those occasions the trigger had been unique for one woman it was the remembrance of her childs birth that made her fight the hardestand for the man it was nothing more than a random sunset recalled from memory visceral reactionsreactions beyond mere fear or desireinfusing bodies with the mental strength necessary to fight off the infection caused by vampire contact the mind was more important than the body it was always more important especially when dealing with vampires whose only weakness was the mind a lack of spirit bolster that strengthen the roots of the soul and nothing could take hold but joseph immediately ran into a problem specifically with himself he could not hide from her his thoughts were open his memories fair game and though she did not search his mind as he sank deeper he felt her presence on the periphery of his most private mental spaces and it was an unexpected intimacy that he could not shut off you are afraid six whispered you are afraid of me no he told her im afraid of myself what you see i see and there are things i have done that i dont want to relive like the bones she murmured and joseph remembered that hot flash of her touch in the massage parlor the memory it had calleda fluke he thoughtbut now it happened again a strike of deep connection and he felt her gaze once more upon the worst of his memories years past twentyfive and on the go this time to africa the red cross because he wanted to help and they needed people sierra leone because that was where the need was the greatest but all i found was death and rape and atrocity he told six there was no end to it and one day when we were taken to a mass grave to bear witness i started talking to the dead i asked them who i asked them where and when i knew these things i found the men responsible and i made them joseph stopped he tried to suppress the memory but six would not let him he felt her warmth surround his thoughts unrelenting and after a moment he yielded to her he let her see allowed her to watch how he had possessed the bodies of murderers and torturers and brought them to the graves of their victims forcing the men to rest amongst the decay and filth of the dead and when they were truly buried he showed six how he had summoned the memories of the dead spirits who still wanted vengeanceand shown them what lay in their midst and that it was their chance to take a pound of flesh and they did joseph told her not literally but enough those men died died of fright maybe or suffocation from the bodies i made them rest under either way i was the one who killed them are you sorry sixs question was a gesture of politeness he knew she was already aware of how he felt but he said it anyway because she asked and it was something he had wanted to speak of for a long time no he said grim i am not sorry at all he sensed her satisfaction with his response six was a practical woman why would you try to suppress that memory then it bothers you i see that much joseph felt a hard cold knot inside his heart the place where the bones and the death resided but it was also a place of bitter satisfaction and there was power in that feeling too much power ah six said its easy to become a monster joseph replied easier for some than others you can get a taste for it righteousness makes it simple but its a thin line much like the one i am walking yes he said lets take care of that hows the pain better now that i have gone deeper i apologize for your hand do i still have one i hope you like surprises joseph laughed and it took him off guard he had never felt so comfortable with another woman he had never felt so at ease revealing himself as though her eyes were the same as his without fear or judgment he tried to imagine losing that he could not it did not bear thinking of you lied six said suddenly you have only helped two you will be three he said and dove into her heart searching for a memory to save her life he felt six try to follow and he held out a mental hand tugging her alongside him as he sped through her life tasting her spirit no two souls were ever alikea handful of snowflakes might have more in comparisonbut six was utterly unlike anyone he had ever encountered her memories of life were stark and cold with moments of fierceness interwoven like charms but he did not find anything to save her life nothing that created a visceral reaction not enough to burn out the poison hunting her spirit he could taste the first tendrils of it snaking from the darkness beyond her thoughts moving faster than he had imagined if he waited much longer there would be hooks involved tearing her apart stealing her heart making her empty no six said no joseph there must be something you have to fight he told her desperately youre a fighter six you can do this find something inside of yourself thats worth living for hold on to it he felt inside her mind the memory of a window a window with a view of a wall and beyond that rooftops and trees and sky freedom he heard inside his mind and then beside that window he felt another memory this time of him sixs first memory their first meeting seeing him walk into the room at the massage parlor he tasted her appraisal of his eyes his face and though it was a thrill to know she had noticed him even then what made his heart ache was that in her deepest unconscious she equated him with her symbol of freedom is that what you are six asked him my freedom you tell me no she said no person is freedom but maybe you are a path then use that path he wrapped himself around her spirit holding her fight but instead of fighting he felt six grow more solid in his mental arms and he matched her transformation until he could pretend he was searching her mind in the flesh like walking in a dream and feeling the ground beneath his feet only he suddenly found himself in that office with the window standing beside six as she stared through the glass they were both naked six he said and she turned just enough to kiss him a hard kiss hungry melting right through his soul scorching his heart he pressed her against the window cradling her head in his hands and he could feel her skin ride against his own smooth and hot he grabbed the backs of her thighs and lifted her up swinging them both around to the desk until he could lay her flat pushing apart her thighs moving between them six did not hesitate she reached down and slid him into her body raising her legs so that her knees practically touched her chin and her calves rested on his shoulders joseph gripped her hips and began thrusting hard and then quite suddenly they were no longer in each others minds but on the bed in his room and instead of being naked they were both in clothes wrapped around each other thrusting and grinding joseph did not stop he began tearing off his clothes as did six buttons popping pants shoved off and caught around ankles joseph pulled down the front of sixs bra at the same time he entered her and the sight of her breasts and the sensation of that first slick stroke almost sent him over the edge she strained against him crying out and all he could do was marvel at the fine strong lines of her body the feel of her moving beneath him as he obeyed her urgings and thrust faster harder pounding into her as she wrapped her legs around his back fingernails clawing into his skin joseph had no warning before she turned them but suddenly he was on his back and she was on top and that was fine because she lost the bra and the sight of her bouncing breasts made him so hot that when he touched them he almost lost it for a second time six leaned forward on her palms thrusting hard then she stopped abruptly and slid all the way off him held herself there as they both panted joseph grappling with her hips and then came down so hardlike that first thrust all over againthat he shouted and sat up wild grabbing her around the waist and hips lifting and squeezing as she moved against him faster and faster he felt her comerode the wave as her muscles clenched around himand then took her over the edge a second time with only a few more quick strokes he came with that second orgasm emptying himself into her body and the feeling of being in her arms spent was so lush that he wanted nothing more than to plant some roots around them both and never move again but as he lay in her arms he rememberedand slowly carefully slipped back into her mind searching her spirit for the virus that had infected her it was still there its progression had stopped the tendrils hard and frozen but the threat remained nor did it appear that it would be disappearing anytime soon permanent and dangerous part vampire waiting to become whole and no way to know what would set it off chapter after the age of thirteen it became quite easy for six to reconcile herself with the idea of death she had after all taken lives to save her own and that was utterly justifiable as was taking the lives of those who were going to hurt others however remotely indeed she felt very little remorse about her actions there was no point dead was dead and she would have to kill again sooner or later that was the way of it that was what she had been trained to do her life no choice but now resting in the darkness of an unfamiliar room she wondered if this new turn in her life was some kind of karma a killer without remorse transforming into the physical manifestation of another kind of killer also without remorse justice or perhaps a divine joke maybe even destiny like meeting joseph six glanced at him he was finally asleep though lines of distress still cut into his forehead he was a beautiful man six enjoyed nothing more than staring at his face analyzing lines and angles and curves wanting to touch him again to feel him inside her she thought about waking him up but turned aside that thought he needed to rest as did she though that was unlikely to happen six dressed quietly and went downstairs she found wenxia in the kitchen seated at a fine table with flour scattered small coins of dough rolled into flat circles a large bowl of ground pork filled with chopped cabbage ginger and shrimp sat by her elbow it smelled good ill make you tea wenxia said scooting back her chair i will do it six offered and with some direction found the leaves a hot water dispenser leaned against the wall she let the water flow into a little ceramic pot and breathed in the steam she let it steep for a moment then poured wenxia a cup the old woman nodded her thanks six sat opposite the old woman and sipped her own cup of tea it tasted good and she felt herself relax as she watched wenxia work her hands were gnarled and brown but she made the dumplings efficiently without sign of pain can i help six asked oh no wenxia replied but she said it with a smile and six reached over for a dough skin it had been a long time since she had tried her hand at making dumplingsthere was an art to itbut she wanted to feel the sensation of cooking of preparing of putting herself into something other than fighting she thought of joseph and smiled ah murmured wenxia you do care about him are you a mind reader she asked startled no need i saw your smile only a man makes a woman smile like that you care six saw no use denying the truth still she hesitated yes i do the old womans mouth quirked you have to think about it no six replied but speaking of such things is difficult for me you are a product of the state wenxia said i can see it in your face does that bother you no a dumpling thumped onto a plate but it makes you react differently to things some people take for granted like making dumplings for example you have never spent a holiday with family have you no six said never life is isolating enough but when forced to live under the cold standard of a government machine wenxia stopped well times are changing one day you and your kind will be as antiquated as my own generation relics and no one will remember what was suffered no one ever does six said struggling to press the dough around the meat in the center and no one will ever care as much as you do about your own life wenxia put down her spoon joseph would care that much about you and if you had any heart in you you would care that much about him six set aside her dumpling he doesnt know me the old womans eyes narrowed if anyone knows you its him its what he does something i think youre well aware of six said nothing wenxia sighed do you know what he does for work many things you know he makes big money being a therapist to rich men giving them advice guiding them in their lives he does that several times a year makes enough and then he leaves runs away to places where the people are hurting dying and theretherehe uses his real power he makes people whole he gives them hope helps them move on did he help you six asked and instantly regretted it wenxia looked down shoulders hunching his father did he dulled my pain made it bearable six did not know how to answer wenxia saved her from trying she leaned on the table her bright eyes glittering you know the story of the spring festival yes how a monster would descend from a mountain to terrorize a village year after year eating people stealing children until finally someone said enough and they attacked that monster with nothing but a firework boom and the monster fled back to its mountain the old woman started making dumplings again the new year holiday is a time of faith child symbols colors flashes of light and soundall of it faith faith in a new beginning in the power of hope faith in the ability of people to be more than what they dream and it is a good dream yes yes six said softly precious even wenxia smiled people become so discouraged there are monsters everywhere beating them down stealing their dreams except the monsters are such cowards a loud noise a sharp light that is all it takes to drive them away face them and be strong and they will not be able to stand against you and what if the people themselves become monsters what if i am the monster wenxia gave her a knowing smile and patted her hand shine a light inside you child make a loud noise six joseph and wenxia shared a lovely dinner of dumplings the finest six had ever hadand the first that she remembered sitting down to with people other than orphans or military she asked joseph if it would be possible for him to learn of her life before she had been taken in by the government if those memories were still there buried he thought it likely but six did not ask him to try not then she was not ready to remember she and joseph did not stay long after the dinner there was too much on the line and the sense of urgency that pressed upon them was sharp enough to taste a ruining effect on an otherwise wonderful meal though six felt worse about leaving wenxia they took a cab back to the shanghai it was difficult to find one on new years day they directed their driver to take them to the bund nothing will be open joseph said holding her hand cradling it in his lap he looked handsome rested his eyes moving over her face out the window searching maybe not six said but at least we will make good targets perhaps attract the attention of someone who will lead us back to his master anger curled through her i have been thinking about the terrorists joseph trying to imagine what they would want with someone like you he grunted i have been thinking about the same thing ever since chenglei first contacted me trying to understand what jihadists would want with someone who most definitely falls outside their religion not that i need to understand too much hate is hate hypocrisy rules and there is precedent what do you mean how much do you know about world war two and the nazis i have studied the history six said but i admit to focusing more on the problems this country faced i have spoken to many elderly and they have told me the stories yes there are a lot of stories joseph said grimly but one thing i learned long ago from the european side of the war is that the nazisand more specifically hitlerwere so consumed by their desire to win that they began seeking alternative methods inexplicable methods of an unnatural origin you mean she said slowly something like you something like that he admitted thankfully they never tapped into anything real though they came close enough to make some individuals nervous and not just those with powers like mine but competing governments who in turn began developing their own programs to explore alternative weaponry within the paranormal the russians were the most serious second only to the germans my grandfather was part of that program he managed to leave it after the war illegally of course he escaped into mongolia and never left he took the daughter of a shaman as his wife and they had a son a family legacy then but it doesnt answer any questions shanghai traffic was lighter than usual but the bund surprised them by being quite crowded it seemed to six that every family had taken the afternoon to travel down to the heart of the city and see the sights days off were rare for most the new year festivals guaranteed at least one we must stay away from the waterfront six told joseph after being dropped off by the cab there will be undercover military there for sure and they will know my face xiu must have been discovered by now as she spoke her eyes seemed to blur vision worsening almost to blindness until suddenly without warning everything snapped back into focus six gasped she could see everything the individual pores on a womans facewho was standing more than fifty feet away the brand name on the buttons of a mans jacket far across the street her vision swooped and burned like she was an eagle flying and it was dizzying frightening check she said is the poison no joseph said grimly it hasnt progressed but youre still suffering the side effects just as long as i do not suffer anything else i am still me correct i still feel you have your heart he said quietly i wont let you lose it six you will not have a choice if the poison spreads joseph said nothing the street they were on was the main artery running parallel to the bund the architecture was european in origin neoclassical designs from the twenties up to the forties immense monoliths that had stood the test of time far better than most modern chinese buildings constructed in only the last few years six and joseph did not take a walking tour of those massive buildings instead they walked into the peace hotel and found a bench in a little nook off the main foyer crowded with tourists most of them from america and europe they sat holding hands joseph began a search with his mind after a moment he invited six to join him and she found herself swept into his thoughts carried alongside him as he traveled another world seeking danger he found it almost immediately right on top of them a sickening lurch of knowledge that made them both reel there is a bomb in this hotel said joseph horror leaking from his thoughts my god its a person a person six was already running the location in her mind the face of the man she barreled through the crowd ruthless battling her own feelings of shock she had expected this in theorythe peace hotel had always been on a list of possible targets to be wary ofbut thinking and knowing were two separate things and there was a part of six that could not believe it was happening here now not now the crowd thickened she did not think she jumped her body flew over the tops of heads she heard gasps she gasped but there ahead of her she saw a stocky man in a heavy coat and she forced herself to move faster than she ever had before faster than was humanly possible the suicide bomber never had a chance he barely saw her coming before he hit the ground six did not kill him she broke his wrists instead cracked his knees by stomping hardand then as he lay on the ground screaming she flipped open his coat and looked at the bomb it was not terribly sophisticated she had trained on harder targets six pulled the necessary wires joseph appeared behind her he knelt placed his hands on the mans temples and began to chant this time six stayed out of his head she stood and pulled out her badge showed it to the hotel manager who came running pale and frightened showed it to the crowd and in her best english told them to please exit the area in a careful manner they did without hesitation she gave the hotel manager a number to call just in case they had not already joseph she said got it he murmured there are seven other locations we cant reach all of them in time six grabbed a nearby man and stole the cell phone out of his hands he began to protestshe showed him her badge dialed fast with one hand ying picked up on the second ring the terrorists are planting a series of bombs around the city she said quickly and then had joseph take the phone and rattle off the list of names and locations six took back the phone listening as ying shouted to someone in the background she heard the call go up loud and fierce for a moment a feeling of nostalgia a sliver of regret that could have been grief struck her but then she looked at joseph standing beside her and felt such freedom it stole her breath away she was making her own path now walking her own road six said ying what happened between you and xiu she doesnt remember anything you are in such trouble i cannot explain six said but i am still on your side please no matter what happens remember that what happened ying asked this is not you six goodbye she said tell the others for me six ended the call and tossed the phone back to its owner she could hear sirens and flagged down the hotel manager one more time guard this man she said pointing to the terrorist still writhing on the ground step on his wrists or knees if he gives you any trouble do it anyway for fun the police will be here in a moment yyes stammered the man six and joseph ran a police cruiser careened around the corner just as they walked through the revolving doors six tugged on josephs hand and made him slow to a walk which they didvery quicklyin the opposite direction the flow of the crowd made it easy to get lost a lot of people were leaving the hotel you found something else she said to him jostled on all sides by strangers her sense of hearing threatened to overwhelm her she tried to subdue the sounds crashing in her eardrum and much to her surprise they subsided to something resembling normal she wished her heart rate would do the same him joseph said shortly i found him he stopped walking six bumped against his side his hand tightened and she followed his gaze to a man and woman standing in the middle of the sidewalk staring at them eye contact was startling six felt those two sharp gazes reverberate down to her gut and she knew without being told that they were vampires human shells hollow cores just like her if she was not careful if the poison began to move again i wish i had my dagger joseph muttered i should have kept a spare at the house we will get you a new one after this six replied and that brought a brief smile to his face you and i he said softly what a team yes she said i like it the vampires moved close six and joseph waited the crowd parted around them all like water hello sister said the woman hello hello we have a message said the man you should come with us to hear it really were guides added the woman i think you know who sent us the man pointed its a short walk joseph and six did not look at each other they were already inside each others heads and they both knew what they had to do they followed the vampires down the long gently curving street walking away from the bund sirens filled the city a wail occasionally interrupted by the shot and blast of firecrackers the sound made her jumpy though she tried to hide it joseph knew though he felt the same they were led to an office building that was still fairly new all glass and steel there was a security desk but no one manning it the woman keyed in a code the elevator dinged and the four of them crowded into the small spacevampires on one side joseph and six on the other she still had the gun she had taken from the guard its weight was comfortable beneath her shirt we were sorry to hear that chenglei passed on said the man to joseph he was a very good person he had dirty feet six said the vampires frowned joseph coughed holding his hand over his mouth the woman gave six a piercing look you are almost one of us now i think you will like it if you give it a chance six said nothing engaging in that debate would be a waste of time the elevators doors opened the vampires stepped out first joseph and six following behind his voice rumbled into a low chant the creatures frozeand then movements jerky stepped back into the elevator the woman snarled but she pushed a button the door slid closed that will not keep them away very long said six long enough joseph replied a parlor trick and quite useless said another voice six and joseph looked up a blond man walked out of a nearby office his chinese had an english accent and he was tall and cleancut clad in a navy suit with a lilac tie he was followed by three individuals who were quite clearly vampires one of them however also wore a suit his skin was swarthy his features more of the south perhaps from indonesia he gave her a straight hard look and six felt from josephs mind the realization that this individual was one of the terror cells ringleaders a planner ah said the other man so you finally see your vampire connection that still doesnt explain why they would want men like us joseph replied control and information said the vampire there was a woman we needed to speak to but she was too well guarded she had very private information about how to access certain facilities where she was planning new year parties simple really and i knew of your skills if it makes you feel better we were going to kill you afterwards thanks joseph said dryly and looked at the blond man and you mr doe he said with a slight smile john doe to you and no the little bastards wont kill me ive never touched a single one of them and if they do try ive made it crystal clear what will happen in retaliation he leaned forward eyes glinting fear mr besud you should really try utilizing it in a different manner than you have you are far too much of a goodytwoshoes six recalled josephs memories the bones the dead the cold way he had dispatched the vampires during the previous night not so goodygoody she thought not at all the two of them were the same that way what do you get out of this she asked doe not just money you would not want joseph dead if it was simply that doe smiled cracking his knuckles do you know what happens when people die miss six it is quite remarkable really their souls leave everything that ever made a person who they are simply floats away to heaven or hell or perhaps just to live on a cloud i do not know nor do i care what i find fascinating is not what happens after death but what occurs during joseph paled youre feeding off the deaths do you know how old i am doe tapped his smooth cheek running his finger down his strong jaw ninety young mr besud ninety years old and my body is still as young now as it was all those years ago back home in russia his smile changed becoming darker more feral i knew your grandfather boy i trained him josephs breath caught he spoke of a teacher never his name though he said that man was great a compliment doe said i am still fond of him you know he was a stunning pupil i was disappointed when he chose to run away it took me years to find him again i thought for sure that he would have used the trick i taught him to stay young but instead i found an old brittle man with an old crone of a wife their children aging by the minute and you you with even more talent than my student so you would kill me for that joseph swayed forward why because there are no others like us doe whispered not anywhere we are alone boy and you do not want the competition six said quiet doe tipped his head when i was young nothing excited me more than the idea of my brothersinarms all of us living to use our gifts for pride and country but it is a different world now and i like my power being only my power you like killing people for that strength joseph said flatly only a violent death would give what you crave a little bit of chaos never hurt doe said china will rebuild it has people to spare im sure the vampires agree six gritted her teeth i would like to kill him now may i by all means joseph said doe sneered he lifted his hands chanting six felt a brief tug on her body but it slid off her like water and she smiled took one step forward reaching behind for her gun doe faltered the vampires all looked at each other there is a curious thing called possession joseph said you might have heard of it thing is you dont have to fully inhabit a person in order to keep someone else out im surprised you didnt know that doe doe paled he said one word and the vampires jerked in front of him six knew what joseph wanted before he asked she tossed him the gun and then barreled into the vampires clearing a path for him so that he could chase after doe he did disappearing around a corner in the long office corridor behind her the elevator dinged the two vampires who had escorted them up ran off snarling their human faces had drained away they stared at her with hollow eyes and black mouths sharp tongues writhing deep within the maw the air felt cold sister hissed the woman i think perhaps we no longer want you to join us six laughed it was too funny five vampires against one she liked those odds doe ran fast but joseph did too he caught up with the older man before he could fire the gun he heard a low voice fill the air binding words pushing against him joseph held up one hand and let his own voice fill the air double tones loud and strong his voice drowned out doe and he lifted the gun and took aim his grandfather had always been good with a gun so had his father the steppe made men hardy that way joseph fired the bullet caught doe in the knee he went down screaming and joseph stood over him doe tried again to use his gift but the power while strong slid away what did you think it would do for you joseph asked quietly kneeling really what eternal youth perfect control over the people around you and you thought you could beat me with that youre no better than a vampire worse even you had a choice same choice as my grandfather as me does face contorted i should have killed you all when i found you the first time made it easy yes joseph said you should have he put the gun against does forehead and pulled the trigger joseph left does body he did not watch the mans soul leave he ran back to help six there were four piles of ash on the ground no doubt all of them had died with their heads ripped off vampire strength was obviously doing her some good the last vampire alive was the terror cell planner six had him pinned face down on the ground she had somehow found time to locate a minirecorder which she held up to joseph how do you do that he asked admiringly taking the device six smiled joseph turned on the recorder and held it by the vampires face he watched as six questioned him on tape methodically breaking his fingers every time he refused to answer and when he still refused she commenced ripping those fingers off his hand one by one the dismembered digits turned to ash by the time she reached his pinky the man had begun blabbering like an idiot helped along of course by josephs own coercion he did not feel like wasting any more of their time when six was satisfied he turned off the recorder and slipped it into his pocket he did not want to preserve for posterity the sound of six tearing off a mans head with her bare hands which she did quite easily the vampire turned to ash so joseph said that was interesting very six wiped her hands together i hope this doesnt mean were breaking up he said now that the danger is over there is always danger six said and no i am not going anywhere not without you good joseph said the adrenaline finally seeping away making him shaky he wrapped his arm around sixs shoulders and pulled her near happy new year he muttered and kissed her hard epilogue three weeks later six found herself in mongolia it was a nice country she could admit to herself that she loved it it was a beautiful day cold and crisp furs lined her throat her leather jacket was heavy and warm a gun pressed against her ribs slung tight in a new shoulder holster joseph sat beside her on a motorcycle it was a russian model lightweight but sturdy enough for two good for crosscountry riding unless they decided to buy horses unlikely the animals did not seem to like six she blamed the poison still in her blood life is good joseph said yes six said do you think ying has been able to use the information that was on the recording i would think so he hesitated regrets about leaving your old life not really she said i am making a new one in a spectacular way i might add for a vampire joseph shrugged but she could feel concern on the edge of his thoughts youre only part of those creatures enough i think perfect just the way you are joseph held out his hand ive said it before and ill say it again what a team we make six yes six trailed her fingers down his chest and what will we do next as a team i am a wanted woman you are a wanted man we cannot ever go back china is a big country but its not as big as the world well manage he patted the back of his motorcycle ready six hesitated for a moment gazing down at the valley below her the land could swallow the sky with its vastness green and brown and full of lush curves that idled like the clouds no walls anywhere in sight six turned around joseph was watching her a question in his eyes she kissed him long and slow and slid behind him on the motorcycle i want one of these she said i want to fly on this land well fly together he said and they did

wwwmarjoriemliucom the harvest vicki pettersson for my motherjoanne johnson happy thanksgiving happy birthday chapter zoe archer had hated hospitals even before she became mortal and absolutely loathed them now that she was subject to the same capricious whims of the universe as those she used to protect the sharp smell of disinfectant and the even sharper underlying emotions was a bitter reminder that she too was suddenly vulnerable to guntoting criminals and shiftyeyed rapists vulnerable to the rampant evil of shadows for gods sake she thought irritably as she strode from the fourthfloor stairwell these days she was bothered by a mere paper cut shed had to find new ways to move through this old world stepping aside moving around and shrinking back instead of barreling through clamoring over and standing up shed had bruises for weeks after her transformationbruises until shed finally learned the limits of mortal flesh and blood she was just thankful this learning curve wasnt being recorded in the manuals how embarrassing would it be if the agents of light knew she actually bruised how dangerous if the shadow agents discovered she bled zoe shivered and picked up her pace her steps echoing through the wide sterile hallway as she settled her briefcase strap more firmly on her shoulder it was still worth it she no longer deserved the powers that had once made her extraordinary and if shed ever been a heroine worthy of the title she wouldve passed on her chi before her daughter was almost murdered but so intent had she been on her mission her own deceitful life that she hadnt even considered that possibility so when it was too late when all she could do was watch her jobaby fight for lifewires and tubes and casts canvassing her young body like she was caught in a webzoe knew there was only one title that mattered and it wasnt superhero it was mother and she was determined to prove herself worthy of that tonight shed tie up this final loose end and in doing so ensure the safety of all the loved ones shed left behindboth mortal and supernatural then shed spend the rest of her life in this fragile human skin as penance hiding from both ally and enemy alike the nurses station on the labor and delivery floor was eerily empty when she arrived she heard a womans cry from down the hall a sound that had her belly tightening as she remembered the pangs of her own two births but she needed to stay focused and quickly shook the memory off throwing a cursory glance over the rim of her owlish glasses and spotting no one she leaned over the admissions desk to thumb through the charts yep there she was joanna archer room swallowing hard zoe headed that way she was three doors from her daughters room when she heard the crying she slowed but told herself she wasnt stalling just being respectful compassionate human at least that was her excuse peering around a doorway she spotted a young couple dressed in unassuming street clothes clinging to one another as the world spun heedlessly around them she couldnt scent their sorrow as shed have been able to six months earlier but she didnt need to bleakness was printed on their faces carved in the bend of the mans back as he held his wife jackhammering her trembling shoulders as she wept can i help you the voice sharp and businesslike came from directly behind her and zoe jolted before regaining her composure and turning the nurse was older than she was midforties probably and wore her chopped hair in the same red zoe had favored before being forced to dye it black for this new identity her eyes skirted to the nurses name tag nancy was bigboned her powderblue scrubs putting zoe in mind of a giant canvass of sky and she wore comfortable softsoled shoes which was why zoe hadnt heard her sneak up something else she thought wryly that wouldnt have happened six months ago im traci malone zoe said holding out a hand palm down so the woman wouldnt catch sight of the glasssmooth pads where her fingerprints should be case worker for the archer adoption the nurses face cleared understanding replacing her businesslike wariness she held up her hands a wardingoff motion before withdrawing them again youll excuse me for not shaking i just came from delivery and havent had a chance to wash up yet zoes eyes wandered to the couple still oblivious to all but their personal sorrow nurse nancy saw the look and reached around zoe to pull the door shut before shooting her a small bittersweet smile dennis and andie were another of our patients adoptees their baby didnt survive the birth how terrible nurse nancy nodded solemnly then shook it off with a philosophical sigh just another day on the job well you certainly got here fast i just got back from calling your adoptive parents theyre coming right away the family called me first zoe lied in a murmur theyd like the paperwork and documentation completed as quickly and discreetly as possible bet they do scoffed the nurse causing zoe to stiffen a pregnant teen some fancy family name to protect guess money cant buy you everything can it zoe managed a nod relatively speaking money could buy very little the infants very early nancy went on motioning for zoe to follow her just caught the twentyfour week mark but shes intubated and stable enough now that weve got her on the oscillator awfully small though well babies tend to come in their own time zoe said following nancy back to the front desk sure nancy said but scoffed as she glanced at zoe but an early deliverys more common when the mother has endured such traumaraped you know she said in an exaggerated whisper before continuing in a normal voice so the childs obviously unwanted another mitigating factor add in a flawed support systemthe girls mother ran off after the pregnancy was disclosed the father wouldnt even come down for the birthand you have a recipe for fetal trauma nancy tsktsked as she rounded the counter shaking her head in a way that made zoe want to rip it off instead she pulled out her notepad and with shaking hands pretended to scribble some thoughts what time was the child born midnight sharp actually nancy shook her head flipping through paperwork what a novelty huh not really zoe wanted to say the zodiacs lineage was matriarchal everyone who was superhuman was born on their mothers birthday exactly midnight just as their mother before them thats how zoe knew her daughter would be here tonight even if it was three months too early and the girl the mother how is she nancy glanced up brows furrowed you dont need to see her do you why is she all right please god please sedated the labor was complicated and a shock to a stillhealing system but shes resting easily enough now a sigh spiraled out of zoe before she could stop it causing nancy to glance at her sharply zoe immediately checked herselfcase workers didnt get involved with their clientsand shot the nurse a distracted smile no of course i dont need to see her shes already signed the release papers and she should rest nancy was still looking at her speculatively when a crisp bell chimed behind zoe the nurses eyes slid over zoes shoulder and her face cleared there are the mccormicks now she waved them over and zoe turned warily inspecting for the first time the people who would take possession ofno take care ofher granddaughter the woman was diminutive a fussy fluttery thing who kept clutching at her own hands and holding so close to her husband she very nearly tripped him up he seemed not to notice though chest puffed out peacock proud a wide smile blanketing his ruddy face as he steered his wife with one large hand and mauled a stuffed bunny with the other mr and mrs mccormick this is traci malone zoe provided when nancy faltered im with social services i have your paperwork right here cutting right to the chase are we mr mccormicks voice boomed unnaturally throughout the still hallways but i imagine this is old hat for you huh youre probably anxious to get home and to bed mrs mccormick clutched his arm oh yes its late and so close to thanksgiving everyones so busy and she faltered her eyes going wide at a fresh thought oh honey our first holiday with our baby girl i just cant believe it weve been waiting dreaming for so long her husband shot zoe a helpless smile as his wife collapsed into his arms technically you wont be with her for thanksgiving zoes voice came out louder sharper than she wouldve liked she checked it along with her emotions and plastered a bland expression on her face she must remain in the hospital until shes strong enough to be selfsupporting another sixteen weeks or so but maybe by christmas nancy reassured smiling as she pushed away from the counter ill just go make sure the babys ready ready zoe turned back to the couple who were tryingunsuccessfullyto temper their giddiness oh yes didnt you know more fluttering by mrs mccormick as her wide eyes searched zoes face were having the child moved to the sheep mountain medical facility they have the best neonatal unit in town and well we dont want to risk the birth mother seeing her and you know changing her mind her husband said flatly we know shes young probably fickle or confused obviously not of the best moral character dave his wife slapped ineffectively at his shoulder the girl is giving us our darling baby im sorry sweetie youre right almost nauseated zoe fumbled in her briefcase and reminded herself that shed picked these people out of hundreds of candidates shed researched their backgrounds those of their extended families and even did a drive by on their neat suburban home she needed them and the child needed to be in hiding because of who and what she was shed be safe with the mccormicks safe from the judgment of those whod fault her for the circumstances under which she was conceived and most importantly safe from the shadows if you could just sign here she said her voice sounding hollow even to her own ears as she dropped the paperwork on the counter and moved away suddenly all she really wanted to do was get away the mccormicks moved in close chattering excitedly as they each signed the small stack of papers completing the adoption when they were done zoe ripped off the copies and handed them to mrs mccormick she then dropped the rest back in her briefcase settled her glasses more firmly on her nose and said congratulations dave blinked and drew back thats it wow that was fast the birth mother isnt contesting anything she shot them a smile it felt brittle on her face enjoy your new family but shed only taken a few steps before halfturning again she couldnt help it and asking now would save her the trouble and risk of searching later what will you name her jenna samantha they answered at the same time then looked at one another sheepishly bursting into giggles again dave recovered himself first were still working that out zoe nodded shortly and forced an aspect of bored professionalism in her voice before turning good luck and she strode away closing the last chapter on her old life forever zoes plan was to turn in the paperwork finalizing the mccormick adoption to social services in the morning quit her job right after that and lay low until she figured out a new identity to replace traci malone shed have liked to take a little vacation get out of town while everyone else was celebrating the holidays but her finances wouldnt allow it every dime she had and every safety net shed had to leave behind she was starting over for the third time in her life and doing it with fewer resources than ever before but she had seen her family safe she thought on a sigh and had secured her lineage for the next two generations joanna possessed everything she needed to heal and eventually shed be better and stronger for it and now her granddaughter was hidden deep if in plain sight and the shadows would never know of her existence yes thought zoe as she exited the hospital into a cool november night it was all worth it caught up in her thoughts zoe hardly noticed the black town car glide up to the curb or the driver hop out to open the passenger door ill pull around to the side and wait for you there miss olivia the driver said holding out a hand thank you brian his charge said and zoe turned to see a beautiful young girl alighting from the car she was on the cusp of womanhood with peaches and cream skin and billowing blond hair that stood out like a beacon against her black sweater set zoe stared unable to take her eyes from the girl itd been six long months since shed seen her youngest daughter olivia archer beelined for the entrance as the car whisked off her arms so full of bags and boxes she had to peer around the side to navigate her way zoe didnt question the need to help to see her daughter she just moved before she knew shed acted rushing to hold open one of the giant glass doors olivia caught the movement from the corner of her eye yelping she shied and ducked and only belatedly did zoe realize what she must look like someone waiting until the girl was alone charging from the side attacking her in the night olivias packages flew from her arms and zoe heard glass shattering and bags ripping while her daughter dodged behind a concrete pillar even with her mortal hearing she could make out the ragged breath and whimpers no no no no oh her poor traumatized baby miss archer zoe cast her voice high keeping it steady though it wanted to shake im so sorry to startle you i was just going to get the door olivia peered cautiously around the pillar her blue eyes wide fear etched on her brow her poor poor baby hhow do you know my name olivia asked still wary zoe tried on a smile but it felt tight on her face and she let it drop trying for casualness instead im the case worker for your sisters adoption we met before olivia edged out from behind the pillar recognition dawning in her eyes iim not supposed to talk to you i mean my father said im not supposed to talk about it with anyone the baby i mean ill just bet he did thought zoe cursing xavier archer his greedy heart his blackened soul she smiled reassuringly i understand let me just help you with these they bent together and picked up what remained of the dinner olivia had brought her sister turkey and stuffing cranberrieshalf of which were splattered across the sidewalksweet potatoes and apple pie joannas favorite quite a spread zoe murmured keeping her head bowed to hide her tears i made it all myself i wanted her to have a proper mealthe food in here is just awfuland since she wont be home in time for the holiday and daddy wont let me come down on thanksgiving day she trailed off obviously worried shed said too much olivia had never been able to directly disobey xaviers order though she had recently begun to dodge them as evidenced tonight well you did a wonderful job zoe said handing her a final container of gravy she hesitated then pressed will mr archer be joining you olivia flushed to her roots then swallowed hard and lifted her heartshaped chin daddy doesnt know im here i snuck away after he left for some party if he finds out hell have brian fired for driving me but i just had to see joanna its her birthday i couldnt let her be alone tonight thanksgiving maybe but not her birthday and not after she so recently was attacked raped beaten left for dead had a baby zoe said softly as she stood and handed a bag to olivia dont worry i wont tell a soul relief had the girl sagging a bit thank you ms im sorry i didnt catch your name zoe held open the door you can call me traci thanks traci olivia walked through the door but hesitated just on the other side not looking back she wont talk about it with me she cant but shes a very brave girl zoe waited until olivia did look back and held her gaze there youre brave too me olivia immediately scoffed no im not i ran i left her iim nothing thats not true zoe said so vehemently it had olivia blinking in surprise zoe fought to work a blank expression on her face its not youre here arent you taking a chance that youll get caught disobeying because youre right you dont give yourself enough credit from what i understand you saved joanna because you did run and fast there was nothing more you could have done that night you reacted perfectly to a perfectly horrible circumstance olivias beautiful face crumpled on itself and tears emptied out over her cheeks she bit her lip to keep it from quivering still trying to be brave when jo gets out of here were going to take a trip to europe itll be a fresh start for her for the both of you olivia smiled through her tears for us all for the baby too dennis and andie seem like wonderful people zoe thought of the couple upstairs clutching one another a stuffed bunny and longheld dreams of having a daughter she nodded but corrected olivia you mean dave and andie olivia looked at her oddly before shaking her head no i mean dennis and andie the mccormicks dont tell anyone but i looked them up on the computer she shot zoe a sheepish grin though pride lurked beneath the look actually i hacked into the hospitals registry i just had to see where my the baby was going im sure shell be happy with them did you know they already have a name for her ashlyn isnt that lovely i think its a family name but but zoe had stopped listening she closed her eyes and let the images come fast and furious as olivias airy voice faded to the background nurse nancy shutting the door on a grieving couple whod just lost their adopted daughter dennis and andie the same nurse warding off a handshake just as zoe wouldve done a couple anticipating the longawaited arrival of their daughter though strangely they hadnt yet agreed on a name zoe dove for her briefcase fumbling for the papers inside typed neatly at the top of the page mccormick dennis and andria signed below mccormick dave and andie zoe was slowstupidly inattentivebut she was suddenly catching up fast were having the child moved oh my god she lurched forward and grabbed at the door olivias questioning alarm spiraling out behind her in the wide deserted lobby midnight zoe thought doing a mental head slap a perfect time to snatch a child she took the stairs two at a time her briefcase banging awkwardly against her hip her breath echoing in the stairwell nurse nancy zoe said slapping her palm on the counter in front of a tiredeyed nurse shed never seen before where is she the nurse blinked up at her who zoe cursed and reached across the formica counter it wouldnt take much to create a distraction in a hospital just a false a code raising the alarm that some other patient had crashed she wondered briefly what ploy the shadows had used excuse me what do you think youre no chart ignoring the nurse she raced for the nursery maam you need to sign in zoe skidded around the corner god but theyd had their roles down pat the baby was gone zoe squeezed her eyes shut and lowered her head to the glass window there was no nurse nancy no couple named dave and andie if shed been thinking straight if she hadnt been so damned close to the situation she might have noted the small things the name slip the way the nurses nostrils had flared at zoes slip of emotion the couples forced surface emotions shed have seen all of it then as clearly as she saw it now maam are you all right no zoe thought pushing the other woman aside to charge back down the hall and neither was her granddaughter chapter in the car on the way to the address scrawled across the discharge papers zoe tried to figure out how the shadows had found out about the baby she was certain they couldnt scent out the power the light on joanna if zoe had withheld even a smidgen of her own personal chi then maybe but she hadnt shed given it all up and the very fact that she hadnt scented any of them assured her of that but theyd taken the baby and that couldnt be coincidence so how had they known the only thing zoe could be absolutely certain of was that the shadows hadnt known who she really was otherwise shed be on her knees in front of their leader right now begging for her life paying for her past zoe shuddered at the thought of the tulpa then resolutely pushed his image away she needed to concentrate on the task at hand follow the shadows trail one step at a time and go from there but when she pulled her car to a stop she didnt even need to look at the for sale sign on the lawn to know the house was empty she yanked her cell phone from her jacket pocket a slim new model shed bought on the street and called the number listed at the top of her papers out of service she then had the operator give her the number to the sheep mountain facility where they told her no baby by the name of mccormick had been admitted that evening zoe was disappointed but not surprised both sides of the zodiac forceshadow and lighthad private facilities with their own medical staff it kept mortal physicians and officials from being suspicious or curious when the body count rose and often acted as a place of respite for injured agents until the next splitting dawn or dusk when the veil between their two parallel worlds lifted and they could pass easily into a different safe and alternate reality so zoe had no way of finding out where the enemy agents had taken the baby and even if she had shed be hard pressed to take on even one of them in her condition mortals were deplorably weak but she thought biting her lip there was one place she could go one person she could turn to for help shed sworn never to see or call upon him again but if she could catch him before sunup she might be able to convince him to help her because if he ever really knew herif he had ever truly loved herhed recognize her even beneath her mortal disguise and without the power that had made her his equal and if he refused asked an unwelcomed voice inside of her a bitter reminder of what shed done then her lineage and the legacy of the archer ended with her and shed sacrificed it all for nothing including her children including she thought pulling from the curb his love when warren clarke wasnt fighting crime and leading the agents of light in a centurylong battle against supernatural crime he spent his down time kneeling in a pew at the guardian angel cathedral it wasnt that he was particularly religious like all the star signs in the zodiac he believed in astrology preordained fate and that every life and death was written in the sky so his regular attendance at the cathedral had nothing to do with penance forgiveness or an overabundance of piety in truth whenever he lit a candle or knelt before the altar all he was really praying for was a fight zoe wasnt going to be the one to give it to him so she lit a cigarette and propped a foot up against the towering white obelisk in front of the cathedral directly beneath the neon cross flaring at its apex staring south down the length of flash and glitter of las vegas boulevard through faux hornrunned glasses she thought as she always had that it was an odd place for a cathedral but itd been here since outliving most of the casinos the mobsters the howard hughess and wynns remaining a solid and memorable fixture even though it was unremarkable compared to that long stretch of neon just outside its doors a statue of the holy family blessing the cathedrals visitors was cradled in the center of the hollowedout obelisk and zoe glanced at it now the promise of welcome was a strong lure for both the humans buffeted by the surrounding chaos and especially for the recent influx of immigrant agents from south of the border after naftas implementation and the subsequent devaluation of the peso not only had mexico experienced martial strife but the paranormal war between good and evil in that country had taken a decidedly ominous turn one had only to watch the soaring crime rate the corruption of government officials and staggering poverty to realize the balance between the two opposing sides had been toppled and that any agents of light still alive in the larger cities would have to flee so watch was exactly what warren did because something about vegas drew the transient and displaced mass would be an unnecessary ritual to those fleeing agents but itd also be familiar comforting and if one of them were looking for an allysomeone to perhaps rebuild a troop in this gamblers paradisethen the most visible cathedral in the city was an obvious place to meet but troop was already staked out in this glittering valley and warren was their leader so in his eyes once these displaced agents left their city of origin they became independents or rogues as he called them how they got that way and the fact that theyd once been agents of light was of no interest to him hed eradicate the valley of the rogues and the threat they posed to his troop even if he had to do it one by one zoe glanced at the steel and concrete sign to the right of the holy family the guardian angel had mass scheduled for midnight which meant it had just ended there were a few stragglers around the pyramidshaped building mostly couples but they were all exiting of the two men she saw entering one was clergy and the other was with a woman who obviously had the place confused with the allnight wedding chapel zoe waited finally her gaze locked on a lone man hands shoved deep in the pockets of his baggy jeans the open shirttails of his embroidered guayabera flapping in the wind he was young with smooth olive skin his heritage decidedly latin zoe straightened and called out to him smiling brightly waving him closer he hesitated but redirected after a moment hey buddy got a light he tilted his head and if he was an agent hed have scented her out by nowa human a lone female no threat no ingles he said turning his pockets inside out no money zoe sighed and rolled her eyes damned newcomers they all thought hooking was legal in vegas dame fuego she said to him and mimed bringing a cigarette to her lips his expression cleared and he colored even under the kiss of his golden complexion but his shoulders relaxed a fraction and he dug into his shirt pocket and withdrew a lighter it was one of the millions sold on the boulevard the infamous welcome to las vegas sign stamped on one side she flicked him a mildly flirtatious glance from beneath her glasses and bent forward as he flicked the lighters wheel it flared on the second try and zoe caught the smooth gleam of his fingertips unmarred in the wavering light like hers like all agents her voice was a throaty purr as she blew smoke up and out gracias señor solamente carlos he said almost shyly and zoe felt a momentary pang of regret knowing what awaited him on the other side of those doors gracias carlos she said and let him go anyway watching him disappear beneath the giant blue mosaic depicting a guardian angel and gods eye she had her own problems and after two full minutes she stubbed her cigarette out beneath her heel and followed carlos inside to face one of them the mexican agent was nowhere in sight when zoe entered the cathedral she glanced at the spot warren generally favored closest to the bishops chair at the front of the sanctuary but the pews were empty so he either wasnt in the building or he was already trailing the rogue agent tiptoing across the white marble floor she ducked into the chapel of the blessed sacrament while there she lit a prayer candle it couldnt hurt thirty seconds later she grinned grimly as a yell ricocheted through the cavernous building followed by a startled yelp she stopped grinning at the report of running footfalls down the sanctuarys center aisle four pair she determined not two a spanish curse spiraled to the buildings apex and if this had been a baptist church the agent would probably already be burning in hell but that wasnt what bothered zoe getting to warren had just gotten as tough mortals often witnessed paranormal conflict though the victorious agents made sure none ever remembered it sometimes the humans would wake the next morning swearing itd all been a dream or that their dinner the night before hadnt quite agreed with them problem was the memory of the entire twentyfourhour period prior to the conflict was often erased along with the incident and zoe needed to remember her familys lineage depended on it yet as she stood holding her breath next to the outstretched arms of the blessed mother all she remembered was what it was like to be super how she could sneak up behind any man or woman and have them unconscious before they took their next breath how shed laugh about it afterwards now that shed been stripped of the ability and was on the receiving end of the body blows she didnt find it quite as amusing taking a deep breath she edged around the white marble wall the fight was centered in the middle of the cathedral though to say that zoe was watching it would be deceiving she ripped the faux glasses from her face and shoved them in her pocket no prescription would allow her to follow these events what she needed to do was cease seeing let her vision blur as if she was trying to look at one of those puzzles where images were hidden within a picture even still she only caught brief flashes of action a limb flying outward before disappearing again a fist clenching before plowing from sight the man who wrote the manuals of shadow and light had once tried to explain to zoe how the agents actions came to him his inspiration he said came in blurred images and it was up to his imagination to supply the rest only now did zoe understand what he meant it was like flipping through one of those childrens books where the cartoon figure became animated the faster the pages turned only in the lifesized version a few of the panels were missing forcing her gaze to sharpen again she turned away from the action every instinct she had was screaming at her to remain hidden but she had to trust what she knew of warren and hope it still held true hed be at the center of the melee and his two companions would be too focused on him to spy zoe creeping in from the perimeter once again she stilled her breath and began inching forward along the triangular walls unlike those involved in the paranormal melee she moved achingly slow when in fight mode agents locked in on quick moving objects like eagles soaring over a desert canyon of course zoe had no delusions about not being caught her goal was only to be as close to warren as possible when that happened she probably would have made it if not for fluted candelabra and its tottery stand what was it with these catholics and their goldplated tchotchkes the room went still as they all whirled her way the rogue agents wild eyes widened in recognition while warrens narrowed zoe didnt bother looking at the other two she just burst into a full sprint hoping the unexpected movement would give her time to reach warrens side it worked closest warren had no choice but to give chase leaving the rogue to his allies unfortunately zoe blinkeddamned mortal eyes and the spot hed been standing in a second earlier was empty shit she dropped to the floor felt arms cushion her fall my hero it was their favorite endearment for one another and she said it to no one if she waited until she saw him itd be too late as it happened it already was warrens form solidified as he froze eyes widening in recognition and then a blurthe blow slowingbut it was too late to stop entirely warrens shocked image shattered as darkness enfolded her in inky arms numbness shooting through her body strangely though the disappearance into herself was more peace than shed know since the last time shed seen his face chapter the lights in the roadside cafe wouldve been bright no matter what the circumstances but with a knot the size of a walnut on her skull and said knot throbbing like a teens heart on prom night they were absolutely blinding zoe pushed away from the ripped vinyl of the red bench wiped the drool from the corner of her mouth and faced her three captors i cant believe you guys are still coming to this dive the cook spits in the soup you know jesus it really is her the man on warrens left gaped dropping his cheap coffee cup back in its saucer with a clatter zoe lifted a glass of water and pressed it to her aching forehead hello gregor walk beneath any ladders lately he shook his head his smile almost as wide as his bulky body gregor wasnt very tall but he had the neck of three men put together and the shoulder span of an angels wings he was bald with one small hoop earring that made him look like a modernday pirate and had a superstitious nature to match havent stepped on any cracks in the sidewalk either damn zoe but its good to see you and worth losing that rogue agent back at the cathedral agreed the woman to warrens right zoe smiled at phaedre she was the same age as nurse nancy though the similarities stopped there actually thought zoe theyd probably ceased in their twenties because thats how old phaedre looked like a twentysomething party girl with lowlights in her mahogany mane and a smile deadly all on its own the weapon tucked between her ample cleavage helped though welcome back shes not back an uncomfortable silence bloomed and zoes heart plummeted she shifted her gaze to warrens meeting headon the anger she saw living there his baggy clothing made him look slim almost slight but beneath it he was sinewy and tough though zoe knew the skin that covered all that compact muscle was as soft as her own hed have looked boyish with his short hair springing from his head in straight brown tufts except that his eyes were hard and knowing calculating as they rested on zoe it was his choice whether to accept her back in the troop or not but that wasnt what he was talking about of anyone warren knew zoe never changed her mind or went back the waitresss arrival saved her from answer and the woman let her disinterested gaze travel over zoes face lingering where the throbbing was the worst your girlfriend finally come to she asked needlessly snapping gum the same peptopink as her uniform get you some coffee sweetie zoe pursed her lips why not her funds were low and despite warrens current appearancehe seemed to be dressed as some sort of street bum this timehe could afford it besides he owed her for the knock on the head she nodded thatd be good and a short stack side of bacon the waitress pulled her pen from behind her ear and wrote down the order as she walked away zoe assumed everyone else had already eaten she returned her eyes to warren still waiting for her to explain herself so she did i need your help phaedre looked concerned gregor interested warren continued to stare warily if she was hurting him by not apologizingif shed hurt him by leaving without saying goodbyehe was hiding it well but it was a superficial sort of hidden like an alligator stirring up sediment beneath a brackish surface and zoe couldnt help wondering when itd strike she made them wait until her food had arrived and shed gotten a good bellyful before telling them if she had to chase them out of the cafe begging for help she wanted to do it on a full stomach surprisingly when she finished the tellinga mortal child had been stolen by the shadows and she needed to get her backthey were still there cool she signaled the waitress for a refill so there must be something special about this child warren finally said cupping his elbow in his hands as he leaned forward i mean to bring you out of retirement zoe ignored his emphasis of the last word and sipped at her coffee as she shook her head i was in the wrong place at the right time i saw the shadows take her didnt you try to stop them there were probably too many right zoe didnt meet phaedres eye or answer gregors question they didnt know about her mortalitythey probably thought she was wearing masking pheromones and thats why they couldnt scent her she didnt want to relieve them of that notion not just yet there were three of them i was alone but warren could tell she was holding back always holding back zoe always with the secrets and the lies still zoe didnt consider for one second telling him about joanna or the attack her daughter had endured because the shadows had scented zoe on her in her the seer had been very clear no one could know about these girls these future archers the knowledge could one day be used against them all thus beating against warrens unspoken accusation was a prophecy that ruled zoes days you must do it alone so she silently willed him to understand that she was still the woman hed once loved still light but his returned silence was critical like he sensed her desperation and he probably did the unease sitting on both phaedres and gregors faces told her they did as well zoes lukewarm coffee soured in her belly and straightening she pushed her cup away are you going to help me or not she said shortly of course phaedre started why should i warren interrupted not we phaedres mouth snapped shut isnt it obvious zoe said his imperious tone making her own voice tight youre the one with the power and dont forget who the hell helped put you in that position she thought blood beginning to boil whats obvious he said flatly is that youre doing another one of your disappearing acts and you want us to clean up after you thats not it at all oh really warren shut up gregor warren shook off the other mans hand without looking at him and threw zoes purse at her all your id is different youve altered your appearance hid your scent beneath a masking compound im not hiding it zoe finally exploded gripping the edge of the formica table so hard her fingers ached im human they all fell still and zoe felt herself redden i have no power she said more normally think about it smell and watch and youll know its true i couldnt cross into another reality right now if it unfurled in front of me like the yellow brick road gregors mouth fell open no my god the disbelief in his voice had her dropping her head only another agent could understand exactly what shed lost phaedre was just as shocked zoe what happened did the shadows find you steal your chi make you relinquish it in return for your life because all those things had happened before to other agents though not in this troop not to anyone under warrens watch zoe nodded how else could you sneak up on me without me even batting an eyelash i was wondering that myself gregor murmured falling back in the booth zoe was so busy reading the pity in his eyes that when her head whipped back the openpalmed slap coming at her from nowhere the sting of it had her gasping the blood that sprayed from her nose had gregor and phaedre doing the same pressing her napkin to her face head tilted back she regarded warren over the top of it id make you pay for that she said voice muffled but youd see it coming a mile away warren blanched which cheered her a bit what have you done he asked his whisper ragged at the edges i gave my power away she said with more composure than she felt why to whom to someone who needed it more than i did to someone she didnt say wed all need before long brave said gregor fingering the inverted gold horseshoe shining from a thick chain around his neck heroic phaedre agreed on a awed whisper stupid warren said he shook his head his expression again shuttered why do you always have to be so stupid zoe jaw ached from the effort to hold her tongue and temper she wouldnt get into a pissing contest with warren just because he was still nursing hurt feelings he could deal with those himself shed had to look she said pushing her cup aside to lean forward on her elbows the babys mortal were still in the business of protecting mortals right or are we only interested in slaughtering rogue agents who are doing nothing more than looking for sanctuary warren colored at that good she was useless physically but at least her words still had some sting we protect mortals you are a mortal warren phaedre chided zoe shrugged like it didnt matter that may be but im still light warren just quirked a brow and when it was apparent hed do no more than that phaedre reached out and patted zoes arm of course you are gregor put his giant palm on her other arm glaring at warren they all stared at him linked and acting as oneeven though he was their leaderdaring him to tell the archer of the zodiac no for a moment she thought hed hit her again she didnt have to scent his emotions to know how angry he was fine he finally said voice frighteningly low but lets get one thing straight youre just baggage zoe youre no good to us she flinched to me he was saying to anyone well get back this precious mortal for you but after that you disappear for good and you formally relinquish your star sign zoe sucked in a breath formally renouncing her star sign meant another agent born under the sagittarius moon would fill her place on the zodiac in the troop it would void her lineage forever and nullify everything shed sacrificed and that just wouldnt do but warren didnt need to know that so she held her indrawn breath and inclined her head and warren was just arrogant enoughand angry and righteous toonot to insist she do it right then and there he shot the three of them a grim closedmouth smile then threw down his napkin and rose fine lets work it out gregor shot zoe a relieved smile before following and phaedre took her hand helping her up zoe wanted to thank her but didnt know if her voice would hold besides just because they said they were going to help didnt mean they could do it the shadow and the light had been battling in the valley ever since vegas was just an x on some prospectors map each side was comprised of twelve agentsone for each sign on the western zodiac and when both sides were full there was balance in the mortal realm people were then free to make personal and societal decisions uninfluenced by paranormal nudges meant to bring out the shadow or light lurking in their own souls as tempting as it sometimes was to interfere in the worlds human dramas agents of light worldwide had fought to preserve the gift of choice for too many centuries to blithely disregard it the shadows conversely specialized in that which gave them a distinct advantage over the mortal realm it was far easier to cause heartache and mayhem than clean up the resulting mess zoes life work before she threw it away had been to neutralize this advantage shed grown up idolizing the elder agents devouring the manuals that depicted the fight between good and evil from the moment shed undergone metamorphosis at the age of twentyfive coming into her full powers shed dedicated her life to infiltrating the shadow organization she was patient wickedly sharp and determined to use whatever resources she had to fell her enemies her strength her craftiness and eventually her body shed spent more years than she cared to remember using that last tool but an effective weapon itd turned out to be so warren had no right to complain about the means by which she garnered her information or stalked her prey hadnt she always reminded him that no matter whose bed she woke in her heart remained solely with him its what i was born to do she told him years ago when they were both still young and arrogant enough to think philosophically about the whole thing its what im good at and warren knew it maybe zoe thought now that was the problem the child is how premature asked the troops physician micah over the car phones speakers theyd called him on the way to the real mccormicks residence hoping hed be able to better deduce where the shadows would have taken the child well the nursethough an imposterwas right children can be saved at twentyfour weeks though itd help if she were an initiate one born to the zodiac is naturally more resilient than a mortal infant zoe knew that which was why she wasnt as concerned about the childs health as much as her continued health so theyre hiding her incubating her keeping her safe from discovery not exactly news to us warren snapped hands tight on the steering wheel the dueling sides of the zodiac were constantly shifting their appearances their occupations and haunts settle in one place too long and you were just begging for a paranormal ambush as zoe had discovered geez came micahs voice from over the speakers someone woke up on the wrong side of reality today gregor and phaedre snickered in the back seat but zoe kept staring out the window careful to keep her expression neutral micah continued before warren could reply we have a couple of locations scouted out nothing confirmed yet he added quickly and there was a shuffling of paperwork as he searched for the addresses then read them aloud two were located on charleston a street where the singlefamily homes of the seventies had given way to medical and legal offices along both sides of the streets the third was downtown they thanked micah and hung up as they pulled to a stop in front of a modest twostory in an enclave of middleclass homes zoe stepped out onto the walkway stretching in the morning light thinking the neighborhood was a good fit for the couple shed seen grieving the night before comfortable yet without ostentation orderly but still welcoming zoe grabbed the briefcase shed retrieved from her car on the way over and started up the walk she halted halfway causing warren to plow into and then steady her though he released her as soon as hed done so that fueled her indignance adding a sting to her words where do you think youre going youre not going in there without me he replied just as coolly his light brown eyes hardening on hers as phaedre and gregor joined them on the walk zoe made a point of looking him up and down taking in his ratty trench coat tattered hems and mussed hair all that was missing was the cardboard sign around his neck why you want to scare the poor people to death she smiled when he scowled adding besides you smell his mouth worked wordlessly at that and a furious blush stained his chapped cheeks zoe wouldve laughed if she werent so pissed shed brought this case to them and now he was acting like she couldnt be trusted to convincingly play her part gregor sensing an argument brewing quickly threw in his two cents shes right hog youre as ripe as a maggoty brisket fuming warren looked from zoe to gregor then over at phaedre you stink she confirmed and the three of them headed up the sidewalk without him even with her mortal hearing zoe could hear warren cursing as he returned to the car gregor shot her a smile as she rang the doorbell and she grinned back it felt good knowing they were behind her flanking her trusting her it wasnt until that moment did she realize how lonely shed been it was the husband who answered the door zoed expected that but what made her heart catch in her throat was the red rimming his eyes making him look older than his thirtysix years making him look ill as well mr mccormick im traci malone the caseworker for united hospital we spoke on the phone recognition flashed through his eyes at her name but it didnt brighten them the guy looked like hed been extinguished inside can we come in she asked inching forward the physical suggestion wasnt as powerful now that she was mortal but he did take a small step back its about your daughter and now the pain followed he shook himself as if from a dream and began to shut the door you havent heard then we dont have a daughter ashlyns alive mr mccormick phaedre said from behind zoe the childs name was what stopped him zoe saw that the rest took a moment to sink in honey who is it andria mccormick mustve been crying all night she appeared pale skin blotchy hair falling out if its loose ponytail and wearing the same rumpled clothes shed been in the night before these these people but dennis couldnt finish fresh worry sprung into his wifes face as she studied his reaction then it iced over with protectiveness zoe knew then that shed chosen right this coupletheir love and homewouldve been perfect for her granddaughter would be perfect she corrected and straightened her shoulders mrs mccormick we have reason to believe your daughter was abducted from the hospital last night by a couple posing as you and andie gasped as denniss head reared up your husband they were assisted by a nurse named nancy allen may we please come in by the time the mccormicks had led them through the living and dining rooms dennis had regained his wits enough to ask to see their credentials zoe handed him one of her social services cards her eyes catching on a welcome home ashlyn banner draped over the glossy dining room table while gregor and phaedre flashed detective badges andie then settled them in the cozy kitchen nook while she put on a fresh pot of coffee and dennis opened the shades the morning light invading the darkened house in unrelenting streams zoe let her eyes pass over all the baby gear and followed andies movements as she pushed aside the preparations for the following days thanksgiving celebration making way for a tray and five cups and saucers her attention however never strayed from her visitors damn but zoe wanted this woman as ashlyns mother what we need from you she said ten minutes later after telling them all she could about the previous nights events is to tell us everything you remember about the nurse who called you last night even the smallest detail might help us find her the mccormicks looked at one another desperately nothing stands out dennis finally admitted running his hands over his chin he looked more composed now zoe thought hed recovered fast and concern had replaced his grief anger superseding his worry we wouldnt have noticed another couple and the birth mother didnt want to meet us so we never met any of her nurses before either gregor glanced up from where he was pretending to take notes did she try to convince you to have the child moved to another facility a clinic a private practice dennis shook his head glancing at his wife again she did the same nobody expected the baby to be born so early though there was clearly a chance of that because of the birth mothers trauma poor thing andie murmured pouring more coffee all around zoe lifted her cup to hide her expression knowing phaedre and gregor wouldve scented the bump in her nerves this womans life had just been ripped at the seams and she still had sympathy to spare for her jobaby sometimes she thought sighing she really wondered who was superhuman dennis ignored his coffee rising instead to pace we got the call around eleven last night telling us the baby was coming we rushed right down but by the time we arrived it was she said it was too late ii dont remember anything after that zoe nearly wept i do four pair of eyes fastened firmly on andies pretty determined face and she rewarded them with a tight smile the nurse nancy gave me a card said i could call her next week to find out the exact cause of death or if i just needed to talk the smile turned bitter i hugged her and thanked her for her kindness mrs mccormick gregor said while everyone else held their breath do you still have that card she pushed her chair back and stood with a small victorious toss of her head you bet i do the address matched one of those micah had given them phaedre and gregor disappeared with a hasty goodbye to the mccormicks leaving zoe to wind things up and leaving her alone with warren afterwards he was waiting at the cornerthe others had taken the carand they fell in stride without speaking she walking normally he with the limp from a blow thatd almost killed him years before as if knowing her thoughts warren accelerated his pace hed hardly feel it but knowing she was mortal hed also know she would she gritted her teeth and bore it the next persona she donned would just have to be extremely fit so what happened to your car salesman identity zoe finally asked when she couldnt stand the silence any longer what always happens he answered shortly the shadows had discovered it which one taurus it figured that was warrens sign too and if an agents identity was going to be found out it was usually their opposing zodiac sign who did it just like the old saying opposites attract breca he nodded before a clearly satisfied smile overtook his face the new one is named graham but when zoe smiled back warren caught himself and turned away she bit her lip and increased her pace its your birthday he said staring back at a man in a pickup whod slowed to stare at him he grinned grimly when the pickup sped away both the look and the statement were typical warrenno preamble or apology or emotionand it was totally different than wishing her a happy birthday zoe was surprised hed acknowledged it at all she shrugged not wanted him to know the day was any more significant for her than any other mortal most didnt share the day with their firstborn daughter and granddaughter besides she knew he was just warming up and if she waited hed finally come around to the heart of the matter why would you give up your chi zoe he asked stopping in his tracks because i love my daughter even more than i loved being a heroine she turned to face him and leaned against a streetlamp for the troop warren she answered truthfully and its future bullshit youve never done anything unless there was something personal at stake as well he pressed when he saw zoes jaw tighten then again getting out from under my command would qualify wouldnt it its not always about you warren she said and let the fatigue she felt bloom around her she knew what it would smell like to him apples just past their ripeness and a softpetaled flower wilting in the sun as expected he pounced what happened get tired of bouncing from bed to bed she blanched even in the harsh morning light youre lucky im mortal she whispered dont hide behind that and dont let him bait you she told herself as he limped past her so that she again had to follow because as long as she was doing the right thing it didnt matter what he thought hed know the truth in time she just wished she could see his face when he discovered how wrong hed been so she swallowed her retort and tried again speaking of hiding howd you go from being a salesman to a vagrant was becoming a walking cesspool your only choice stubbornly he kept limping along i chose it because its the exact opposite of everything youd want me to be warren please she stopped walking and sighed you dont mean that he whirled so fast all she saw was the blurred hem of his trench coat i do he said almost violently his face was contorted all the pain hed been hiding and the anger hed stored twisting it into a jumble of emotion his brown eyes were murky and cold youre toxic zoe you even believe your own lies you say love and you mean hate you dont even know what it means to work as a team or troop all you know is deceit she wouldnt let him get to her or bait her she swore and she wasnt going to fucking apologize warren had known what he was getting into the first time hed climbed into her bed shed kicked his ass in enough training sessions for him to have no illusions about that and after they spoken clearly of what theyd give and how far theyd go to conquer the shadows theyd give it all it wasnt her fault hed changed his mind about her or the men shed already targeted because there had been other men two to be exact shed stayed with the last xavier archer for sixteen years a mortal who was the human lackey to the shadows leader a man who traded informationand livesfor power and money that was olivias father but the first manif you could call him thathad been the shadow leader himself and zoe knew it was this relationship that bothered warren the most fooling a mortal was one thingeven humans could lie adeptly to one anotherbut deceiving the shadow leader took uncommon nerve someone with zoes particular skills she never had found out what warren found most irritating that shed faithfully return to his bed after months of lying in another mans embrace or that he just as faithfully would let her all she knew was that every time she returned to the sanctuary theyd end up yelling at one another until their throats were raw so she never told him when the tulpa got her pregnant or after shed changed her identity to go back undercover when xavier did the same two years later her daughters were hers alone not pawns to be bargained with manipulated orgod forbiddestroyed because of warrens jealousy spite or sense of duty but all of that was in the past back when she still thought she could make a difference when she thought she was invincible back she thought as warren stalked on ahead of her when she believed she and this smelly stubborn and impossibly good man still had a future together they trudged on in silence chapter nurse nancys real name was melania she was the shadow zodiacs libra firstborn daughter of treya granddaughter of patrice the cruel and by the time zoe learned all this she was also dead not only had she been working at the decoy clinic when phaedre and gregor got there but shed been alone the only problem with this she was alone no child and no faux adoptive parents but before phaedre killed her with a firetipped wand that burrowed through flesh to incinerate her core she convinced melania to tell her where theyd taken the babe the tulpas house gregor reported back when theyd all gathered at the smoking gun inn a battered roadside motel dumped conveniently in the middle of town and most of the shadow zodiac is gathered there as well zoes head shot up thats odd the tulpa never allows the shadows into his home or he didnt when i was with him and if hed changed that practice in the years since zoe wouldve ferreted the information out of xavier either with alcohol or sex or both so it was a recent development but like the others she could now only guess at the reasons why yet even odder than that why would the shadow leader take a mortal child into his home warren wondered because shes the granddaughter of his most hated enemy i dont know zoe lied keeping her eyes downcast weaving the wide straw shed made warren stop for at the crafts store on the long walk back to the inn that afternoon hed raised a brow but hadnt asked her why pretending not to care who knew maybe he really didnt by now she shrugged off the weight of his gaze and let them debate the pros and cons of risking their lives for one mortal child keeping her hands moving in an even toandfro like she had nothing vested in the outcome shed already made up her mind so the particulars of their actions interested but wouldnt affect her whatever youre doing warren said suddenly its not going to work her lips curvedleave it to him to know she wasnt merely weavingbut she didnt stop instead she said did you know another name for the cornucopia is the horn of plenty in the past people would fill it up with fruit nuts and seasonal vegetables and offer it as a blessing when visiting a neighbors home zoe he sang her name turning it into a long warning she went on not looking up but before that tradition it was a part of the ancient harvest festivals see bringing in the harvest meant stripping the land bare which left the spirit that lived amongst the crop homeless a corn dollyor idol as it was more popularly knownwould act as spirits receptacle for the winter until the idol could be furrowed under again at the start of the new season yet in greek mythology it was a goats horn and had the power to give its possessor whatever she wished for how convenient that it was now associated with thanksgiving a holidayor holy daythat the tulpa considered one of the best an extremely superstitious being he believed celebrations like ceremonies gave shape to days and years of mortals making their actions nice and predictable as they clung to their rituals he used to say it kept them in their place and he loved it when events conformed to his expectations he banked on it of course zoe had already blown that expectation onceblown it like an abombso she wasnt expecting a joyous reunion and showing up on his doorstep on thanksgiving day was the least expected thing she could do but the more she thought about it the more she was sure it would work because though the design of the universe was intricate and mysterious nothing was left to accident here she thought she was powerless to influence anything of import due to her mortality but by weaving this basket herself by imbuing her work with her intent and passionate belief she was doing the one thing all humans had the power to do she was turning her deepest desires into reality after all wasnt that what the man who created the tulpa had done so all she had to do was believe in this task just as strongly as he had strong enough to bend the universe to her will and thats what she had specialized in when she was a troop member she thought gritting her teeth bending others to her will thanksgiving is an opportunity she murmured more to herself than the others now the holiday gives me an opening the tulpa will be fixed on gaining power from all the emotion associated with the holidayhope joy thankfulnessthings humans believe unerringly in hell never sense my true intent above all the emotional static its perfect and she fell back in to the rhythm of the weaving visualizing it now everything else secondary to what she wanted its not perfect warren broke in its suicide she didnt look up her fingers continued their smooth slideandweave and the basket began taking shape chin up warren at least this time youll know for sure what happened to me he dropped a strong palm over her hands stilling them youre not going hear me she remained still head bowed voice soft ive always heard you warren he removed his hand quickly then youll have no problem obeying when i order you to give up your star sign tonight i said i heard you she did look up now her voice cold as his i didnt say i listened and he knew that too warrens chin shot up and the eyes thatd once followed her every move with an earthy softness were now petrified in an equally unyielding face see that she doesnt leave this room even if you have to tie her down zoe returned to her weaving as the door slammed behind him oh zoe phaedre said running her hands through her rich hair on a sigh your plan was to show up on the shadow leaders doorstep on thanksgiving day clothed in mortality and bearing a gift cursed with ill intent zoe shrugged ignoring phaedres use of the past tense so it didnt sound like such a great plan when stated like that but she would still go through with it ill charm him into opening his door for me because if she could get inside get him alone for even a moment it would work getting in without getting killed might be more of a problem phaedre had turned her back ostensibly fixing her hair in the dresser mirror but zoe knew she was studying her except this time hell be on his guard hell sense an attack coming a mile away hell be expecting it from you hell drop that guard once he sees my humanity my vulnerability she said the words to convince herself as much as phaedre flipping the straw horn on her lap starting a new row everyone is always on their guard around him because hes the psycho kingpin of the paranormal underworld and he hates it she looked up to meet phaedres disbelieving stare through the mirrored pane he does its one of the reasons he loved me phaedre turned you werent on guard because youd already gained his confidence and so when i say i changed my mind and ran away from the agents of light hell believe ive been in hiding from you all these years not him hell believe what hes always wanted to when he looks at me phaedre leaned against the dresser crossing her arms and what is that that i love him she said setting the corn idol aside that were destined for one another zoe trust me phaedre she stood brushed off her pants and headed to the door warren had exited through the movement was quicker than the human eye so zoe found herself sprawled facedown across the bed without knowing how shed gotten there phaedre was straddling her so close zoe could scent the mint on her breath and the powder of her perfume pleasant were it not for the wand tip pointed at zoes throat warren said you stay phaedre murmured in her ear meaning the bodily assault wasnt anything personal zoe craned her neck to peer into phaedres face despite the risk of a fiery death and what the troop leader says goes right annoyance flickered behind phaedres jewelgreen eyes i understand it might grate zoe especially considering your former status but maybe its time you listened to someone other than yourself zoe dropped her head and lay limp knowing shed get up only whenifphaedre allowed it you want to put your conduit away its a bit of overkill phaedre shifted atop her but that was for her comfort not zoes she inched the wand closer to zoes left eye her favored point of insertion bother you does it make you nervous because the tulpa doesnt have a conduit you know he is a conduit a whole being through whom energy is conducted amassed multiplied thats why he can affect the weather move things with his mind manipulate environments andmost importantlyread your intentions i know all this zoe said testily she twisted again and this time phaedre got up letting her turn im the one who told the rest of you remember so then you also know that hes been working on the timespace continuum using special relativity to attempt to return to the past zoe pushed herself to her knees it was evident from her silence that she hadnt known so how had phaedre the manuals zoe guessed phaedre inclined her head hes conducting experiments gathering energy around him to return to the moment of his gravest betrayal when you zoe exposed his vulnerability thats not possible zoe whispered kneeling in the ratty bedspread mind whirling was it phaedre pursed her lips wryly as she rose and tucked her conduit back in her pocket zoe gave an inward sigh of relief he thinks theres only a finite amount of energy available on this earth in this valley in particular and since hes bound to las vegas and cant derive energy from outside this city hes working on creating more of it here storing it hoarding it if you will for himself and thats what hed use it on zoe asked noting she looked as bewildered in the opposing dresser mirror as she felt saving wyatt phaedre laughed humorlessly and shook her head hes not going back to save his creator zoe hes going back to kill you and even as zoes mind whirled with disbelief she knew it could be done anything was possible if the mind believed strongly enough and the tulpa possessed an iron mind hed need a tremendous amount of energy she murmured so how was he getting it what law of physics or powerful magicor bothwould enable him to contract time and alter the terrestrial setting phaedre shrugged we havent figured it out yet all i know is if you show up on his doorstep plain as day and clothed in mortal skin youll save him the trouble of having to find you in the recesses of time and youll die for nothing not nothing zoe thought standing because now she was more determined than ever to get her granddaughter back whatever the tulpa was doing and however he was deriving power she was sure it involved ashlyn i need to speak to warren zoe started then smiled grimly when phaedre took a warning step forward he can hold me down himself if hes so inclined it was phaedres turn to smirk he just might she said but motioned to the door the manuals phaedre had referred to recorded the battle between good and evil in the nevada desert as itd gone on for the past rnillennium in the mortal world the manuals were called comic books and were devoured by the young minds that lived the stories out in their imaginations and in turn gave energy to the agents and troops through their detailed daydreams and belief the connection between reader and agent was very much a partnership and without one the other would fail to thrive so everything zoe had doneboth accomplishments and defeatswas recorded in either the shadow manuals or the light depending on the sensitivity of the information there any knowledge that could give one side dominance over the other thus unbalancing the zodiac was omitted thats why zoes pregnancies hadnt been recorded on either side and why neither the tulpa nor warren knew where shed gone when she disappeared thus every agent had secrets they knew lay solely in their own minds and even the most senior troop members couldnt help but wonder about their allies lives as well as their enemies what wasnt being revealed so what exactly were the manuals omitting about zoe and her relationship with the angry stubborn man on the other side of that door well it wasnt the part about the bond theyd forged growing up as teens in the paranormal safehouse known as the sanctuary the bloom of their subsequent love affair around the time she was nineteen and he twentyfour was also welldocumentedmuch to their embarrassment at the timeas was the bloody coup thatd led to warrens meteoric rise in rank to become the youngest troop leader ever zoe had been pictured firmly by his side no the omissions began after all that when zoe herself had taken up her star sign and began to hunt the tulpa a task that would make her famous for her bravery singlemindedness and willingness to give up personal happiness in return for their enemys blood maybe what angered warren most wasnt that she turned her back on him in order to fulfill these duties but that the original assignment had been his idea hed ordered her into the tulpas lair and lifeand bedwith his blessing and in time it became his curse because the manuals did record how good she was at her job they showed in exacting detail how clearly the tulpa and later xavier fell for her ruse soon every small helpful important detail she brought back about the shadows plans and machinations were met by her troop leaders knowing and bitter sneer eventually zoe stopped coming back at all so the wedge between the two former lovers grew with time expanding with secrets until the girth that lay between them was too wide for either of them to attempt crossing and when zoe disappeared this final timeafter the daughter warren knew nothing about had been brutalized by the shadow aquarianshe hadnt even considered telling him why she was leaving where she was going or what she intended to do she didnt want to argue and besides she barely knew the answers herself all that mattered now was that joanna and olivia were safe shed given up her chi and her place in the troop to ensure it and now she would hunker in close by watchful as shed failed to be the first time and wait for the moment when joanna would rise up and stake her claim in the zodiac because zoes greatest secret wasnt merely omitted from the manuals it was the one the seer had told her never to utter not to warren not even aloud to herself her eldest daughter was both shadow and light and when she was ready and had overcome the tragedy that would shape her future she would be mightier than all of them put together so warren and zoe didnt have a love story that began with once upon a time and inevitably it wouldnt end with happily ever after either but zoe had a job to do and she was still enough of a heroine to see it through to the end are you ready to listen zoe began moving across warrens dim motel room hed stiffened as he sensed her presence but hadnt looked up from the paper he was pretending to read im ready to hear you touché thought zoe with a wry smile she crossed the dingy room to stand in front of his chair hearing was a start you need to let me do this why because i can because im the only one who can the holiday doesnt just give me an excuse its a powerful time the holy days join the old world beliefs with the new the possibilities that opens up are endless he lifted one shoulder unwilling to admit she was right christmas is coming up the troop can figure something out by then but zoe had to get ashlyn out of there now let me do this im already on the outside why risk the life of an active star sign when you have me ready to go in willingly why do you care so much about this one mortal child because im mortal she pounded her chest then clenched her fist at her side its all i have dont you see this life this skin the breath in my lungs its all that separates me from death and yet youre so willing to give it up warren said watching her now because thats what youre asking to do one foot on the tulpas doorstep and hell slay you where you stand because i betrayed his love she asked yes you havent killed me she pointed out because her betrayal of himtheir betrayal of each otherhad been greater and deeper than any ruse concocted to topple their enemies warren swallowed hard ive wished you dead and i you she said matteroffactly stepping closer warren opened his mouth but she put a finger to his lips and held it there its not the same thing and im willing to bet my life that the tulpa feels the same his face crumpled in on itself and he shook off her touch you would compare me to him i didnt mean that you said it which means you were thinking it and we both know its the thought that counts dont we thats what theyd told one another when she had returned to his arms his bed it was the thought that counted most it was the most powerful thing in the universe warren she began to protest but stopped what he said shortly youre right zoe said and the surprise that flashed across his face must have mirrored her own she laughed mirthlessly maybe i am toxic but i had to stop feeling anything for anyone in the time i was with the tulpa i couldnt just turn it back on when i returned to the sanctuary i had to close down because i needed to save a small place inside of me that was mine alone shed been a possession she remembered with a shudder shed belonged entirely to the tulpa sometimes i even forgot why i was therethat i was even or ever had been super she backed up and sank to the edge of the bed realizing for the first time that it was true shed disappeared into her role as the tulpas woman and instead of remembering that she had chosen to be therethat she could choose to leaveshed begun to feel small and weak like a shell with only the pretty memory of something vital living inside as for her idea of love well the tulpa had twisted that as well shed had to stop feeling real love at all just to survive it zoe looked up when she felt warrens weight drop down beside her whatever he took from you zoe you gave willingly you had to have seen and felt it happening so did you she said sharply wiping at her eyes and what was i supposed to do he shifted putting distance between them without really moving i couldnt contact you and even if i did i couldnt order your withdrawal nullifying all the years youd put in up to that point do you realize youve spent more accumulated years outside of the sanctuary than in it you grew up there but its not your home your home is your will and desire and what you want its all that matters its all that ever mattered she turned toward him and after a long moment lifted her tearstreaked face to his you mattered it wasnt what hed expected and he jerked back before he could stop himself she stayed him with a hand on his arm and when he didnt shake it offjust swallowed hard as he saw her intentshe shifted closer ran her hand up his shoulder to curl around his neck used the same smooth liquid motion she had before she was reduced to mortality to pinion around above and upon him the weak cradling the strong as a tear raced down his moonlit cheek you mattered she whispered again and wrapped her limbs around him so she wouldnt have to see it put her head on his chest and shut her eyes resting there until his arms finally came up to encircle her this she thought was home she sucked in a deep breath and scented only what her mortal nose would allow the menthol rub he used on his bad leg the fainter scent of his soap and beneath it all the warm earthy wisp of the man she loved she tilted her head pressing her lips against the first available patch of bare flesh that offered itself to her his biceps i missed this so she murmured voice muffled my arm his voice was softly teasing as it used to be shed missed that too she realized with a smile pulling away to peer into his face dry now doebrown eyes deep pools of softness in the moonlit room she knew that no placesanctuary safe house mansion or motelswas more linked in her mind with home than his arms she straightened her spine and pressed into him so that he sucked in a needy breath they were fused at hips her small breasts pressed against his wider chest and he tilted his jaw up to find her lips the need in that first kiss illuminated all the hard words between them showing them for what they really were smoke camouflage to protect the emotion they couldnt put to words the i love yous and i miss yous and mostly i cant not without you so they abandoned words for the tangible and zoe found shed been missing a lot more than just his arms warren lifted her and zoe didnt rail at him for manhandling her like she would have with anyone else she didnt fight to assert her own control over this lovemaking just to prove she could she just let herself be swept up and away because the weakening of her knees her limbs the numbing of her mind and thoughts had nothing to do with his otherworldly strength versus her muchhated humanity it was just warren loving zoe as he always had loving her she thought numbly as his mouth found hers and not what she could do what she had done and would do yet no this night was all about being cradled and cherished by the only man shed ever taken into her with no ulterior motive outside of giving as good as she got which is what she did now humanity hadnt stolen her agility and when he swung her to her back her legs whipped up and around his waist his response to grind against her was automatic as was the moan coaxed from his throat and into hers problem was she was still clothedthey both wereso many of the soft growls and needy whimpers that escaped them both in the next few seconds were driven in part by frustration the rest were spawned by sudden sensationsa palm cupped just there when her simple cotton shirt was finally lost a hunger emphasized by the bite above the breast a surprised laugh at the responding pinch and a slow melt into the heat of each others flesh as the rest of their clothes fell away zoe had dreamed of this moment and these sensations for too long to rush she arched against him whenever she got the chance but kept it light and unhurried just a caress of thighs a skimming of skin a slow glide from her belly to her thighs to show him she was already wet and ready for him that shed been ready for years now waiting even as duty had kept her away one didnt need supersenses to quantify need and zoe felt warren too straining to stay himself he slowed his hands to a languid caress even as the need to race along her sides made him shudder he tasted her with breathy and heated lipsnot just sampling but drinking her in like her skin was a sweet liquid and vital to his very existence this was what she missed most zoe thought as she eased over him blanketing him with her core lacing his limbs with hers it wasnt her lost strength or the vitality leached from her world with the stripping of her extrasensory abilities it was the union of mind body and spirit with a man whod known her so long understood her so well and frustrated her so completely zoe eased up warren shifted skimming hips and smiled as he slid home zoe swallowed hard she could swim in this liquid motion just let herself drift away as a body both outside and inside herself determined the beat of her steadfast heart she rocked feeling like she was mere driftwood on a vast open sea and the only thing keeping her from floating away entirely was the knowledge that their time together was finitethat the sun would rise and their bodies would part leaving behind slick thighs and an hollowness where he once resided zoe wiped at her eyes with the back of her hand on her way to caressing warrens cheek pulling him closer and deeper as she pushed the thoughts away she didnt want to swim in these feelings anyway she wanted to drown in them and that wasnt allowed zoe she pressed a finger to his lips knowing he sensed her pain she recalled the ability and the way emotions burning on the air he wanted to console her but words werent going to fix it and besides he felt the same way she saw it in his eyes felt it in his tensing fingers and the way he pulsed inside of her and that was comfort enough she smiled being as brave as the moment would allow and his image blurred beneath her the first tear fell as she refitted her body against his opening to him further and inviting the hard and the soft the warm and the wet and when they came together the tendons in his neck straining as he cried out below her zoe knew she wasnt just sating him she was completing him because duty aside zoe archer and warren clarke were simply made for one another and when she collapsed atop him the long smooth length of him still filling her warming her she knew that warren had come home as well later when he was as boneweary with the need for sleep as she warren wrapped his arms around her from behind spooning her body with his own youre wrong he finally whispered and she knew he would let her go zoe smiled bittersweetly as his hands warmed her breasts nuzzling back cocooning herself further safe for now if i am you wont need to ask me to relinquish my star sign again itll be someone elses for the taking a sigh hollowed out his body she turned in his arms because it felt like there were suddenly acres and canyons and miles between them and quickly drew close again but im not wrong i have prophesies and legacies and adventures left to fulfill she had a daughter a destiny and at the end of it all maybe she still had this man to come home to so she wouldnt fail she promised him that then pressed her lips to his trying to kiss away the worry that had returned to furrow his brow and if you do it was too practical a question for her liking she rose straddled him and he immediately fell silent while she shrugged the question away it didnt matter either way death was preferable to a life without meaning and for the first time since leaving the troop she had a purpose again that alone was worth giving thanks for so she held back the words he wanted to heari wont goonce again putting away any chance at personal happiness and merely smiled as dawn rose on a beautiful thanksgiving morning well see she told him flipping her hair back dropping her palms to his chest well see whos giving thanks by the days end chapter white was the symbol of holiness and purity in tibetan buddhism it represented prosperity too so it was no accident that the tulpas home was achromatic from rooftop to doorstep a blank slate against the sea of pastels and dusty stuccoes that otherwise dotted the valley floor it wasnt however an ivory tower the tulpa was reluctant to remove himself from the source of all his energy and strength human emotion particularly negative fueled him though most mortals steered clear of the soaring pale home without even knowing they were doing so even shadow agents didnt darken the doorway without invitation zoe had been the only agent of light to even get close enough to peer in a window and since her infiltration sixteen years earlier paranormal sensors and precautions had been added to further secure the place but as warren drove her to the drop point a block away she didnt worry about those she was mortal and the only monitor that would pick her up was attached to the security camera tucked high above the entrances alcove on the surface of it warren was right she hadnt seen the tulpa in sixteen years plenty of time for bitterness to crust over any soft feelings hed once held for her and she had no doubt his hatred had further cemented the emotion but no sense in worrying about that now instead her lips moved in an almost rhythmic chant as her fingers nimbly played over the cornucopia shed woven an observer might have thought she was praying but zoe archer knew too much of other worlds to put stock in any one deity and let her whispers spiral out into the universe as affirmation instead she had at one time been a fervent student of tibetan culture and lore studying the transitional realities called bardos learning the selfcontrol and discipline needed to succeed with tantric work including hours of meditative practices prostration and mantra recitation because thats what a man named wyatt neelson had done devoting fifteen years of his life to visualization in order to create a being so vivid real and evil that the thought form eventually morphed into reality and became the tulpa it was this beings arrival on the paranormal scene that upset the valleys metaphysical balance the tulpa sought influence over the mortal realmto control their thoughts and actions and dreamsand absolute dominance over the paranormal one the agents of light fought of course but theyd never faced a created adversary before and suddenly balance became a secondary concern survival was allconsuming the tulpa didnt age he couldnt be killednot even by the conduits that were so deadly to the agents on both sides of the zodiacand he assumed the physical form of whatever the person looking at him expected to see it was this that most worried zoe god forbid he look in a mirror while standing next to her and see the demonic monstrosity that still came for her in her dreams then hed know she was misleading him again and hed skin and flay and bury her with her bones outside her body heart still beating atop a living pile of flesh he knew how shed seen him do it before so while weaving her cornucopia zoe had focused her thoughts on the way hed once allowed himself to be vulnerable with her turning those tender moments into a new story for herself and a new past for them both she wove and thought and invented and wove until she had the minutest detail engraved upon her gray matter she memorized this new past and then began to believe it she believed the tulpa was as before that he loved her and would readily welcome her back she believed as before that she loved him as well and that she wanted nothing so much as to be in his arms once more she created this story as she created her giftwith focus and a studied and purposeful intentand by the time shed finished she knew she could walk into the tulpas house with complete confidence because thered been one chink in the tulpas impenetrable paranormal armor and zoe archer was it she was stepping from the car even before warren had come to a full stop and the crisp november air greeted her brightly as the morning sun hit her face it was easy to turn nostalgic on a day like this a holiday when one should be with family and friends feasting and giving heartfelt thanks for this lifes blessings she hugged her homemade cornucopia tight to her chest and its weight and scent and purpose grounded her giving her strength to push those wistful thoughts away leave them for the mortals who had use for such things she slammed the car door and had already begun walking away when she stopped they never said goodbye it was considered bad form indicating a deficit of confidence and was usually unnecessary but she didnt want to just walk away from warren not again not without at least some solid sense of closure so she backed up and waited until hed lowered the drivers side window then stared down into that face shed loved almost as long as shed breathed theres something you should know but i cant tell you she couldnt really tell him anything certainly not the truth its about the legend the rise of the kairos the woman who was both shadow and light and whose powers would forever tip the paranormal scale in favor of good or evil whichever she chose whichever her daughter joanna chose zoe squinted against the light as warren sat back studying her as carefully as she measured her words the kairos lives shes going to rise up in under your command watch and listen for her she doesnt know it yet but shes hurtling toward her destiny even now warren had fallen stockstill he was listening and hearing her now where zoe tell me how to find her she shook her head and quickly held up a hand staving off his protest shes in hiding warren even from herself you wont find her until her metamorphosis which is when that head shake again im sorry but thats all i can tell you she thought hed be mad start railing about lies and secrets trust and duty but he simply leaned back against the leather seat and squinted up at her in the sharp morning light he could see it out here she thought the veil between worlds was wide enough on this hopeful thankful day that her intentions were clear in the light and clearly light i didnt say it before he finally said admiration and yes love sharpening his words happy birthday zoe she gave him a wide smile then turned to face the long walk leading to the stark white house up the steps that were almost silvery in the brilliant sun where she casually rang the doorbell when it opened she said what shed been thinking her wish for warren a vow for the days work a final goodbye happy thanksgiving the woman who answered the door was named lindy maguire she was frumpy matronly favoring lace collars and long skirts and she was also the shadows leonine sign on the zodiac like all leos lindy was ruled by the sun and like most also ruled by the heart she had long ago set aside personal aspirations in order to remain as close as possible to the tulpa so it was natural that lindy was acting as vanguard for his home natural too that she hated zoe lindys delicate nostrils flared as she examined zoe scenting out humanity as she ran her eyes skeptically over the cream slacks and overcoat though she didnt place her until zoe opened her mouth damn lindy zoe said studying the womans beehive still stuck in the sixties i see recognition had barely flashed in lindys eyes before zoe found herself crushed against the wall blood welling in her mouth as she thought i used to be that fast but i hit harder uhuhuh zoe said shaking her head as much as she dared lindys conduit was outzoe hadnt seen her draw that eitherand the honed nail file was pressed against zoes larynx so that breathing was no longer the best way to stay alive zoe shifted her eyes to the camera trained on them from above dont want to ruin all his fun do we lindy cursed under her breath then let up but not before flicking the file just enough to draw blood zoe hissed at the flash of painit still surprised herand lindys frown turned upside down i must be dreaming because every sense i own tells me the mighty zoe archer is a mortal she wrinkled her nose as she said the word like it befouled the air around her and while she was gloating reveling in being the first to know and at holding her longtime foe at a distinct disadvantage zoe discreetly shifted her weight and plowed her fist into lindys already flat nose she probably felt no more pain than a pinch and the blood was only a trickle but lindys eyes watered as her nose mended itself shifting back into place with an audible crack zoe smirked and picked up her toppled cornucopia mortal doesnt mean pushover no it means walkedover just tell him im here zoe said curtly the house quaked like the hills of san francisco lindy grinned as she swayed he knows as it seemed did everyone else as zoe was escorted beyond the foyer and into the core of the house doors began to swing open she didnt make eye contact as speculative whispers turned to hissing and curiosity turned hostile instead she let her eyes stray over the shoulders of her enemiesraven was here she saw and polly and damian they leered at her as she passedbut she ignored them all and searched out the rooms she remembered and recognized by layout pretending to look for the tulpa there was neither anything resembling a nursery nor any sign of a child hed called these his drawing rooms when she was living here and she was surprised to find nothing had changed not even the furnishings even after zoes infiltration that first time even though he knew shed returned to the light and reported every secret detail of his lairand she knew them allhed stayed put arrogant bastard she thought as lindy smiled back at her from over one slim shoulder that arrogance would be his downfall she wiped away the thought like cleaning a slate in her mind imagination was what was needed to keep her alive through the day so instead of thinking that the tulpa was stupid as well as manipulative and cruel she thought of him as trusting and hopeful just waiting for the day zoe would return to him ill take that lindy said holding out her hands for the cornucopia once theyd reached the end of the hallway it was an unnecessary precaution nothing on the physical plane could injure the tulpa but lindy wasnt about to release zoe without letting her know she wasnt trusted zoe almost thanked her it was a good reminder after the relative ease of the entry its a gift zoe said lightly and its not for you lindy couldve easily wrested the cornucopia from zoes grasp instead she reached out and deliberately plucked the finishing piece a sugared plum from atop the carefully arranged mound leaving a hole where the fruit had been she bit into it without breaking eye contact and juice ran down her chin as her mouth curved upward attractive zoe commented dryly and the manuals still speculate why youve no heir to your star sign or prospect of spawning one lindys expression snapped anger pulling it tight at the center but she didnt use the fist clenched at her side and she didnt tear the cornucopia from zoes hands security tapes had shown zoe entering with the piece if she didnt walk in with it now the tulpa would wonder why and if there was a weapon hidden in the cheerful basket hed want to shove it down her throat himself there was a pedestal perched next to the door one that had once held a fern but now sported a bloodred scripture box with twin dragons on each wooden side a lone bright spot in the long bare hallway that was one difference zoe thought she hadnt seen any living thingplants animals humansin the house because shadows didnt count she thought as lindy slid open the boxs ornate lid and pulled out a pair of goldrimmed aviator glasses put these on zoe screwed up her face im not going to meet the tulpa in glasses that make me look like im stuck in the eighties put them on lindy repeated her voice brittle zoe sighed shifted her gift to one arm and accepted the glasses her confused gaze winking up at her from the mirrored lenses why because i said so lindy rapped on the door twice with her knuckles and it immediately swung open to reveal a dim and deep interior it wouldnt have been intimidating if thered actually been someone manning the door lindy saw zoe hesitate and the cruel smile was back on her face have fun zoe wondered at the deliberate word choice but slid the glasses over her eyes like she hadnt noticed and smirked we always do zoe wouldve given her life just then to be able to smell the bilious jealousy she knew was seeping from the womans pores but the cursing and chattering behind them told her the other shadows did scent it knowing an impending riot when she saw one she stepped smoothly into the room and watched as the door swung shut on the demonic faces glaring at her from the hallway then the vacuum of silence was absolute the glasses accentuated the rooms dimness and zoe thought that was their purpose so she emptied her mind and tried not to let it unnerve her tried too not to think of all the empty space around her or how she could be cut down where she stood without even knowing the blow was corning she knew fear stank like something pickled and old and the tulpa fed on that fear zoe was determined to make him starve still she jumped when a movement flickered across from her freezing as she did swallowing hard she cradling the curved horn like it was a talisman that would ward off injury and took a step forward three beings across from her mirrored the movement none of them spoke babe she said using the same endearment she had all those years before no answer she stepped forward again the shadows across from her drew closer as well still silent she tilted her head and saw two of them imitate the movement cutting her eyes to the third she realized that figure also clad in owlish lenses had as well she lifted her hand as if in greeting and they did the same mirrors a relieved sigh scuttled from her throat but caught when a wispy shadow rose up behind her kept rising in a tower of smoke that burned even in her mortal nose and was tripled before her eyes she froze as it suddenly retracted leaving vaporous tendrils to dissipate in the air as it solidified over her right shoulder like ash caught in a mold even as she strained through the dark glasses to make out his features she knew she was the one creating them expectation and memory joining forces to construct the man she remembered like an architect building a house from the bones up he wasnt much taller than she and slighter than one would expect of a man of great power his hair was a sandy colornot quite brown but not blond eitherand he had deep hazel eyes like the moss of a clouded swamp with a wide face and full lips he couldnt be called unattractive and that was no accident zoe remembered thinking that if she had to bed down with unadulterated evil he could at least be goodlooking once hed fully materialized he slipped his arm over her shoulder around her neck his fingers coming to rest on her opposite arm he squeezed lightly pulling in tight to whisper in her ear darling he said his endearment for her returned his voice was raspy pure male and honed but his embrace wasnt as cold as she remembered his breath not as septic sour and though zoe knew it was only because her senses were blunted with mortality it made it easier to ignore the rot she knew lay ready to engulf her if not for the fragile membrane of his skin before shed been able to scent out festering venom and bacteria and at the end shed even begun to expect infection like she too was contaminated even though she was super but now she could anticipate nothing about him including this unexpected welcome realigning her thoughtsand zoe was a pro at thatshe let go of the knowledge that he could kill her with a swift snap of those gentle fingers or crack her like a walnut between the lever of his strong arm and body and turned into him instead the sigh that flew from her body was one of relief not fear her arms clung to him with gratitude not entreaty and she lifted her lips to his icy ones as shed done countless times all those years past to utter her heartfelt lie i knew youd allow me to return he pulled away to study her face taking in the changes since hed last seen herfew as shed aged wellthough he studied her eyes in particular no not her eyes she realized his reflection in her glasses her thoughts as they materialized on his face so she let memories wash over her easy now that she was seeing and scenting and touching him again and his features sharpened further his brow grew in smooth the whorls of his earlobes became delicate and defined she thought she saw his eyes flash dark but his expression brightened as the room did degree by degree until they were standing face to face in a room of reflected angles and light have fun lindy had said and now zoe knew why this was the one room in the house that had undergone a complete renovation and it was why he hadnt needed to move herein the place thatd once been the tulpas bedroom where zoe had lied time after time and betrayed him the night shed gone to kill his creatorhed built a funhouse fullsized mirrors to reflect a true picture of the inhabitants intent reflect it upon and for him it explained why no one had accompanied her inside it was harder for the tulpa to solidify when multiple people projected their expectations upon him and it was uncomfortable for him to exist under the weight of too many peoples expectations at oncehed actually feel himself mutating and changing under their conflicting emotions so only the person he was most interested in reading could initially face him directly now that he had fully solidified the others could come in pick up on it without risking influencing the image or causing any embarrassing mutation but she hoped they wouldnt she had a better chance of convincing him to spare her life if they remained alone so they stood as a couple reflected back on themselves in dozens of shapes sizes and angles so that not an inch was omitted or hidden from his sight you are the most clever man she said letting her realization play out on her face as she caught his eye through one of the mirrors and smiled seductively in addition to being the most handsome of course she whirled back toward him intending to draw him closer again god how ive missed you he caught her arms stopping her shortagain gentlyand held her in place it was something zoe had forgotten he didnt move from one position to another he glided and that wasnt something she had to imagine he had the ability all on his own oh ive missed you as well zoe he said smiling back she shut her eyes and held her breath as panic threatened to thread through her veins she let him sense her uncertainty it was only natural for her to question whether itd been a good idea to come here so she let him feel that hesitancy as well when she opened her eyes again he was staring over her shoulder at his mirrored self waiting to see what emerged but there was only the tulpa as shed always seen him and she suddenly felt like shed never been gone or escaped him at all please baby you have to let me explain explain why you betrayed me he murmured now that shed spoken of it only explain how i managed not to she replied and willed him to believe her with eyes voice her mind he must have felt it because after a moment he appeared to soften and is this a peace offering he asked eyes flicking down to the cornucopia she still held a small smile lifted one corner of her mouth merely a centerpiece for your holiday celebration i remember how you enjoyed thanksgiving he had it was his favorite holy day then you plan on staying for dinner she lifted her free hand and removed her glasses raising her head to gaze directly into the cold black depths of eyes shed never thought to see again i was hoping she said softly he nodded after a moment good then over dinner you can offer your explanation to us all and he glided to the door to usher in his sycophants movements impossibly smooth and entirely too quiet for zoes liking chapter dinner was held in the same mirrored room the hollowed out center suddenly taken up with an elongated black marble table the cornucopia zoe had made centered like a bullseye a gleaming table setting of mirrored plates china and crystal winked in the studded light of two shining candelabras the tulpa could now see himself above below and in the mirrored glasses of his half dozen guests hed become even more of a control freak since zoes hard betrayal which she understood ignoring the fact that he was the epitome of everything she despisedthat he was the coldest hardest heartache in this worldshe instead pitied that he felt the need for it and grieved for the suspicion thinning his lips she sorrowed mostly that shed been the one to put it there her eyes teared as she thought of the pain shed caused and she discreetly wiped them away behind the mirrored frame of her borrowed glasses donned again like everyone else at the table across from her lindy glared at her from behind her own much cooler lenses zoe ignored her as well as the disbelieving snort from the shadow seated to her right as he scented her emotion there was another man she didnt know leering at her from her left and two other favored agents flanking lindy but zoe didnt try to engage any of them in conversation they took their clues from the tulpa and even though homicide lived in their mirrored faces theyd stay their hands as long as he did fruit damian offered plucking an apple from the cornucopia zoe swallowed hard hands shaking slightly as she cut through white meat its decorative zoe informed him i didnt mean for it to be he took a bit of the crisp skin his thin lips littered with sugar eaten she finished on a sigh she looked to the tulpa for support but he was busy watching himself in his mirrored wineglass he wouldnt let them injure her yet but hed let them have their fun choose one then it doesnt matter to me really then it doesnt matter to me either he lifted the entire basket and deposited it in front of her so that a few nuts rolled loose you choose zoe considered before gingerly choosing a ripe pear scooping up the loosened nuts and depositing those on her plate as well then she set to righting the cornucopia making it look as ornateif less stackedas before damian snickered and immediately yanked free a grape bunch before passing it around the table so the others could do the same zoe pursed her lips but said nothing the tulpa had steepled his fingers observing them all over the top like an amused parent watching his children at play zoe decided to begin you care nothing about thisor mei see on the contrary darling time hasnt lessened my feelings for you it strengthened them lindy popped a handful of berries in her mouth snickering and mine for you zoe said softly looking down pushing a walnut across her plate with her index finger then why hide from him she glanced up to find the man directly across from her leaning in feigning interest licking his lips wasp thin he reminded zoe of a snake that tongue seemingly testing the air tasting it honing in on her his grandmother had been one of zoes first victims after she ascended to her star sign his name was ajax he was the new shadow virgo zoe leaned back and blotted her lips with her napkin i wasnt hiding from him or any of you i was hiding from them everyone looked toward the tulpa zoe waited sixteen years was a long time to have hidden from both sides of the zodiac but she willed him to believe it willed them all the tulpa stared blankfaced before motioning for her to continue so she told them the story shed rehearsed the past shed invented the history she now believed passing it along so they would believe it as well it was true that zoe had killed the tulpas creator wyatt neelson but her intent she said wasnt to destroy the tulpa but to strengthen him do you remember the way we spoke of him she asked stopping to address the tulpa as the others listened carefully about the way he clung to you even after you broke free of him to assert your independence you said he was dead weight like a stone attached to the string of a kite that would otherwise sail free so you decided to sever that weight yourself no zoe shook her head i went to convince him to give you a name the tulpa froze and silence settled heavily over the table because even though wyatt had visualized the tulpa so completely to construct a fully developed consciousness hed refused to give the tulpa a name there was power in a name it was why adam named all the earths creatures in the bible giving himself power over all of them why in jewish tradition a childs intended name wasnt revealed until after they were born it was why cultures all over the world were superstitious about sharing names and why all parents chose their offsprings names so very carefully and it was why the tulpa desired one so very badly zoe reminded him of that now youd refused to see him for months and that had taken its toll on his psyche he was unkempt mumbling like a crazy man about abandonment and having nothing to show for his lifes work when i told him what i wanted that we even had a name picked out here the others looked back and forth between them curiosity stark on their faces but zoe continued on blithely well he only laughed then spat at my feet it angered me she bit her lip and the tears welled i snapped i told him i was the most important person in your life now not him that he may have created you but i was also supernatural and that we were creating something new between us thats when he lunged she swallowed hard drawing a shaky hand across her brow before letting it drop her voice fell to a whisper i dont know i guess id begun to think of him as one of us as having powers being able to detect intent plus i was furious with him for his crazed rebuff i swear it was only meant to be a slap but it was enough to kill him and to reveal that id once been light i knew once you found my psychic imprint on the kill spot that youd be so enraged youd never hear me through so i fled zoe stared at her hands like she couldnt believe shed done it and the others studied herand the tulpafrom behind their safe shining lenses the tulpa continued watching his own reflection and waited for zoe to finally look up so it was all an accident she nodded eyes trained on his toocalm face like he wasnt listening though zoe knew he heard every word all syllables every breath drawn in between and all these years ive been wracking my brain trying to think of a way to return to you and prove itd been unintentional i needed an excuse that the agents of light would fall for or a mission that would bring me back into your arms then i realized youd never believe me not if i showed up here as before with power ability light we dont believe you now said one of the others zoes frustration showed even from behind the dark glasses why would i lie why would i walk right up and ring the doorbell if i didnt want this more than anything in the world it is a conundrum the tulpa finally said voice still too gentle which meant he was indulging her out of curiosity she took a bite of turkey and felt it catch in her throat but curiosity was a good start she told herself swallowing curiosity could be turned into concern concern into desire zoe shrugged one shoulder and hugged herself i finally decided the only way to convince you of my sincerity was to come to you on this your favorite holy day when mortal observance and emotions could be tapped and channeled for your benefit and strength if you use that power youll see im telling the truth ive returned to you out of love i miss you i just want to come home she held up her hand when two of the shadows opened their mouths to speak but i also knew that wasnt enough i had to prove myself lose something irreplaceable as i caused you to lose the creator it took me a year to get up the nerve to actually do it but ive shed it all for youmy past my chi my near immortality i come to you with a basket of fruit to commemorate this holy day of bounty thanks and forgiveness and i come to you only as a woman it was all she had and it was the truth the tulpa leaned back lifting his cup and finally smiled lindys head swiveled back and forth between them her confusion and growing anger magnified on every mirrored surface bullshit zoes eyes never left the tulpas face longing and hope naked on her own just a little clue lindy if youve had fifteen years to seduce this man and still havent made it into his bed chances are its not going to happen lindy was fast but the tulpa was faster a flick of the wrist and another mirror sprang up in front of zoe halting lindys lunge with a resounding crack she grunted and fell back into her seat and the mirrorall the warning shed getdisappeared returned with a womans weapons too i see the tulpa murmured zoe looked at lindy who was straightening her glasses her hands were shaking now theyre all i have ill be damned if i die without them you may be damned yet shut up ajax the tulpa finally took a bite from his own plate continuing while he chewed you werent here before so you dont know but zoe and i have always had a strong bond opposites attract she agreed before sadness again overtook her face though it seems that too has changed like you again he checked his reflection in the mirror studying what zoe had created there i look exactly like before i mean on the inside i dont need extrasensory power to see youre holding back and do you blame me i understand it she said shaking her head but i regret it all the same oh for fucks sake lindy halfrose from her chair but the tulpa held up a hand her mouth snapped shut the words scuttling off into a growl zoe held back the smile that wanted to visit her face still she knew they all could sense her satisfaction it didnt bother her and it didnt seem to bother the tulpa either he pushed back his chair and stood walk with me he said holding out his hand the others stood only zoe they floundered looking around at one another sir please shut up lindy triumph thrilled through zoe warming her so thoroughly she didnt even feel the chill of the tulpas palm in her own she smiled up at him let him gaze into her glasses to see himself as she saw himhandsome healthy hersand they exited the mirror room alone zoe took it as a very good sign it was three in the afternoon when the tulpa escorted zoe from his mirrored room and a part of her was aware and surprised that shed lived that long trapped in a house with supernatural enemies who could snap her neck as easily as she had wyatt neelsons shed expected the high drama of her returnin whatever way it played outto have climaxed by now instead shed gotten to explain herself have dinner and was now taking a promenade around the grounds she was so in she linked her arm in the tulpas squeezing lightly thinking this might just be her best thanksgiving yet then she saw the boy he couldnt have been more than seven and he rounded the corner struggling with all his might against the hold of two women in long dark robes their eyes as large as silver dollars and completely overtaken by blackened pupils their appearance however wasnt what made zoes heart stutter they were ward mothers of the shadow children charged with raising and schooling the shadow initiates until they metamorphosized into fullfledged agents and zoed seen them before but this was no initiate it was a mortal child with fat tears rolling down his cheeks and fear etched on his face he caught sight of zoe probably the only normal person hed seen in this gloomy mausoleum and lunged for her help me please i want to go home i want my mommy zoe had to force herself not to run to him as one of the ward mothers knelt in front of him her blackened eyes drawing a scream from deep within his tiny chest now now lets behave you dont want to scare the other children do you others zoe said before she could stop herself the tulpa only put one finger to his mouth shushing her put this on and you wont be afraid anymore the ward mother said pulling a wooden mask from behind her back and slipping it over his eyes zoe had seen masks like this before countless himalayan artifacts such as these adorned the tulpas living areas creations of that regions animist tribes it made sense that the tulpa cherished objects created by people who believed souls inhabited ordinary objects as well as animate beings but why put a middle hills tribal mask on a living mortal child well the boy immediately calmed zoe saw and why not he could no longer see the woman looming over him with no eyelids no tear ducts no reason or inclination to blink if he had hed see her looking up as she knelt before him nodding once her partner nodded back then in one swift motion slammed her palms on the sides of the childs head like a school marm boxing the ears of a naughty pupil zoe jolted but the boy didnt cry out instead he immediately stiffened and fell unnaturally silent then the mask appeared to begin melting thinning out like the finest leather until it molded itself to the childs face encasing it fully from forehead to chin the ward mother rose and for the first time acknowledged the tulpa a new recruit she said serenely as they steered the nowdocile child to the left and disappeared behind a pair of great oak doors which shut with a sharp click youre distressed the tulpa said patting zoes arm and drawing her closer she nodded stiffly and fought for control im just confused that boy was mortal wasnt he at the tulpas nod zoe tried for a lighter tone youve never allowed mortals in your home before and what was the mask for would you like to see the tulpa replied motioning to the door she didnt she knew that much she wanted to run from whatever was being done to that child behind those doors but she thought of her granddaughter and nodded instead its fitting that you should see this today on thanksgiving he told her before throwing open the great doors and spreading his arms wide because this is my first harvest and its a bumper crop if i do say so myself they were lined on the floor in rows of five wearing dark brown robes in the fashion of the ward mothers each masked like the first boy uniform but for their heights they were all children and from size alone zoe guessed their ages fell between three and ten except for those along the wall where another unblinking ward mother stood guard there cribs were lined up for the smallest of them zoe aware of the weight of the tulpas stare on her face tore her eyes away i dont understand but she was beginning to the horror of it was slowly sinking in as she watched a ward mother read to the silent unmoving children from the shadow manuals introducing the mythos and lore of the paranormal world into impressionable young minds encased in living wood zoe pocketed her shades bent and passed her hand in front of the child nearest her the girl didnt move thats when zoe saw the tiny pins anchoring the mask in place there was a slot next to the temple where a perfume vial was cradled halffull zoe swallowed hard not just a mask to keep out the light then or one that merely limited expression it was shackled to their skulls and the drug did the same to their minds because children she thought as she straightened should never be this unnaturally still and silent its simple really the tulpa was already explaining its childrens belief in us and our mythology that grants us the energy to battle the light problem is children grow up they become adults and stop believing in comic books star signs me so i came up with the idea of harnessing their minds and of harvesting all that potential energy and intelligence and natural curiosity they think solely of the shadows they study our history they worship me zoe couldnt help herself despite her mortal senses she suddenly recalled the smell and taste and touch of this creatures festering spirit her thanksgiving dinner spoiled in her stomach so theyre your slaves theyre my family he corrected smoothly and the babies she asked her eyes instinctively searching out ashlyn in one of the cradles at least they had no idea she was a child of the light theyd merely stolen her because the opportunity presented itself as theyd stolen all these children from their families surely theyre too young to contribute oh no theyve the most concentrated chi of all the tulpa smiled id take them from the womb if i could zoe was glad they were no longer in the mirrored room because for one moment his image flickered and the skeleton that flashed from beneath his skin wasnt human it was scorched bone tooth fang and the invisible power that reared up from the bowels of midnight zoe quickly realigned her thoughts glancing around to make sure none of the ward mothers had noticed the tulpa oblivious went on think how devoted the mind would be if we could form specific neural pathways and manipulate a persons thoughts from birth on my children he said arms again wide will make wyatts mind look like a shrunken head and that was how he planned on manipulating time using the chi of dozens of young trained minds he would bend natural law and make reality conform to his wishes why not stranger things had happened but how do you keep them so docile zoe asked playing dumb as the tulpa motioned her to the front of the classroom we limit their choices and experiences he grinned as he whirled to face her and we provide examples of what happens to those who attempt treachery the tulpas grin dropped along with the floor beneath zoe she yelped freefalling and above her the previously mute children let out a collective cheer somehow the evidence of health and life didnt warm her chapter the drop was short and she hit solid concrete unsettling enough dust to have her coughing in the complete dark her first hint that she wasnt alone was the threatening growl that came from her left as if she didnt already feel threatened enough she swung around as an insistent whine and heavy panting emerged closer to her right wardens fear reared instinctively the animals sensed it and the whining strengthened but fear can still be attributed to my humanity zoe thought whirling blindly again who wouldnt be afraid trapped in a dark underground pound uh babe she tried revealing her fear and alltoohuman nerves in the shake of her voice still alive then the tulpa asked casually from directly above zoe looked up and saw his slim outline blocking the dim light from the childrens classroom the question was telling it meant he hadnt expected her to be she felt a sniffling along her arm a wet nose then the tentative lick of a very large tongue the shadow wardens were dogs paranormal pets that could scent out enemy agents and rip them apart in seconds they were the only things other than conduits that could actually kill an agent well thought zoe looking up again conduits wardens and the tulpa clearly but and this is just a wild guess i take it you have some other questions for me i have one then his voice was in her ear who the fuck do you think you are and one after another four giant spotlights boomed to life flooding the cave with light so bright zoe had to cover her face the wardens whimpered their claws scratching as they scampered blindly away zoe fished for the shades shed dropped in her pocket and slipped them back on her eyes still teared as the light assaulted her from beyond the lenses but she could finally make out the perimeter of the room and it chilled her to the bone it was a stupa a building in the tibetan tradition meant to honor buddha the tulpa had always meant to build one but his hed said would be dedicated solely to himself zoe had researched the subject when shed lived with him so she knew there were three types of stupas ones to commemorate events or occasions in buddhasor in this case the tulpaslife ones erected to gain favor but those were generally small and this was anything but finally there were those used for the burial of relics from a funeral pyre zoe felt the grit caked beneath her fingernails from her abrupt landing and swallowed hard yep she thought looking up the room was coneshaped indicating solar worship there was also an altar to her right and while most burial stupas held vessels containing the bones and ashes from a crematorial fire zoe didnt look for them the entire room was the vessel all that was missing was fire i mean you must think im stupid he went on voice circling her like a vulture from above he was circumambulating walking in a clockwise direction reflecting the movement of the sun and rotating planets zoe fought back the whimper that wanted to come i have to admit you caught me by surprise just waltzing up and knocking on the door that way that was a stroke of brilliance as was the way youve obviously clothed yourself in humanity but it only means youre that much easier to break ill have to be careful if i want our time together to last she wrapped her arms around her middle so you dont believe me the understatement of the year believe that you went to my creator intending to free me to name me outrage made his voice shake but his outline above had gone unnaturally still no zoe i know you went there believing that his life and death was linked to my own she jerked her head but youd broken free of him you already had enough consciousness and ability to rule the mortal and supernatural plane i knew that so why risk killing the creator only to leave behind my signature scent you didnt know you expected me to weaken and die he paused and his exhale rolled over zoe pushing her hair back from her shoulders and you never loved me sweat broke on zoes forehead though only part of it had to do with nerves then what am i doing here now three of the spotlights powered down and his voice was again in her ear thats what i intend to find out zoe whirled but he wasnt next to her he was across the ashstrewn chamber outline obscured but eyes glowing red why cant you just believe me she asked him shaking her head because look at me he bellowed i look exactly as i did before you have created me in the same image even the same fucking clothing which means your intentions are the same as well but you will die for your betrayal this time and your death will benefit me and as the temperature suddenly soared in the spherical chamber she knew there was no way to sway him hed sought a way to get to her for too long now and shed just walked in and given it to him zoe lowered her head bit her lip then slowly lifted the glasses from her face she looked at them for a long moment then threw them to the ground in front of her when she looked up her face was resolute slowly she began to walk toward him the mirrored lenses splintering beneath her heel i gave it all up my chi my place my legend and legacy among the star signs of zodiac she swiped a damp tendril of hair from her forehead as she came to a stop in front of him she ignored his blatant anger as he ignored the bitterness coating her words and reached out to take his icy hands in hers they felt wonderfully cool in her sweaty palms and she lifted them gently and dropped them around her neck like an executioners noose she shrugged in the confused silence what is my life in comparison take it as i took wyatts because i no longer want anything to do with this world if i dont also have your love for a moment his face remained impassive a blank slate she thought he was making her wait prolonging the moment making her suffer but then that petrified stare twisted first with fury then anguish and finally a wild and open need those icy fingers splayed wide bracing her from her hairline to the base of her sweaty neck slipped lower to her collarbone beneath her shirt rising to grasp her damp shoulders he pulled her to him so quickly she lost her breath and continued to fight for air as his icy lips found her heated ones cold tongue probing in her warm mouth she managed one great inhale of that icy breath and it shot through her like quicksilver freezing her lungs and then she was kissing him back pouring heat into him both of them fighting for balance and equilibrium they clung to one another the same way they both clung to life with a greedy and selfcentered zeal a perfect match in that respect when zoe finally opened her eyes again she gasped aloud there was the man she loved it was warrens face she caressed the homeless mien shed seen most recently his cheeks were the ones she lovingly ran her smoothtipped fingers over catching on the stubble curving at the jaw they were his lips that her eyes caught upon and his adams apple bobbing under the weight of her gaze it was warren alone that she saw even as soulless black eyes flared beneath the bones you do love me she told him her whisper choked with tears and truth and i love you and living without that love is a far worse fate than any momentary pain i welcome death over the halflife ive been living ill burn and ill do it with your name on my lips the warrenface winced and my bed he rasped the tulpas icy breath blowing her hair back again from her shoulders it felt like a welcoming spring breeze do you return there willingly as well not just willingly she whispered back her eyes drinking him in as her hands moved lower desperately she didnt add that shed have to be desperate to return to him at all he had immediately turned and she was too busy following and reimagining him erasing warrens image before anyone else caught sight of him and too busy wiping away her tears if only shed said those words to warren while shed still had the chance it was only after shed already gone through with the unthinkable allowing him on top of her and inside of her as she had all those years agothat he wanted to talk zoe was huddled beneath the covers shivering with cold from her core on out though she told the tulpa it had to do with relief and because shed barely touched her food earlier so he brought the cornucopia shed made to their bed the gesture showing zoe how much he wanted to trust her again the sentiment made her smile wobbly and moistened her eyes he was like one of the children he stole off the streets curious and hopeful and so very gullible the timing is curious though he was saying as he popped a ripened fig into his mouth he was propped up beside her on his elbow as she lay with her dark hair splayed on his pillow her image reflected back at herself from above it turned out it wasnt only his reflection he liked to watch in the mirror whats curious about wanting to be with the one you love on the holidays zoe said running a hand along the fine hairs of his arm he fed her a bloodred berry approval in his eyes as he watched her eat and she nibbled lightly on his fingertips its a time to be with family i wanted to come home i dont mean that he smiled down at her looking infinitely younger i mean that after years of no word or sighting of you you pop up after reports of your capture and death she had no idea what had been reported back to him so kept her response deliberately vague i told you ive been trying to find a way back to you for a long time now if ive been sighted lately its because ive been working toward that toward this he almost grinned as she continued to stroke him but shook his head not a sighting of you not like this reports had you posing as a young girl who was caught and killed in the desert they thought shed been posing as joanna zoe realized and almost shuddered at the easy way he spoke of her death and did you believe them oh no i knew you were still alive i felt it in my mind and core no matter what joaquin said joaquin she repeated committing the name to memory the tulpa mistook her silence for confusion hes always been one for hyperbole then youve reprimanded him she asked hopefully oh yes he knows how i love children and the reminder was all she needed to shore up her nerve fruit she asked sweetly holding out an apple he smiled down at her and took it willingly zoe watched him bite into it imagined it as the juiciest and sweetest fruit hed ever tasted the crisp skin smooth against his tongue the juice trickling down his throat she put all her energy into envisioning this as she watched his eyes flutter halfshut as he swallowed and she rose up to her elbows placing the cornucopiathe horn of plentyon his belly as he reclined trancelike the scent of ripe fruit rising to permeate the air he came back to himself slowly so that by the time he realized what was happening it was too late the cornucopia was once again a tool of the greeks the pagan farmers a tool of zoes will melding with the traditions of the past the wicker unraveled as those ancient powers merged and the straw was once again a living thing slipping around the tulpas body burrowing through the bed and deep into the earth the growth was slow at first but it sped up as zoes excitement soared and the tulpas spirit was enslaved in the narrow tip of the horn his eyes flew open black searing to red only to be snuffed by zoes power she smiled closedmouthed then rosefruit and nuts pomegranates and gourds peppers and artichokes all spilling over the bed and floor each grew stems and spines and burrowed into the earth both rising and falling vines weaving among themselves to bind the tulpa where he lay zoe knew the fruit hed already eaten was doing the same to his insides and smiled again feeling his eyes follow her as she dressed when she was done she turned the tulpas throat worked visibly paining him but he managed a deep breath even as an emerging leaf shot from his mouth but youre mortal zoe brushed the remains of someone elses ash from the crease in her slacks you forget what mortals are capable of tulpa dear we can use belief to create imagine wish and will things into being and those of us with extremely powerful minds believe anything is possible she leaned in close to whisper in his ear you asked me before who do you think you are but i never got to answer did i she licked her lips and despite himself the tulpas gaze flickered down before he drew it back to her eyes she smiled knowingly well im zoe archer dear the woman who can break you at will and the real questionyou nameless formless fuckis who the hell do you think you are his enraged howls were muffled as a miniature gourd spilled over his tongue im leaving now im going to bring in your socalled harvest and return those children where they belong but keep one thing very clear in your mind she flipped her hair back from her shoulders knowing she was planting another seed this one in his mind i can and will get to you again mortal or not on this plane or another anytime and anywhere dozens of images of her smirking saluted her as she turned to leave the room but before she did she glanced over her shoulder one last time oh and next time babe youd better have a castle and a moat because ill have learned how to kill you by then and i wont be stopped by a mere kiss and with that she strode out the door to find lindy slumped anchored against the wall by the woody growth of a cranberry vine the hard bitter fruit spilling like bright marbles from her mouth immobile her eyes alone followed zoe as she stooped to meet those hatefilled orbs youre lucky lindy the cornucopias powers wont hold you all long enough for me to both kill you and still get away she paused as relief played across lindys face then shrugged so ill just let the agents of light take care of that for me have fun lindys protests were berrychoked as zoe strode down the long silent hallway back to classroom where the children were now sleeping curled up in the same even rows theyd occupied before the ward mothers awoke when she entered stood in tandem but did nothing to stop her they werent warriors and that wasnt their job zoe wove through the children searched out the one she wanted and lifted her sleeping granddaughter from her crib hell find you you know one of the mothers spat he wont stop this time not until your blood runs like a river yeah zoe said drawing out the word as if considering it thats what you said the last time then she left the room and threw open the front door of the tulpas house chaos erupted behind her as the alarm sounded the house coming to life too late and a piercing whistle rang through the night as light descended on the mansion her former allies felt rather than seen rushed past her war cries pealing like bells in the cool air but zoe had already fought her battle she turned her back on it all and gratefully thankfully finally took her granddaughter home chapter she laid low for an entire week her cornucopias magic had held long enough for her to get away and since that was all she wantedand all she believed was possiblethe agents of light and shadow had fought yet another epic battle shed pick up a manual at one of the comic book shops later so she could get the cliff notes version of what went down but she already knew the tulpa had escaped with his life like him she could sense his existence in her marrow and knew she always would she didnt waste time regretting it though she was already plotting how to double back and give him the next time shed promised she might be mortal but the word that still summed up zoe archer best was singleminded the mccormicks paid daily visits to the facility the agents of light had set up just on the outskirts of town until ashlyn was strong enough to return home with them they had no problem forging the new identity papers micah had prepared for them and immediately put their home on the market as phaedre instructed they were still under the assumption that phaedre gregor and zoe worked for the government that ashlyn was at risk and needed to be placed in a witness protection program so they told no one where they were going and left no forwarding address but zoe knew it and she planned on keeping a close eye on them as she had the night the moving van came and they loaded up all their belongings she couldnt be there for her daughters any longer but she could at least watch over ashlyn but what she really needed to do was finally fully embrace her humanity there could be no more dipping into the paranormal world shed left behind no lamenting all shed lost in order for her to be a whole woman and a person who could act and move through the world with purpose she had to accept her limitations just like anyone else she had to release once and for all her knowledge of what went on beneath the veil separating this reality from the next but this time she would say goodbye so the following thursday found her pacing the walkway of an apartment building just one block from the guardian angel cathedral hands shoved deep in the pockets of her black slacks the collar of her winter coat turned up to shield her face from the whip of an angry wind the weather had turned suddenly and the streets were empty because of it zoe inhaled a deep breath of the biting wind and as she blew it back out she thought of the tulpa naked but for the vines and leaves canvassing his body like living entrails it was so satisfying even now that her laughter stilled her in her tracks you went blonde and even though shed been prepared for him zoe jumped warren grinned when she turned and you took a shower she said noting his smooth cheeks and shorn hair he was dressed like her in black his peacoat flapping open in the wind he motioned to a stairwell next to the apartment managers office and zoe ducked beneath it im trying on a new persona he said following her her eyes traveled down his long body respectable businessman what do you think i like you better as a bum i could track you down even with this poor mortal nose plus it keeps the girls away his smile was fleeting he knew she was saying goodbye and do you think youll need to track me again i mean ill want to but you wont they didnt look at each other for a time and zoe knew he was considering every obstacle facing them and like her was unable to see any way around them the children she finally asked turning to him he nodded all freed returned to their homes and families theyll have nightmares of course but theyll outgrow them in time and therell be no permanent damage we also stole the masks the tulpa was using to control them he wont be able to do it again zoe thought of the young boy she saw wailing in the tulpas hallway good his home was burned to the ground warren said and she nodded to let him know shed heard he finally sighed so thats it zoe you can just walk away and leave it all behind leave me behind he was really saying zoe ran a hand through her shortened hair im not walking away warren everyday that im out here on my own im ensuring our troops legacy im carrying out a prophecy that will benefit us all warrens eyes fell shut why do i have to love a woman who always puts duty first she placed her palms on his cheeks and waited for him to look at her because if i didnt you wouldnt have loved me at all when he finally nodded she worked a wide ring off her finger you know what to do with this right he looked it over studying the grooves that gave way to hinges around the stone ill put it away for you or for the next archer are you sure you dont want to keep it though its all you have left to remind you of our world no zoe smiled bittersweetly thought of her daughters and granddaughter now safe and shook her head i have myself and before his eyes could glaze with pain before he could get out the words and thats all youve ever needed zoe exhaled the wistfulness she held in her soulthe sharp hunger shed been staving off since theyd made love and the despair shed felt in the tulpas stupa when she thought shed never lay eyes on this face again warrens mouth still opened but it stuttered and eventually closed as he inhaled deeply tasting of the air and of her and then he sighed she wished she could smell his feelings on the air too she wished she could bottle them and carry it apply it like perfume or a balm that would melt against her skin and seep into her pores so a part of him would always be with her warren scented this too and finally it was enough goodbye my phantom he whispered and though his face remained tightbrows drawn jaw clenchedhis eyes were suddenly wet and luminous and soft in the icy air zoe choked out a laugh at the shared pet name stolen from a superhero that didnt exist given to ones that did to anyone else it had always appeared to be just that a nickname but it was much more and it was an endearment shed never expected to hear again my phantom limb the ache that is you existing outside of me the pain of every moment spent apart the empty throbbing that remains behind and warren did leave after that in a movement too fast to catch with mortal eyes leaving zoe slumped against the stairwell wall scenting and seeing nothing in the cold december night then she stopped feeling sorry for herself then she straightened and turned her thoughts to the tulpa then she narrowed her eyes and considered what shed learned about the power of imagination if she was right what she was planning would take months seasons years itd take stubborn belief and the doggedness required of tibetan monks and all those mortals who most valued longterm goals but zoe had a purpose again and a plan and she was still alive she could suck in the cold air and blow it out again no worse for wear and as long as she could do that there was hope about the author after ten years with the tropicanas folies bergere vegas native vicki pettersson traded in her sequins for a laptop but she still knows all about what really happens behind the scenes in sin city her first two novels the scent of shadows and the taste of night were published in march and april
