opening atlantis harry turtledove part one new hastings i e dward radcliffe steered the st george toward le croisic soon he would take the fishing boat out into the atlantic after cod before he did though he needed salt or his cargo would spoil before he brought it back to england the marshes of guerande in southern brittany yielded the best salt in this part of the world that was what he wanted edward radcliffe though far from rich had never been one to settle for anything less than the best he was nearly fifty a big bull of a man with broad shoulders weathered red skin and a thick shock of hair going from yellow toward white because of the sun at least as much as because of the years two of his sons richard and henry were part of the little cogs crew they showed what edward had looked like before the years began to challenge him le croisic stood on a spit of land that stuck out three miles into the sea from the marshes as always ships from every land in the western part of the world crowded the waters around the port they all had different lines and rigging a lubber couldnt have told one from anotherbut then edward radcliffe neither knew nor cared about the various breeds of sheep he was however no lubber when he saw a basque boat he didnt think it came from ireland the french built different from the dutch and the english different from either endless variations on each themeyou know what he called from his place at the tiller ships are no more alike than women are a couple of the fishermen nodded more of the crew laughed at him weve got to take you into town and get you drunk father henry said youre thinking too much you need to salt down your brain everybody laughed at that even edward sharper than a vipers fang to have a snotnosed brat he said with a chilly wind driving them on from the northwest everybodys noseincluding his ownwas dripping snot henry stuck out his tongue like richard he was even bigger than their father and at the high spring of his strength rather than at the beginning of its autumn we need to go into town richard said more than half to himself he would have been a lubber if he could he didnt love the sea the way edward and henry did but he was a fishermans son and so he sailed with them the st george squeezed into a place at the quays just ahead of a basque boat the basques dark blocky fellows with eyebrows that ran straight across their foreheads with no break above the nose shouted what sounded like abuse in their peculiar language people said the devil himself couldnt learn it edward didnt know about that but he knew he couldntand besides english he could get along in dutch and french and not quite so well breton first things first he declared we get the salt we bring it back to the boat then we worry about everything else nobody told him no which only showed how much the crew respected him the fishermen were menthey wanted to gamble and drink and whore before they sailed off into the wild wet wasteland of the atlantic theyd already had a rough passage around cap finisterelands end the same name as the westernmost tip of cornwallto get here theyd earned relief and they would get itonce they did what needed doing master jean abrgall sold the best salt in le croisic the flower of salt he called itnone of the gray ordinary stuff mixed in hello you old thief radcliffe greeted him in breton when the fishermen came up to him abrgall spoke perfect french too but he preferred the tongue hed spoken since he was a baby yer mat gast saoz he replied in that tongue cheers whore of an englishman it meantsomething like that anyhow radcliffe bowed as if at a compliment abrgall gave him a thin smile the equivalent of another mans guffaw he went on so the sea serpents didnt bite you and the mermaids didnt drag you under eh not yet radcliffe said what have you got for me and how much will you gouge me for it not so much and itll cost you more than you want the salt merchant answered come have a glass of wine with me and well talk about it you want to get me drunk so you can cheat me easier edward radcliffe said unperturbed abrgall nodded radcliffe went on well seems only fair to give you a chance hows your family they are well god be praised abrgall crossed himself so did the fisherman they drank they ate a little salt codmaybe some of radcliffes but more likely from a breton fisherman both men knew about what the englishman would end up paying but how you got there was part of the game they swore at each other in several languages abrgall called radcliffe something in what had to be basque what does that mean radcliffe asked beats me abrgall admitted i never could make sense of that godcursed tongue but it sounds good doesnt it once the bargain was sealed with a handclasp radcliffe paid the salt merchant he and his men lugged crates of shining white crystals back to the st george dealing with jean you knew the quality would be there all the way to the bottom of each crate some dealers would put the cheap gray salt below hiding it with a layer of the pure flowers you learned the hard way not to spend your coin with people like that some fishermen never learned and so the bastards stayed in business all right edward said when the hauling job was done he was hot and sweaty as they were every little cut and scrape all over his body stung if you worked around salt that would happen to you now weve done the work now we can have a day of fun go back into town and drink and wench as you please ill stay with the boatshes mine after all no you go father henry said youre entitled to enjoy yourself once in a while ill stay i dont mind on such chances worlds turn edward and richard radcliffe walked into a dive called the salicornes along with a grape vine the place had a bunch of the stuff hanging above the door in english it was called samphire or glasswort in springtime its burgeoning growth turned the salt marshes purple the locals ate boiled fresh samphire in season and pickled it to eat when it wasnt fresh as far as edward was concerned the locals were welcome to it when he and his son went in the most ridiculous argument hed ever heard had almost reached the knifedrawing stage some breton fishermen and some basques were quarreling over what year it was they were doing it in french which neither side spoke wellbut neither spoke the other sides birthspeech at all its the basques shouted no by the virgin the bretons yelled back were you at sea so long your wits got soaked in salt and you lost a year picking his way through the chaos edward asked the tapman can i get myself a mug of red wine and what are you having son red wine will do for me too richard replied here you go friends said the fellow behind the counter dipping two mugs full he wanted nothing to do with the shouting fishermen but the radcliffes couldnt stay out of the quarrel so easily here are strangers who care nothing for any of us one of the basques said they will tell the truth and shame the devil its not so edwards hand dropped to near his gutting knife too not on it but near well now friend i dont mean to give offense but i do believe its a year later than you think the squarejawed basque looked as if that knife had gone into his guts the bretons whooped and cheered come drink with us truthful man they cried come eat with us too bide a moment edward said he set another coin on the counter and pointed to the basque fishermen give these lads a round of whatever they fancy and as much bread and cheese and salt meat as the silver will buy besides i have no quarrel with them and i want none he meant that basques were even worse than frenchmen for remembering feuds forever his gesture satisfied this table full of them anyway they rose one by one and bowed each with a hand over his heart edward andafter a nudge from himrichard bowed back then they could go over to the bretons without seeming to be on their side drink up said the man whod been loudest in inviting them to come if you bought for those basque buggers well buy for you do you know breton or just french i can have a go in your tongue edward answered and richard nodded they can they can the fishermen whooped in their own tongue also in breton the talky one said good to meet you by all the saints im francois kersauzon will you be giving me your names kersauzon is it ive heard of you friend edward said and introduced himself and richard if anyones done better in our backbreaking business i dont know who hed be ive been lucky kersauzon said sun and salt had feathered his coppery hair with gold strands he was slimmer than either radcliffe but had a fishermans broad shoulders and scarred callused hands lucky ill say more cod and bigger cod than anybody else brings back edward said im jealous i wont try to tell you any different plenty more where those came from too kersauzon said easily he wasnt drunk no but his tongue was loose in his mouth one of his crewmen tried to shush him but he didnt want to shush dont fret over it jacques plenty more yes is it the truth or is it even less than the truth the englishman gave the truth for uswe can give it for him kor ki du jacques answered edward hid a smile black dog shitjacques wasnt convinced radcliffe grabbed a stool from another table and brought it over to the one where kersauzon and his friends were sitting his son did the same the famous breton raised his mug your health yer mat edward said and drank with him the crooked smiles some of the fishermen wore told him he didnt speak breton all that well they didnt bother him he already knew it but he won points for making the effort here francois kersauzon said as you drink with us so you can eat with us too enjoy it he cut a slice of the taverns bread for edward and another for richard then as jacques squawked some more he started sawing away at the most remarkable joint of meat the englishman had ever seen it looked like a smoked and salted gooses drumstickexcept that it was larger than his own calf large enough to stretch almost from one side of the table to the other it was dark meat like goose it tasted a lot like goosebut edward thought not quite the same he knew he might be wrong goose he usually ate fresh and the smoking and salting could well have changed the flavor it was almost like eating goose ham good mighty good he talked with his mouth full richard busy eating nodded edward went on so along with all your big fat cod you went and killed the roc out there too he was only half joking hed always thought the roc was only a bird sailors told stories about hed always thought so aye but now he wondered wouldnt you need a bird the size of a roc to get a drumstick like this one kersauzon and one of the other bretons both said the same thing at the same time honnnk they pitched their voices as deep as they could almost deep enough to make the table vibrate all the fishermen from brittany even sour jacques laughed like loons well friend francois you know something i dont edward said before he could go on jacques said never thought id live to hear a saoz admit that a gallaou is worse francois kersauzon said an observation that surprised radcliffe not at all the bretons lived right next door to the french so of course they disliked them more than the english the channel kept edwards countrymen far enough away to seem less menacing than their nearer neighbors if it is the roc where did you find it and how did you keep it from sinking you edward persisted and if its not by our lady what is it will you pay me to hear the story will you pay me a third of your catch this year to hear it kersauzon asked he might have drunk a good deal but he wasnt too sloshed to be sly thats outrageous richard exclaimed the breton shrugged he gestured toward the enormous inexplicable drumstick if you dont care to hear the story no one will make you but you can still eat your fill we dont begrudge it a third of my catch edward said slowly in breton then he said it again in french to make sure he had it right francois nodded the englishman went on and in exchange for this you promise me that you will hear my story and that it will be true kersauzon answered past that i promise nothing how can i ours is a chancy trade things may go well or they may not who can know ahead of time a third of your catch may be worth nothing too god forbid it but it may be so richard radcliffe set a hand on his fathers arm lets get out of here he said in english hes run out a line and baited a hook and hell haul you in and cut your guts out and dry you in salt your father would be gamy even in salt kersauzon said also in english richard turned red tell me your story edward radcliffe said his son exclaimed in dismay edward held up a hand i will pay your price friend francois maybe i am a fool it could be plenty of others have said so and i will give you one small promise in return which is the breton asked politely if you lie or if you cheat i will hunt you down and kill you several of the bretons growled jacques reached for his knife in a way that warned he wasnt about to cut himself more of the strange smoked flesh that tasted so much like goose francois kersauzon didnt flinch or even blink a bargain he said and thrust out his right hand edward clasped it kersauzon began to talk maybe i am a foolplenty of others have said so radcliffe wondered whether his words would come back to haunt him if they did he would keep his promise it was as simple as that all around him brawled the immensity of the atlantic hed never been a cautious sailor clinging to the sight of land you couldnt be not if you wanted to make a halfway decent living with your lines and nets but hed never sailed so far into the greengrayblue of the ocean before either ahead of him like a willothewisp the morzen bobbed on the swells francois kersauzons cogher name meant mermaidwas a little smaller a little faster than the st george if shed wanted to she could have given radcliffe the slip but she reefed her big square sail a bit and stuck with the english vessel edward radcliffe stood at the st georges stern holding the tiller that connected to the rudder a few cogs still used oldfashioned twin steering oars but he liked the new arrangement better it let the builders square up the stern so the cog could hold more than it would have otherwise the morzen was made the same way up ahead kersauzon was doing the steering by now edward was as familiar with his distant outline against the sky as he was with those of his own sailors i dont like this henry grumbled i dont like it one bit those damned tricksy bretons are laughing up their sleeves at us you wait and see if theyre not father fine sleeves they have for laughing too edward said his son gave him a dirty look he was joking and not joking at the same time a breton kabig with its hood its wooden toggles and its sturdy oiled cloth was one of the best foulweather jackets around his own wool coat didnt shed water so well though it was probably warmer one of the sailors pointed into the sea off the port bow something funny floating there he called thanks will radcliffe answered and steered towards it grab a dip net and see if you can snag it ill do that will said and he did when the st george came up alongside of whatever it was he thrust the polehandled net into the sea grunting with effort he pulled it in again another fisherman hung on to him to keep him from going over the rail he thrust a fist in the air in triumph got it skipperdamned if i dont good for you edward said and then to henry take the tiller for a bit will you lad i want to see what hes brought in whatever it is it wont be worth the third part of our catchsilver doesnt float his son said but he took his fathers place at the stern edward went forward his gait automatically compensating for the cogs roll and pitch had he thought about how he was doing that he probably couldnt have done it well will what have you got its a leaf like off a tree or a bush will didnt sound sure when edward radcliffe got a good look at the thing he decided he couldnt blame the other fisherman it was undoubtedly a leaf but it was like none hed ever seen before it was bigger than a leaf had any business being for a couple of heartbeats he wondered if it was something on the order of a pine branch that didnt look like a pine branch thoughit looked like a stem and it didnt have needles growing from it those couldnt be anything but leaves even if they were frondlike almost feathery he scratched his head pretty peculiar all right i wonder if the bretons know what the devil it is another fisherman came up beside them you know what it reminds me of he said i dont ned but i hope youll tell me edward answered it reminds me of the leaves on a palm tree ned said a real palm tree i should saywe mostly use yew branches on palm sunday on account of real palm trees wont grow in england but i saw em once in cadiz when i sailed down there on a trading run with a dutchman a palm tree radcliffe echoed ned nodded the skipper rubbed his chin his beard was coming in thick now nobody shaved at sea you were asking to cut your own throat if you tried were a mighty long way from cadizfarther off than we were at le croisic how in blazes would a palm leaf drift all the way out here ned spread his hands which were as callused and battered as the skippers i dont know its not just like a palm leaf either more like one than anything else i know of though maybe it says kersauzon wasntisntlying after all radcliffe said we can hope so anyway wed better hope so ned said which also wasnt wrong he went on and cadiz may be a long way off but that there leaf says some kind of land isnt its pretty freshanybody can see that i was thinking the same thing radcliffe said i he broke off then a bird flew up to the st george out of nowherewhich is to say he didnt notice it till it landed on the rail not a long spit from him its shape and size put him in mind of a good english blackbird so did its yellow beak and when it opened that beak so did its song but it was no blackbird nor any other thrush hed ever seen before yes its back was dark brown but it had a brickred breast and belly not quite so bright as a redbreasts but close it let out a few more bars of sweet music then as radcliffe took a step towards it it sprang into the air and flew awayoff to the west it didnt land on the morzen edward didnt think it did anyhow no it kept on going and where else would it be going but land ned said got to be land yes i think so too and i begin to think francois kersauzon was telling us nothing but the truth edward radcliffe said i didnt believe that when i took his bargain if half of what he claimed was so part of our catch would have been a small price to pay but if all of its true well what then the fisherman asked edward stared west after the vanished songbird i dont know he whispered more than half to himself i just dont know and i dont think anyone else does either more birdsplainly land birdsperched on the st georges rail or in her rigging or atop her yard over the next few days edward radcliffe would have bet that the cloudbank hanging off to the west hid the unknown land from which those birds came he started thinking of it in his own mind as atlantis the fabled country set somewhere out in the ocean with which it shared a name for some time though he had no chance to sail west along with everyone else on the boatand he was sure everyone on the morzen toohe was too busy pulling cod from the sea kersauzon sure hadnt been lying about what a fine fishing ground this was edward had never seen anything like it in waters closer to england some of the cod were almost as long as a man and heavier than big men like edward and his sons the fishermen had to gaff them to bring them aboard and even then the cod flapped and fought desperate for life before long the st georges deck was running in blood and slippery with fish guts the crew flung offal over the side as fast as they could that only brought sharks and other wolves of the sea alongside to feast on the unaccustomed bounty gulls and skuas and other sea birds fought for their share too and screeched in rage when they didnt get everything they wanted listening to those furious dissatisfied cries edward straightened for a moment and said to henry they might as well be men eh his son nodded theyre greedy enough all right but theres plenty here for all of them plenty here for the bretons and us toofrancois wasnt wrong about that and you werent wrong to take him up on it henry managed a wry grin there father dyou see you can say i told you so and i just have to put up with it so do i richard said instead of coming out with the words every childand every man and woman grownso hated to hear edward radcliffe only grunted and went back to gutting fish the knife he used was a sturdy tool not far removed from a falchion or shortsword yet for some of the cod that were coming out of the sea it was barely big enough he stropped it against leather again and again and longed for a steel to do an even better job of keeping the edge sharp the st georges master salter was a lean fellow named hugh fenner good thing we have a full load from abrgall he said spreading flower of salt inside the body cavity of a fish edward had just gutted well use every speck we got in le croisic well i hoped for a good catch theni always do the skipper replied but i own i never dreamt of anything likethis by our lady who would who could fenner said some of these cod are so meaty we need to carve em into thinner slabs to make sure the salt can cure em before they spoil more work as if we didnt have enough already edward said but do what you need to do hugh and make sure the lads all jump when you tell em to the catch comes first that might not have been the apostles creed but it was the fishermens dont you fret skipper everybodyll do what needs doing thats what were here for fenner said radcliffe nodded without taking the master salter seriously telling him not to worry was like telling him not to breathe worrying was part of his joba big part if the captain didnt worry who would nobody and if nobody worried what would become of the fishing boat when something that people should have been worrying about happened nothing goodhe was only too sure of that well fill the hold fulldevil take me if we dont hugh fenner said we could fill it full two or three times all the fish were taking jesus and mary we hardly need the hooks and lines the codre so thick we could dip baskets in the water and take em out that way he was likely right no wonder francois kersauzon had led them here this bank had more fish than any one boat could handle radcliffe thought it had more fish than a hundred boats could handle or a thousand in exchange for the secret the canny breton got an extra third of the catch for no extra work it struck radcliffe as a good bargain for both sides whether it would strike kersauzon the same way five or ten years from now edward wasnt so sure the st george would keep coming back and next time around would owe nothing to the other boat i can sell the secret too if i want to or need to radcliffe thought it wouldnt last a secret this big this rich couldnt last long by the nature of things the wind shifted radcliffes eye automatically went to the rigging though of course he knew the sail was furled the breeze had been coming out of the west now it swung about so that it blew toward the clouds fixed in the mysterious distance there maybe it would shift them at last he hoped sohe wanted a look at what they hid hed heard kersauzons stories about atlantis and hed seen one enormous smoked leg of fowl all that whetted his appetite both literally and figuratively as soon as he was sure the swing portended no danger to the cog he plunged back into the unending labor of gaffing and gutting and salting fish some time went by before he looked up again startled and realized hed forgotten to do anything of the kind for much too long dripping knife in his hand he stared and stared green as england in springtime was his first thought after he finally got a glimpse ofatlantis yes the name seemed to suit more than well enough a longer look said his first thought wasnt quite true this green was darker more somber than that of his native land but that didnt mean he didnt want to see this new countryside up close oh no it didnt mean anything of the kind oars creaked in the oarlocks as the st georges boat neared the shore edward waved to francois kersauzonthe morzens boat was going ashore too only a short bowshot away the breton skipper waved back is it not as i told you he called his voice thin across the waves seems that way edward looked over his shoulder toward the two fishing boats anchored in eight fathoms of water he didnt believe in taking chances he wanted plenty of ocean under his keel plainly kersauzon felt the same way that surprised the englishman not at allyou didnt get to be a captain if you were reckless or if you did you didnt stay a captain long he and his sons and hugh fenner and two other fishermen had a longer pull than they would have if hed brought the st george into shallower water so did the bretons from the morzen so what edward thought anyone who minded work had no business going to sea in the first place he wondered whether kersauzon and the bretons would race to the shore sensibly they didnt anyone who gave himself extra work when so much wasnt extra had to be a fool francois kersauzon might be a lot of things but radcliffe would have sworn on christs holy relics that he was no fool the boat fought through the breakers and grated to a stop on a beach half sand half mud you go out first father richard said you brought us here i never would havei thought the breton was cozening us the rest of the englishmen in the boat nodded i thank you edward said his back creaked as he straightened when he stepped ashore his boot squelched in mud he knew he ought to come out with something grand something peopleor at least hewould remember for a long time but he was no traveling player or glib peddler to find fancy words whenever he needed them well were here wasnt what anyone would call splendid but it was true kersauzon hopped out of the other boat and trotted toward him the breton took the new land for granted it wasnt new to him not as a whole even if this stretch might be what do you think he asked as proud as if he rather than god had shaped the ground on which they stood itsdifferent edward answered the murmur of waves going in and out the winds sigh the smell of sea in the airall those things were familiar enough so were the grasses and shrubs just beyond the beach past that familiarity broke down radcliffe pointed to a strange plant what do you call that i dont know its right name i dont know if it has one kersauzon said but ive been calling those barrel plants radcliffe nodded right name or not it fit well enough the trunkhe supposed it was a trunklooked like a stout barkcovered barrel from the top sprouted a sheaf of big frondfilled leaves like the one will had netted from the atlantic more barrel plants some bigger some smaller dotted the landscape their leaves were of varying sizes and shapes and of different shades of green but they all seemed built on the same plana plan edward had never seen before farther inland the woods were of conifers but not of the sort of conifers he knew have you a name for the trees too he asked i doi call em redwoods francois kersauzon replied cut down a small one and youll see whythe lumber is the color of untarnished copper and mother mary turn her back on me if i lie englishman but some of them are bigger than any trees i ever set eyes on back home are there men here richard radcliffe asked moors or irishmen or other savages ive not seen any kersauzon said i dont swear im the only fisherman ever to find this shore basques or galicians who dont get their salt at le croisicor maybe even those who do for the basques are closemouthed bastardsmay come here too but ive yet to run across a native its a new land edward spied a flash of motionmotion on two legsbehind a tall barrel plant then whats that he demanded wondering if the breton was tricking his son and him kersauzon only laughed bide a moment friend and youll seeand hear honnnk the note was deeper than a man could have made it edward gaped at the curious creature that came out from behind the barrel plant it walked on two legs like a man but it was some sort of enormous bird its neck and head were black except for a white patch under its formidable beak the shaggy feathers on its back were dun brown those on its belly paler the legs were bare and scaly like a fowlsbut what a fowl it was when the honkerthe name flashed into edwards mindspread its wings the fishermen laughed those tiny appendages could never lift it off the ground he wondered why the bird had them at all it reached down with its beak and pulled up a mouthful of grass then another and another so thats where you got your great drumstick is it edward said it is indeed kersauzon replied the poor foolish things have no fear of mananother reason i think there are no natives here you can walk up to one and knock it over the head and it will let you it will lie dead at your feet when it should be running or kicking ill do that right now then hugh fenner said half apologetically the master salter turned to radcliffe you get tired of even the best fish after a while if we roast that overgrown goose weve got a feast for the whole crew when we come to a new land do we mark it by our first kill the way cain did edward wondered but his stomach growled at the thought of meat too go on if you care to he told fenner the master salter advanced on the honker fenners confidence grew with every step sure enough the monster bird seemed curious at his approach but not afraid he had a stout bludgeon on his belt one good wallop with that ought to shatter the stupid things skull a flash in the air a harsh screech a shriek from fenner and then he was down and thrashing with a great hawk or eagle clinging to his back and tearing at his kidneys with a huge hooked slicing beak the honker might not fear men but the sight of that eagle sent it running back for the shelter of theredwoods kersauzon called them shouting and waving their arms englishmen and bretons rushed to hugh fenners rescue the eagle screamed harshly but flew away blood dripping from bill and long curved talons hugh lay where hed fallen he didnt move a sharp stink said his bowels had let go edward grabbed for his wrist then let it fall the master salter had no pulse hes gone radcliffe heard the dull wonder in his voice man could killbut so could atlantis ii f rancois kersauzon seemed as upset about fenners death as edward radcliffe was as god is my witness friend saoz ive seen those eagles take honkers before but i never dreamt they would take men he said we probably look like honkersa good nameto them henry said except smaller and maybe easier to kill edward added staring into the trees where the eagle had flown that was a formidable bird bigger and fiercer than any golden eagle or sea eagle hed ever seen and if its prey walked on two legs as kersauzon had said the honkers seemed to have no fear of man but that one had disappeared into the woods as soon as the eagle struck hugh fenner men might be an unknown quantity but the birds that struck from the sky were enemies honkers had no doubt of that poor hugh he died unshriven richard crossed himself so did the other fishermen english and bretons edwards younger son went on we have to bury him here we cant very well salt him down and take him home ill say the words over him edward said his sons and the other englishmen nodded hed had to do that before more than once when someone on the st george took sick and died or perished by some mischance he was no priest but he could hope his prayers helped a soul win through at least to purgatory a little piece of atlantis will be english forevermore hed spoken his own language but kersauzon as hed seen could follow english atlantis the other skipper echoed weve just been calling it the western land but thats better by goda name to stick in the mind atlantis edward tried to remember if they had a shovel aboard the st george he didnt think so he scuffed at the dirt with the toe of his boot it was soft whatever they had they could manage are there wolves here or gluttons or anything else that might dig up a grave he asked havent seen anything of the kind kersauzon answered havent seen any fourfooted creatures at all or heard them howling in the night some uncommon big lizards one of his fishermen put in when edward radcliffe thought of a lizard he thought of a scurrying thing as long as his finger an uncommon big one might bewhat as long as his forearm anything larger than that was beyond his ken this whole land was beyond his kenexcept that he was standing on it off to the west beyond the trees he saw the distant sawtoothed outline of mountains against the skyline what lay beyond them he snorted he had no idea what lay on this side of the mountains except for peculiar plants even stranger birds and eagles ferocious as demons from hell but richard was looking out toward those faroff peaks too no other men here not settlers not natives no wolves no bears as he rowed out in the boat to see what digging tools the st george had he remarked if you fished in the sea and cleared some land for a crop you could live here you could live here pretty well i think if youre going to live here youd need to bring some women over henry said edward nodded and that thought pulled him back to the present or at least to the near future when we get home ill have to tell poor hughs meg what chanced here he said and grimaced i dont look forward to that even paying her his full share i dont look forward to it how many children have they got five i think it is richard answered and megs likely to have another by the time we see england again edward nodded once more he thought he remembered the same thing and wished his son had told him he was wrong are you thinking of settling on these shores father richard asked arent you edward said henry might be older but richard was the sharper of his boys no doubt about that no moneylenders no lord to bend the knee to no king to pay taxes to were free when were at sea now but on land we might as well be slaves wouldnt you like to be free all the time no church richard murmured did he want to be free of the priest too or was he complaining of the lack edward couldnt tell henry was more resolutely practical no boatwrights no netmakers no blacksmiths no horses no sheep no cattle not unless we bring em with us edward glanced over to the morzen if we dont settle here how long do you think these bretons will wait if theyre on the spot theyll have these fishing banks all to themselves the bastards theyre bad enough on the other side of the channel richard said would you want them living a long spit down the coast from you well if the other choice is spending the rest of my days jealous because theyre here and im not maybe i do edward radcliffe weighed his words and nodded yet again yes son maybe i do the crews of the st george and the morzen spent ten days on atlantis the longer edward radcliffe stayed the more he wanted to come back to settle and never to leave he kept glancing at francois kersauzon out of the corner of his eye was the same thought in kersauzons mind how could it not be henry did knock a honker over the head it was as easy as the breton said it would be the enormous bird stared at the man with a kind of dull curiosity as he walked up to it it wasnt afraid of him it had never learned to be afraid of things that looked like him it died without ever knowing it should have learned to fear more than anything else that made edward sure atlantis had no natives if even savages lived here the local beasts would have learned to run away from them and edward found himself eyeing francois kersauzon in a new way the other skipper was properly alert but if he got knocked over the head half in regret and half in relief edward shelved the idea he wasnt afraid of wearing the mark of cain he was afraid he would have to kill all the bretons to make killing kersauzon worthwhile and he was afraid he would lose too many of his own fishermen in the fighting sometimesnot always but sometimespeace was smarter than war perhaps three miles south of where hed first come ashore he found a river flowing strongly out into the sea henry was with him when they came to the mouth of the stream the younger man pointed inland its bound to come down from the mountains he said no doubt it would have to with so swift a current edward agreed it runs hard enough to power a great plenty of grinding mills aye belike if the mills have a great plenty to grind his son said no grain growing here not yet no not yet edward looked inland again he was also looking into the futurethrough a glass darkly which is as much as it is given to a man to do but do you see any reason why grain shouldnt grow here i seen none henry replied which is not the same as saying there is none we dont know i want to find out edward said i want to live here where when im ashore i can do as i please i can hunt deer without poaching on the lords land i havent seen any deer here either his son broke in no one has that i know of fine i can hunt these honkers then edward said impatiently oh yesthey make fine sport sarcasm dripped from henrys words the excitement of the stalk the thrill of the chase he mimed bringing his club down on a big stupid birds head they make mighty good eating though edward said and his son couldnt very well argue with thatthe one henry had killed was smoking on the beach where theyd landed edward went on and if there are no deer here now whats to keep us from bringing them across the sea like sheep or cattle or horses or henry interrupted again everything else wed need to live well what of it edward said are you telling me we cant do that we can find this place again or near enoughwe know the latitude and if we dont settle right here any other stretch of the coast would do about as well will you tell me im wrong no father henry said but its a big step to uproot ourselves from england and cross the sea to try to make our homes on an unknown shore it wont stay unknown long by our lady its not unknown nowwere standing on it edward radcliffe said and if we dont make homes here the bretons or the french or the basques or the galicians will then we wont even be able to fish here theyll be in their own back fields you might say and well have to cross the atlantic both ways wed never stay in business against them do you want that wed be second best forever thats no fate for englishmen thats no fate for radcliffes henry sighed father it sounds good when it comes from your lips but when we get home whats lucy going to say to me he put his hands on his hips and raised his voice to sound like his wife whod always struck edward as a bit of a shrew you want me to leave my kin and cross the sea you want me to put our babies into a fishing boat you want to sail away from my mother by god yes to that edward saidlucys mother was more than a bit of a shrew his son went right on imitating his daughterinlaw you want me to carve a farm holding out of nothing while you fish the way you always did you expect me to live without neighbors without friends we wont be the only ones goingtell her that wed better not be or the venture fails edward said true enough what can you promise the others except a dangerous voyage over more sea than anyone in hastings cares to think about besides the best place to fish they ever saw besides land that stretches to the horizon there for the taking besides freedom from lords how about freedom from peasant risings too edward said only a couple of years earlier jack cade and his rebels had almost chased the king of england from his throne henry nodded thoughtfully there is that what do you suppose mother will think shell go along edward said more confidently than he felt nell radcliffe had a mind of her own and a tongue sharper than lucys she would go along if she thought going along was a good idea if she didnt she wouldnt be shy about saying so well well see henry said which only proved he too knew his mother well crossing the atlantic from west to east was easier than sailing the other way for they had the winds with them through most of the journey they put in at le croisic where edward paid francois kersauzon the price to which theyd agreed seeing a breton take so much salt cod from the hold of an englishmans ship made the locals smirk edward looked suitably chagrined as he piled fish in front of the morzen he didnt believe many bretons knew of atlantis yet what did they think that kersauzon had won some enormous bet from him he wouldnt have been surprised let them think what they wanted though he knew and kersauzon knew two could hold a secret could kersauzon keep the fishermen on the morzen from blabbing the odds were against it the bretons had brought back more smoked honker and radcliffe had a leg bone they would have to explain where those came from what would they say whatever they said it would make the other fishermenand even the local lubberscurious they would want to sail west that meant edward needed to move fast if he wanted his countrymen to take their fair share of atlantis he needed to move fastand he couldnt contrary winds held him in le croisic day after day he fumed and swore but he couldnt do anything about it his only consolation was that what held him in port held the bretons too that wasnt quite true they could go down the coast to the south but he didnt think they would spill the secret to frenchmen they scorned the french even more than englishmen did which wasnt easy at last the wind shifted he took the st george out of the harbor and sailed around cap finistere and into the channel the waves there squeezed between europe and england grew taller and more menacing than they had been out in the open ocean even fishermen with strong stomachs stayed close to the leeward rail the waves helped push the cog along though she made good time on the last leg of the voyage home hastings was the westernmost of the cinque ports in reality seven towns though the name had room for only five they pooled their resources against pirates there edward felt safe enoughcorsairs were after silk and silver not salt cod what he brought home wasnt worth stealing but a man could make a good living at it what more could you want the old deserted norman castle still stood on west hill looking down on the town william the conqueror had based himself in hastings of courseeverybody knew that with plantagenets still ruling england no one saidout loudthat he wished the saxons had won the fight not far away what would the country be like today had harold prevailed different edward thought and he was bound to be right about that he brought the st george into the stade the fishing boats harbor youre back late a dockside lounger called wed almost given up looking for you youre holy men though another man said with so many masses going up for your souls how can you be anything else i wish i were so sure i had all my sins washed away not much room to sin in a fishing boat henry said with a grin well have to make up for it now that were here a dealer hurried out onto the pier where the fishermen were tying up youll want to sell your fish to me wont you edward he said his voice as greasy as codliver oil if you give me a proper price for them paul radcliffe answered if you act like a jew the way you do most of the time id sooner sell them to an honest man instead you wound me paul finley said but this was as much a dance with formal steps as the dicker with the breton salt dealer had been and when finley saw the size of the cod and the slabs of cod that came from the st georges hold even his air of worldweary contempt for anything that had to do with salt fish cracked i dont know the last time i set eyes on the like he admitted which meant hed never seen fish that came close to these where did you catch em i planted them in the dark of the moon the way you do with crops that grow below the surface edward radcliffe answered gravely his men sniggered sooner or later one of them would get drunk and spill the word with a little luck it would be later paul finley gave him a very strange look i almost believe you fair enough for i almost told the truth edward said the dealers eye raked the fishing boat i dont see hugh tell me nothing happened to him pleasehes a good man edwards mouth tightened we lost him im afraid youll keep that to yourself by god for ive not yet spoken to his wife and his father he remembered the master salters scream and the eagle tearing at his kidneys and flying off with his blood dripping from its beak and claws finley crossed himself lord have mercy on him this was at sea before anyone had to lie he answered his own question well of course it was where else would it be he forced himself back to what lay before him you have the hold full of fish this size and quality twothirds full edward said his voice flat if paul finley wanted to make something of that he would have to do it himself he raised an eyebrow before he spoke though he seemed to think better of it mm thats your businessor your misfortune depending if youd come home earlier in the season you would have got a better price for them youll take any way you can find to knock down what we did out there wont you radcliffe spoke without heat he knew finley was still following the steps of the dance you do your job i do mine the dealer said easily you want to make money when you sell and so do i he named a price edward radcliffes bellow of rage was a permitted step but not a common one you needed to feel some of that fury to show it and he did even you know thats thievery paul ive heard what worse cod than this is bringing he named a price close to three times as high as finleys they went back and forth back and forth edward knew his quality he also knew his hold was onethird empty which made him hold out for every farthing on the fish he did have finley came up ever so slowly like a drowning man who didnt want to break the surface both of them were sweating when they finally clasped hands if youre going to be that tough with a full load of fish finley shook his head lord jesu maybe i ought to let some other dealer see how he likes matching wits with you he counted out silver and gave it to edward thats what we said yes radcliffe counted the money it wasnt that he thought finley was trying to cheat him but checking never hurt anything he nodded yes thats what we said their hands joined again one of these days youll tell me where you really came by cod of that size finley said yes one of these days i will and it may come sooner than you think edward agreed but not yet paul not yet childbearing and hard work had coarsened nell radcliffes figure the years had lined her face and streaked her redblond hair with gray when edward looked at her he still saw the beauty hed married more than half a lifetime earlier he made love like a sailor newly home from the seain the daytime which would have scandalized the neighbors had they known and had so many of them not been fisherfolk themselves then he told her why the st george was so late coming home and of the new land hed trodden atlantis she echoed the fine lines at the corners of her eyes crinkling as they narrowed but atlantis is a story a fable a makebelieve like the drowned city of ys and the bells you hear under the water funny you should talk of ys when a breton guided me west to atlantis edward said but its no dream we still have the bone from a smoked honker legwe ate the meat on the way home when the fishing flagged and hugh fenner died on the coast of atlantis how nell asked bad hard edward left it there he didnt intend to say more to meg fenner either or even that much but all the same its a true place a good place a place of great promiseyou should have seen pauls eyes when he got a look at the cod not paradise or hugh would live yet but a good place a fine place you sound like you want to go back his wife said he nodded there beside her in the bed so much wider and softer than his bunk aboard the st georgeand he was lucky to have a bunk on the cog when his sailors slung hammocks instead i do he said its a broader land than this one and a man could live there free of a lord a man could be a lord there by heaven for who would say he could not nell stirred so the leather lashings under the mattress creakednot the way they had a little while before but enough to make him smile you dont just want to visit she said slowly you want to stay i do edward repeated what about me then what about your children what abouteverything her wave took in not just the house not just hastings but all of england id want you to come along thats what wed make a new life there a new townwe could call it new hastings if you like i like this hastings well enough nell said talk to richard and henry theyre as wild for atlantis as i am edward said though he wasnt quite sure that was so about henry talk to mary and kate and philippahis daughters all of them married to fishermen do you think theyd be sorry to have gardens as wide as they could grow them and no noble landlord and no rent to pay i think theyd be sorry to sail to the edge of the world and maybe off it nell answered i think i would be too i thought id live my whole life in hastings i never wanted to do anything else edward radcliffe had to remind himself not to get angry nell wouldnt be the only one whod want to stay right here most people were like limpets clinging to one spot if you went farther than a days walk from where you were born it was the journey of a lifetime and youd bore your neighbors with it the rest of your days fishermen and traders were different it was easy to forget how different edward had seen far more of the world than his wife had he was eager to see more she wasnt eager to see any if life is better there why not go he asked doing his best to keep his voice gentle who says it would be better wed have to start from the beginning with nothing at all nell said wed have everything we could bring with us from england edward said livestock and seeds and saplings and cuttings and tools and someone would steal them from us as soon as we set foot in this place if you men spend all your time fishing who would drive off our enemies we couldnt call on a lord or the king for soldiers the way we can here if those nasty french dogs cross the channel patiently edward answered thered be no enemies we would have the first settlement the only settlement on those shores would we what about that breton pirate who sold you the secreta third of the catch christ have mercy nell said is he lying with his wife right now filling her head with wind and air about the marvelous land on the other side of the sea will there be a town full of those rogues around the cape from ours they dont even talk a language a regular person can understand he almost reminded her he spoke breton but feared it would do more harm than good and he didnt know francois kersauzon wasnt planning to settle down in atlantis he feared kersauzon was the breton was nobodys fool if radcliffe could see the advantages so could he and what about the wild men wholl live there nell said they wont even know our lords name and theyll murder us in our beds first chance they get no wild men there edward spoke with assurance how can you know that on the tiny visit you had his wife demanded because the beasts in atlantis had no fear of us he replied if they knew men at all they would know to be afraid of them even wolves and bears feared men they killed men sometimes but they feared them and fled when they could wellmaybe nell said grudgingly or maybe there just werent any savages close by if there are men anywhere in atlantis theyd be there that land was too fine to stay empty edward squeezed his wife dont say no right away think it through you cant imagine what youre throwing away if you turn your back on this i know what ive got now she said i can imagine worse a lot easier than i can imagine better it will be better there edward said for us for our children for their children and for all who come after them as long as there be radcliffes the fervor in his voice amazed him well maybe nell said again before long hastings bubbled with the name of atlantis if you wanted to go and settle someplace you couldnt very well keep where you were going a secret word spread fastest among fishermen and merchants who had the ships to get to the new land but others heard too the smiths and potters and carpenters who sold them the things they would need on the distant shore and after that those in authority edward radcliffe was dickering with a farmer named george tree over several laying hens and a rooster when a blackrobed priest strode up to him i would have speech with you master radcliffe he said importantly what do you need father john radcliffe asked step aside if you please the priest made it plain he wanted no one else to overhear whatever you like holy father edward nodded to the farmer ill be with you in a bit george them birds wont fly away while youre gone tree said father john had the smooth pink complexion and double chin of a man whod seldom known hunger he also had a blade of a nose and shrewd black eyes do i hear rightly he asked after leading edward down the muddy street till they could talk in reasonable privacy do you purpose sailing off to the edge of the world and leaving the holy mother church behind i do want to sail off yes father radcliffe said and the priests mouth tightened quickly the fisherman went on but i never dreamt of leaving the church behind if a priest would come with us wed count it a blessing there should be a chapel in atlantiswhy not isee father john said slowly edward hoped he hid his own tension he didnt want every clergyman in town preaching against his venture if anything could ruin his plans that could if people decided god was against them they wouldnt go father john tapped a forefinger against the side of his leg if a priest did come with you you would give him proper support wed be glad to have him as i said wed give him what we could i cant say he wouldnt have to work some on his own though radcliffe answered its a bare shore you understand well all be working hard at first hard as can be how can we have a drone among us meaning no offense priests are not drones drones toil not nor do they spin father johns voice was as stiff as his spine radcliffe thought priests fit the definition more than well enough but saying so wouldnt do sure enough father john went on who would intercede with god but for priests who would baptize who hear confession who give unction at the end of life no one edward said as he had to he didnt want to go out of life without unction the way luckless hugh fenner had but he was a stubborn man in his own right a priest who is respected among men is better than one who is not he insisted anyone who pulls his own weight in this world will be better liked than a man who expects to be waited on hand and foot holy father you know there are priests like that we both wish there werent but there are we dont need one like that where everyone else is bending his back like a beast of burden maybe his earnestness got through to father john what sort of priest do you need then eh radcliffe edward calculated for a heartbeat and part of another as if he hadnt he answered why one much like yourself holy father had he read his man aright me father john rapped out why would i want to sail to the back of beyondbeyond the back of beyond where would you find a better chance to be your own man edward asked youd belike a bishop almost he didnt wink at father john if the priest thought of himself the way radcliffe hoped he would rise to the bait on his own if i am to be sent alone to a strange shore i should become one father john said this is to enable me to ordain new priests so that the church may continue in that faroff place you will know such things better than i do the same as im likely better at salting a cod edward said do you think you can make the necessary arrangements well well the priest said and then again well well he rubbed his smoothly shaven chin do you know sir it is possible that i might all right then edward said as if that were a complete sentence by the way father john smiled it was edward radcliffe was a man of some consequence in hastings any successful fishing captain was all the same he didnt expect a summons to the castle and he didnt expect the summons to be delivered by four large unsmiling men in chainmail the largest and most somber of them growled you are to come with us at once in the name of sir thomas and in the name of his majesty henry vi king of england henry vi king of as much of england as he can persuade to obey his writ at any given moment the thought ran through edwards mind but he kept it to himself sir thomas hoo the local baron was a loyal follower of the kings i am at your service gentlemen and at sir thomas and of course at the kings the fisherman said if he tried telling them anything else he had the bad feeling he would die as unpleasantly as hugh fenner sir thomas men had horses waiting in the street they even had one for radcliffe he took that as a good sign if they were going to throw him in the dungeon they would have made him walk probably with a noose around his neck to advertise his disgrace to the town he was more accustomed to riding a pitching deck than even a sedate gelding two of sir thomas retainers sniggered as he awkwardly swung up onto the horses back youve got more practice at this than i do friends he said in the st george in a storm on the north sea youd be the sorry ones as i am here just ride said the one who seemed to do their talking for them ride radcliffe did not well but well enough the wooden motteandbailey castle william the conqueror built as soon as he landed in england and its stone successor had long since grown useless the sea had chewed away most of the land that once stood between the old fort and the waters edge its replacement a solid mass of gray stone safely stood farther inland their horses hooves drumming on the lowered drawbridge edward and his escorts rode into the castle sir thomas hoo stood in the courtyard watching some young soldiers hack at pells with swords sir thomas was no youngster he was five or ten years older than radcliffe and his strength once massive was beginning to fail his stooped shoulders and wrinkled jowly face warned of the storms of lifes winter ahead he rolled his eyes at edwards dismount which was no more graceful than the way the fisherman had mounted whats this i hear about you wanting to put all of hastings on board ship and sail off with it to some unknown shore he growled without preamble by the holy cross sir thomas if you heard any such thing you heard lies edward exclaimed oh i did did i sir thomas hoos eyes were redtracked and rheumy one of them clouded by the beginnings of a cataract but they were very shrewd if its all moonshine and hogwash why do i hear it from so many folk eh answer me that if you believed everything you heard from a lot of people sir youd be a sorry soul sir and thats the truth edward said a couple of his escorts scowled one of them dropped a hand to the hilt of his sword then sir thomas grunted laughter and his retainers relaxed radcliffe went on rumor always outruns fact and any man who wishes me ill would work to make it outrun fact the more it could be the castellan said i dont say it is but it could be well then what do you intend a small settlement on the new shore radcliffe answered the fishing grounds there are finer than any in the north sea that i saw for myself would we want to let the bretons and basques and other foreigners seize the advantage over englishmen in using them fish cod sir thomas made them into words of scorn if not into swear words he glowered at edward from under shaggy graystreaked eyebrows you want to get away from peasants in rebellion against their rightful lords and from french sea dogs i should say i do edward thought the french had almost burnt hastings to the ground not long before but he couldnt admit what he wanted without the least hesitation he shook his head how could we leave our homeland behind for good he said where would we sell the fish we caught if we did that was a legitimate question he couldnt imagine cutting all ties with england even if he and his kin spent most of their time in atlantis and off its shores how many folk would fare with you on this madcap venture sir thomas asked a couple of dozen families sir and wed need to bring the seed grain and livestock to let us make a go of it in the new land edward answered does not the good book speak of casting your bread upon the waters this is englands bread and she shall find it again after many days youve been talking with father john sir thomas turned that to an accusation i have sir he will vouch for me edward radcliffe hoped he would hes ambitious too the castellan scowled once more well go then and i know not whether to wish you godspeed or say be damned to you atlantis nonsense he hawked and spat and turned away iii g etting animals aboard the st george vexed edward to put it mildly i never worried about noah before he growled to nell now i feel sorry for the poor devil i feel sorry for his wife nell said chances are he made her do all the work if you think im going to sleep from here to atlantis youre bloody well out of your mind edward said the cog wont sail herself and the fish wont catch themselves either the hold which still stank of fish was full of hay and grain instead they had to get the sheep and hogs and chickens and ducks across the sea before they ran out of fodder and water for them could they do it he thought so but feared it might be close he had no cattle or horses on the st george the boats that carried the bigger beasts had fewer of the smaller ones he hoped things would work out he didnt know they would but he hoped so what else can i do he thought richard said something hot as a smithys forge when he stepped in sheep shit get used to it son edward advised it wont be the last time richard said something even hotter henry laughed at him which only proved he hadnt stuck his foot in ityet on another cog not far away father johns tonsured head gleamed under the bright sun of early spring two other priests were also coming along on this leap into the unknown edward radcliffe smiled to himself the other two were pliable tractable fellows men without ambition for themselves if any of them was made a bishop when one of them was made a bishop it would be john so far from any other prelate he might almost be a pope edward cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted to the other boats assembled in the stade are we all ready two or three skippers echoed his cry to make sure everyone heard nobody said no then lets away he said sailors ran to the lines and let the big square sails fall from the yards the wind came off the land and pushed the cogs out of the harbor and into the waters of the channel with the greatest of ease women and children squealed in excitement not many of them had put to sea before the water in the channel was the way it usually was rough those squeals didnt last long ruddy english complexions went ghostpale the rail a fisherman shouted get to the damned rail he was just too lateand somebody would have a mess worse than sheep shit to clean up is italways like this nell asked gulping no dear radcliffe answered his wife looked relieved in a wan way till he added sometimes its worse she searched his face hoping he was joking when she saw he wasnt she groaned he said youll get used to it after a while though almost everyone does almost nell got out through clenched teeth she gulped again and ran for the rail unlike the first victim of seasickness she made it she even knew which rail to run to people who ran to the windward side only made that mistake oncetrying to clean themselves afterwards ensured that fishermen screamed at passengers to get out of the way as they swung the yard to catch the breeze they screamed at the livestock too but the animals didnt want to listen neither did some of the children one irate soldier booted a hen into the english channel dont ever do that again wat edward told him well need those birds when we get to the other side if i trip over the damn thing and go into the drink myself i wont make it to the other side wat retorted you wont make it there if i toss you in the drink either edward said wat was twenty years younger a long look at the jut of radcliffes jaw and the size of his knobby fists though made the other man turn away muttering to himself edward was glad to be back at sea he felt he belonged here his time ashore he endured he came alive on the waves that wasnt anything he talked about with nell any more than he would have told her if hed taken up with another woman he didnt want her jealousit would only have made things worse the st george took much longer to shake down to routine than she usually did the fishermen knew what routine meant their wives and children didnt and had to learn the animals didnt either and learned even more slowly if at all people who werent used to the rations grumbled about themor they did when they finally got their sea legs under them and found they had appetites after all radcliffe thought the food was extravagant to go with the ships biscuit they had much more bacon and sausage aboard than usual and less salt cod the fish needed to be soaked before you could eat it they had so many more mouths aboard than usual they couldnt afford much water for that this biscuit has weevils nell said when theyd been at sea about a week yes that happens edward agreed im sorry but i cant do anything about it but its disgusting she said shrilly it can happen on land too he pointed out it does not like this nell held the biscuit under his nose its crawling with bugs he couldnt see them when she did thathis sight had begun to lengthen it didnt mean he didnt believe her because he did she went on all the ships biscuit is probably like this edward nodded it probably is his wife glared at him well what are we supposed to do about it we cant pitch it into the ocean the way we ought to not if its all bad wed starve im afraid so radcliffe was also afraid nell would grab something and try to break it over his head he regretfully spread his hands i dont know what to tell you dear if you toast your biscuit over a candle flame youll drive out most of the bugs or if you close your eyes and dont think about it you justeat i already tried that she said bleakly it doesnt workthey crunch under your teeth they taste bad too maybe ill toast it and see how many weevils come out maybe i dont want to know i never did edward said she needed to remember this happened to fishermen all the time she flounced off as well as she could flounce on a pitching deck her long wool skirt swirled around her ankles after a couple of strides she turned around for a parting shot do they have weevils in your precious atlantis before he could answer she did it for him they would then she stormed away later that day edward asked her does the toasting help a little she said grudgingly more grudgingly still she added you did try i thank you for it theres my nell he said the scowl his nell sent him told him all was not yet forgotten even if it might be partway forgiven the fishermen went to work sooner than they would have on a regular run everything they caught stretched the supplies on the st george further edward wouldnt have bothered salting most of what the lines brought in but as fishermen knew and few others ever had the chance to learn fish just out of the ocean made far better far sweeter eating than fish dried and salted or fish starting to go off at a fishmongers stall the dogs didnt turn up their noses at fresh fish guts either that eased radcliffes mind he hadnt been sure how he would keep them fed all the way across the atlantic dogs would eat almost anything if they had to but they did best with something meaty fish suited the cats fine there werent enough rats and mice on the cog to keep them full for such a long voyage edward knew from experience that there were bound to be some he also knew from experience that no matter how many cats he had aboard they wouldnt catch all the vermin he wondered whether atlantis had rats and mice of its own hard to imagine a place that didnt he laughed a little if by some accident the new land lacked them it wouldnt much longer they were bound to come ashore and bound to get loose in the wilderness it was a shame but he didnt know what he could do about it swine were bound to get loose too they were much closer to wild beasts than sheep and cattle and horses swine at least made good hunting and good eating day followed day edward had a compass to give him a notion of north he had a crossstaff to give him a notion of latitudeas long as he kept the date straight as soon as he got out of sight of land he had only a rough guess based on how far he thought hed sailed about longitude he wished someone would figure out how to keep track of it but no one had are we almost there he expected to hear that from his grandchildren and he did he was less happy to hear it from his sons wives and from his own the more he heard it the more it grated on him too do you see land out there he would ask and point west there was as yet no land to see when whoever was grumbling admitted as much he would say then we arent almost there are we when the fishermen started pulling cod that weighed as much as they did out of the grayblue water edward smiled to himself the lubbers aboard went right on wondering where land was edward knew it wasnt very far they really were almost thereand he said not a word he thought they would spot land the very next day but they didntfog closed in around the little fleet of cogs and held them wrapped in wet wool for the next two days sailors shouted to one another and blew horns to keep from drifting apart because no one could see from stern to bow of one fishing boat let alone farther edward hadnt been worried till then everything on the journey west had gone as well as he could have hoped or maybe even better but those two days made him pace and mutter and crack his knuckles and do all the other things a badly rattled man might do he wasnt fretting only about one cog colliding with another either here he was off a shore about which he knew next to nothing how many rocks and shoals did it have and where did they lurk was a rock he couldnt see only a few feet away waiting to rip the bottom out of the st george to ease his mind he cast a line into the water it came back showing thirty fathoms and a sandy bottom that made him feel a little better but only a little a rock could rise suddenly and he knew it too well he set one of the fishermen to casting the lead every time he turned the glass if we go under twenty fathoms scream at me he said no screams came only the shouts and braying trumpets from the other fishing boats radcliffe didnt mind those he would have started and sworn had a horn bellowed from right alongside the st george but that didnt happen either youre jumpy as one of the cats henry told him its my boat edward said simply its my notion to start a new town in the new land and if anything goes wrong its my fault were fine father henry said we are now we are now as long as god wants us to be edward crossed himself a moment later so did his son if god decides he doesnt want us to be then we cant do anything about it anyway henry broke in we have to do everything we can do everything we know how to do edward insisted if we dont weve got only ourselves to blame god put the rocks wherever he put them if we dont look for them though thats our fault whose fault is it if we strike one just after we cast the lead and find naught amiss henry asked ours no his no edwards glare should have been hot enough to burn off the fog by itself youre trying to tie me in more knots than the lines his son laughed well if youre storming at me you wont keep stalking the deck and scaring the poultry im not scaring the hearing his own voice rise to a level he usually used only in a gale edward started to laugh all rightmaybe i am as long as you know you might be maybe you wont henry said and then half spoiled it by adding so often anyhow edward made as if to cuff him hed done that plenty with both boys when they were younger if he tried it in earnest now he feared he would be the one who ended up lying on the deck henry and richard had their own boys to tame these days henry knew he was joking here and made as if to duck then he clapped edward on the back if i go down which god prevent ill go down in good company edward said which god prevent is right henry said a sunbeam in the face caught edward by surprise it caught him by surprise twice in fact he didnt remember falling asleep on the deck some time in the dark hours before dawn and fog had still shrouded the st george when he did but now the sun shone the sky was blue and a warm breeze from the southwest carried the green smells of land with it he sprang to his feet land ho he bawledthe line on the western horizon was hard to make out but he had no doubt it was there land ho praise the lord he has brought us safe to this new shore other cogs began shouting it too but he thought he was the first if those shouts were what woke him and not the sunbeam after all he didnt want to know about it nell came over to his side she peered west shading her eyes with the palm of her hand thats it she said it doesnt look like much not yet edward bowed as if he were a nobleman kindly give us leave to draw closer if youd be so gracious his wife dropped him a curtsy oh very well since tis you as asks her impression of a highborn ladys airs and accent also left something to be desired they grinned at each other with the wind in that quarter drawing closer wasnt easy they had to slew the big square sail around on the yard again and again tacking toward the land that almost seemed to retreat as they beat their way westward but they did gain even if not so fast as radcliffe would have liked and they did find their first rock on the new shore the sea boiled white just above it thats a bad one henry said if the tide runs a little higher itll hide the bastard altogetherbut it wont lift a boat high enough to get over it note the landmarks edward said well chart these waters one day by god we will this isnt right where kersauzon brought us his son said i know edward sighed and nodded at the same time we did the best we could and this is what we got a few leagues north a few leagues south who can say maybe we didnt have the latitude quite right when we were here last maybe we drifted in the fog i dont know but thats atlantis ahead the land where were going to put down roots henry muttered something under his breath edward couldnt make out what it was and supposed he might be lucky he knew richard had more enthusiasm for the new land than henry did well henry was here whether he was glad to be here or not the fishing boats kept fighting toward the alluring coast ahead the only way the wind could have been worse would have been for it to blow straight into their faces no boat could make headway against a directly contrary wind they would have had to drop anchor and wait for it to swing around edward might have been tempted to do that anyway were the land not so nearthe constant tacking wore out the crew with women and children and beasts on deck it was harder more dangerous more aggravating work than it usually would have been too but the hard work had its reward to edward radcliffes way of thinking hard work commonly did the st george dropped anchor in eight fathoms of water as the sun sank toward the newly notched horizon ahead can we get ashore before sunset richard asked only one way to find out edward answered the boat went into the water the fishermen began to row looking around edward spied other boats heading for the beach he hadnt raced francois kersauzon but he did now pull hard damn you he roared and pulled hard enough himself to come close to jerking the thole pin out of the gunwale pull hard no ones going to beat me back to atlantis in a twinkling all the fishermen in all the boats were rowing as hard as they could edward was working harder than he had on the st george but exhaustion fell away he laughed as he worked his oar and shouted out the stroke to the others in the boat and he heard other laughs float across the green sea the men racing to be first ashore werent racing because they had to but because they wanted to and it made all the difference in the world sand and mud grated under the boats keel edward sprang out into ankledeep water mine he shouted throwing his arms wide mine he thought he was the first man on the beach if he was though he wasnt by much other skippers and fishermen stepped out onto the shores of atlantis little gray and brown shorebirds skittered along at the edge of the advancing and retreating waves pausing now and again to peck at something or other they left their tiny hentracks behind to be washed away by the next incoming surge richard set a hand on his fathers shoulder were here again he said we are by god we are edward radcliffe agreed were here again and this time were not going to leave whats that said one of the fishermen whod rowed the boat ashore we arent going back to the st george edward laughed well go back alf but well go back to get what we need to set up a new town here it may be a while before we go back to england i wonder if ill ever go back i wonder if ill want to he thought and then i suppose ill have to one of these days its not the same as wanting to alf nodded he might not be bright but he was willing well thats all right then he said thats what i came for that is the biggest adventure was getting the horses and cattle off the cogs and onto the land ahead some skippers solved it with brutal simplicity by pushing the animals over the side and making them swim others ran their lightly laden cogs aground at low tide and lowered gangplanks so the beasts could descend when the water rose it lifted the fishing boats and let the skippers move them out to sea again where are these honkers you kept telling me about nell demanded as soon as she came ashore she bent to wring out the dripping hem of her skirt giving edward a glimpse of a stillshapely ankle well i dont know just where they are he admitted i expect well see them sooner or later thoughsooner unless i miss my guess we saw a good many when we were here before remembering what else theyd seen before he raised his voice to a carrying shout watch the sky the eagles here are huge and they have no fear of menthey think were prey those little shorebirds had darted betweensometimes even overmens feet too in england or france they would have kept their distance it seemed theyd never met men before and didnt know such creatures were dangerous and that was only a tiny strangeness among so many larger ones the plants were the same curious mixture of conifers ferns and those barreltrunked plants with the leaves that shot up from the top of the barrel the honkerseven if absent at the momentwere like nothing edward or anyone else had seen before and the redbreasted thrushes acted like blackbirds but looked more like oversized robins and all this within an hours walk of the shorefor no one yet had dared venture farther inland some of the first things the newcomers made were salt pans at the edge of the ocean to trap the seawater and let it evaporate leaving salt behind what they got would not be anywhere near so fine as the pure white flower of salt bought in le croisic right this minute though edward worried more about quantity than quality he wanted to be sure he had the salt to preserve enough cod to get the settlers through their first winter on the new shore he didnt worry about having enough cod the banks off the east coast of atlantis were abundant beyond anything hed ever imagined and he knew the great fisheries in the north sea as well as any man alive maybe the north sea was like this when fishermen first started going out there he said after the st georges boat brought in load after load of huge plump gutted fish no more though weve taken the very best out of it and that best is still here it is henry agreed the fish we dont salt down well be able to use to manure the fields he held his nose the smell will be bad but the crops will be good yes edward radcliffe nodded so much to do all at once but this goes so well it frightens me his son frowned frightens you edward nodded again by our lady it does we work we sweat and swink and toil we build and what if some sea wolvesbretons or basques sayswoop down on us with swords and spears and steal all weve made by our labor i know what i want to buy when we see england again whats that henry asked some fine iron guns by god and powder and shot for em edward said a couple here ashore and a couple on the st george too i want to be able to fight if i have to not to be raiders meat after pursing his lips in thought henry also nodded i do like that notion and if were not the only ones putting down roots in this new soil he let the words hang what then edward prompted his sons grin was wide as the ocean between them and hastings why we could turn wolf ourselves i could stay at sea i didnt come here to go warring asea or ashore i came here to get away from all that edward said with the peasants up in arms with the damned frenchmen roaring across the channel with lancaster and york glaring at each other and both ready to swoop theres war and to spare back home if youre so hungry for it henry looked down at his feet you shame me father by god i hope so edward thought but he didnt want to leave henry with no pride so he said i didnt mean to but think on what youre talking about thats all war usually looks better to the fellow who brings it than it does to the poor buggers who have it brought to them mm something to that i shouldnt wonder his son said to his deep relief but then henry pointed a halfaccusing forefinger at him who was just talking about buying fine iron guns i was edward said but i didnt talk about raiding with them only about standing off raiders theres a difference no doubt henry said and edward beamed too soonhenry hadnt finished the difference is after a while you want to try out the guns no matter why you got them in the first place edward radcliffe winced that held too much of the feel of truth it wont happen that way while i have anything to say about it he insisted all right father henry said i hope it doesnt happen for many many years then edward noticed he didnt say he hoped it never happened at all they did call the settlement new hastings the houses they made were of wood not stone because those went up faster cutting back saplings and clearing away the undergrowth were easier than they would have been back in england no berry bushes or wild roses full of thorns and no stinging nettles plowing under the ferns that grew in the shade was even easier than dealing with grass on the meadows and when the crops came in they flourished even before the settlers manured them with fish i dont see any bugs on the plants nell exclaimed is it a miracle ask father john or one of the other priests edward answered maybe the bugs here dont know how to eat our crops or dont like the way they taste is that a miracle richard doesnt like the way squash tastes richard is not a bug nell said since edward couldnt very well argue with that he walked off shaking his head the weather got warm and then warmer it got muggier than it ever did in england too edward had known the like down in the basque country but the people whod spent their whole lives in hastings wilted like lettuce three days after it was picked an eagle swooped down and killed a child it tore gobbets of flesh from the small of the girls back before flying off she died the same way hugh fenner had in other words even though she was already dead father john gave her unction while her mother screamed and screamed they buried her next to the log hut that did duty for a church no stonecarvers were on this new shore yet but at father johns direction the carpenter made a grave marker out of the redtimbered evergreens that seemed so common here rose simmons vibas in deo the inscription read may you live in god how large would the churchyard grow edward dared hope his flesh would end up there and not at sea for fish and crabs to feast on thy will be done lord he thought but not yet please another eagle killed a sheep that would have been a sore loss in englandnot that eagles there attacked beasts so large it was worse here because the newcomers could spare so little a smaller hawk carried off a halfgrown chicken a big lizardbigger than any edward had imaginedate a duckling but there were no foxes that alone helped the poultry thrive edward chanced to be ashore one morning in early summer when a twelveyearold told off to keep an eye on the livestock ran back into new hastings screaming things theres things in the fields like everyone else radcliffe tumbled out of bed he pulled on his shoes and went outside what do you mean things he demanded see for yourself the boy pointed to the bright green growing grain i dont know what they are demons from hell is what they look like they arent demons edward said those twolegged shapes might be strange to the boy but hed seen them before they have the look of something otherworldly father john crossed himself just in case but edward radcliffe shook his head no no father those are the honkers ive been talking about they think weve spread out a feast for them they dont know theyre a feast for us he raised his voice we cant let them eat our grain and trample what they dont swallow get clubs get bows well kill sometheyre good eating mighty goodand drive the rest away when he went out into the fields he saw that these werent quite the same kind of honkers as hed seen the year before they were bigger and grayer and shaggier of plumage their voices were deeper but they showed no more fear of man than the other honkers had you could walk right up to one of them and knock it over the head down it would fall and another one ten feet away would go right on eating if you didnt kill clean thougha man named rob drinkwater only hurt the honker he hit it let out a loud surprised blatt of pain before he could strike again and finish it one of its thick scaly legs lashed forward oof drinkwater said that was the last wordor soundthat ever passed his lips he flew through the air crashed down and never moved again he was all broken inside the honker lumbered off still going blatt the cry got the other enormous birds moving fast as a horse could trot they headed off into the undergrowth every stride knocked down more young hopeful wheat and barley ann drinkwater keened over her husbands body the rest of the settlers stared from the dead honkers to the damaged crops and back again will they come again tomorrow richard radcliffe asked will they come again this afternoon how many of them will we have to kill before the rest decide they shouldnt come those were all good questions edward had answers to none of them well butcher these dead ones he said we can smoke some of the meat or salt it or dry it we cant let it go to waste after that theyre afraid of the damned eagles if they arent afraid of us henry said if we screech like them maybe we can scare off the honkers wed have a better chance if we could fly like them his brother said and edward judged richard likely right numbly the settlers got to work henry carried a pile of honker guts well away from the place where the creature had died he made sure he included the kidneys though they might have gone into a stew if he hadnt he waited in some nearby bushes a hunting bow in his hand down from the sky to the offal spiraleda vulture even the vultures here differed from the ones back in england this one was almost all black down to the skin on its head only the white patches near the base of the wings broke the monotony henry came out and shooed it away before it landed and stole the leavings it flew off with big indignant wingbeats edward watched it go before he realized it had a healthy fear of men he wondered what that meant and whether it meant anything his son went back into cover henry had a hunters patienceor more likely a fishermans patience he was for once applying to life on land and that patience got its reward when an eagle descended on the kidneys and fat much more swiftly and ferociously than the vulture had edward wasnt too far away when it did he was close enough to notice the coppery crest of feathers on top of the great birds head as it tore at the bait henry had left for it with a shout of triumph henry sprang up let flyand missed he couldnt have been more than eight or ten yards away but he missed anyhow the eagle might not have feared men but a sharp stick whizzing past its head startled it it launched itself into the air with a kidney in its beak henry said some things that were bound to cost him time in purgatory he made as if to break the bow over his knee dont do that edward called we havent got many and we havent the time to make more without need either besides its a poor workman who blames his tools i couldnt hit water if i fell out of a boat henry was still furious at himself there there his father soothed as if he were still a little boy youre a fine archerfor a fisherman ha henry made a noise that sounded like a laugh but wasnt keep at it edward said its a good idea if we dont kill these cursed eagles theyll go on killing us and the honkers too henry said theyre as bad as deer or unfenced cattle in the crops how much did we lose today i dont know some not more than we can afford though i dont think edward answered and the eagles are more dangerous than honkers ever could be tell it to poor rob drinkwater tell it to his widow and his orphaned brats a horse or a mule can kick a man to death too edward said thats all honkers aregrazers that go on two legs not four but when god made those eagles he made them to kill henry thought it over then nodded he made them to kill honkers id say and we look enough like honkers they think we make proper prey too edward radcliffe started to say something then stopped and sent his son a surprised glance i hadnt looked at it so damned if i dont think youre right henry walked over retrieved his wasted arrow and put it back into the quiver with the rest well have enough to get through the winter with or without crops seems like he said between the cod and the honkers well do fine aye belike edward said but i want my bread too and lord knows i want my beer if we have to fence off the fields to keep the honkers out well we can do that it will be extra work henry said were all working harder now than we would have on the other side of the ocean now we are yes edward agreed but thats only because we have to make the things we take for granted back there once we have them things will be easier here than they were in england why else would we have come henry laughed you dont need to talk me into it father im already here he made as if to break the bow again but this time not in earnest id be gladder im here if only i were a better archer each cat his own rat edward said plenty of fine bowmen whod puke their guts out on a fishing cog one of the girls was screeching about a rat the other day henry said it must have got ashore in a boati dont think this country has any rats of its own i dont either but i was waiting for that to happen edward said no rabbits here either or none ive seen which is a pity for i like rabbit pie and jugged hare you cant keep rats and mice out of things we brought cats too so there wont be too many vermin i saw a cat with a lizards tail in its mouth yesterday henry said yes and they hunt the blackbirds that look like robins too edward said never worry about cats they dont starve i wasnt worrying henry said next time we go back to england though maybe we could bring some rabbits over theyre good eating and good hunting well maybe we could edward said iv r abbits more chickens and ducks two more sows with their piglets and tom cawthorne a bowyer and fletcher and his family they all came back to atlantis on the st george with the good hunting in the woods back of new hastings edward was glad to get a man like cawthorne the bowand arrowmaker probably wouldnt have come if his oldest son hadnt just got a girl with child dan cawthorne didnt want to marry her and so if you didnt want to marry her why did you sleep with her edward asked the youthhe was seventeen or soonce they got out to sea dan looked at him as if he were not only crazy but ancient why because she wanted me to he answered by the way he said it only a fool could imagine any other reason we didnt think anything would happen dont you remember what its like to he broke off not quite soon enough to have a stiff yard all the time that was what hed been about to say that or something a lot like it and edward did remember his yard still worked well enough but it wasnt stiff all the time the way it had been when he was seventeen he sighed one of these days dan would get older too edward tried again well if you like lying with her so much why wouldnt you wed her the bowyer and fletchers son sent him another you idiot look dont you know judy martin at all master radcliffe he said as soon as she puts her clothes back on she starts talking and youd have to hit her to make her shut up im not even sure that would work edward paid little attention to how much sixteenyearold girls talkedthese days anyhow there had been a time when he could have gone into great detail on the subject but that was thirty years gone for him he laughed and shook his head wondering why he was worrying about this anyhow if anything dan cawthorne had done him a favor if dan hadnt got judy martin in trouble tom cawthorne wouldnt have wanted to leave hastings for an unknown shore right now the shore was unknown to edward too anything could have happened while he made the long round trip to england plague might have broken out there might have been natives in the new country after all despite the signs to the contrary or bretons or galicians or basques might have happened upon new hastings maybe if they had they would have stayed friendly and traded then again maybe not his eye went to one of the two swivel guns the st george now mounted she wasnt a warship she was nothing like a warship which would have had high castles fore and aft packed with archers but she could fight a little now if she had to against what she was likely to meet in atlantean waters that would do the ocean was rougher this time out than it had been on the first journey to settle the new land the wind was more contrary too so the fishing boat stayed at sea more than a week longer before it came to atlantis the cawthornes went greener and greener dans bravado evaporated at one point clutching the rail he moaned i wish i wouldve stayed and listened to judy the rest of my days youll change your mind once we get ashore edward told him dan cawthorne managed a feeble glare why arent you puking your guts out too he asked then as if talking about it reminded him of itwhich it could do for some peoplehe gulped and bent over and started to retch this isnt a bad blow edward said you should see a real storm if you think this is something dan took his right hand off the rail just long enough to cross himself his left kept its death grip god spare me that he choked out and spat something disgusting into the green boiling water when the fishing cog finally reached the banks off the coast of atlantis edward and the rest of the crew started pulling big cod out of the sea dan and tom watched in fascination the cawthorne womenand even dans little brother who couldnt have been more than eightseemed more horrified how can you do that to the poor fish toms wife cried as radcliffe gutted a fat fourfoot cod well mistress louisa wed go hungry if i didnt edward kicked the offal towards one of the sows which fed greedily dont you ever kill any of your own meat louisa cawthorne gave a reluctant nod i do and i cry every time i wring a pullets neck she was a tenderhearted creature then she was tender in other ways too sailing with a woman aboard when your wife wasnt proved an unexpected strain edward kept his hands to himself but his dreams were warmer than the ones he usually had at sea he breathed a sigh of relief when they sighted land at last he didnt see new hastings or the smoke rising from its fires that didnt surprise him he hadnt seen any english fishing boatsor any othersbobbing in the ocean navigation was anything but exact edward wasnt even sure whether he was north or south of the new settlement he shot the sun with his crossstaff then he did it again and then once more if he weighed all three measurements together and gave a little something extra to the one he trusted most he thought the st george lay south of where she should have been most of the fishermen agreed with him nobody was positive though one of the men said well well go north and see what happens if we dont like it in the end we can bloody well turn around edward nodded that sounded about right to him and that very afternoon a fisherman shouted sail ho if she was an english cog everything would be fine if she wasntedward ordered the swivel guns loaded with scrap iron if you got ready for a fight sometimes you could stay away from one the lines of that cog did look familiar edward radcliffe squinted north where had he seen her before he cursed bugger me blind if thats not the morzen sure enough the hail that came was in breton ahoy the st george is that you moses yes that was francois kersauzons voice all right moses edward shouted back what are you talking about you blasphemous toad you mistake me for your mother kersauzon said sweetly and is it not that you have led your people to the promised land i saw your new town and all the cogs in the sea close by youve done well edward well enough to make me jealous they were closing fast on each other radcliffe looked to his guns if he opened fire now maybe he could cripple the morzen and finish her off at his leisure he didnt want anyone jealous of new hastings if francois kersauzon didnt come home to le croisic wouldnt that make other bretons less likely to sail far into the west the temptation but kersauzon hadnt done anything to him or from what edward gathered to new hastings hed done edward a favor in fact by leading him to atlantis yes hed profited from it but hed deserved to if edward returned evil for that great good wouldnt he pay in the next world pay for all eternity he crossed himself he was a believing man he didnt want to imperil his soul and so he waved to the west to the waiting atlantean shore its a broad land francois he said room for englishmen and bretonsand frenchmen and basques too i shouldnt wonder it could be that well end up neighbors here one day then kersauzon replied i always thought englishmen were better at a distance but what can you do his comic shrug was very french he would have got furious had edward told him so instead radcliffe made sure he really was south of the english settlement kersauzon didnt mock him for asking where dead reckoning left off at sea and prayer began was a question every sailor had to face now and then the two cogs parted with fishermen on each calling good luck to the other henry came back to edward as he steered the st george toward new hastings quietly the young man said i wondered if youd fight him edward radcliffe sighed i wondered the same thing but how could i we wouldnt be here if not for him his son sighed too well father its not that youre wrong i only pray you wont spend the rest of your life sorry for being right god forbid it edward said and crossed himself again new hastings thrived how could it do anything else set on fertile soil with the closest enemies an ocean away swarms of fish came out of the sea crops and livestock burgeoned hogs and rabbits got loose in the wild but no one had imagined that they wouldnt not many years went by before honkers grew scarce around the settlement people complained that they had to walk a day or two to find the big flightless birds and kill them the birds couldnt seem to figure out that these strange twolegged creatures were a menace to them redcrested eagles grew scarcer too though not fast enough to suit edward radcliffe the eagles killed a child and a woman and seemed especially fond of the fat above the kidneys of sheep shooting them while they attacked was hopeless shooting them while they perched on the other handthe great fierce birds often sat in trees on the edges of the woods so they could spot honkers grazing in the fields and meadows beyond the eagles did see humans as prey but didnt seem to see them as threats archers could get close to the trees and let fly after a while the eagles around the settlement thinned out mothers still watched their small children more carefully than they would have back in england for the danger from the sky was diminished not gone when edward radcliffe sailed the st george back to england again six years after he first set eyes on atlantis he found the country fallen into the civil war everyone had dreaded so long the port officials at hastings roughly demanded whether he favored the white rose or the red finding they were loyal to the house of york he declared for the white rose himself though in truth he couldnt have cared less whether the king was yorkist or lancastrian he didnt need long to find that most of the people in hastings felt the same way he did who ruled hardly mattered to them all they cared about was that someone should rule and bring the land peace as usual the lords who fought were profoundly indifferent to what the people wanted edward wasnt the trouble in england made people in hastings whod laughed at him on his last visit suddenly eager to find quiet across the ocean marry itd be wonderful to go about my business without worrying about soldiers stealing my stock or burning down my shop a leatherworker said they wouldnt do that in new hastings radcliffe said there are no soldiers in new hastings no soldiers the other man might have had a vision of a miracle isnt that a fine thing he paused scratching his poorly shaved chin dyou need a man who makes leather well we might edward replied id pay the artisan said by god id pay plenty to get away from these swaggering thieves in chainmail i have a daughter whos fifteen and id pay even more to get her away from them i understand that radcliffe said if his womenfolk were here now he would have wanted to get them away too he rubbed his chin getting money for taking new settlers across the ocean hadnt occurred to him till now he wondered why not well see what we can do for you friend i am your friendyour friend for lifeif you take me away from this the leather maker said radcliffe knew not to count on that too much gratitude went bad almost as fast as fish did but it might last to the other side of the sea lets talk he said and so they did the leather maker wasnt the only one who spent silver for his passage that proved just as well because edward had to pay a fat bribe to take the st george out of the harbor even then he left under cover of darkness but he did leave and once he was at sea he didnt worry about anybody catching him once theyd put lands end behind them henry came over to him and said i wonder how long it will be before ships full of people we never heard of start dropping anchor right offshore how would they know where to go edward asked automatically setting himself against the rolling and pitching of the cog in the atlantics long tall swells his son laughed at himone of the less endearing things a son can do to his father word has to be all over the cinque ports by nowlikely all up and down the coast henry answered load what you hope is enough food into a cog sail west and a bit south till you think youre going to fall off the edge of the world and what do you know you end up in atlantis what do you know edward radcliffe echoed in distinctly hollow tones it wasnt that henry was wrong no it was that he was much too likely to be right if you had the nerve to sail the open sea you could come to atlantis and if you were sure atlantis was there if you were sure you wouldnt fall off the edge of the world wouldnt that help you find the nerve to set sail edward clapped a hand to his forehead all the riffraff of the kingdom landing in our laps that wasnt fair riffraff wouldnt be able to sail a cog so far or to afford passage in one but just then anyone he hadnt handpicked to come to new hastings seemed like riffraff to him and henry damn him was grinning not just our riffraff either the younger radcliffe said somewhere between atlantis and le croisic francois kersauzon and his son are talking the same waywhat do you want to bet the land is there more and more people know its there a land with no kings a land with no soldierswhy wouldnt half the folk in the world want to pack up and move to a place like that when edward looked at it that way he could see no reason why lots of people wouldnt want to travel to atlantis either but he said ill tell you one thing son if atlantis does start filling up it will need soldiers soon enough to keep some folk from taking what others have no doubt henry said then the soldiers will start taking on their own because thats what soldiers do i know edward said unhappily he sighed and i suppose thats why we need kingsto keep soldiers from taking too much well sometimes kings can do that henry said and sometimes he didnt go on or need to the war in england theyd barely escaped did most of his talking for him god grant that civil war stay far from atlantis shores edward said im sure he willfor a while his son replied how many of the folk in new hastings stand with the white rose how many with the red i have no idea i never tried to find out edward radcliffe said as long as you can say that and say it truly were safe from civil strife henry said as soon as you know as soon as you need to know yes edward could gauge the political winds along with those of the world may that day stay far away too his sonboth sonshad bumped heads with him a great many times growing up but henry having at last attained manhood himself only nodded now the war of the roses did stay away from the western shores neither yorkists nor lancastrians cared who followed their emblem in the lands across the sea not enough people dwelt there to matter to either side yes the war stayed away but flotsam and jetsam from it did mark atlantis as henry had foretold a good many englishmen thought a land without soldiers and without kings sounded wonderful they swarmed aboard anything that would float and sailed west some of them no doubt starved before they got anywhere close to atlantis it was a long journey across rough seas if the winds went against you if you crammed too many people aboard for the food you carried if you couldnt pull in enough fish to make up for your dwindling store of biscuit if your water butts went dry or got too foul to drink before you sighted landif any of those things happened you were doomed the fishermen who sailed out of new hastings didnt see the worst disasters they saw the folk who planned better but not quite well enough every so often a shipload of living skeletons would come ashore caring for them strained what the settlers could do the land was rich hunting and fishing were good but what would have been plenty for a small village proved a good deal less than that with more mouths to feed edward radcliffe was almost relieved when a wellequipped flotilla from dover founded a new town eighty miles down the coast from new hastings they called the place freetown though some of the people who set it up seemed more interested in running things than he ever had but as he said when he came back from a visit the more the merrier the land can hold them and once they get in a couple of crops theyll be able to help us with the rest of the newcomers the ones who have no notion of what theyre doing will they help or will they just turn them away henry asked theyd better not edwards hands folded into fists if they try to leave us with all those folkwell we wont have it thats all but if theyre proper christian men theyll remember the parable of the good samaritan and if they arent well remind them of it by god henry said edward nodded richard radcliffe seemed discontented in a different way he hadnt gone to freetown he hadnt gone back to england with his father and older brother either when he wasnt working his farm he spent a lot of time staring west how far does atlantis run he asked one winters day whats on the other side of the mountains we can see plenty close to the sea to keep us busy for a while answered the relentlessly pragmatic edward one of these days i expect well find out whats over yonder but wheres the hurry richard might not have heard him id like to head up the brede he said theyd named the closest stream for one that ran not far from the town where they were all born who knows what lies in the forests we could float trees down to new hastings we edward said im not the only one richard replied so much land for the taking i feelfenced in here how did you stand it aboard the st george asked edward who knew his younger son hadnt always had an easy time on the fishing boat richard shrugged what choice had i i couldnt start a farm in englandthe land was all taken if i lived in town id be cramped too so i tried to keep my mouth shut and do what needed doing but here i have choices and i aim to make the most of them well i dont know how i can hold you back if youre bound and determined to go edward said go on then and god bless youand yes well be able to use the timber for houses and for boats eight or ten families went up the brede with richard and his wife and children edward watched them lead their livestock along the riverbank with a curious mixture of pride and fear he didnt know what could go wrong with them in the woods but he worried all the same if anything did they would be too far away for the folk remaining in new hastings to help them in a hurry and they hadnt been gone more than a couple of weeks when a boat came up from freetown the dovermen were in high dudgeon do you know what one of them said in portentous tones not yet edward answered but since i think youre about to tell me i will pretty soon whats your news theres a town full of godcursed frenchmen down the coast from us the freetown man cried frenchmen you say or is it bretons edward asked by our lady it only matters to them the man from freetown said is that francois kersauzons settlement radcliffe persisted the fellow whod been talking just shrugged one of the other new settlers nodded that was their leaders name yes he said they all speak french with a funny accent the ones who speak it at all but i could follow that much i have no quarrel with kersauzon no one here does edward said he was the one who showed us the way to this land we owe him a debt if anything several people standing close by him nodded that wasnt what the men from freetown wanted to hear atlantis should be english atlantis must be english howled the one who liked to hear himself talk we ought to chase those french scuts back across the sea with their tails between their legs do you think theyd stay chased edward inquired would you id kill the french dog who tried to make me leave the freetown man blustered and if i did go id come back with a fighting tail and make the knaves sorry they ever troubled me to begin with radcliffe sighed some men were impressively blind why dyou think kersauzons one pin different if you tell him to go hell spit in your eye if you somehow make him leave hell come back with soldiers himself do you want to farm and fish here or do you want to fight the question sounded sardonic but he meant it some men did fight for the sport of it hed never understood that himself but he knew it was so to him life was hard enough without making it harder still others though used brawls to spice up their days the way cooks used cinnamon and cloves and pepper to spice meats i ought to let the king know he has such spineless subjects here the freetown man grumbled if you do i will hunt you down and kill you edward said matteroffactly as if hed remarked the sun will come up tomorrow and now you have quite worn out your welcome get out if you fight kersauzon who is my friend you may expect to fight me too i tell you that now so you cannot say i will have taken you by surprise and i aim to tell him the same as soon as may be you wont get away with this radcliffe the man from the new settlement said with a shrug edward answered im not trying to get away with anything only a blind idiot would think any different since you do you have named yourself muttering their fists clenched the dovermen got into their boat and went south toward freetown what do we do now henry asked they wont let it liethey arent the sort who could i know edward sighed we always find a serpent in paradise even if we have to bring it with us well need a watch to see that the freetown men dont seek to serve us and the bretons the same way well need to hold the st george between here and freetown for a whilei am glad i got those guns and we really will need to warn francois kersauzon which may provoke the freetown men enough to make them complain of us back in england henry said let them bellow and bawl like branded calves for all i care edward answered will king henry send knights here to make us behave when civil wars aflame back home give me leave to doubt songive me leave to doubt what would you do if he should send knights henry asked well it depends on how many edward said a few our longbowmen can deal with a few knights beshrew me if they cant an army of em an army of em would tell me hes gone quite mad but if he does send so manyif he can send so manywhy then going up the brede with richard looks better and better we can live off the land can knights newly come here do the same i would rejoice to see them try something to that i shouldnt wonder his son said i will thank the lord though if we dont have to put it to the test so will i edward nodded yes by god so will i edward radcliffe took an unarmed cog well out to sea before sailing south he didnt want any of the dovermens fishing boats spotting him his ploy worked the first boat he saw was the breton amzer gaerthe fairweather she would have been in english when he hailed her her skipper thought he was a freetown man and made ready to fight no god butter you and the devil futter you edward shouted in breton im kersauzons friendcant you get that through your bloody thick head take me to him i have news he must hear why should we believe a lying saoz the breton yelled back if you dont know who edward radcliffe is you son of a dog ill board your scow myself and pound some sense through your hard skull the breton fisherman was bigger and younger than he was but backed down before his fierce temper why didnt you say you were radcliffe thats not your st george yes ill listen to youfor a while anyway thank you so much edward said with a mocking bow but i dont want to talk to you i want to talk to kersauzoni know he doesnt keep his brains in his backside where have you hidden this new town of yours cosquer lies southsouthwest of here youll know it by the big rock offshore the breton answered the name made radcliffe smile it meant old village only the bretons would use that kind of name for a place on a barely explored shore obliged to you god give you a good catch he could be polite enoughafter he got what he wanted and you the same saoz gast the other man shouted edward laughed as he swung his cog on the new course how many times had the bretons called him an english whore not enough to make him believe he was one anyhow the rock in front of cosquer was almost big enough to make a small island several of the strange atlantean almosttrees with barrel trunks and leaves sprouting from the tops of them clung to its side as for the village itselfedward laughed again when it came into sight here was a bit of brittany transplanted to a far land all right the thatched roofs had a steeper pitch than they would have in hastings the windows were different too even if the houses were built from wood rather than stone henry was thinking along with him only thing missing is a circle of standing stones in a meadow by the town he said by god youre right edward said damned if id be surprised if the stubborn buggers didnt put some up to remind em of home he pointed isnt that the morzen lying right offshore sure looks like her henry eyed francois kersauzons cog she didnt carry those swivel guns last time we saw her youre rightshe didnt edward frowned those guns were longer and would probably shoot farther than the ones aboard the st george if kersauzon wasnt thinking along those lines before he saw us last maybe we gave him the idea half a dozen men pushed a boat into the atlantic and rowed out toward the cog ahoy englishmen yes that was kersauzons bellow made louder by the hands he cupped in front of his mouth is it you radcliffe no its your motherinlaw come from brittany to nag you edward answered anything but that francois kersauzon cried in mock terror come ashore if you care to and see what you have to nag about ill do that and gladly but first let me say my saythe freetown men are not your friends kersauzon clapped a hand over his heart i am shocked to hear it he said which made edward and henry both chuckle more seriously the breton continued and you say you are against them yes by god edward said i told them the same too you had better come ashore then the breton fishing captain said even across a broad gap of ocean edward could see how wide his eyes got yes you had better come ashore because we have much to talk about lets get our boat in the water edward called to his crew to his son he said would you rather come and dicker with me or stay here and do whatever you have to do in case theres trouble do you need me to help put something over on the bretons henry answered his own question no of course you dont you can diddle them slick as grease all by yourself i thank you for your trust in me edward radcliffe said dryly he didnt faze henry a bit any time the younger man replied we wont have trouble at sea from kersauzons people either right now after what you just said theyd pick you for pope if they had the chance but if the dovermen decide to raid cosquer todayid better stay here all right the fishermen edward chose to row him to kersauzons new village all spoke some breton or at least some french theyd be able to make themselves understood once they made it to dry landand maybe they would hear something the settlers didnt want them to kersauzon waved when he saw the english boat heading toward his a little to edwards surprise the bretons rowers didnt make a race of it they went back to shore sedately instead a couple of the english fishermen sent edward questioning looks but he shook his head why push things theyd get there soon enough any which way and besides warmer here than it is in new hastings he called to kersauzon it was warm enough in fact to make the sweat stand out on his face and unpleasantly sticky too unpleasantly for him at least francois kersauzon made a joke of it you are from the north so you settle in the north and you think chilblains are every mans godgiven rightis it not so we like the weather were used to edward said and left it at that the boats keel grated on hard sand he hopped out and helped haul it farther up the beach kersauzon and his men were doing the same with theirs edward pointed to the land theyd cleared in back of cosquer are those vines youve planted there he asked what else would they be the breton replied beer is all very welli have nothing against beer who could but i want wine too and ill have itsoon not yet mind you but soon maybe we can trade this for that eh maybe we can edward agreed my other sonnot henry whos with me but richardis starting a new settlement deep in the woods before long we may have more lumber than we can use ourselves and who knows what else well find once we look around a bit who indeed youre ahead of us i think even freetownkersauzon pronounced the name as if it tasted bad in his mouthis a year ahead of us but do you say the dovermen want a war with us theyre sure thinking about it theyre thinking hard id say edward answered i told them to their faces id sooner stand with you if they start a fight they didnt care to hear that but i told them anyway you are a gentleman francois kersauzon bowed as if to a nobleman in his own country it could be that cosquer and new hastings should band together and take this freetown pesthole off the map before more trouble comes from it radcliffe had wondered whether the breton would say that not without some regret he shook his head no i dont want to theres enough fighting across the seawhy bring more here thats the other thing you need to know if you strike first at freetown new hastings will stand with her too kersauzon scowled at him some of the other bretons swore one or two of them ostentatiously turned their backs their leader asked who appointed you the man to say who may war and who may not i say nothing of the kind edward answered i only say what will happen if a war does start and if cosquer and freetown move against new hastings together good luck radcliffe said watch your backyoull need to kersauzon stared at him then started to laugh well when youre right saoz gast youre right but how long do you think youll be able to keep the peace all by yourself i dont know as long as i can edward sighed sooner or later something will go wrong we arent in eden so it has to were closer to eden here than we were back home though i feel that in my bones so maybei hopeit will be later not sooner v a n axe on his shoulder like a soldiers spear richard radcliffe strode through the woods of atlantis no man had ever seen what he was seeing now the only tracks in the soft damp earth were the big deep threetoed ones that belonged to honkers and other smaller bird prints the air smelled spicy it smelled green richard thought it made you wish you could fill a bottle with the scent and take it back with you wherever people lived for a while things started to stink smoke and manure and slops and unwashed bodiesgetting away was a relief to the nose moss and ferns grew between the curious barrel trees and the pines that rose above them and the enormous treesredwoods the bretonsd named themthat towered over the pines some of those redwoods seemed a bowshot tall no way to be sure just how immense they were till you felled one and measured it since the monsters were as thick through the base as three or four men were tall that wouldnt happen right away something stared out at richard from behind a barrel tree he stood still and waited his father was right the creatures here had no natural fear of man after a moment this one came out and walked along with a rolling motion that brought a smile to his face oil thrush he murmured not since adam and eve had people needed names for so many new creatures the birds and lizards and snakes of the new land were for the most part unlike any the settlers had seen back in england oh ravens croaked from tree branches and sometimes harried hawks and eagles barn owls glided ghostly through the night forktailed swallows dipped and darted after flying insects they were all familiar enough and the redbreasted thrush that acted and sounded like a blackbird was easy to get used to but the oil thrush it had the shape of one of those redbreasted thrushes some people were calling them robins though they were bigger and less vivid than the redbreasts back home it had the shape yes but it was the size of a chicken or even larger its legs were long and strong its wings too stunted to lift it into the air and its beak richard smiled it was as if someone had made a thrush out of clay and pulled and stretched the beak till it could go no farther it was more than half as long as the oil thrushs body a beak like that might have made a formidable weapon except that the bird didnt seem to realize it could use its beak so the oil thrush stared at richard with a beady black eye its head cocked to one side when he just quietly stood there the bird peered down at the ground instead suddenly that long strong beak stabbed into the dirt when the oil thrush pulled its beak out a plump earthworm wriggled between the mandibles a twist of the birds head and the worm disappeared on waddled the oil thrush six or eight feet farther along the trail it paused again was it listening sniffing richard had no idea but its beak thrust down again and came forth with another worm this one tried to wrap itself around the birds beak to keep from getting swallowed but to no avail richard followed the flightless thrush it looked back at him as if to say that was an unusual thing for anyone to do but then kept walking it didnt seem to take alarm when he bent down and picked up a fistsized stone the gray rock was cool against his palm little bits of mud and moss clung to his fingers he was only a few feet from the oil thrush when he let fly the stone knocked the bird over a startled squawk burst from its throat as a puff of feathers floated up into the air richard finished it off with the axe as always when he hunted here he felt a little guilty it was like playing draughts against an idiot childof course you were going to win but he was hungry and one thing the settlers had found was that the oil thrush made tasty eating he bled and butchered the bird keeping the liver and heart and gizzard to toast over the fire when he buried the rest of the offal a layer of golden fat under the skin led the settlers to give the oil thrush its name back at new hastings and bredestown they rendered the fat over a slow fire and used it in lamps and in cooking and for grease richard didnt have time for that as he cooked the bird some of the fat melted and dripped down into the flames the rest he ate with the dark flavorsome flesh the taste reminded him of woodcock perhaps because both birds lived mostly on worms several different kinds of mushrooms grew close by the fire they looked good he knew a couple of kinds were safe so he ate of them the ones he wasnt sure of he left alone he didnt need to take chances on them not when the hunting was so good and he could roll himself in a blanket and sleep by the fire with very little fear no wolves and no bears here to harry a lone man he did get a surprise the next morning when he found a snake curled up not far from him it slithered in amongst the ferns and disappeared before he could grab a rock or a stick to smash it some snakes here the settlers had found were more deadly than any vipers back in england english poisonous snakes were the size of a mans arm the ones here could be as long as a man was tall they had bigger fangs and delivered more venom he ate the rest of the oil thrush and pressed on every so often he paused to blaze one of the smaller trees the marks would help him find his way home again meanwhilemeanwhile he had atlantis all around him and it was wonderful when he sailed on the st george he would sometimes stand at the bow and look out over the sea the broad sky and the endless everchanging wavescape let him almost forget for a while that he was cooped up aboard a fishing boat when he smelled stale cod the illusion of aloneness in immensity wavered when he had to clamber into his hammock of an evening it vanished altogether here in atlantis it was no illusion fern and shrub and moss pine and redwood and barrel tree honker and oil thrush and redcrested eagle he was alone among them and no thinking being save god himself had ever set eyes on them before the same held true for the serpents and the peculiar frogs and the big snails and the even bigger bugs well almost the same richard was willing to believe the devil had looked at them along with god he picked his way around a marsh dragonflies and darning needles of astonishing size and variety buzzed above the reeds and the stagnant water a bird snatched one out of the air and flew over to a stump with it the bird bashed the dragonfly against the stump till it stopped struggling then wiggled it around till it was in a good position to be swallowed the dragonfly vanished the birds tail bobbed up and down pheebee it sang in a selfsatisfied voice turtles stared at richard from the water they didnt have domed shells like the pond turtles he was used to in england they were flat as flapjacks and as big around as the pan in which a woman might cook flapjacks they had cold yellow eyes and jaws big enough and strong enough to bite off a finger you could catch them with a hook like trout they made good enough eating near the edge of the marsh a honker plucked up water plants with singleminded determination it was of a variety different from the ones that raided the fields in new hastings it was a good deal smaller richard doubted its head would have come up much past his shoulder even if the bird raised it instead of leaning forward as it was doing the ones near the coast could tower over a man if they did that this one was a dull brown all over darker on the back lighter on the belly it didnt have the black neck and white chin patch of the coastal honkers and its feet had more web between the toes than the coastal birds feet did when it honked its voice was higher and lighter than those of the honkers by the coast but it had one important similarity to them it also didnt know it was supposed to be afraid of men it kept right on feeding as richard walked up to it he carried a stout bludgeon on his belt the honker glanced at him but it didnt even try to dodge when he clouted it down it went kicking with the random thrashes any creature from fish to man might make when suddenly killed richard jumped back to make sure those flailing feet didnt catch him they werent aimed his way which didnt mean they couldnt hurt him after the honker stopped twitching he butchered it its heart was almost as big as his fist big enough with a chunk of liver to make a meal he cut off a big chunk of thigh meat to take with him when he traveled on the rest of the carcass he left where it lay hawks and vultures and snakes and lizards were welcome to it he could always find another honker or oil thrush to kill a little farther west as evening fell frogs began to sing they came in all sizes from little peepers no longer than the last joint of his thumb up to baritone croakers large enough to make a cat think twice like so much in atlantis they were at the same time familiar and strange frogs in england sang with small inflated sacs on either side of their throat atlantean frogs by contrast had a single larger throat sac under the chin the frogs croaking couldnt mask another swamp sound the buzz of mosquitoes atlantis had more of them than england did and fiercer ones too summer here got hotter and stickier than it did over there maybe that had something to do with it richard put more wood on the fire hoping the smoke would hold them at bay no matter what he hoped it didnt the bigger fire did let him see farther out into the night though eyes glowed back at him he wasnt frightened as he would have been back in england these eyes were all low to the ground and set close together they belonged to frogs or lizards or snakes no fourlegged killers prowled atlantis wilds darkness deepened the chorus of frogs grew louder and more various a pair of big frogs hopped straight at each other both of them croaking as loud as they could they were only a couple of feet apart when one broke and ran vanishing into the night beyond the campfires bright circle an owl hooted the note was different from the ones english owls used but unmistakable all the same then richard saw a moving light that wasnt paired glowworm he said in delight some people called them fireflies england had only a few in summer they made the air itself here seem to dance something else also scooted through the night air from left to right it was bigger than a mosquito bigger than a glowworm and it didnt dance in the air the way bugs did the motion was straight and not too swift richard scratched his head that straight track also meant it was no bat or nightjar come to feed on the insects drawn to his campfire he scratched his head again in that case what was it had he seen only one such strange scoot he would have shrugged and gone back to eating toasted honker liver he even had coarse sea salt to scatter on his supper after he finished he intended to swaddle himself in his blanket so that if the mosquitoes wanted him they would have to find the tip of his nose then he spotted another of those curious fliers and then another they all came from the left and vanished to the right what the he said climbing to his feet atlantis was full of surprises he seemed to have run into another one one that made his curiosity itch he walked out about as far from the fire as he thought the things were flying as like as not he thought ill scare them away he shrugged if he did he would go back to the honker liver that was all but he didnt one of them whatever it was scooted right past in front of his face startled he grabbed for it but he missed another one went by he missed that one too and swore the trouble was he could see them only when they came close to the fire that didnt give him much time to catch them it would have to be luck then if they kept coming he was bound to snag one sooner or laterwasnt he after five or six fruitless lunges he started to wonder then he did catch one the cool moist smack against the palm of his hand made him wonder whether he was glad to have it even as his fingers closed what have i got he said out loud he turned so that firelight would help him and opened his hand a little frog green with streaks of yellow stared up at him out of big black eyes it looked like any other tree frog hed ever seenexcept for its hands and feet the fingers and toes were ridiculously long with webbing stretched between them the frog had to use those webs to glide through the air the way a ship used sails to push it along richard started to laugh he set the frog down on the ground it hopped off into the darkness the way any other little frog might have he wiped his hand against his trousers atlantis he said you wont find another place where the birds dont fly and the frogs damn well do laughing still he went back to his supper these days edward radcliffes bones creaked when he got out of bed in the morning sometimes sitting by the fire for a while or going out into the warm sun would get him moving again almost as freely as he had when he was younger sometimes he creaked and ached from dawn to dusk and woke up aching if he had to ease himself in the night hard to believe fifteen years had gone by since francois kersauzon talked him out of a third of his catch in exchange for a secrethard to believe till he looked around anyway new hastings was more than a village at the edge of unknown wilderness nowadays it was well on the way to becoming a town farms and mills went up the river all the way to bredestown and beyond whenever richard came back from a journey into the woods he kept muttering that he would have to pull up stakes and move west again things were getting too crowded where he was edward didnt think that would change either the war of the roses went on and on in england once people had had their homes plundered and burnt once men had been robbed and killed and women violated the idea of getting on a ship and heading for a strange land across the sea no longer seemed so frightful and so new hastings swelled as did freetown settlers founded other towns up and down the northern part of the east coast of atlantis francois kersauzons cosquer also flourished two or three other breton villages grew not far away from it edward had heard that there were basque and galician settlements in the southern regions of the new land but he didnt know for a fact whether that was so the bretons came up to new hastings to trade most of them still wanted nothing to do with freetown no folk from the spanish kingdoms had turned up here yet still it had to be only a matter of time when radcliffe looked west toward the mountains no man had yet visitednot so far as he knew anyhowwhat struck him was how much things had changed since he founded new hastings the dark forests of pine and redwood had been driven back for miles replaced by farmlands and meadows and groves of apples and pears and plums that were still young but now starting to yield fruit its not so bad here now is it nell he asked his wife not so bad as it was when we first came here thats sure enough she said and you got to go back to england too me i was stuck here all that time he frowned if you think all that sea voyaging was easy or funwell you should have tried it yourself is all i have to say nell didnt back away from an argumentshe never did we had to make do here when there wasnt enough to make do with before we had a blacksmith breaking a tool was as bad as it could be because we couldnt get another one whatever it was and the first houses were sorry affairs everyone who was here made a better shipwright than a proper carpenter no danger of going hungry though edward said and nell couldnt very well argue with that between the cod the fishermen pulled from the offshore banks and the big foolish honkers there was always plenty to keep a mansor a womansbelly full his wife did say i missed bread till the crops started coming in the way they should edward only shrugged when a fishing boat ran out of biscuit men lived on what they could catch he didnt much care what he ate as long as he had plenty of it you hardly see honkers any more not here by the seaside nell remarked still plenty of them inland they still make good eating and as long as they come down into the fields to steal what we plant what else are we going to do but kill them edward said oh i know but the landscape seems soso ordinary without them i was thinking the same thing or close enough edward smiled at his wife if they didnt think the same way a lot of the time they wouldnt have stayed as happily married as they had one of these days it will be hard to tell atlantis from england no it wont nell said at once in england the nobles and the kings men can tell ordinary people what to do they can take our money and use it to hire soldiers who steal from us none of that foolishness here by our lady not yet anyhow edward said i wonder how long it will be before some duke or earl fits out a ship with guns and comes across the ocean to try to tell us what to do to try to squeeze money out of us you mean nell said thats what it comes down to in the end well so it is edward agreed i just thank heaven we havent had a fight with freetown and we havent got into a brawl with the bretons yet either tell me thats not coming too make me believe it i wish i could his wife said we didnt leave all our troubles behind when we came over here did we radcliffe shook his head i wish we would have but its too much to ask for we have more room here so not all of them show up the way they did back home but they arent gone as if to prove his point a lookout on the beach winded a horn that meant a strange ship was nearing new hastings edward hurried into his house and came out with an axe he wasnt young and he wasnt spry but he didnt need to be either to defend the home hed built from nothing he hurried down toward the muddy strand but it wasnt a strange ship approachingit was henrys cog the rose she wasnt the white rose or the red rose simply the rose no one here saw any point to angering whichever side eventually won the civil war she was made from atlantean lumber her sails were made from atlantean wool danes and norwegians used woolen sails they were heavier and baggier than linen but the flax crop here was just beginning to come in unlike richard henry didnt mind putting to sea in anything at all edward thought his older son had traveled farther up and down the coast of atlantis than any other man alive this run the rose was coming up from the south henry proved that when he came ashore he had a strange bird on his shoulder it was bright green with a yellow head a red face and a large hooked beak it squawked shrilly then said something in a language edward recognized thats basque by god he said what does it mean i dont know but itll start a fight in any tavern full of those oneeyebrowed buggers henry answered is the devil teaching birds basque now edward asked is he trying to make liars out of the people who say he cant learn it himself or did you find the settlement people have been talking about i found it gernika theyre calling it after a place in their country henry said they picked a good spot for it most ways a river bigger than the brede flows into the ocean there and an island offshore makes the harbor as well shielded from bad weather as any ive ever knownit puts new hastings and cosquer to shame but by our lady father its hot down there the worst of summer here seems like nothing beside it and sticky your clothes melt to your skin you stink all the time if you dont bathe or even if you do and you come down with rashes and ringworms and i dont know what all else well then theyre welcome to it edward said how can they make a living in country like that why would they want to settle there the land is richno way around that his son replied you stick a seed in the ground and you have to jump back in a hurry or the growing plant will poke you in the eye and the hunting is good they said edward radcliffe raised an eyebrow they said that where did you learn basque from your bird clarence here speaks more of it than i do and thats the lords truth henry said but some of the basques down there know enough french to get by and i do too you speak better but i can get along all right gernika is it edward clucked to himself we do need to start mapping this coast too many different folk settling along it to manage without knowing who lives where building a new village too close to somebody elses holding is the easiest way i can think of to start a fight im doing it as best i know how henry said im not the best chartmaker in the world but anything here is better than nothing we can know latitudes anyway and curves of the coast better than nothing as you say edward paused remembering what henry had said a moment before what do you mean the hunting is good there what have they got that we dont well for one thing they have snakes big enough to swallow a honkerplenty big enough to swallow a man henry answered and theyve got these river lizards i dont know what else youd call them but they arent lizards the way we have lizards in england or even like the ones herebig as your arm these are lizardsfifteen or twenty feet long with big mouths full of big teeth they eat turtles and honkersand people too if you arent careful down by the riverbank their hides make good leather the basques showed me some they sound likewhats the name for the creatures in the good book edward radcliffe snapped his fingers in annoyance dammit i cant recall bishop john would know henry suggested he would yes edward didnt sound thrilled he knows almost everything if you dont believe me just ask him henry laughed for all the world as if his father were joking but finding a name for those big river lizards kept bothering edward he and henry went to the church at the center of new hastings it was only whitewashed redwood but it was as far as he knew the finest in atlantis and bishop john paunchier and grayer than he had been when he set out from england all those years before looked the very model of a prelate the radcliffes spelled out their problem for him those sound like crocodiles john said gravely crocodiles edward nodded thats what you call the things i couldnt hook the name to save my life you ever see one father youll remember what they are from then on henry said the basques have their own word for them too but to me it sounds half like sneezing and half like spitting basques bishop john asked i know you took the rose south henry but i dont know what you foundbesides crocodiles i mean henry told him in less detail than hed given his father plenty of time for that later the prelate heard him out then said more and more folk flock to this shore i thank god that we havent yet brought our wars across the sea with us i think yet is the word edward radcliffe said i fear its only a matter of time though john crossed himself i shall pray you are mistaken oh i pray for the same thing your grace radcliffe said but i want to be ready all the same in case god doesnt feel like listening henrys wife was a slim redhead named bess she clung to him outside the new hastings church as if the rose were another woman and not a ship at all must you go away so soon she asked it seems you only just got home he kissed her sensing that was some of what she wanted it only made her cling tighter though and start to cry we have to learn what sort of land we have here he said we have to know how big it is how wide do we have to find out right this minute bess flared do you have to do all the finding yourself its not like that henry said richard goes off into the woods for weeks at a time and and it drives his wife wild bess seemed bound and determined not to let him finish a sentence do you think bertha and i dont talk about it we have to talk to each other lord knows we dont get much chance to talk to the two of you we need to explore henry said if we didnt if you didnthis wife poke him in the chest with a bluntnailed forefinger to make sure he understood that you was a singularyou could settle down and farm and spend more time with me and your children would that be so dreadful you didnt fuss this much when i left hastings on fishing runs henry said sometimes id be gone longer then than i am on the trips i take these days his wife eyed him with a curious mix of exasperation and affection in those days you had no choice if you didnt help your father bring in the cod we wouldnt eat but now you dont have to go wandering neither does richard you do it anyway both of you do it anyway its not right its not fair her voice broke more tears swam in her seagreen eyes henry had never talked things over with his brother he didnt know how they stood with richard he only knew for himself if i stayed on a farm all the timeit wouldnt be you love he wanted to make sure he said that because it was the truth but if i stayed in the same place all the time if i saw the same things around me all the time he shook his head something inside of me would die id be living in a cage and the rose isnt bess crossed herself mary pity women richard thought a ship was a cage but richard also had to think a farm was a cage hed proved that again and again so instead of putting to sea hed thrust deeper into the atlantean wilderness than any man alive didnt it add up to if not the same thing then something not so very different deeper into the wilderness than any man alive henry suddenly realized he couldnt be sure of that bound to be restless bretons restless basques even restless dovermendeeper into the wilderness than anyone whod started from new hastings anyhow that would do bess shook her head she said the rose under her breath in a tone not far from hatred but then she went on whats the use if i burnt that cursed scow to the waterline youd only go and build another one and youd enjoy doing it too by the way she said it that was the worst crime of all and she wasnt even wrong henry had enjoyed building the rose if he had to craft another cog he thought he could do a better job the next time he kissed bess again not sure whether that would make things better or worse he wasnt sure after hed done it either he was sure of one thing though ive got to go ill be back before too long it will only seem like forever bess said bitterly he kissed her one more time some men who went to sea for weeks and months at a stretch worried about their wives being unfaithful while they were away some men who went to sea for weeks and months at a stretch had children that looked like their neighbors who stayed home people mostly didnt talk about such things which didnt mean they didnt happen henry didnt worry about bess he knew he could count on her and he didnt reward her for her fidelity by going into strange women when he came into a strange portnot very often anyhow if hed brought home the gleets and passed them on to her she would have been even less happy with him than she was now come back to me do you hear bess said i always have henry answered i always will i pray i always will he walked out onto the beach right up to the edge of the atlantic and waved out to the rose the mate waved back the cogs boat went into the water a couple of fishermen rowed it toward shore one of these days the settlers would have to build jetties out into the ocean so cogs could tie up more conveniently either that or they would have to find a proper sheltered harbor instead of this bare stretch of coast open to wind and sky if they did new hastings might wither away henry shrugged bess wouldnt like that but to him one place on land wasnt much different from another like his father he only felt at home with a rolling pitching deck under his feet the boats keel scraped sand and mud hop in skipper one of the fishermen said bide a moment henry turned back to wave to bess and blow her a kiss she waved back both rowers snickered they were bachelors they didnt understand how a woman could get under a mans skin and into his heart he hoped they would find wives for themselves one of these days more men than women came to atlantis so it wasnt a sure bet he wondered whether that was so for the bretons and the basques if they had more girls than menwell wouldnt that make a strange sort of commerce among the new settlements but from what hed seen farther south it seemed more likely to be the same with them as it was here ready to fare north this time the other fisherman asked as they started back to the rose damned if im not sam henry answered we wont stew in our own juices sailing that way anyhow only a couple of little settlements that anyone knows about north of new hastings too most of what we find will be new that anyone knows about yes sam said but who can guess whether theres a pirates nest up there not likely henry said wed know if there were pirates because theyd prey on us weve lost a couple of boats since we came here but nobody thinks it was on account of anything but bad weather and uncharted rocks plenty of both to go around lord knows youre not wrong there sam admitted still and all though what do we know about those other settlers maybe they fish part of the time and farm part of the timeaye and steal part of the time too whenever they see the chance maybe they do henry said sam had a notion of what he was talking about henry couldnt swear hed never turn pirate himself if the chance for a big haul appeared out of nowhere if he was sure he could get away with it and not start a feud that would hurt him and his for generations yet to comewell who could say what hed do if something like that came along the rose carried swivel guns to ward off raiders which didnt mean she couldnt turn raider herself he clambered up the nets stretched along her port side sam and geoffthe other rowercame right behind him the fishermen in the cog grabbed hold of their hands as they scrambled up over the gunwale and pulled them aboard then they brought in the boat stowing it abaft the mast the mate was a broadshouldered fellow named bartholomew smith are we ready henry asked him ready as well ever be he answered weighing anchor is all that wants doingand then we find out what happens when we get colder instead of hotter youre not old enough to remember fishing runs in the north sea henry said count your blessings that youre not this could be something like that then why are we doing it smith asked if we dont someone else will for henry that was reason enough and more vi o cean when you looked west from the roses bow there was nothing but ocean how far henry radcliffe wondered all the way to cathay all the way to the edge of the world where it spilled off in gods waterfall all the way to some land as unimaginable as atlantis had been when henry was a young man he didnt know how could he he wanted to hungered to find out but that was a voyage for another time with another ship the rose was a fine coasting vessel and the best job a gang of amateur shipwrights could have done when they hacked her out of timber for striking out across the broad stormy atlantic to shores unknown well no where now skipper bartholomew smith asked whenever henry heard that he started to look around to see where his father was but edward radcliffe stayed behind in new hastings he still put to sea to fish or to go down the coast to one of the other settlements heading off to nowhere for the fun of it though was beyond his old bones and creaking muscles or maybe he just thought the rose didnt have much of a chance of coming back from nowhere and maybe he was right but if he was he judged with an old mans sour wisdom henry hoped that kind of judgment passed him by yet if enough years piled onto him it probably wouldnt where now he echoed west along the coast for a while and well see what it does if it goes straight we do the same if it tends south we follow if it tends northwell we still follow but i wont like it so well who would the mate replied cant run all the way up to iceland though or the squareheads would have found this country a long time ago henry grunted he hadnt thought of that and he should have we wont go hungry anyhow he said plenty of little fish to net out and plenty of birds getting fat feeding on them even as he spoke a brightbilled puffin plunged into the sea and came out holding three or four sardines murres and auks and guillemots also preyed on the abundant fish so did bigger birds that looked like auks but seemed unable to fly they swam like small porpoises instead smith must have been thinking of them for he said shame we cant render some of these birds down to oil like the thrushes ashore theyd yield tun after tun devil take me if they wouldnt we ought to think about setting up a trying works here henry said not just for the birds but for the whales too hed seen several of the big beasts blowing and breaching not far from the rose if one of them had risen right under herthere were all kinds of reasons why ships didnt come home far as the whales go im surprised we didnt find the damned basques up here ahead of us bartholomew smith made some gabbling noises that were supposed to be basque henry laughed even if the mates imitation didnt sound much like the real thing theyre whaling men all right he agreed there were no more intrepid whalers than the basques they had their reasons too like any other fish whale meat was allowed during lent and on fridays henry himself was mighty fond of salted whalecraspoix the french called itand peas the big auklike birds were easy to catch like so many of atlantiss creatures they were ignorant of men some of the flying sea birds behaved the same way but others were warier henry wondered what that meant did some of them stay in atlantean waters all the time while others flew to lands where men were liable to hunt them or were some simply stupider than others a nice question but one he had no idea how to answer before the rose got very far west at all her progress slowed even though the wind remained favorable the water through which she sailed changed color too turning lighter and bluer than it had been before it was also noticeably warmer than the stretch of ocean from which theyd just come strong current henry remarked right strong smith agreed seems to scoot along the shore here it does might almost have been put here to make sure we dont get anywhere in a hurry henry said you dont suppose the mate sounded alarmed even by the standards of his age and trade he was a superstitious man by the standards of his age and trade henry wasnt no i dont think anything of the kind he answered old scratch has better things to do than worry about the likes of us or i hope he does anyhow he crossed himself on the off chance bartholomew smith did the same thing i hope so too his voice quavered a little satan did seem busy elsewhere just as henry hoped the coast soon started tending southward strong breezes blew down from the north to push the rose on her way she didnt travel as fast as she might have for the current coming up from the south fought against her but she did travel and the warm current seemed to bring balmy weather with it as it came they still lay far to the north of new hastings but the climate here in the west was far milder than it had been on atlantis eastern shore i wonder what its like here come winter henry said foggy i warrant smith replied all this warm water striking cold airmight make london look to its laurels have you ever seen london henry asked the mate shook his head why on earth would a hastings fisherman want to go and see london have you skipper no never once henry admitted well there you are bartholomew smith said and ive been a new hastings fisherman as long as you have and i dont much want to go back across the sea any more either by god i like it here so do i any land where no lord can tell you what to do and you dont owe taxes to anybodyi like that fine henry said when they found a goodsized stream flowing into the ocean they rowed the water butts ashore to refill them a gaggle of honkers stared at them in mild curiosity as if to say youre the strangestlooking birds weve ever seen they were the strangestlooking honkers henry had ever seen they were a pale gray with orange feet and beaks their wings were bigger than those of any variety near new hastings though still utterly useless as far as getting them off the ground was concerned one of the honkers puffed up its chest and flapped its silly wings at another honnnk it screeched the other bird skittered away as well as something as tall as a man and considerably heavier could skitter getting the water butts back onto the boat once they were filled was slow careful work if you made a mistake you could put one right through the bottom henry was calling out instructions when the rambunctious honker ambled up to him perhaps because he was making noise it seemed to think him some kind of rival it went through the same sort of display it had with the other honker puffing itself up flapping its wings and making a noise like a badly played horn full of spit henry straightened up he was he noted with satisfaction a couple of inches taller than the orangelegged honker he jumped up and down he waved his arms yaaah he yelled at the top of his lungs the honker started at him in birdbrained disbelief then with a piglike grunt of dismay it backpedaled turned and hastily retreated the fishermen cheered henry to the skies well done skipper sam cried i didnt know you spoke its language laughing henry answered hell its got to be easier to learn than basque and if it decided to give me more trouble i could always clout it over the head that works pretty well with the damned basques too sam said it does henry agreed but theyve got harder heads than honkers and theyre liable to try and clout first youre right about that cant trust any of those foreign folk bartholomew smith said it never occurred to him or to henry or to sam or to any of the other englishmen that foreigners might feel the same way about them in fact the mate added bugger me blind if we can trust those bloody dover bastards either freetown free my arse he spat to show what he thought of the neighboring settlement sam nodded the bretons are a better bargain than the dovermen even if kersauzons getting old your fathers right about that skipper yes henry tried not to sound too glum thinking that francois kersauzon was getting old reminded him that his father was too the graveyard back of the church already had its share of headstones and more he didnt want to think about its having one more in particular and thinking about death and dying reminded him of something else keep an eye out for eagles he called wherever we find honkers chances are well find them too theyd grown scarcer around new hastingsand from everything he could see along the rest of the eastern coast as well but men were new in these parts the redcrested eagles would think they were nothing but strange honkersnothing but food to his relief the work party got the water butts loaded and back to the rose without trouble honkers watched without understanding as the cog weighed anchor and sailed south fishing in the warm current that ran up the west coast of atlantis wasnt anywhere near so fine as it had been farther east there were fewer sea birds to nab too their numbers depended on those of the fish they ate every so often then the rose would come in close to shore honkers were never hard to find and never hard to kill their smoked and salted meat fed the fishermen on the journey south dont know what wed do without them henry radcliffe said cutting a slab of meat from an enormous thigh wed go hungry thats what sam said grease ran down the fishermans chin im glad theyre so stupid henry said it makes hunting them so easy you almost feel ashamed sam shook his head not me id be ashamed of starving when you can just knock them over the head the men who went ashore to kill the honkers also came back with pine cones which had tasty seeds other than that thoughno berry bushes one sailor grumbled youd think thered be swarms of them too in weather like this nice and damp but not too coldfeels like spring every day henry nodded that was nothing but the truth i wonder why there arent he said none by new hastings eitheronly the ones we brought from england not many proper trees either the sailor said no oaks no elms no chestnuts no willows no apples or pears or plumsbloody pines and these redwood things and ferns like there should be fairies flitting through them havent seen any god be praised sam said no more wee folk in atlantis when we got here than men dont let bishop john hear you talking of fairies and wee folk or hell give you a penance you wont fancy henry warned them they both nodded you might believe in such things but you didnt talk about them where churchmen could overhear theyd make you sorry if you did up in the crows nest the lookout sang out theres an inlet ahead before long henry could see it from the deck too an opening a couple of miles across with the sea entering to some considerable distance he nodded to bartholomew smith wed better go in and see what we have there aye skipper the mate nodded could be a prime harbor he laughed could be i mean if there were any people here and if there was anything to ship from here and if there was any place youd want to ship it to from here damn it bart if youre going to grumble about every little thing henry said the mate and the rest of the fishermen laughed a few minutes later a breeze from out of the northwest wafted the rose through the inlet and into the calm waters of the bay everyone looked around trying to see every which way at once oh my sam said softly and that summed things up as well as anything the bay widened out to north and south beyond the inlet leaving the best and biggest natural harbor henry had ever seen he nodded to bartholomew smith well you were right he said i couldnt have been much righter the mate replied almost makes me want to settle here just to make sure nobody else does right again henry said by our lady what an anchorage you could put a navy here or a flock of pirates smith said you named the trouble there henry pointed out what would they have to steal this is a bare shore he paused thoughtfully well its a bare shore now maybe it wont be one of these days but not yet gulls and terns wheeled overhead white wings flashing in the sun ducks and geese bobbed in the greenblue water of the bay a shag plunged from on high emerging with a fish in its beak ashore redwoods taller than a spire speared the sky the more henry looked around the more he too wanted to stay now all at once he understood what had pushed his brother ever deeper into the forests of atlantis you wanted to find something like this to be the first one ever to set eyes on it to think it was all yours if only for a little while he looked east toward the shore there half expecting to see richard coming out from the treesnot that he could have seen a man at such a distance but richard hadnt even crossed the mountains yetor if he had he hadnt admitted it somewhere here therell be a river coming in henry said we can fill the butts at its mouth and after that after we clear the inlet again i think its time to head home we wont find anything finer than this whatll we call this place sam asked paradise bay bartholomew smith suggested im not sure god would like that henry said the mate went on plumping for his favorite but henrys point carried the day well what do we call it then smith grumped scowling at his shipmates henry had a name on the tip of his tongue but it didnt want to come off whats the name of the land that was supposed to lie off the coast of england the one where morgan le fay took arthur avalon three fishermen called out at the same time avalon thank you henry nodded that was supposed to be a wonderful country it should do for this place eh nobody said no even bartholomew smith unbent enough to allow well you could have done worse and i thought you were going to avalon it is then well get water and meat before we sail out again henry said we wont find a finer place to do it thats sure a river did run into the bay they named it the arthur they filled the water butts there then spent some time skylarking in the pure cool water henry radcliffe fought shy of that the water was too cool for him avalon bay seemed locked in an eternal april farther south along this coast perhaps some other anchorage basked in an eternal july that would suit him better for splashing and snorting and ducking skylarkinghis smile went wistful his grandchildren wouldnt know what a skylark was he hadnt seen one or heard its explosion of song from on high since coming to atlantis horned larks hunted bugs here but their more musical cousins hadnt crossed the ocean honkers came down to the river to drink knocking them over the head was as easy as it usually was you had to be careful to do the job right that was all if you didnt a wounded bird would kick your guts out through your back but as long as you killed clean you could go through a whole flock and knock one bird after another over the head the honkers would stare in surprise but what was going on didnt register as danger to them when they saw the widewinged shape of a redcrested eagle in the sky though they would scramble for the closest trees honking and gabbling in alarm they knew the eagles meant to kill them and fleeing gabbling honkers meant the fishermen had to beware maybe the eagles thought they were honkers too maybe the fiercebeaked birds didnt care but they would strike at men without hesitatinglike the honkers they didnt know enough to be afraid to henrys way of thinking the eagles were only thorns on the rose nostalgia again no wild roses hereonly the few brought from england and the ones sprung from their seed if we had our women with us id start a town here today he told the mate as is next summer will have to do it will likely do well enough too smith replied were the only ones whove ever seen this place and i praise god for that too anyone who did see it would want it henry said well skipper i wont quarrel about that smith said getting out of avalon bay wasnt quite so easy as getting in had beenanother thorn on the rose the rose herself had to wait till a warm breeze blew off the land and wafted her out through the opening and into the rougher waters of the atlantic once more a few of the fishermen needed to run for the lee rail when the cog started behaving like a restive horse once more damned if i didnt lose my sea legs there one of them said sheepishly spitting into the drink to get the last of the puke out of his mouth youll have plenty of chances to get them back henry said he steered the rose straight west out into the ocean if the wind suddenly shifted he wanted to put some distance between the cog and the land behind her clawing off a lee shore in a storm was every sailors blackest nightmare and then he got his biggest surprise since he watched his father agree to pay francois kersauzon a third of his catch for the secret of the bretons fine new fishing ground sail ho the man in the crows nest cried sail ho off the starboard bow henrys first thought when the shout went up was outrage pure and simple how dared anyone but he come into these waters then fresh wonder filled him the other ship was coming out of the northwest did legendary cathay lie beyond atlantis was the great khans fleet stumbling onto this new land at the same time as he was wouldnt that be a marvel wild beyond belief before long he could see the other ship from the roses deck a wry smile spread across his face how likely was it that the great khan built his ships to look just like the cogs the men of western europe had known for generations not very not unless henry missed his guess then he made out the oaktree flag and a slow smile spread across his face whatever else that ship held it wasnt fearsome warriors from cathay bartholomew smith realized the same thing at the same time bugger me blind if they arent a bunch of bloody basques he said and the men on the other cog would be able to see englands red st georges cross on white would they be wondering about the rose the same way henry was wondering about them better not to take chances load the guns henry said quietly dont make a fancy show of it but do it you never can tell what foreigners have in mind to the basques englishmen were foreigners henry squinted across the narrowing gap of sea yes they carried guns too yes they were also loading them henry swore under his breath he didnt want to fight dammit but he didnt want that other cog to be able to rake the rose with impunity either one of the basques pointed toward henrys ship like most of the men from that corner of the world he was darkhaired and heavybearded he wore linen and wool not quite in the same cuts as an englishman would have but not so very different either all the basques on the other cog were dressed that way all the basques were yes but not all the people were beside henry the mate pointed who are those funnylooking bastards up near the bow i dont know ive never seen folk like them henry stared like the basques the strangers had black hair but their chins were smooth and their skins werent just tannedthey were coppery their clothes were in shades of buff and brown made from hides henry wondered he cupped his hands in front of his mouth ahoy the basque ship parlezvous francais surely somebody over there would know a language you didnt have to be born a basque to speak and somebody did hello englishmen one of the men on the basque cog yelled back yes we understand you who are your friends are they from cathay henry asked all the basques who spoke french thought that was the funniest thing theyd ever heard no by god their spokesman answered they say they are pattawatomi they say theyre what henry wondered if the last was a word in basque but evidently not for the man in the other cog repeated it pattawatomi its the name of their clan or tribe where did you find them henry asked i didnt think atlantis had any people of its own before answering the basque talked with some of his countrymen then a little reluctantly he said no they arent from atlantis well then henry said more confabulating on the other ship at last and even more reluctantly the basque spokesman pointed west there is another land a new land about ten days sail that way we thought we were the only ones who came to this side of atlantis a new land with people in it how can it have people in it when atlantis has none with a shrug the basque replied if you want to know how ask god i cannot tell you that but i can tell you it is the truth and here are these pattawatomis to prove it the men in skins eyed him impassively they had broad faces with high cheekbones and strong noses one of them held a wooden club with a ball of polished stone in the head i will tell you another thing this new land is largemaybe even as large as atlantisso why not the basque said if it had no folk of its own it would be better to settle than atlantis is why when it is so much farther from everything henry asked because the trees and the animals are more like the ones we know there are oaks with acorns growing on them and there are squirrels in the oaks too not red squirrels like ours but gray ones stillthey are squirrels where will you find oaks or squirrels in atlantis did you see honkers or redcrested eagles we saw eagles but smaller than the ones in atlantis they have white heads and eat fish like our sea eagles we saw no honkers only ordinary geesebut they have black heads and white chins like some honkers we heard wolves howling in the night wolves were almost hunted out of england your new land is welcome to them henry said we have them at home i used to hear them howling outside my village in the wintertime the basque said they would kill sheep once in a while if they got hungry enough they would kill men what will you do with the pattawhoevertheyares henry asked i dont know yet the basque replied maybe well trade with them and take them back to the new land one of these days maybe well just keep them and put them to work they look strong dont they the two cogs had come close enough to give henry a good look at the copperskinned men from the unknown country they did look strong they were taller than most of the basques even sothey look like warriors to me they shoot bows and they have those clubs but we saw no iron among them the basque said no helms no swordsthey have knives but theyre made of chipped stone we can beat them if we have to yes but can you make them work if you keep them in atlantis like i said it could be well find out where are you bound now the basque changed the subjectnot very smoothly back to new hastings henry gave him the truth he didnt have ten days worth of supplies aboard the rosenot this trip god keep you safe on your voyage back to gernika god keep you headed south of west you wont spy avalon bay thennot if hes kind you wont again the spokesman talked things over with other men before replying not too obtrusively english gunners stood near their swivels if the basques wanted trouble they could have it and youyou go with god as well the basque said after a long long pause the two cogs passed each other men on the other vessel looked ready to shoot too the range lengthened lengthened some moreand pretty soon it was too long for the guns the rose carried only as the tension slid out of his spine did henry realize how tight hed been strung more new lands he murmured new lands beyond atlantis i wouldnt have looked for that it seemed big enough by itself theres land west of iceland bartholomew smith said you talk with some of the squareheads and youll hear about it but its as cold as iceland is or maybe worse they dont go there very often ive heard some of those stories too henry laughed i always had trouble believing them and here we are in a new land of our own and now with news of more new lands beyond i ought to do penance for doubting well skipper if everybody did that who ought to youd have plenty of company the mate said me im just glad we didnt have a sea fight on our hands so am i they were thinking about sinking us to keep their secret if they thought they could get away with it they would have done it too smith nodded cant keep a new land secret forever though were likely lucky those copperskinned fellows never sailed east and found atlantis ahead of us i think youre rightthey looked like men who could fight they did henry radcliffe agreed but if they cant work ironeven the irish bogtrotters can do that turn your back on one and hell take a knife and let the air out of you like a boy poking a pigs bladder with a stick no doubt about it smith said well between avalon bay and the miserable basques well have a deal of news when we get home henry looked over his shoulder the basque cog was still sailing southwest away from the rose that gave him a better chance of seeing new hastings againand it gave the pattawatomis a better chance of seeing gernika he wondered what they would make of the basque town he wondered if hed ever find out the pier didnt push out as far into the sea as henry would have liked but it was there and it hadnt been when he sailed north from new hastings he was glad to be able to tie up at it instead of anchoring offshore and then rowing in as hed done more times than he could count a gull strutted along the planking plainly it thought the pier had gone up for its benefit alone it fixed him with a yellow stare and skrawked at him as he walked past how dared he a mere man profane the timbers where its webbed feet had gloriously preceded him as soon as he was walking on solid ground and not on those gullhonored planks his wife almost flattened him with a hug after he untangled himself from herwhich took a while because he didnt want tohis father spoke dryly im glad to see you too henry and im glad to be seen not having seen edward radcliffe for some months henry wondered if hed been that stooped for a while now or if it had happened all at once while he was gone he didnt know whats it like on the other side his father laughed never thought id say that to somebody who hadnt died if you want to talk to ghosts thats your business henry retorted if you want to ask mewell the weathers better there by god seemed like spring all the time it was spring all the time you were thereor a lot of the time anyhow edward reminded him we stayed into summer and it didnt get hot and muggy the way it does here henry said and there is a bay with the best harbor ive ever seen anywhere avalon bay we called it if king arthur had seen it he never would have wanted to leave yes but a harbor on a coast with no people on it is like a tree falling in the forest with no one to hear his father said it may be there but so what there will be people on that coast henry said and there are people beyond that coast i know because we saw them he told his father and his wife and the rest of the people who were listening about the basques and the strange pattawatomis a new land another new land with people in it this time edward said funnylooking people but people just the same henry answered and the basques say the trees and beasts are more like england or their country than atlantis they talked about squirrels in oak trees and howling wolves i havent seen a squirrel in years edward said at the same time as bess was going i miss squirrels his father added theyre welcome to the wolves though i said the same thing or near enough henry answered and who are the strangers his father asked did the basques find the court of the great khan of cathay i asked them the same thing and they thought it was funny it didnt seem that way to me and it didnt sound that way from what they said edward radcliffe chuckled grimly believing what basques say is a fools game by our lady sometimes understanding basques is a fools game the one who talked to me spoke pretty good french henry said he said the strangers didnt know the use of iron one of them carried a club with a stone ball for a headthat argues the basque was telling the truth they wore hides they had no gold or silver ornaments if they come from the great khans court ruling cathay isnt what it used to be easier to think this new land lies between us and cathay wherever cathay may be your children may go to the new landi expect they will edward said i might like to see it before i die but i think my bones will end up here in atlantisand that wont be so bad he sounds like moses wanting a look at the promised land henry thought and then nofor him this is the promised land he really has got old but after a moment he realized atlantis was the promised land for him too he was curious about what lay to the west he wanted to see it and more than once but having pulled up stakes in england to settle here he wasnt eager to do it again as his father said maybe one of his boys would be if they didnt find atlantis roomy enough or maybe his brother would where is richard he asked out in the woods bess said as usual he was talking about going over the mountains edward added i half wondered if you would see him when you came ashore on the west coast so did i that would have been funny henry said i wonder which of us would have been more surprised more people were coming off the rose and telling loved ones and friends what theyd done and what theyd seen on the journey around the northern coast of atlantis henry heard several sailors trying to pronounce pattawatomi every man said it differently henry couldnt very well complainhe wasnt sure he was saying it right himself he wasnt sure the basque had pronounced it very well any people that gave itself such an outlandish name probably spoke a language as bad as basque too henry hadnt thought there was any such creature but maybe he was wrong then bess put her arm around his waist and gave him an inviting smile he suddenly and acutely remembered how long hed been at sea im going to have a look at the house father he said well talk more later send the children out to play before you look too hard edward answered lord knows i had to chase you and your brother and sisters out the door after a few fishing runsyes just a few henry remembered that hed been puzzled when he was small puzzled and hurt why wasnt father gladder to see him well father was but he was glad to see mother too and henry was very glad to see bess they walked off side by side in a little while he thought he would be gladder still vii p retty soon richard radcliffe would reach the downhill slope that was what he was waiting forproof hed made it into the western part of atlantis proof hed got through the mountains at last if only id done it last year hed been exploring in the green ridge then he hadnt got to the crest and over and so his brother sailing around got to the far side of the new land ahead of him richard muttered under his breath in a way you hardly mattered at all if you werent first but only in a way the radcliffes hadnt got to atlantis first by all accounts though new hastings and bredestown and the other settlements that sprang from their first visit were growing far faster than cosquer richard didnt know for a fact whether that was true hed never gone down to the breton town the more he traveled through the heartland of atlantis the less patience he had for his fellow human beings even the ones who happened to be englishmen andwomen oh he was glad to see glad to touch his wife when he came back from one of these jaunts but even rutting palled sooner and sooner nowadays before long he itched to be gone again other people were a stench in his nostrils and the more of them there were the worse the stench got they lived with it all the time so they didnt even know it was there richard hadnt himself not till he was able to go away into the woods here for days at a time how did i stand the stinks on a fishing boat he wondered aloud he often talked to himself when he was out alone why not and the answer was easy enough to find hed stood it because hed known no better the same way hed stood getting jammed together with the other fishermen on the st george jammed almost as tight as the gutted slabs of salt cod they made here in the wilderness his words seemed to take on an importance they wouldnt have back in new hastings or even bredestown they echoed back from the boles of the trees that leapt skywards the way cathedral spires dreamt of doing some of the trees hed seen rose higher than any cathedral spirehe was sure of that only birdcallshonkers loud nasal notes and the more melodious songs of smaller birdshad ever disturbed the stillness in these mountain passes before richard smiled no that wasnt quite true there was also the chirping of the big green katydids that scurried and hopped through the undergrowth they were as long as his thumb and twice as fat they couldnt fly like the honkers they had useless little stubs of wings they didnt even hop particularly well but like mice back in england they came out at night to nibble at whatever they could find and sometimes here in the mountains they came out by day too or what passed for day fog lingered long in the valleys here sometimes as it thinned richard could see the green slopes above and to either side of the pass he was trying to get through that was when he came out into the open under the trees mist might linger all through the day he knew hed gone astray a few times just because of the mist few trails wound through these forests there were no deer or wild boar here to make them nor had men tamed these woods as they had englands honkers made some paths but honkers didnt care to go deep into the woods most of them were by choice creatures of the meadow and the forest edges they sheltered under the trees to save themselves from the savage beaks and tearing talons of redcrested eagles without the birds that slashed down from the sky to slay them they would have spent their time in the open the constant moisture made the air seem thick and textured in richards lungs it also made the spicy scents of sap and needles even stronger and sweeter than they would have been were the weather drier of course in drier weather the redwoods that gave the forest its upper story could never have grown somewhere not far ahead a stream gurgled richard came up to it dipped up a cup and drank the clear cold water that ran down his throat seemed as sweet and almost as strong as wine it wasnt the greenish nasty stuff that came out of the butts when youd stayed at sea too long it wasnt the vile stuff that came down to hastings either already foul with inlanders shit and piss and the leavings from tanneries and breweries this was water the way god intended it to be a frog stared at richard out of golden eyes that single singing sac under its throat still seemed strange to him but so much of atlantis was strange by english standards why should that one small thing stand out he couldnt have said why but it did the frog didnt hop off the rock as a sensible english frog would have it didnt recognize him as a threat which could have made him all the more dangerous to it luckily for it he wasnt hungry right now he plucked a leaf from a fern and dropped it in the stream it floated offtoward the east damnation richard muttered he was still on this side of the watershed one of these days if that leaf didnt sink it would wash out to sea somewhere not far from new hastings he wanted leaves to float west and to follow them to atlantis farther shore thanks to henry he knew it was there more than half of him wished his brother hadnt found avalon bay or anything else that had to do with atlantis western coast what he already knew made his own explorations seem less weighty going off towards a land you already knew something about was like listening to a story where you already knew the ending what lay in the middle might still be interesting but it wasnt the same a flapjack turtle stuck its pointynosed head out of the water and eyed him with reptilian suspicion he was suspicious of it too the creature had formidable jaws he didnt want it taking off a finger joint if he tried to catch it flapjacks made good eating but plenty of other prey was easier to hunt he pressed on light filtered through the mist through the redwood canopy and through the lower story of pines in sudden startling shafts almost as if it came through a stainedglass window in a cathedral the tall columns of the tree trunks only strengthened the resemblance richard thought god more likely to live in this pristine outdoor chapel than in any building men threw together you could see the creation here the birds and the wind in the branches played a sweeter melody than any that burst from the throats of a choir and the conifers smell that filled the air in the woods made his nose happier than all the frankincense and myrrh brought in from distant shores bishop john would not have been glad to hear his opinions but bishop john never would richard radcliffe had no desire to fall foul of the church he hadnt even told his wife of his notions about the woods she wouldnt understand them anyhow she hadnt traveled far enough under the trees maybe someone from freetown had as little use for his neighbors and as much for the new world in which he found himself as richard maybe one of francois kersauzons bretons or a basque from gernika also made a habit of plunging deep into the heartland of atlantis for no better reason than to see what he could find maybe but richard had found no signs of other wanderings in the course of his own what would i do if i did he wondered he shrugged he had no idea it was like wondering what you would do if the mast suddenly toppled the idea seemed farfetched enough to be silly and yet once it lodged it didnt want to leave he kept looking around every small forest sound made him wonder if he should draw his bow he knew that was foolish but he couldnt help it hed been blazing trees to mark his path he kept on doing it but made his blazes point in the other direction as if he were coming from the west that might confuse a stranger who found them or it might do nothing but make him feel better he did it anyhow some of the snails that crawled up trees and foraged on ferns here in the mountains were almost the size of his fist his first thought when he saw one was that a frenchman would have thought hed died and gone to heaven his next thought was that the frenchman might not be so foolish after all a snail that size had a lot of meat even if it came with eyestalks and roasted over a small fire giant snail didnt prove bad at all it was bland enough to make him wish hed brought more salt along but he couldnt do anything about that now he noted that a clean empty shell might do duty for a cup if he ever broke his some of the slugs in the woods were even bigger than the snails he needed longer to notice them though they were a dark green that made them look like patches of moss but patches of moss didnt usually leave behind a trail of slime as wide as two fingers side by side when they glided along and the slugs of course had eyestalks too they reminded richard of slowly moving cucumbers they also had a lot of meat he decided he wasnt hungry enough to find out what it tasted like if he was missing a treatthen he was that was all one of these days some other traveler more intrepid or more desperate than he was might find out he wondered how long hed been walking downhill before he realized he was excitement flowered in him was he past the watershed at last or was this nothing but a trick of the ground he didnt see it rising up ahead of him but he couldnt see very far ahead a stream i have to find a stream he said finding one didnt take long not in that moist country did the water taste different or was he imagining things he couldnt say not for sure he scrabbled around in the dirt till he found a few pine needles and he dropped them in he felt like shouting when they slid off toward the west he went another halfmile or so then repeated the test in a different rivulet when a leaf also floated westward there he let out a whoop that came back from the redwood trunks im on the other side he pressed on when a ship came out of the east in the middle of november edward radcliffe was surprised the atlantic turned blustery by then he wouldnt have wanted to put to sea at this season sometimes you had to but he wouldnt have wanted to this was a fancy trading cog too not a beatup fishing boat like most of the ones that crossed the sea to atlantis he walked out along the pier to meet her and see what her crew wanted cold nasty drizzle blew into his face yes it was november all right even if few of the trees here in the new land lost their leaves edward stared at the fellow looking down at him from the forecastle under a sleeveless leather jerkin the stranger wore a tunic of crimson silk edward couldnt remember the last time hed seen silk he didnt think any of the settlers had brought any hither oh maybe a hair ribbon maybe even a scarf surely no more than that he hadnt seen a look like the one on the strangers face for a long time either he needed a moment to recognize it for what it was the newcomer was looking down at him all right that was a man of high birth surveying a social inferior it wasnt a look edward was glad to see he thought hed left such fripperies behind for good when he didnt speak the stranger glowered more as far as edward was concerned he could glower all he pleased and he could freeze too for all edward cared and he was probably doing just that silk might be pretty but it wasnt warm edwards duncolored woolen cloak was homely yes but it shed cold and rain at last grudgingly the newcomer said god give you good day old man and you edward radcliffe replied more grudgingly still true he was old but he didnt care to be reminded of it tell me old manthe stranger didnt just remind him of it but rubbed it in on top of thatdo you know do you have any idea whom you will have the honor of meeting when he steps off this godcursed scow if he thought that ship was a scow he knew nothing about the sea well likely he didnt as for the alleged honorno edward said dont much care either he turned and started to walk away hold varlet or you die before your feet touch solid ground barked the man in silk as if by magic three archers had appeared behind him each aimed a clothyard shaft at edwards short ribs the rain would play merry hell with their bowstrings soon but not soon enough the archers had the look of hired muscle if the stranger told them to shoot shoot they would they would worry about it later if they worried at all radcliffe stopped and came back well you talked me into it he said i thought i might yes the bastard up there was used to giving orders used to having them obeyed and used to enjoying having them obeyed his selfsatisfied smirk said so even more clearly than his snotty tone of voice i ask you once again old manand better than you deserve toodo you know whom youll have the honor of meeting when he disembarks think carefully on your answer this time if you want to meet him on your feet and not lying at his no i dont know please tell me edward saidcarefully anyone who knew him would know he was seething anyone who knew him would know too that only a fool angered him and thought to come off unscathed this fellow didnt know him or care to and didnt worry about angering him all of which only proved the man a fool but he was a fool with important news for he answered why none other than his grand and glorious lordship the earl of warwick we have no lordships here edward blurted you do now by christ and youd bloody well better get used to it for hes here to stay said the man in the red silk tunic warwick here to stay what happened like everyone else in atlantis edward got news of the civil war in england in bits and fragments as new shiploads of settlers came in to new hastings the earl of warwick was king edward ivs cousin his help had let richard of york briefly claim the throne a few years earlier without him edward wouldnt have sat on it there had been talk hed fallen out with the king over edwards french policy but this this is exile edward realized he must have risen risen and lost he hada disagreement with his majesty now the man in silk chose his words with care this being so he wasencouraged to travel across the sea to seek his fortune in these new lands the fisherfolk stumbled upon did he have the faintest idea he was talking to the leader of those fisherfolk to the first englishman whod done the stumbling obviously not would he have cared had he known that seemed just as unlikely and so the fellow up on the forecastle went on he has sailed here to freetown that he may edward radcliffe threw back his head and laughed like a loon loons swam in the ponds and rivers here as they did in england their wild cries were almost as characteristic of this wilderness as those of the honkers the man in the silk tunic went almost as red as it was silence wretch he roared give me one good reason i should not order these my men to shoot you down on the instant like the dog you are why you sorry blockhead you dont even know where the devil you are edward said laughing still he pointed south freetown lies down the coast go there and be welcome if you and warwick are welcome anywhere in atlantis which i doubt this is new hastings newhastings the stranger spat the words out as if they were bad fish you lie surely you lie that cur of a captain swore by the cross by our lady by god sir this is new hastings and no other place in all the world edward knew a certain fleeting sympathy for the man whod captained this cog on a choppy sea of the kind you were almost bound to have this time of year gauging even your latitude was no easy feat if hed had clouds for several days as he easily might have done he wouldnt have been able to take a sun sight he would be going by god and by guess and they would have let him down newhastings the stranger turned away and started screaming at the top of his lungs phenomenal lungs they were too he could have made himself heard from stern to bow on a bigger ship than this in the middle of a savage blow one of the men who came running was plainly the skipper the other just as plainly was richard neville the earl of warwick he couldnt have been far past forty but his hair and beard had gone very gray he had a strong prow of a nose and clever dark eyes set too close together his man bellowed abuse at the captain the poor man did his best to defend himself his best was none too good how could it be when he found himself in the wrong warwick listened for a while then walked over to the rail and peered down at edward with his man still berating the skipper in the background he said so this is new hastings is it the nobles voice was surprisingly soft and gentle unlike the fellow in the red silk he didnt need to bluster to get what he wanted im afraid it isyour lordship edward hoped the nobleman didnt notice the pause he needed before he brought out the title of respect but warwick did notice edward could tell warwick was one who would notice everything and forget nothing the whole world and its mistakes would be grist for his mill hed gone wrong at last though or he wouldnt be here for a great noble for a man who aspired to the kingship atlantis would not be the earthly paradise or anything like it it would be the nearest thing to hell how could you be a great man a mighty man when everyone was putting forth all his might merely to wrest a living from the vast wilderness the settlements bordered and where in the wilderness was richard these days had he found avalon bay yet or some other point on the western coast of atlantis when would he find his way home again edward had the sudden bad feeling he might need every pillar he could find new hastings the earl of warwick repeated as his retainer had not long before but he spoke in musing tones as if he were hefting a new tool and wondering whether it would serve him well enough to use yes your lordship this time edward didnt hesitate something glinted in the nobles eyes oh yes you say the words but you dont mean them and you cant fool me into thinking you do maybe edward was reading too much into a single glance maybe but he didnt think so well i daresay i can do as well for myself here as i could at freetown richard neville said perhaps as much to himself as to edward he went back to speak to his lackey and to the captain a moment later the captain bawled an order a gangplank thudded down from the waist of the ship soldiers strutted out onto the pier move aside old man one of them told edward this place is ours now richard radcliffe smiled in the november sunshine in england it would have been cold and cloudy and likely rainy in new hastings it probably would have been colder yet maybe it would have rained it might even have snowed it had done that more than once this time of year since he settled in atlantis now he was on the other side of the mountains now as far as he was concerned he was on the right side of the mountains henry had said avalon bay had weather like an unending april richard saw that his brother was right he was somewhere not far from the famous bayif a bay could be famous when only one shipload of men had ever seen itand here it was april or as near as made no difference november in truth but birds still sang in the trees leaves stayed greena dark green as most greens were in atlantis but green nonetheless the grass under his feet as he stood out in the meadow was as lush as if it were the height of spring it hadnt died and gone all yellow the way it would have in england or new hastings he knew what that meant this grass hadnt seen a freeze maybe it would when winter advanced furtherif winter did advance further here richard wouldnt have bet on that as far as he could tell it really was springtime the whole year around back behind him lay the mountains hed crossed with such labor a ridge of green now against the eastern horizon instead of the western where hed grown used to seeing it hed come into one new world when he first set foot on atlantis now he was in another onein his view a better one the sea called him he could smell it again a smell hed known all his life but one that had gone out of his nostrils as he crossed atlantis fogfilled spine he couldnt see it yetthe ground rose ahead of him but it was there and beyond that sea lay more land with strange people living in it hed heard that from henry too and from the fishermen on the rose he shrugged seeing that new land meant getting into a cog again he supposed he could if he had to if he didnt have to he didnt want to atlantis was plenty big enough to satisfy him a crow cawed from the edge of the woods it wasnt just like an english carrion crowthe call was different and it didnt have such a heavy beak it wasnt just like a rook either it lacked the pale patch on its face but it couldnt be anything but some kind of crow ravens in atlantis as far as he could tell were just like the ravens back in england crows here were similar but not identical jays were quite different they were blue and white and crested not pinkish brown but they were plainly jays their feisty habits and raucous calls proclaimed that to anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear richard wondered why it should be so why did birds that acted like english blackbirds have robinlike red breasts here why were there so many atlantean birds that couldnt fly honkers several kinds of duck oil thrusheshe scratched his head the question was easy to ask but he had no idea what the answer was he trudged on before long he was sweatingin november that made him smile he knew the kind of work he would have to do back in new hastings to sweat there just walking along wouldnt do it not at this time of year thinking of oil thrushes made him hungry he would have to hunt before long well at least hunting was easy here when the quarry didnt know enough to run away going after rabbits in england hadnt been like that deer and boar knew enough to flee too not that the likes of a fisherman could go after them he didnt miss working hard on a hunt he did miss apples and pears and plums and all the juicy berries hed known back in england nothing like those here the settlers had planted orchards but they werent bearing abundantly yet the trees in those orchards were the only fruit trees in atlantis one of the native barrel trees had a sweet sap that could be boiled down into a honeylike syrup or fermented into something halfway between beer and wine it was pleasant but it wasnt the same as wandering through the woods and finding fruit he couldnt do that here no matter how much he craved the sun he didnt stay out in the meadow longer than he had to around new hastings and bredestown redcrested eaglesand their attacks on settlershad grown scarce here in the west though no one had hunted them no one had gone after their nests the birds were still common and still deadly dangerous a lone man had scant hope of fighting one off if it took him for a honker under the trees richard breathed easier the birds went right on singing as he walked along the big katydids fell silent at his approaching footfalls they feared men they feared everything because so many things ate them richard had eaten them two or three times when he couldnt catch anything bigger if you peeled off their legs and feelers before you roasted them and if you ate them in a couple of bites without much thinking about what you were doingif you did all that they tasted a little like shrimp but they tasted more the way he thought bugs would tastesort of greenishand so he wasnt anxious to repeat the experiment a salamander on a tree trunk eyed him it didnt scurry away or show any sign of alarm nor did it try to look like something else the way so many crawling things did even in the gloom under the trees it stood out its background color was blood red while the spots that measled it were a brilliant yellow he left it alone there were brightly colored salamanders back near new hastings too they werent identical to this one but they had to be close cousins hed seen what happened when a dog ate one it took a few steps then fell over dead a few years earlier theyd found a twoyearold girl whod gone missing also dead with half a colorful salamander in her mouth you can do as you please for all of me deathworm richard told the creature and gave it a wide berth for all he knew just touching it could kill he didnt care to find out the hard way high overhead a redcrested eagle screeched richard flattened himself against a treenot the one where the salamander insolently rested he didnt think the eagle was hunting himhe didnt know the eagle was hunting anything why take chances though it screeched again from the same place he peered up up up peer as he would he couldnt see the bird it was high up in a redwood and anything high up in a redwood was higher than it could be anywhere else countless branches all shaggy with needles hid the eagle from the ground no doubt it could see a long long way from there if a honker anywhere within its range of vision walked out onto a meadow to forage the redcrested eagle could take wing and strike even though he couldnt see it richard didnt feel altogether safe from the eagle for he feared it might be able to see him one thing the settlers had learned the eagles had better eyes than they did a bird would appear out of nowhere to strike at a honker or a man or to carry off a lamb or a dog or once or twice a toddler a fishingboat skipper with eyes like that could name his own price but the birds outdid mere men this one called again now it was in the air as its screeches receded into the distance richard breathed easy again whatever it was after it wasnt after him that meant he could press on faint in the distance he heard honker alarm cries the bird must have struck whether it had killedif it hadnt chances were it would soon find some other perch he needed to be careful but you always needed to be careful when you were the only man in strange country something slithered away through the ferns atlantis had far more serpents than england did and more of them were venomous you had to watch where you put your feet well you didnt have to but you were liable to be sorry if you didnt some of the vipers twitched their tails perhaps in anger just before they struck if they happened to lie coiled among dry leaves that twitching might make enough noise to warn a wary man or of course it might not he hadnt got a good look at this snake he didnt know if it was one of the poisonous kind he wasnt inclined to go after it and find out either the ground sloped up under his feet then he topped the low rise and headed down instead the afternoon sun flashed off water ahead at first richard could make out no more through the screening of trees and ferns ahead a pond a lake he hadnt gone much farther before he realized that if it was a lake it was a big one he pushed harder now he wanted to get out into open country at least long enough to take a good look at what hed found sunshine meant hed come to the edge of the woods oh he said softly as he got the look he wanted after a moments wonder he added if thats not avalon bay then this coast has two of them he could see the quiet water of the bay the lips of land that almost closed around it and the opening that gave access to the wide ocean beyond henry hadnt liedthis was a harbor in a million it hardly mattered that there was nowhere to go from here this was the sort of place where you wanted to build a town just because you could and there might be somewhere to go after all there were those copperskinned men the basques had found the ones with the name henry and his crewmen pronounced differently every time they tried it did they have anything worth trading another land across the sea one you could reach from atlantisthat was a surprise but then atlantis itself was a surpriseone surprise after another in fact richard wondered whether francois kersauzon rued the day when he sold the secret to his father a third of a hold of salt cod it didnt seem enough not when the englishmen had done so much more with the new land than kersauzons bretons had even the basques had done more with atlantis than the bretons had and the basques had got off to a late start here richard paused peering out into the bay he thought the basques had got a late start here no matter what he thought though could he prove it like the bretons like the englishmen basques and galicians sailed deep into the atlantic after cod just because his own father heard of atlantis from the bretons that didnt mean the basques and galicians must have maybe theyd stumbled over the new land on their own have to ask them next time i see onewhenever that is richard thought he had no idea when it would be hed never traveled south basques came up to new hastings every now and again but he couldnt remember the last time one went inland to bredestown richard was curious about the copperskinned unpronounceables how had they made out after they got to gernika he looked out at the ocean again or what he could see of it through the mouth of the bay it wasnt impossible he supposed that he would see a sail out there on the atlantic henry hadnt taken the rose out around the northern cape this year but maybe the basques had gone around to the south and then sailed west toward their new land their inhabited land henry hadnt wanted them to find avalon bay that had made sense even before richard saw this marvelous harbor with his own eyes now that he had he was as sure as his brother that nobody but englishmen had any business exploring or making a home here a river ran into the northern part of the bay henry had said so henry and his crew hadnt taken a boat up the river so nobody knew whether the stream ran west from the green ridge of mountains richard had penetrated or came down from the north if it did rise in the mountains it would make a wonderful highway across the western half of atlantis you could build a raft or a boat up in the mountain country and then ride the rest of the way you could if there werent too many rocks or mudflats anyway that would be worth knowing richard went on blazing his trail as he headed north toward the river if it didnt suit his purposes he could always go back the way hed come out he didnt want to hed already been over that ground once but he could which was comforting in its way shorebirds flew up in shrieking clouds when they caught sight of him they wouldnt have done that on the eastern shore or not to the same degree a lot of the birds in the east were as naive about people as honkers were what did that say was it close enough from here to the new land with the copperskinned people that more western shorebirds made the journey and grew familiar with hunters richard couldnt see what else it was likely to mean he swore under his breath hed seen snipe in those clouds of birds and snipe made uncommonly fine eating the ones back near new hastings were tame enough to catch by hand not these if he wanted them hed have to get them the hard way even without snipe roasted in clay he went on over along the eastern edge of the bay what was water what marsh and what land seemed as much a matter of opinion as anything else although it was bright daylight mosquitoes buzzed henry had made it plain the water was deeper out by the insweeping arms of land one of those would be the place to build then birds swooped here and there after the swarms of insects some of the swallows were achingly like the ones hed left behind in england others were larger with a purple cast to their feathers instead of flitting all the time some birds perched on branches and stumps and made forays against the mosquitoes peebee they called gaily peebee richard found the river a little before sunset it meandered through low country so he had trouble being sure but he thought it came down from the east ill find out tomorrow he said with a bone hook some worms he dug out of the boggy soil and a length of line he had no trouble pulling a couple of trout from the stream they wouldnt make as good a supper as snipe would have but they were a lot better than nothing he wondered how things were back in new hastings cold and wet and boring unless he missed his guess not much happened there not these days when he got back hed give people something to talk about for a while viii t hree of the earl of warwicks troopers tramped down the middle of new hastings widest street pulling their boots out of the mud at every step rain pattered down which would make the mud even thicker and gluier before long the troopers mailshirts jingled as they walked to keep the rain off of their byrnies and helms they wore hooded wool cloaks theyd taken from the settlers edward radcliffe wore a cloak himself and a broadbrimmed hat in lieu of a hood he made sure he steered well clear of warwicks men the less reason they had to get angry at him the smaller the chance they would do something hed regret he watched them trudge by they paid him no attention at all the soldiers seldom went about in groups smaller than three not any more two of them had suffered unfortunate accidents while walking around by themselves nobody could prove anything even warwick admitted as much but the exiled noble had called edward in to the house hed appropriated and laid down the law like moses coming down from mount sinai this will stop warwick said bluntly it will or i shall turn loose my wolves and new hastings will not be the happier for that your lordship i had nothing to do with it edward said i believe you if i didnt believe you you would be dead and i would be talking to someone else richard neville didnt waste sweet words on his social inferiorswhich meant he wasted them on no one in atlantis still these people listen to you and they had better if they dont want to see what slaughter looks like they will not play me for a fool dyou understand me oh yes you always make yourself very plain sir edward radcliffe answered but may i ask you one question go ahead by warwicks tone he was granting a favor to a man who didnt deserve it even if your soldiers hold new hastings down what good will it do you what will you get from it richard neville stared at him they might both use english but they didnt speak the same language if i cannot be a lord in england radcliffe i shall be a lordno a kinghere this may be a miserable puddle of a realm but it is my miserable puddle of a realm do you understand me now i certainly do your lordship edward said good then get out get out edward radcliffe did thanking heaven the noble let him leave and he spread the word as warwick wanted him to do but he spread it for his own reasons not for the earls we dont want a king here do we he said when he visited his son after getting away from warwick and answered his own question no by god of course we dont not if he uses his soldiers to steal from us and to hold us down why shouldnt we knock em over the head as we find the chance then henry saidand he was only the first of many if we get rid of a few now the rest will be easier to dispose of later reluctantly edward shook his head if warwick keeps them all together think what they can do to us do you want englands worthless war coming to the shores of atlantis sooner or later well have to kill them all again henry was only the first who said that the earl of warwicks soldiers had not endeared themselves in new hastings how can we without raising the whole settlement edward asked they have training they have discipline they have armor one of them is worth more in the field than one of us his son smiled a most unpleasant smile we have longbows he was right a clothyard shaft from a longbow would pierce any mailshirt ever made a shot at close range would pierce plate but he seemed to think being right was enough edward radcliffe feared he knew better unless we kill them all at once the rest take their revenge he said the whole settlement is hostage to them trying and failing is worse than not trying at all henry shook his head nothing is worse than not trying at all if we dont try at all what are we but their dogs patience edward told him patience what we have to do is we have to make sure we dont fail when we try and we have to make sure warwick and his wolveshis name for them not minethink we are their dogs till we try if theyre ready for us if theyre waiting for us our work gets that much harder am i right or am i wrong i am a man not a dog henry said but then shaking his head ill be a quiet man i supposefor a while thats what we need edward didnt try to hide the relief in his voice he had to play the dog too no matter how it galled him and acting subservient wounded him all the more because he knew he wouldnt be worth much if it came to a fight for a man his age he was healthy enough he could still see wellat a distance he hadnt gone deaf he still had most of his teeth all the same he was nearer seventy than sixty he wasnt very strong and he wasnt very fast his wind wasnt what it had been either when he grumbled about it henry set a hand on his shoulder dont fret father youve still got more brains than any three men in atlantis and that includes warwick when we move against him well move because of you you flatter me edward said i think youre wrong though when new hastings rises against warwick chances are it will be because a soldier does something so horrible hell make everyone hate himand his lord these things work out that way if you say so henry winked at him what i say is you show youve got all those brains by knowing such things what i say is youre a miserable pup edward said with rough affection henry winked again and where do i get that from you or from mother dont let her hear you ask or youll get it all right edward said they both laughed as if he were kidding snow on the ground and sleet in the air told richard radcliffe he was back on the east side of the mountains again his breath smoked as if he were a dragon he had a dragonish temper right now just a few miles back the weather had been tolerablenot warm but tolerable no more were living in the wrong place we all ought to pack up and head for avalon bay he grumbled fog spurted from his mouth and nose with every word and if that didnt prove his point he couldnt imagine what would he also couldnt imagine getting everyone in new hastings and bredestown to pack up and travel across atlantis or sail around it to get to the land where it was always april most people were like plants they found a spot and they put down roots he didnt even intend to try to talk the whole english settlement into leaving a few men a few families might more likely nobody would bloody fools richard said scuffing through the snow he kept his head down partly to ward against the nasty wind and partly to spot any tracks there might be if he could follow a trail straight to a honker or an oil thrush when the weather got cold you needed to eat more the fire inside you needed more fuel to keep going and before long he found some this country was extravagantly rich in extravagantly stupid game the oil thrush he came upon eyed him in mild confusion as he approached maybe like the redcrested eagles it thought he was some strange kind of honker it probably wondered what he was doing right up to the moment when he knocked it over the head he found shelter behind a fallen pine driedout needles made good tinder he dug around under the trunk till he found some the snow hadnt reached once he got the fire going he fed it with twigs and branches the warmth felt goodfelt wonderful in fact he butchered the oil thrush and started cooking a leg he hadnt done the best job of plucking it the stink of singeing feathers filled his nose grease dripped down onto the flames and made them sputter and pop he carved chunks of meat off the bones with his knife he didnt admire his own cookery part of the bird was nearly burnt the rest nearly raw he didnt care after tossing the gnawed leg bones aside he cooked the liver and the heart and the gizzard and then the other thigh the breast and the wings had less meat on them a couple of soft slow almost sleepy chirps startled him then he started to laugh he wasnt the only one who thought the fire felt good one of those mousesized katydids had taken shelter against the cold under the downed pine with the fire close by to heat it up it revived maybe it thought spring had come early sorry bug richard said pretty soon im going to push on and then youll go back to sleep in england dormice snoozed away the winter no dormice here no mice of any kind except the ones that had sneaked aboard the cogs that brought the settlers from england no native rats either richard didnt miss them who but a cat would after he built up the fire to burn for a while he rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep it wasnt a soft bed but it would do now he hoped the weather wouldnt warm up if it started to rain it would soak through even his thick greasy woolen blanket then weariness claimed him and he stopped worrying about the weather or anything else he was shivering when he woke up that meant he woke sooner than he might have it was still dark with only the faintest hint of twilight in the east new hastings lay farther south than its namesake in england so its wintertime days were longer and its nights shorter than the ones hed grown up with all the same its winters seemed harsher than the ones in the land hed left behind he wondered why that should be so but had no doubt it was father should have settled farther south yet he muttered as he poked the embers to red life fed more tinder onto them and got the fire going again from everything hed heard the cold season was milder down in cosquer and much milder down in gernika the bretons and basques had it easier than their english counterparts did of course that coin was twosided new hastings summers were hotter and stickier than the ones back in england the farther south you went down atlantis east coast the more pronounced that got by the time you reached gernika wouldnt you turn into a puddle of sweat there had to be a better wayand there was on the far side of the mountains from what hed seen and from what henry had reported the weather near avalon bay came close to perfection the whole year round again he wondered why there should be such a difference and again he didnt know that the difference was there and that it was real he couldnt help believing hed seen it hed felt it his stomach growled he roasted the oil thrushs other drumstick and broke his fast with it he left the rest of the carcass behind when he went east once more in england he wouldnt have for he wouldnt have been confident of catching anything else even a halfway decent hunter though had a hard time going hungry in atlantis hed left a lot of big birds behind him dead in his travels he could always kill another one when he needed to downhill again downhill all the way to new hastings all he needed to do was find the trail hed blazed and follow it and it would take him home again what could be easier yes and then what he asked himself aloud when he got back how many people would care where hed gone how many would care what hed done oh some would but most of the settlers just wanted to get on with the lives theyd made here they thought him strange for plunging into the wilderness every chance he got he wondered why theyd bothered leaving england even his wife thought him strange for plunging into the wildernessand for leaving her alone he hoped she hadnt done anything to make a scandal while he was gone fishermen who went to sea for weeks and months at a time ran that risk richard had no reason to think bertha was unfaithful but he knew it was one of the things that could happen to a traveling man of course it was also one of the things that could happen to a man who lived over his shop if a woman was going to she was going to the same held true for men but women had a harder time doing anything about it he was perhaps halfway down from the mountains to the sea when he got a surprisehe saw a hog drinking at a swiftrunning stream a heartbeat later the hog saw him or smelled him or heard him it snorted and trotted away unlike honkers and oil thrushes it knew what a man would want from it by our lady theyve come a long way richard exclaimed if hed seen this one here some were bound to have traveled even farther west he wondered if any swine had reached the mountains or gone over them he laughed they would give the local beasts a lively time halfway up the towering spire of a redwood a parrot screeched others started to call too till the woods echoed with their cries that made richard laugh again back in england hed heard of parrots but never seen them from everything hed heard they lived in hot countries not in atlantis here they were screaming their heads off in the middle of winter you never could tell at last near the headwaters of a small stream running east he came to a pine marked not with one of his usual blazes but with a b he smiled that blaze marked the brede all he had to do was follow the river and it would take him home but when he neared bredestown he got another surprise and one not nearly so welcome as the hog more game out in the woods was always welcome strange men tramping the edges of the cleared ground wearing helmets and chainmail were anything but who the devil are you one of the strangers said when richard stepped out from the shelter of the trees what the devil are you the other one added he looked down at himself his clothes were filthy and tattered his beard long and unkempt when he was alone in the forest what difference did it make it made one now my name is richard radcliffe talking to other people especially to strangers felt odd after so long in his own company ive been to the other side of atlantis and now im back who are you why the earl of warwicks men by the way the soldier said it even someone just back from the other side of atlantisor the other side of the moonshould have known that in case richard didnt know that the man added warwicks in charge here now is he richard said tonelessly both soldiers nodded both of them kept hand on swordhilt richard got the idea they would make him sorry if he said that didnt suit him that being so he didnt when i set out the earl was on the far side of the sea so were you two i expect seemed safer both men at arms nodded but were bloody well here now so we have to make the best of it the bigger one said he had a scar on his upper lip and two missing front teeth he also had bushy eyebrows which came down and together as he frowned radcliffe is it youll be the old grumblers other son no one had ever talked about richards father that way before richard had brawledwho hadntbut he was no warrior he wouldnt have cared to take on one of these bruisers let alone both of them even if they werent armored another soft answer seemed best so he gave one henry is my brother yes they put their heads together and muttered to each other richard wondered whether he ought to bolt back into the woods but the soldier with the missing front teeth said well now that youre back youd damned well better keep your nose cleanthats all ive got to tell you youd damned well better keep all of you clean the other soldier held his nose you stink like a dung heap friend richard had no doubt the earl of warwicks man was right its been cold he said with such dignity as he could muster not much chance to wash it hadnt been all that cold on the other side of the mountains but the soldiers didnt need to know that when you were all by yourself though what point to washing most people didnt bother very often even when they werent by themselves warwicks men stank of sour sweat too but richard had no doubt he was riper he looked forward to a bath after a last couple of growls warwicks men let him go on a sigh of relief gusted from him as soon as they got far enough away not to hear it cows and sheep and a few horses grazed on the meadows and gleaned what they could from the fallow fields manuring them with their dung dogs barked and growled a brindled cat sneaked around the corner of a barn it might almost have been england it might that is till richard looked past the plowed and settled ground those somber woods had no counterpart in the lands across the sea here and there in the settlement a pine or a barrel tree still stood the redwoods were gone not only was their timber useful but living under their shadow would have made the english feel like mice living under a church steeple prince the family dog snarled at richard as he came up then the beast took his scent and stared like a player doing a comedy turn in a mummers show is that really you his line would have been yes you miserable hound it is me richard said whining the dog came up and licked his hand he wondered what would happen if he stayed away long enough for prince to forget him he would get bitten that was what bertha was down on her knees in the garden plot by the farmhouse you could keep things alive through these winters if you looked after them up to a certain point carrots and parsnips got sweeter if you left them in the ground and far fewer pests plagued them here than would have been so back in england richards wife glanced up from her work her mouth dropped open the way he looked didnt faze hershed seen him come home from the woods before she scrambled to her feet and ran to his arms hello dear he said she felt good pressed against him her solid warmth reminded him how long hed been away so good to see you bertha tilted her face up for a kiss i was beginning to worrynot a lot but some just a long trip not a hard one richard said but who are those damned brigands in chainmail where did they come from he didnt hold his voice down his wife looked alarmed youve met them have you be careful how you talk about them if anyone makes them angry he pays somebody ought to make them pay by god richard said those byrnies wont hold out arrows bertha crossed herself sweet suffering jesus you sound like your father hes wild to do them in but they dont give many chances whats this warwick doing here anyway richard asked he was sent here for our sinsand for his own his wife answered he made the king angry so henry sent him off to freetown to do his worst there but his captain landed here instead and now were stuck with him they went inside she poured water from a bucket into a kettle and set it on the fire to heat richard smiled hed be able to bathe soon but the smile didnt last were going to have to do something about him he said you do sound like your father bertha said he goes on and on about how he didnt come to atlantis to bend the knee to any nobleman one day hell say it too loud or to the wrong man and it will get back to warwick and then the trouble will start to the wrong man richard frowned hed been away from human company too long he needed a moment to realize what that had to mean some of the settlers would betray him to this robber chief watch what you say bertha repeated but she nodded unhappily some would they want to get along any way they can they dont want trouble if ive heard that once ive heard it a hundred times i dont want trouble they say and pull their heads into their shells like turtles theyll have more trouble if they bend the knee to this dog of a warwick than they will if they give him a good kick in the teeth richard said his wife started to speak again then closed her mouth instead he suspected hed just sounded like his father one more time well his father knew a hawk from a heron when the wind was southerly all right bertha took the kettle off the fire she mixed the hot water with a little coldnot too much because it would cool fast enough on its own richard stripped off his filthy clothes and scrubbed at himself with a rag and some of the harsh homemade soap she gave him by the time he was done his skin had gone from assorted shades of brown to pink she trimmed his hair and beard with a pair of shears shed brought from england you look like the man i married again she said when she finished and not the old man of the woods any more i feel like the man you married too he reached for her they kissed laughing he picked her up and carried her over to the bed edward these days stayed close to home he knew he had trouble keeping his mouth shut if he hadnt known nell would have made a point of reminding him he hadnt had to worry about saying what was on his mind not for years no one in atlantis had people needed to worry now if you didnt watch your words richard nevilles bully boys would make you sorry the earl of warwick acted like a king or at least like a prince his bravos held new hastings hostage they lived off the fat of the land taking what they wanted one of the things warwick took was lucy fenner the late master salters daughter she was nineteen now or maybe twenty people said she was the fairest on this side of the atlantic a redhaired beauty with a figure to make a priest forget his vows she could heat up a cold nightedward had no doubt of that he was getting old no devil take it hed got old but he wasnt dead he also wasnt a bandit chief to take a woman whether she was willing or not warwickwas lucy these days went around with redrimmed eyes and an expression beyond sorrowful shed never imagined beauty could be dangerous to her whether shed imagined it or not she was finding out the hard way mary pity women nell said when edward remarked on that its not marys doing that lucy got snatched from her family edward said its that dog of a warwick hes a dog with teeth nell warned i know edward said grimly fear of what warwicks troopers would do was the only thing that had kept new hastings from rising against its new and unwelcome overlord someone needs to give him a boot in the ribs to remind him hes not supposed to do that kind of thing here his wife wagged a finger in his face not you youre not going to throw your life away over a chit of a girl i wouldnt do that edward said with dignity nell only snorted still with dignity he went on if i rise against warwick i wont throw my life away ill make him throw away his can you nell askedthe right question sure enough if i dont think i can i wont move edward said he has his bully boys and he has the men hes scared into thinking hes a sure winner and he has the handful of cursi wont call them men because they dont deserve the namewho lick the boots of anybody they think is strong we have the rest of new hastings is that enough nell asked anxiously against trained men with armori dont think there was a mailshirt in atlantis before warwick came let alone that suit of plate he wears you only need armor if you intend to kill your fellow man and you dont intend to let him kill you edward said why would we have wanted it till now but we have shields and we have our bows andhis voice dropped to a whisperin bredestown where warwicks hounds dont go so much the smith is making swords warwicks hounds almost took richard when he came out of the woods by the brede his wife reminded him i didnt say they never went to bredestown i said they didnt go there so often and they dont edward radcliffe answered and adam higgins is no fooltheres always something else on the anvil so no stinking bravos likely to see him forging a blade im not worried about soldiers seeing him so much as i am about some judas selling him to warwick nell said edward put an arm around her speaking of being no fool my dear oh pooh nell shook him off im an old gossip is what i am and one gossip knows how much trouble another one can cause is there anyone in bredestown who doesnt like the smith if there is thats someone we have to watch by our lady edward said and laughed at his own choice of oath by our lady indeed i wonder how men ever get anything done with women keeping an eye on their every move before they make it he paused looking thoughtful i wonder whether men ever get anything doneanything their women dont want i mean i have no idea what youre talking aboutnone nells voice was so demure and innocent edward started to nod then he caught himself and gave her a sharp look her face was demure and innocent tooso very demure and innocent that he started laughing again she poked him in the ribs you believed me for a heartbeat or two you believed me youll never prove it he said i dont need to prove it i know you too well to doubt it now nell sounded supremely confident and with reason id better after all these years dont you think who else would have put up with you for so long no one in her right mindthats sure enough edward said nell made a face at him he made one back they both laughed this time edward wondered if he was slipping into his second childhood if he was he was having a good time doing itor he would have been if not for the earl of warwick henry radcliffe paced the roses deck she lay not far offshore far enough to keep a bad winter storm from flinging her up onto the beach and breaking her all to flinders no storm now the day was cold but almost bitterly cleara good match for the state of his mind at the moment not quite by chance one of his mittened hands came to rest on the wroughtiron barrel of a swivel gun i wonder if we could hit new hastings from here he said in musing tones i wonder if we could hit a particular house in new hastings from here hit the town i think the pieced reach that far bartholomew smith said henry nodded he gauged the range and the guns power about the same the mate went on hit one house in particular thatd take the devils own luck dont you think regretfully henry nodded again afraid i do smith eyed him which house have you got in mind oh lets just say i was thinking of putting a ball through my fathers door to wake him up if he was sleeping you can say that if you want to smith looked around to make sure no one besides henry was in earshot me id sooner put one through warwicks dooror through warwick though from here thatd take more than the devils luck it would wouldnt it henry said sadly he sent the mate a hooded glance so youre not fond of his lordship lucy fenners mother is my first cousin smith said i should have remembered that henry thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand well no then you have good reason not to be the mate scowled lucys a good girl a sweet girl damn him not her fault she was born pretty and she shouldnt have to pay for it like that women have been paying for their looks that way since the days of adam and eve henry said seeing the mutinous expression on the mates face he quickly added not that that makes it right i should say not bartholomew smith spat the day is coming when warwickll push all of us too far like hes already pushed me i think its coming soon and when it does his strong scarred hands folded into fists my father feels the same way i do believe hes felt that way since he first set eyes on warwick before the earl even set foot on our soil henry looked around again no one was paying him or smith any special heed in a low voice he continued when the day does come he aims to fight skipper i always knew your father was a good man smith said i always knew he was a smart man too only question is can we kick those bastards when we have to thats whats held him back this long and he says even winning you can pay too high a price if the battle tears new hastings and bredestown to pieces if half the people die and half the houses and shops burn down well all be years getting over it henry said when he was a lad he says his old grandfather would tell him stories about what england was like just after the black death passed over the countryside the mate shuddered and made the sign of the cross god keep the plague on the other side of the sea that bloody warwicks plague enough for these lands plague enough and to spare henry agreed but thats just fathers point a war here could be as bad as the plague it could set us back the way the black death set england back thats why he doesnt want to fight unless we can beat the soldiers in a hurry without ruining ourselves in the doing thats sensible no doubt about it bartholomew smith said how long do you think poor lucy will want us to go on being sensible henry grunted that shot hit the target in the bullseye smith asked another question isnt it better to die on our feet than to live on our knees henry grunted againhe hadnt dreamt the other man had so much fire in his belly slowly he answered it is yes my father would not say otherwise but he would say its better still to live on our feet hes looking for a way to do that which is why he waits god grant he find one smith said how long can hehow long can wekeep waiting though if we get used to saying yes lord to whatever warwick demands of uswell well be living on our knees then and i fear me well forget how to climb up on our feet again i dont think it will go that far henry said back in england even the king has trouble telling his people what to do thats why the wars go on and on if the king cant make englishmen obey lord have mercy on a poor earl who tries eh smiths smile touched his lips but not his eyes dont they call warwick the kingmaker though that was his nickname all right but the king he made unmade him and if a mere king can cast him downhenry winkeddont you suppose a settlement full of englishmen can do the same when the time comes belike youre right despite his words smith still didnt smile with his whole face it had better come soon i tell you for lucys sake a womans not like a man you knowshe keeps her honor between her legs warwick has dishonored her but he hasnt taken her honor away its not the same thing henry said everyone knows what he would have done to her kin if she didnt yield herself to him that would have touched off the fight i expect but it wouldnt have done the fenners any good no it wouldnt touched off smith set his own gloved hand on the wroughtiron barrel of the swivel gun he swung it toward the house the earl of warwick had taken for his own as hed taken lucy fenner for his own as he aims to take new hastings for his own henry thought when you got down to it wasnt it that simple warwick didnt want to be a kingmaker here he wanted to be a king himself it would be a small kingdom maybe that would suffice him or maybe he dreamt of taking england in king edwards despite using atlantis as his base if he did henry judged him a madman but wasnt a madman all the more dangerous for being mad well settle him he declared what does atlantis need with kings king warwick smith followed his thoughts without trouble king neville king richard whatever hed style himself let him carve it on his tombstone instead my brother would make a better king richard than warwick would henry said hes better suited to the job too by god hows that he doesnt want it ix e dward radcliffe was coming to dread a knock on the door he never had before not in all the years since coming to atlantis in that stretch of time a knock on the door meant a friend had come to call now a knock was much too likely to be trouble calling this particular knock on the door came just before supper chicken and turnips and parsnips and cabbage bubbled in a pot filling the house with savory fragrance and making edwards stomach rumble he said something unchristian when a fist thudded against the planks of the door tell whoever it is to go away nell said nothing id like better but when edward went to the door he found that his visitors were not likely to take no for an answer they were five of richard nevilles biggest roughest bravos all of them armored all of them with drawn swords except for one who carried a crossbow instead well well edward said whats all this about the soldiers with the swords hefted them the fellow with the crossbow aimed it at radcliffes chest the biggest ruffian growled his lordship wants to see you and i mean right away does he edward said mildly all the soldiers nodded edward asked suppose i dont care to see him right away that would be too badfor you the trooper answered and he would still see what was left of you there was a line between bravery and stupidity edward radcliffe knew which side of the line defying five young tough armored men lay on well supper will just have to wait in that case wont it he said smartest notion youve had in a long time granddad the big soldier agreed now get moving before he gets sick of waiting im coming edward raised his voice to call out to nell his lordship has something to talk about with me she squawked in dismay he was dismayed too but he didnt think squawking would do any good he nodded to warwicks men lead on im honored to have such a fine escort they snorted almost in unison we arent doing it for your honor old man the big soldier said were doing it for his really edward said as if that hadnt occurred to him he didnt think pushing them any further was a good idea he stepped over the threshold and into the street he remembered when new hastings literally hadnt been there now it could have been any other english seaside townif you didnt notice the redwood timber and if you didnt raise your eyes past the fields to the dark woods that didnt lie far away guards stood in front of the house neville had appropriated the biggest one in town they carried spears taller than they were the sharp edges of the spearpoints glittered bloodred in the fading light so he came did he one of the guards said how about that he came all right the crossbowman answered see hes not so dumb as he looks couldnt prove it by me the guard said take him on in then his lordshipll let him know whats what right the crossbowman gave edward a little shove you heard peter go on in thank you so much edward said the fellow with the crossbow smirked plainly he didnt recognize irony when he heard it too late edward realized that might be good luck had the archer recognized it he might have made him sorry inside the earl of warwick sat in a chair with a back that emphasized his noble blood like most people radcliffe had only stools in his house lucy warwick called fetch my guest something to drink yes your lordship lucy fenner hurried in from the kitchen the silk gown she wore must have come from england with the exiled earl it bared too much of her and clung too tightly to what it didnt display she lowered her eyes to the ground and scurried away as soon as shed set a mug in edwards hand he raised an eyebrow even before he tasted it the rich bouquet told him what it was did the wine come from england lord he asked warwick shook his head i took it in trade from the bretons he replied its horsepiss alongside what a proper vintner could do mind but any wine is better than none edward hadnt known the settlers francois kersauzon had brought to atlantis were finally turning out enough wine to turn some loose i thank you for your kindness he said and surprised himself by more or less meaning it been a good many years since ive drunk anything but beer and ale and barreltree sap i deserve better warwick said simply the one trouble is getting what i want isnt always cheap sorry to hear that your lordship as long as the earl was giving him wine edward would sound sympathetic he thought so anyhow till warwick continued since it isnt i am going to have to takecertain measures i suppose you would say maybe the exiled noble hoped the wine would fuzz edwards wits so hed blithely accept anything he heard if that was what warwick had in mind he was doomed to disappointment what kind of measures sir radcliffe asked he still sounded polite but he was sure he also sounded wary and with reason for he was warwick sent him a sour stare yes the noble had wanted him fuddled all right well no matter what warwick wanted he had what he had he needed only a handful of heartbeats to see as much i shall have to start levying a tax on the settlers here he said regretfully as if it were edwards fault that hed been reduced to such measures a tax edward blurted he could have sounded no more appalled if richard neville had denied that the son and holy ghost were proper persons of the trinity you cant do that one of the bully boys whod fetched him hither growled like a dog on a chain the earl of warwick raised a languidseeming hand and the soldier fell silent he still glared in edwards direction though and his knuckles whitened as his hand clutched the hilt of his sword you are a bold man radcliffea bold man or a fool warwick said how dare you tell me what i may and may not do i suggest you think carefully before you answer think very carefully in fact lord i could think from now till doomsday and not think you had the right to tax me edward said i am sorry if my being so plain offends you but thats the truth why in england the king himself has to ask leave of parliament before he taxes his people richard nevilles mouth tightened i will thank you not to speak of the king in my presence if you value your neck radcliffe you will honor myrequest i dont know if i can sir not while were talking about taxes edward said how do you claim a power here that he doesnt claim in england how simple the earl of warwick drew from his belt a dagger whose hilt was ornamented with gold wire and began cleaning his nails with the point this miserable godforsaken place isnt england its bloody atlantis and you people here never tire of telling me so but we are englishmen lord we have the rights of englishmen till that moment edwards main concern had been making sure that england paid no attention to atlantis parliament might have decided to levy taxes here too and to whom could he have appealed if it did to no one at all as he knew too well warwick eyed him like a cat watching a mouse it was playing with but hadnt yet decided to kill you claim those rights when you feel like it otherwise youre glad england lies across the sundering sea that arrow quivered in the center of the target edward couldnt and wouldnt admit as much he took a deep breath you are not our king lord you have not got the right to do this warwick went on cleaning his fingernails the dagger was slim pointed and sharpquite a bit like him i have the might to do it sirrah as you will learn to your sorrow if you prove lunatic enough to challenge me we are englishmen lord edward radcliffe repeated stubbornly you have no right to steal from us this wayand that is what it is stealing if you try to take what is ours we will appeal to his majesty even as he said the words he wondered whether that was a good idea the earl of warwick with a small force of soldiers behind him was an annoyance and no small one but the king of england could call on the whole strength of the island if he choseand if he wasnt caught up in the coils of civil war he might prove a more dangerous master than any local lord or he might not if the local lord made as much trouble as this one was doing the threat didnt seem to worry warwick he neither flinched nor paled nor did he raise his voice as he said i will kill every one of you if you try he was just stating a fact he might as well have said redcrested eagles will kill honkers if they can if i am a honker by god i can honk all the way across the ocean edward thought meaning no disrespect lord but that is a silly thing to say he replied silly is it that roused the nobles ire explain yourself and quicklyyou are talking for your life were fishermen for heavens sake edward answered cod are what brought us to atlantis in the first place we have lots of boats and they can sail across the atlantic how do you propose to stop them all richard nevilles jaw dropped edward almost laughed in his face the only thing that stopped him was the fear that he would never leave this room alive if he did the earl of warwick plainly was a calculating man you didnt get the name kingmaker if you couldnt see past the end of your nose but warwick hadnt seen something herehis astonishment and dismay showed as much you he said thickly ill hold you to blame if boats go out and dont come back then bring bishop john here now so he can shrive me edward said boats go out all the damned time they stay away a long time too they have tootherwise wed go hungry how will you know if ones gone to england and not just to the fishing banks you wont not till its too late for you by the way warwicks jaw worked he might have been gnawing on a piece of meat that proved tougher than hed expected get out he told edward justget out but if you think you can stop me from levying taxes when i have a mind to youd best think again you will do what you think best your lordship radcliffe said and so will we he didnt say that out loud maybe warwick would figure it out for himself or maybe it too would come as a surprise to him if it didtoo bad taxes richard radcliffe said when his brother came out to bredestown to give him the news to his embarrassment surprise made his voice break like a youths thats right henry said grimly he thinks hes strong enough to squeeze them out of us i almost hope hes right richard said henry dug a finger into one ear did i hear that damned if you didnt if warwick thinks he can have soldiers prowling all over the settlement and if he thinks he can take away what he didnt earn well plenty of people will want to go somewhere else and ill be glad to take em there wouldnt you rather fight him so we make sure something like this can never happen again henry asked ill do that if i have to richard answered but packing up and leaving is even easier atlantis is a big place if we settle somewhere else nobodyll come after us for years no doubt henry said and if warwick wins here in the meantime the tax collector will be the one who does richard winced that unfortunately was all too likely to be so well what do you want me to do he asked stand with the rest of us stand i say dont run henry told him i know youd sooner go off into the wilderness all alone and look at the birds and the frogs and the snakes weve got our own snake here and we need to slay him a bowman who knows his business could do that for us richard said i will if you want me to warwick cant hide in his house the whole day through but henry shook his head he doesnt come out without bodyguards too likely theyd run down whoever shot him and even if they didnt no one knows what the soldiers would do if he got killed they might try slaughtering everyone in sight to avenge him theyd seal their own fate if they did richard pointed out which is true and which might not have anything to do with anythingchances are it doesnt father says warwick is a man who thinks past the moment not many folk bother from what i know of soldiers they mostly dont or will you tell me different well no richard said much as he would have liked to say yes are we going to fight warwick then unless he pulls in his horns we are his brother said slim odds of that mighty slim a longbow hung on the wall next to the fireplace richard had brought the bow from england nothing the bowyers had found here measured up to yew they made good enough bows hed brought a fine one a longbow had almost the range of a crossbow and could shoot many times faster the only problem was a longbow needed constant practice and a crossbow didnt i wish we had hand cannon not just the swivels on the rose richard said warwicks bully boys would think twice before they bothered us if we did theyd better think twice anyway henry said im sure we can beat them if we gather our strength together richard said but will we really do that if warwick is fool enough to keep trying to tax us we will henry answered do you know something i think you may be right richard said henry beamed at him we never agree about anything he said if we both feel the same way about this richard cut him off it isnt a sign that were bound to be right it only means warwick is bound to be wrong that will do well enough henry said better than well enough in fact edward radcliffe didnt suppose he should have been surprised when the earl of warwicks men pounded on his door again early one chilly morning whether he should have been or not he was he said something that made nell cluck reproachfully then he said something stronger than that the pounding didnt stop open up you old fool one of warwicks bully boys bawled we know youre in therewhere the devil else would you be time to pay what you owe another soldier added what edward said then made nell frown not for the blasphemy but from fear of the soldiers outside dont make them angry she told him say what you will this isnt worth getting killed over he looked at her im afraid youre wrong he said if warwick thinks he can rob new hastings hed best think again the folk here will stand up to him maybe it should start with me ive lived a full life what have i got to look forward to slowness and sicknessnot much more nell grabbed his arm dont talk like a fool slaying yourself is a mortal sin and what else would you be doing if you tried to fight thosethose she stopped whatever she wanted to say it had to be hotter than the endearments that had burst from edwards lips a moment before bang bang bang youd bloody well better open up in there or somebodyll close your cursed coffin for you warwicks bravo yelled this is your last chance and you ought to thank us for it with a sigh edward walked to the door and unbarred it one of the soldiers out there held a torch he hadnt been kidding but he dropped it in the mud of the walkway it hissed and sizzled and went out you want something of me edward inquired his voice deceptively mild too bloody right we do a soldier said radcliffe recognized him as one of the earls sergeants he had a list of what his overlord required you are assessed at two pounds seven shillings ninepence hapenny give us the coin and well be on our way this was robbery even more naked and raw than edward had looked for you must know i have not got it he said oh hed buried some money in a safe place but not that much he didnt think anyone in new hastings had that much ready cash trade on this side of the atlantic was mostly barter nobody here needed much in the way of actual silver he wondered whether warwicks men would kill him on the spot for refusing but the sergeant seemed unfazed referring to his list again he said his lordship declares the following valuations for taxes collected in kind one horse is to be reckoned at one pound one cow is to be reckoned at fifteen shillings one sheep or goat is to be reckoned at ten one pig is to be reckoned at eight one salted honker carcass is to be reckoned at four one goose is to be reckoned at two one duck is to be reckoned at one and sixpence one hen is to be reckoned at one shilling salt cod is to be reckoned at a shilling for five pounds weight his lordship has it all ciphered out doesnt he edward said the values warwick set on beasts werent even unfairor they wouldnt have been back in england where there were so many more animals to take that was clever of the noblemanpeople couldnt say he was cheating them by cheapening their goods he was cheating them by taxing them at all but that was a different story the sergeant nodded seriously too right he does friend well take what we need to take to pay your tax bill and not a bit more you can watch whilst we do it honest thieves you are edward said only a little irony in his voice thats us the sergeant nodded once more anybody who doesnt fancy his tax bill or the way we collect it hes welcome to complain to the earl oh that will do a lot of good edward said aye belike warwicks sergeant chuckledhe knew how much good it was likely to do he turned to the common soldiers paul matt john go to the barn and take whats due his lordship right sergeant they chorused it was nowhere close to right but they neither knew nor cared about that off to the barn they went they emerged with enough livestock to square edwards scotby their reckoning anyhow youre nothing but thieves edward called to them from the path that led to the street nell called them something much less complimentary than that they just laughed they laughed that is till someone hiding behind a squat barrel tree fifty yards away also shouted thieves and let fly with a longbow the arrow thrummed through the air and buried itself with a meaty chunk in the middle of the sergeants chest he stood there staring at it for what seemed a very long time when he opened his mouth to say something only blood burst from between his lips his knees buckled he fell to the ground where he kicked a few times and lay still the three common soldiers gaped as astonished as the sergeant had been another arrow hissed toward them it missed by the breadth of a hair and slammed into a sheeps rump the animal bawled in pain and bolted more blood dripping in the dirt that seemed to snap the soldiers from their stunned spell two of them rushed toward the barrel tree that was brave if the archer kept his head he could slaughter them before they got close enough to hurt him theyd just seen that their byrnies werent proof against his shafts not at close range but he must have been as caught up in the madness of the moment as everyone else for his next shot flew between the two of them he had no time for another oneall he could do was run away run he did with the armored men pounding after him but losing ground at every stride is that richard nell hissed to edward if god is kind youll tell me that isnt richard edward could tell her nothing of the sort for he also feared it was their younger son if warwicks troopers recognized him too that would bring trouble down on all the radcliffes heads but trouble was coming faster than recognizing richard would bring it the third soldier the one who hadnt gone after the archer stalked back towards edward and nell he swung his sword up to slash with it rage twisting his face he shouted you knew that murdering bugger lay in wait for us no edward said liar the man cried and broke into a heavy trot run edward told nell when she didnt he shoved her toward the farmhouse he looked around for a weapon then or for anything that would let him defend himself he snatched up an axe handleno axehead attached worse luck youve got me wrong he told the soldier who was now very close save your lies for the devils in hellthats where youre going all right the soldier said and aimed a cut at edward that should have taken his head off somehow he turned it with the axe handle nell screamed like a scalded cat warwicks man swore absurdly edward wasted a moment wondering what good telling lies to devils would do wouldnt they know them when they heard them the soldier slashed again edward got the axe handle between himself and the blade once more but it flew from his fingers he stared at his hands as if theyd betrayed himand so they had that never would have happened twenty years earlier or even ten but it had happened now and he would have to live with itthough not for very long so long old man the trooper shouted he slashed once more this time the sword bit edward howled next thing he knew he was on the ground with warwicks soldier hacking at him as if he were a badly butchered sow nell grabbed the mans arm but he knocked her aside he swung up the sword again it fellright on edwards neck so died the first englishman to set foot on atlantis the founder of the first english settlement in the new land not far from where the settlement began it was in the year the sixtyninth year of edward radcliffes age the tenth year of the reign of king edward iv in england and around new hastings still the first year of the reign of richard neville the earl of warwick and the manner of his passing helped determine the englishmen in those parts that warwicks reign should reach no further like a dog henry radcliffe raged they cut him down like a dog on his own farm ill garter myself with warwicks guts the devil damn me black if i dont i never thought they would go after him his brother said my idea was id either kill them all or lead them a merry chase his mouth twisted i didnt do either not well enough no you didnt henry agreed and now were all paying the price for it he and richard crouched in the woods somewhere west of bredestown theyd got their families away before warwicks men could swoop down on them richard seemed utterly at home under the redwoods he made little shelters of branches and twigs and bark and by all appearances was as content in one of them as he would have been in front of his own hearth he was as happy to eat honkers and fiddlehead ferns as he would have been with white bread and butter and fat mutton we shouldnt pay the price warwick and his men should richard said well yes they should henry said the trouble is they arent were out here with the honkers and the oil thrushes and the cucumber slugs nothing wrong with them richard said nothing wrong with them no henry replied but the bloody earl of bloody warwick the man who bloody murdered our father hes sleeping in a bloody soft bed back in new hastings and swiving lucy fenner in it whenever that strikes his fancy and theres something bloody wrong with that oh yes there is richard said quietly and i aim to do something about it you by yourself henry had trouble hiding his disbelief if not for you he broke off if not for me father would still be alive thats what you were going to say isnt it richard demanded henry might not have wanted to say it but he nodded richard scowled at him maybe youre right and maybe youre wrong and maybe ill have somewhat to say to you about that when this mess with warwick is over but that can waitthat has to wait for now ill just ask you this do you think father would have wanted to live in a place where a noble could steal his beasts because the bastard called it taking taxes well no but but me no buts richard broke in as soon as bloody warwick tries to lift anyone elses chattels hell have a bigger rising on his handsthis is tinder in dry grass whether he knows it or not and if you think i cant do anything about him by myselfwell watch me big brother just bloody watch me he slipped east toward the seashore toward the settlements as the sun set that night henry couldnt watch him after that because he moved with a swift silent assurance the sailor had no hope of matching richard knew henry scorned his trips through the woods henry was a seaman to his marrow as their father had been for him dry land was a necessary nuisance richard was different richard could slip through the woods so quietly even the mousesized katydids went on chirping killing honkers was easy but killing them before they knew you were there was anything but richard could do that he thought he could also kill men before they knew he was there he looked forward to it in fact a nearly full moon gave him all the light he needed before long he came to the camp warwicks troopers had made just inside the forest several loudly unhappy men sat around a fire how are we supposed to catch those buggers one of them grumbled they could be anywhere by now too right they could another soldier agreed damn trees go on forever well beat the bushes for a while and then well go and tell his lordship we had no luck a third man said what else can we do they all nodded they were luckier than they dreamt richard radcliffe could have potted a couple of them as easily as made no difference but he had his heart set on harder game more dangerous game he went on the foulmouthed soldiers never knew he passed them over things got harder when he came into settled country but not much few people were out and about at night dogs barked but never for longhe carried gobbets of honker meat to make them lose interest in him one farmer swore at his hound for raising a ruckus otherwise the night stayed still richard slid past bredestown and down along the riverbank toward new hastings torches blazed on poles thrust into the ground around the house warwick had taken for his own richard radcliffe smiled a predatory smile warwicks men would have done better to leave it dark that would have made it a tougher target the light the torches threw didnt reach anywhere close to the edge of bowshot and standing in that light blinded the sentries to whatever might be going on beyond its reach one of those sentries yawned he said something to the man standing beside him they both laughed richard took his place behind a pear tree whose trunk had grown manthick in the fifteen years or so since it was planted he strung the bow and fitted the leather wristguard to his left hand then in one smooth motion he fitted a shaft to the bowstring drew and let fly the arrow caught the soldier whod yawned a few inches above his navelthe bright torchlight made aiming easier too the trooper did what any suddenly wounded man would do he screamed and clutched at himself as he crumpled his friend stooped to give what help he could richards second arrow punched through the mans neck he let out a gurgling wail and fell beside the other guard richard had a third shaft nocked and waiting if the cries outside didnt bring warwick out what would and when the noble showed himself but he didnt another soldier opened the door to see what had happened richard let fly at him too he must have had uncommonly quick reactions for he jerked the door shut an instant before the arrow slammed into it the shaft stood thrilling in the redwood planks if richard had had some tow and a source of flame he could have burnt the house with fire arrows i should have thought of that flashed through his mind remembering after the fact sadly was easier than getting the idea ahead of time he heard the back door open and shut he couldnt see back there from where he crouched men spoke to one another in low voices he couldnt catch what they were saying but he didnt need to be alexander the great to figure it out before long he could hear boots thumping on the ground hed lost some of his night vision staring toward the torches he couldnt see what warwicks menor maybe warwick and his menwere doing again though he didnt need to be much of a general to know they would work toward him wait till he did something to show himself and then close with him and finish him with swords and spears it was as good a plan as they could make under the circumstances but it would work only if he waited around and let them get that close that didnt look like the best thing he could do the best thing he could do looked like disappearing now so he did he had practice moving quietly maybe he wasnt quite quiet enough or maybe one of them made a better woodsman than the rest there he goes dammit somebody behind him called after him hes heading west no need to chase him another voice said this one was cold and calculating and deadly as a pitfall trap with a bottom full of upthrusting spears if it wasnt the earl of warwicks voice richard would have been mightily surprised it went on make for the western edge of the cleared land beyond bredestown quick as you can if you hurry you can get there before him and keep him from sneaking into the woods richard nodded to himself yes that almost had to be warwick he thought fast and he thought straight they might be trouble if they interposed themselves between him and safety they would be more trouble if he couldnt get back into the woods before daybreak but he thought he could bredestown didnt lie that far upriver from new hastings even after all these years not much of atlantis was settled he had to get away now he took advantage of every bush and every copse of trees before long his eyes adapted to the moonlight again and he could see farther and more plainly but warwicks men would have the same edge worse luck barking dogs told where they were or where they might be no dog barked around richard for long he still had plenty of his meaty bribes left those convinced the hounds of new hastings he was a splendid fellow would warwick have the wit to send someone into the woods to alert the unhappy men whod gone after the younger radcliffes richards lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage grin if one of the nobles men didnt warn them he was around hed let them know himself he didnt go up the brede as hed come down it that was the shortest way back to the wild country which also made it the way warwicks men were likeliest to take all rightthey were welcome to it as long as he got into the trees before the sun rose he was fine he could lie up in a fern thicket and stay safe while they tramped by not ten feet from him he had to cross a meadow to get to the wild wood cows turned their heads to stare at him people didnt belong out here at this time of night too right they dont he thought but he made it back among the pines and redwoods and ferns back to the cool dampness of the forest back to the spicy scents that seemed as good to him as the odor of baking bread and better by far than the smells of the livestock brought here from england the smell of burning wood led him to the fire warwicks troopers had set to warm themselves it had died into embers now they lay rolled in blankets all but one who yawned and nodded and hit himself in the thigh with his fist to stay awake warwick hadnt thought to warn them after all he might be a good general but he didnt remember everything richard strung his bow he shot the sentry first hed hoped for a clean quiet kill but the man let out a dreadful shriek when the arrow tore into his belly the other soldiers sprang awake grabbing for their weapons richard shot two of them too then slipped away hed hurt warwick tonight hed hurt him badly but he hadnt killed him warwick was a man who would take a deal of killing x h enry radcliffe couldnt believe warwick would keep on gathering taxes after what happened with his father had the nobleman contented himself with going after the surviving radcliffes most of the settlers might have decided it was none of their affair and tried to get on with their lives but warwick acted as if there were no feud and he soon brewed up a bigger one more and more people fled into the woods richard began to worry we cant feed them all he said not enough game here to keep em eating then we have to fight warwick straight up henry said if it were just warwick and his bully boys we could do it but he has settlers on his side too his brother said i dont want a war of settler against settler it will leave bad blood for years bad bloods already here henry said warwicks started burning some of the farms and houses that belong to people on our side and hes giving others to his friends chances are that will make him more friends too not everyone got away with a bow richard complained fine henry said do you want to give up richard only glared at him the next day bartholomew smith came up from new hastings with only the clothes on his back theres a skeleton crew on the rose the mate said theyre for us theyve gone out to sea far enough to keep warwicks wolves from surprising them that would be better if we could work together with them henry said why cant we richard said easy enough to go up and down the coast out farther than the soldiers are likely to but what comes after that what comes after that henry saw the answer as clearly as if god had whispered it in his ear for all he knew maybe god had words spilled out of him a flood of them his brother and the mate listened the longer henry talked the wider their eyes got at last the fit left henry he slumped forward exhausted richard leaned forward and set a hand on his shoulder we can do this we will do this then he said father would be proud of you that was when henry was sure he hadnt been spouting nonsense bartholomew smith said you sounded like a great captain skipperlike somebody whos won battles in the war of the roses i dont want to sound like a captain i dont want to have to sound like one henry said and i dont care about roses except i wish more of them grew here if not for warwick i never would have worried about any of this well then hes got a lot to answer for by our lady richard said only thing is he doesnt know it yet like his father henry radcliffe was a leader of men richard had never much wanted to tell anyone what to do hed never wanted anyone else telling him what to do either no wonder wandering alone through lands no other man had ever seen suited him so well hurrying through the atlantean woods with a dozen grim angry determined men at his back felt very different bartholomew smith would have made a better leader but everyone looked to richard he was edwards son the magic had to be in him they thought it did anyhow maybe their thinking so would help make it true he could hope so he had to hope so if it didnt he was only leading them into disaster farms above bredestown were thin on the ground only men with some of the same hermit streak that ran so wide in richard built on the edge of the wilderness but richard and his followers had no trouble coming out of the forest wherever they pleased warwicks soldiers werent about to go in among the trees again they defended a perimeter closer to the sea go away shouted the first man whose house the raiders approached i dont want anything to do with the quarrel i just want to be left in peace will warwick heed you if you say that richard asked angrily no all the more reason you should richard felt the force of the embittered argument he might have made it himself but he couldnt listen to it now not unless he wanted to let his father down we have to fight him he said otherwise hell be king in truth over us do you want that no dont want you doing it neither not me by god richard said and said not a word about his brother if we want to live our own lives we have to free the land of the earl of warwick we have to dammit then i can go back to the woods and make my wife wonder whether im ever coming home again and thats all i want to do dont you understand warwick wont leave you alone he hasnt done anything to me yet the man said when he does thats the time for me to worry about it no richard shook his head thats when its too late to worry about it he turned to the men at his back come on well find men who arent puling babes somewhere else wed better or were ruined he thought and they did some men could see the writing on the wall unlike the blockhead at the first farm where they stopped some had kin whom warwicks hounds had already despoiled and some like richard himself didnt want anybody telling them what to do i dont much like you one of those told richard as he grabbed his bow and slung a full quiver over his shoulder but youre the ague and that warwick hes the plague too bloody right he is richard said i dont care if you like me or not put up with me till we dig the godcursed badger out of his sett then you can go back to thinking im a fool and ill go off into the woods and forget all about you is it a bargain it is the farmer answered not the best one maybe but the best im likely to get richard wondered whether they would have to fight before they got to new hastings they did maybe one of the men who didnt want to fight on his side slipped away and carried word to warwicks soldiers maybe they just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time however that was a clump of them spotted richards ragtag force as it came out from behind some trees the troopers wasted no time figuring out who was who they strung their bows with frantic haste and started shooting back into the wood richard cried the trunks will give us cover they would need it too a man screamed as he was hit the soldiers had mailshirts and helmets and swords only a few of richards men had swords most made do with belt knives or axes none of them wore armor if warwicks troopers came to close quarters they would slaughter their foes they knew it too some of them lumbered forward while others kept shooting to disrupt the atlanteans archery how fast could a man in a byrnie cover a couple of hundred yards not fast enough to keep the settlers from shooting before they got to the edge of the copse rings of iron kept glancing hits out but an arrow that struck square would punch through any armor made another atlantean shrieked he fell clawing at the arrow in his throat his blood rivered out hideously red still another farmer took a clothyard shaft an inch above the nose and died before he knew it one of richards arrows caught a soldier in the left shoulder though it got through it did less harm than the bowman would have liked the soldier yelled but he broke off the shaft and kept coming away richard shouted this isnt the place for a big fight he didnt want the men to empty their quivers here archery was the one skill they had that let them confront warwicks fighters without arrows they could only run when armored men came after them well weve got arrows and were running anyhow richard thought glumly he misliked the omen they had to leave their wounded behind that was no good lord only knew what the angry troopers would do to them but richard didnt see what else he could do trying to drag them along would have slowed the whole band if the soldiers caught up with them the rising would die before it ever came to life you should have planned this better one of his men panted as they trotted north and east richard looked at him what makes you think i planned it at all those bastards were there so we fought them we hurt them too and they hurt us the settler answered worse i daresay thats what fightings all about peter richard agreed when we get the battle we want well hurt them worse how do you know peter asked richard told him how he knewor how he hoped rather the man trotted on for a couple of paces then nodded so did richard thoughtfully if anything happens to him before the big fight i have to knock him over the head cant give him the chance to spill his guts to warwicks men one thing men without mailshirts could run faster than men with mailshirts could chase them after richards followers pulled away he relaxeda little he still had a decentsized force behind him and he was still moving in the direction he wanted to go it could have been worse but it would have been better if theyd reached the seaside unbloodied black midnight blacker than the earl of warwicks heart henry radcliffe and bartholomew smith crouched on the beach a couple of miles south of new hastings youre sure they know the signal henry said theyd better the mate answered which wasnt what he wanted to hear henry set dry pine needles and other tinder on the sand he clashed flint and steel above them again and again till they caught no matter how many times you did it starting a fire was rarely quick or easy he breathed on the flames when he finally got them going coaxing them to brighter life smith fed them more fuel at last the two men had a fire that gave some warmth against the chilly breeze theyd picked this spot not least because it was as close as they could come to new hastings without being seen from the settlement all the same bartholomew smith sounded worried when he said what if they spy it then we run henry answered in the darkness well lose them they would probably lose each other too but they could find each other after theyd shaken off warwicks men after daylight if need be he went on but warwicks eyes should be on the norththats where richard is he hoped that was where his brother was that was where richard was supposed to be smith peered out to sea wheres the bloody boat the longer we have to wait here dont worry henry said they have to see the fire they have to put men into the boat they have to row ashore they sand grated under a keel come on someone called what are you waiting for bartholomew smith and henry both laughed in relief as much as for any other reason they hurried to the boat and scrambled in as soon as henry had a shifting deck under his feet again instead of the dull unmoving dirt he felt like himself richard was welcome to the woods and the oil thrushes and the mountains henry came alive on the ocean clambering up from the boat and over the roses gunwale made him feel ten years younger where now skipper a sailor asked north henry answered at once north past the lights of new hastings he could see them from the rose where a swell of land had blocked his view from shore then we anchor till we see just where we have to go better we sail a little too far now while the wind will let us bartholomew smith said if it swings around and blows out of the northand its likely to do that this season of the yearwe dont want it to leave us stuck where we cant do anything youre right and well do it henry said at once he set his hand on a swivel gun the iron was cold almost cold enough to make his flesh stick to it he raised his voice to a shout are we ready lads ready the fishermen shoutedthe ones that is who didnt shout yes then lets do what we can do henry said lets do what free englishmen can do their cheers put heart into him the way sweet french wine would have his father had been the same way more truly himself when magnified in the eyes of others richard didnt have thatdidnt want it henry wondered why not he also hoped his brother could find some of it in the days ahead if he couldnt whatever the rose did might not matter at all richard radcliffe didnt know how many times hed eaten honker half burnt half raw here he was doing it again grease from someone elses oil thrush made the fire sizzle and sputter we can beat them he said we can and by god we will most of the men sitting by the fire nodded they wouldnt have been there if they didnt think they could beat warwicks soldiers all the same one of them said wish i had me a byrnie sure need one on a fishing boat dont you carl another one said you fall in you go straight to the bottom wouldnt make much difference to me carl replied i cant swim anyway surprisingly few sailors knew how richard was no great shakes in the water himself though he could keep his head above water for a whilelong enough to be rescued if he was lucky one more reason to be glad i dont put to sea any more he thought throw more wood on the fire he called to his men we want warwicks buggers to know were here if warwicks men didnt know their foes were encamped north of new hastings they were blind as well as stupid richards rebels had fed the fire on the beach all night long they wanted the soldiers to come out against them richard thought they would get what they wanted too and when they did they would find out whether theyd been wise to want it in the first place richard looked out to sea the rose lay about where she ought to how much difference shed makeagain they would find out when the plan spilled out of henry it sounded brilliant but all sorts of things that seemed brilliant turned out not to be you didnt know till you tried them which was liable to be too late carl sensibly was looking toward new hastings he crossed himself theyre coming out he said warwicks forces advanced slowly and deliberately since the soldiers whod come from england with him wore mailshirts they couldnt advance any other way the earl himself had a fine suit of plate he rode a horse big enough to bear him and the heavy armor the rising sun struck fire from his lancehead accompanying his troopers were men as bare of mail as richards followers radcliffe ground his teeth those were settlers men like the ones he ledexcept theyd chosen the other side they have more men than we do carl said quietly i know richard answered they have armor and we dont the other man went on i know richard repeated if they beat us theyll kill most of usmaybe all of us i know richard said one more time if it doesnt work i wont forgive you if it doesnt work youll be too dead to forgive me or ill be too dead to need forgiving or else well both be dead and things will even out carl gravely considered that to richards surprise he chuckled under his breath richard clasped his hand they took their places and waited one of warwicks men came up the beach toward them he had no flag of truce but held both hands out before him so richard and his men could see they were empty when he got within hailing distance richard shouted thats close enough say your say the brisk northerly breeze flung his words toward the trooper it would aid his sides arrows toonot a great deal but some the trooper cupped his hands to his mouth give it up he bawled you cant hope to win be damned to you richard answered his men raised a defiant cheer my lord says if you yield now he will let you go into exile go where you will so long as its far from here with your families with whatever you can carry and with one beast and one fowl for each person think on what you do after this fight is won you wont find him so generous those of you who dont burn in hell be damned to your lord too richard spat on the sand all things considered the offer was generousso generous that richard didnt trust the earl of warwick to honor it once hed got his way bloodlessly he looked at his men none of them seemed inclined to give in that heartened him warwicks trooper shrugged mailed shoulders on your heads be itand on your heads it will be he turned and walked down the strand richard was tempted to put an arrow through his kidneys one more man he wouldnt have to kill later but no the advantage wasnt worth the risk if he broke a truce the enemy would show no mercy if they won they mightnot to him surely but to his comradesif he stayed within the rules the soldier reached his own line unpunctured richard watched him shake his head and spread his hands a moment later warwicks lance swung down so that it pointed straight at the men who dared defy him he didnt charge though not yet richards men would have pincushioned him and his horse if he had longbowmen could stand against knights theyd proved that time and again on the fields of france against a lone knight they could have proved it with ease here in atlantis slowly warwicks men advanced almost to the edge of archery range his bowmen formed a line behind his troopers what he had in mind was easy enough to see the archers would keep richards men busy while the troopersand presumably warwick himselfadvanced against them if richards men fought the archers the regular soldiers would close and slaughter them if they aimed at the troopers the bowmen would cut them down from long range a plague carl exclaimed my brothers over there the cursed mangy hound and do you want us to try to spare him or try to shoot him down like the dog he is richard asked before carl could answer the troopers shouted warwick and trudged forward swords drawn shields raised against the storm that would soon fall on them warwicks archers began to shoot at first their arrows hardly seemed to move in the sky but then terrifyingly fast they were on richard and his comrades you could dodge one but if you did you were likely to step into the path of another richard had never had so many men trying to kill him all at once shoot he shouted pick your own targets a better general or a more certain one might have concentrated on the troopers or the archers he hoped splitting the difference would serve well enough if he was wrongthen he was wrong that was all he let fly at a trooper and missed swearing he looked over his left shoulder where was the rose if she didnt do what she was supposed to do pretty soon he and his men would have to run they couldnt face armored soldiers with swords at close quarters and if they started running where would they stop wouldnt they be doomed to outlawry and skulking through the woods the rest of their days she looked close enough to richard dammit one of his men fell with a groan he let fly again his shaft pierced a shield but evidently not the trooper behind it because the soldier kept coming richards quiver would run dry soon his men couldnt have many more arrows than he did hed also have to run when he couldnt shoot any more henry had wanted to cut this close but what was the difference between close and too close simple richard thought nocking another shaft as an enemy arrow hummed venomously past his head if its too close we lose the leadsman in the roses bow cast the line again and again calling out how much water lay under her keel hed already called out less water than she drew more than once why she hadnt run aground henry radcliffe didnt know maybe god loved her and hated the earl of warwick maybe she was just lucky either way she was at last just about where she needed to beand just in time too or he hoped she was just in time anyway he stood at the bow starboard swivel gun bartholomew smith stood by the stern gun at the same side ready henry called at your order skipper the mate replied henry sighted down the wroughtiron tube it was loaded with stones and scrap metal and whatever else they could stuff into its maw fire he shouted and lowered a tallowstinking torch to the touchhole boom the thunderous noise terrified and exalted him at the same time you could never be sure a gun would go off when you fired it you could never be sure the barrel wouldnt blow up either he whooped when smiths gun boomed a heartbeat after his then he peered through the choking stinking smoke to see what the two shots had done he whooped again pumping a fist in the air theyd caught warwicks men from the flank and torn them to bits more than half the armored soldiers were down and kicking or down and suddenly still forever and almost all the rest were running for their lives they were battlehardened battleready men but disaster striking out of nowhere stole the courage from anybody reload the starboard guns henry shouted the sailors leapt to obey swabbing out each barrel pouring in fresh powder and then loading more junk to fire henry pointed his piece a little to the south toward the earl of warwick what did he think at the unexpected overthrow of his hopes port bow gunfire henry yelled boom that one was aimed at the earl too warwick was farther from the roseprobably a quarter of a mile maybe god really was on the settlers side or maybe a horse made a bigger target than a man for the nobles mount staggered then fell pinning him beneath its weight another chunk of iron or stone knocked over an archer behind warwick together the two downfalls made the rest of the settlers whod taken the noblemans side realize they might not have decided wisely drop anchor henry cried it splashed into the sea he didnt want the wind to sweep them past the enemys archers the roses timbers groaned as she slowed boom that was bartholomew smiths gun ready before henrys more of the archers whod backed warwick fell the rest ran faster than the armored soldiers none of them would ever have faced gunfire before a lot of them would never even have heard it it was frightening enough when the gun wasnt aimed at you when it was henry didnt aim his piece at the fleeing settlers once warwick was dealt with theyd be good neighbors again they would want to pretend theyd never been here and he was willing to let them though he wasnt so sure richard would be the soldiers on the other handif you wanted to keep your flock safe you had to get rid of the wolves he lowered the torch to the touchhole boom the powder stank of brimstone and warwicks men had to think hell was visiting them there by the strand more of them toppled writhing on the sand and mud reload henry yelled again his ears rang the rest of the sailors must have too well give it to them one more time richard radcliffe stood over the earl of warwick even with his dead horse dragged off him he wasnt going anywhere hed broken a leg in his fall pain twisted his face as he glared up at richard well he said through bloody lips youve won villein make an end to it if youd be so kind damned saltpeter i ought to let you suffer first richard said you killed my father not in my own person and you in your own person did murder my men and spur them to avenge in blood they were robbing him of what wasnt theirs to take richard didnt need to argue any moredidnt need to and didnt intend to he drew his bow and shot warwick in the face the nobleman kicked for a few minutes then lay still richard let out a long sigh the worst was over his men were finishing warwicks wounded troopers cutting their throats or shooting them or knocking them over the head a few troopers still slogged back toward new hastings if they surrendered he supposed he would let them live if they wanted to go on fighting they wouldnt last long not with their liege lord dead one of the settlers whod sided with warwick lay on the sand an arrow through his calf he eyed radcliffe apprehensively what are you going to do to me he asked as richard approached i was going to take out the arrow and bandage you up richard said you were a bloody fool tim but you wont be that kind of bloody fool again the wounded man started to cry god bless you he grizzled oh bless you shut up or youll make me sorry i dont do something worse richard said roughly hed never known what to do with praise he knelt by tim and cut away his breeches so he could see how the arrow had gone through im going to break off the head and then pull the shaft back through it will hurt some and youll bleed somenot too much with luck he cut through the shaft with his knife till he could snap off the head without moving the rest of the arrow very much tim groaned anyway richard didnt suppose he could blame the other man for that ready he said then before tim could answer he pulled the shaft out the way it had gone in the other man howled and twisted blood poured from both ends of the wound but it didnt spurt so richard hoped the arrow hadnt cut any major blood vessels he bandaged tim with the length of breeches leg hed cut off if i get you a stick can you walk he asked not yet the other man replied better to wait till the bleedings stopped for a while richard grunted tim made sense we did it someone called from the sea richard looked up his brother was coming ashore in the roses boat we did by our lady richard agreed henry jumped out of the boat and looked down at warwicks corpse he stirred it with his foot then stepped away richard said this sort of thing mustnt happen again not ever he looked at his hands which were red with tims blood shaking his head he washed them in the ocean we shouldnt fight ourselves theres room here for all of us well when word of this gets back to england the king will know better than to foist worthless nobles off on us henry said he didnt even mean to give us warwickthat bloody skipper couldnt find freetown richard shrugged freetown new hastingswhat difference does it make he would have plagued them the same way he plagued us atlantis shouldnt be englands dumping ground dammit no eh his brothers grin was crooked then what are we doing here making our own lives with nobody to tell us what to do or how to do it richard said i like that fine thank you kindly once we get all this nonsense settled ill go back into the woodsitll be good to get away youre welcome to them a few nights under the trees were plenty to last me a lifetime henry looked down at dead warwick again and then over at tim im surprised you didnt do for him too part of me wanted to richard answered but with warwick gone he wont be any trouble its done better to let it go i thought so henry said i wasnt sure you would well i do richard said enough is enough or it had better be if we dont let it go tims greatgrandson will be stealing my greatgrandsons sheep and burning his barn well have feuds here like a pack of damned frenchmen thats not what father wanted father was no meek mild man henry said he stood up to warwick when he could have bowed down before him he was ready to fight if he had to if he had to richard bore down hard on the words but he wouldnt have troubled warwick if warwick didnt trouble him he never told anybody here what to do not unless someone asked him for advice thats how i want things to go from here on out nobody should be able to order anyone else about when adam delved and eve span who was then a gentleman henry quoted the peasants cry in wat tylers rebellion ninety years before sounds fair to me richard said warwick didnt want to work he wanted to take what other people worked for well he could get by with that in england till he made the king angry at him but why should we put up with it here he didnt deserve what he stole he deserved what he got im not quarreling with you richard his brother said good richard radcliffe replied youd better not not about this the only building in new hastings large enough to hold most of the crowd that gathered was the church bishop john had built big on purpose as if planning a church for a town the size of the old hastings from which theyd sailed but bishop john how had he got so gray and stooped wasnt in the pulpit on this bright wednesday morning henry radcliffe was richard hadnt wanted the job and wouldnt have done it well had he wanted it speaking to lots of people made him shy henry tried to imagine a shy man skippering a fishing boat the picture wouldnt form he had his flaws but that wasnt one of them we are one folk again he said and his voice which was big enough to reach from bow to stern through a gale was big enough to fill the church too one folk he repeated we fell out for a while but thats over my father is dead warwick is dead too men who backed both of them have died isnt that enough isnt the battle of the strand enough do we need to go on hating each other go on killing each other any more he looked out to the people of new hastings he wasnt altogether sure what they would say to that some of the men on his side had wanted to see everyone whod chosen the earl of warwick dead they were shaking their heads with everybody else though maybe it was harder to stay bloodthirsty in a house of god he could hope so lets remember what we did here these past few weeks he went on that got everyones notice people must have thought he would say lets forget lets not remember to keep old feuds alive lets remember to make sure new feuds dont start the one we had cost us too much we need no more like it standing beside him bishop john smiled and nodded this is the voice of christianity speaking he said this is the voice of god speaking let it be so he made the sign of the cross henry crossed himself too he didnt know whether god was speaking through him he only knew he never wanted to have to try to kill his neighbors again he didnt want them trying to kill him either he nodded to his brother one by one richard carried up the mailshirts of warwicks last soldiers the ones whod yielded themselves after the battle of the strand they stood in the church too henry could see a couple of them and could see their apprehensive faces the ironmongery next to the pulpit made quite a pile a couple of other men brought up helmets and swords and laid them by the stack we dont need these things henry said earnestly by god and all the saints we dont not among ourselves oh we ought to have them so we can make a better fight if more robbers from across the sea try to take away what isnt theirs to take but we should never use them to lord it over each other never he slammed his fist down on the pulpit he thought richard first began to clap that didnt surprise henry radcliffe his brother had never wanted anyone lording it over him what did surprise henry was the way everyone else in the church joined richard till the applause came back in waves from the vaulted ceiling and till a bat sleeping up there in the rafters was frightened awake and fled squeaking out into the unaccustomed day slowly like a storm at sea the clapping ebbed hearing it let henry feel more confident continuing the men who gave up their armor and weapons have taken oath that they will not trouble us again as long as they hold to their promise let them be treated like any other men of new hastings they loyally served their master the earl of warwick now that he is gone they will loyally serve the settlement he got more applausenot so much as he had before but enough to show that the settlers agreed with himand enough to show the surviving soldiers that they wouldnt be killed out of hand relief wreathed their features when they realized that henry thought they were safe enough as long as they didnt stir up trouble that would have to do times will change he said we saw that when warwick came well see it againwe will and our children and our childrens children and down through the generations to the end of days as long as we try though and as long as god helps we can ride out all the storms the way we rode out this one this time bishop john led the clapping as applause filled the church once more the bishop spoke to henry in a low voice a good thing youre a secular man or youd steal my see from me i dont want it your grace henry answered i just want to be able to get on with my life i sound like richard he thought for now you have that you could have atlantis i think if you wanted it john said i dont henry said again atlantis can go on however it pleases and that will suit me fine i wonder what sort of town new hastings will be in a couple of hundred years he looked to the west i wonder what sort of town avalon will be by then part two avalon xi t here was a day when avalon was the wildest wickedest wantonest city in all of atlantis and all of terranova too it wasnt a long day not even so long as the prime of a mans life but there was never another one like it not before or since not anywhere and when it ended it ended in a way worthy of what had gone before red rodney radcliffe brought the black hand into avalon bay after a profitable summer raiding the towns and shipping of the terranovan coast the dutchmen and the spaniards beyond the broad hesperian gulf cursed his name the spaniards called him a heretic the dutchmen who were protestants themselves called him worse than that rodney radcliffe only laughed they could call him whatever they pleased as long as they couldnt catch himand they couldnt nothing could catch the black handso red rodney swore he wasnt far wrong either the brigantine made of fine atlantean redwood and pine scudded over the waves with the wind astern she could make twelve knots shed come from terranova to atlantis in just over three and a half days and left whatever might be chasing her far behind land ho came the cry from the crows nest atop the mainmast and then a moment later damned if thats not the gateway dead ahead the mate a oneeyed bruiser named ben jackson lifted a threecornered hat from his head the closest to a salute red rodney was likely to get nicely steered skipper he said i thank you if radcliffe sounded smug who could blame him hed brought his ship across a thousand miles of open ocean and put her exactly where she needed to go better than moses by god jackson said with a gaptoothed grin i should hope so red rodney grinned back he took blasphemy for grantedas who on the black hand did not moses wandered forty years before he led his people to the promised land and he died before he got in were here againnot for the first time nor even for the twentyfirst and im not ready to turn up my toes just yet better not be think how many pretty ladiesd be sorry if you did the mate tipped him a wink or even the ones who arent so bloody pretty if youve been at sea long enough if you want to waste your time with ugly women thats your affair radcliffe said nothing but the best for me the best ship the best crew the best loot weve got plenty of that jackson broke in we do red rodney agreed furs and prime pipeweed lay in the holds along with a mayors silver plate and a governors gold hed seized two fat merchants to ransom and upwards of a dozen copperskinned terranovan natives the men would be hewers of wood and drawers of water one brothelkeeper or another in avalon would be glad to buy the wenches the copperskins moans floated up from below the dutch merchants kept their big mouths shut they would be fine even if they had to say farewell to some of their fortunes they would that is unless their kinsfolk preferred the loot to the merchants in which case they would cook over a slow fire but the natives knew a short life and not a merry one awaited them why not mourn a pinnace and two light galleys patrolled the gateway the freebooters of avalon might have to fight to hold what was theirs forts on the northern and southern spits that closed avalon bay so well mounted heavier guns than any ship of the line would carry run up our flag red rodney called the black hand on white flew from bowsprit and stern and from atop the mainmast the brigantine carried a fine set of flags in her locker she could show englands st georges cross either alone or differenced with the redcrested eagle of the eastern atlantean settlements she could show the red and white stripes of a portuguese merchantman swedens gold cross on blue spains red and white and gold hollands red and white and blue the crown and fleursdelys of france or even the corsican moors head or she could show her true colors as she was doing now one of the galleys rowed out to meet her it stayed off her bow where its gun could strike without fear of reply galleys were nimble galleys were quickbut galleys werent seaworthy enough for long cruises and carried too many men and not enough supplies to go far they did make firstrate guard dogs though thin across the water a challenge came show yourself red rodney ill do it radcliffe shouted back as he strode to the bow is that you stephen how are meg and the brats good enough good enough the captain of the galley answered and how was the hunting out west rodney struck a pose better than good enough by christ then pass in stephen said the galley slipped out of the brigantines way graceful as a dancer the black hand glided into avalon bay there were days when william radcliff wished his name were jones or bostwick or even kersauzon by all the signs this was going to be one of them no matter that the trading firm he ran from the growing town of stuarta trading firm whose ships sent salt fish and timber and other goods from terranova all the way to arkhangelskwas as honest and reliable as the phases of the moon no much too often no matter at all the gentleman come to do business with radcliff today was a stout londoner named elijah walton he wore a fancy powdered wig and badly wrinkled velvet that must have stayed folded in its trunk all the way across the atlantic a pleasure to meet you mr radcliff he said extending his right hand and you mr walton when william took the master merchants hand he was surprised at the strength of his grip more to walton than met the eye then he surely had all the fashionable vices he took from his pocket a small enamelware box took out a pinch of the powdered terranovan herb it contained and then inhaled it after an explosive sneeze he held out the box care for some snuff yourself sir no thanks i dont use pipeweed in any form i fear i trade in it but its not to my personal taste in wool and linen the only hair on his head that which he was born with radcliff knew he seemed a crude settler to the sophisticate from the mother country well so what he told himself he is what he is and i am what i am with a shrug elijah walton made the enameled snuffbox disappear may i ask you a question mr radcliff without fear of offending more to him than met the eyeand also less william was as sure he knew what the question would be as he was of well the phases of the moon go ahead he said no doubt sounding as resigned as he felt ah you will have heard it before then nothing wrong with waltons ear i shall ask it nonetheless the similarity of the surname but for one character the prominence of men of that surname however spelled in atlantis these past two centurieshave you a family connection with red rodney radcliffe of avalon to my shame mr walton i do we both descend from edward radcliffe through henry rodneys grandfather and mine were brothers so we are second cousins knowing this does not delight menor i daresay him but i would not dissemble that no doubt speaks well for your integrity which i have already heard highly praised elijah walton said william shrugged you are too kind sir i might also remark that my lying here would serve little purpose since you can inquire of almost anyone in stuart and learn the truth in short order did i try to conceal it something in the way the master merchants rather protuberant gray eyes glinted told radcliff that he had already made those inquiries and knew the answer before asking the question a test then well i passed it by christ william thought walton did not admit to any such thing aloud however instead he asked why the curtailed spelling on your branch of the tree that happened in my grandfathers day or so i am told william radcliff replied he hated waste in any form and so lopped off the final e i marvel that he did not leave you but a single f walton observed the story is that he thought hard on that but decided not to for fear men might pronounce the name radclif william lengthened the i in the last syllable i cannot say of my own knowledge whether this be truehe died when i was a boy one more impertinent question the londoner asked a small smile playing across his full red lips ask sir ask william said if it be impertinent enough i will put you out on the street once more and be damned to your business to his surprise waltons smile got wider and if it be impertinent enough you will put me out on the street without bothering to open the door before you pitch me through it well i hope to avoid that at any rate all i wish to know is what is your opinion of yournotorious cousin again this is something you could learn from others besides me william radcliff said in a word i despise him not only does he dip the family name in the chamber pot not only does he revel in befouling it but he also preys on my ships whenever he finds the chance if i could kill him with my own hands it would be a pleasureand a privilege walton took another pinch of snuff this time he had to slap the lid back onto the box lest his sneeze blow its expensive contents all over radcliffs office potent stuff he said dabbing at his streaming eyes with a blue silk handkerchief well sirvery well indeed in fact how would you like to win that privilege and take that pleasure william radcliff leaned toward walton so intently that the older paunchier man gave back a pace tell me more radcliff said avalon despised law scoffed at law reviled lawand lived by law what the pirate town would never have accepted if imposed from outside its freebooters took upon themselves without a qualm a virgin carrying a sack of gold could go from one end of avalon to the other without let or hindranceso long as she was and was known to be under the protection of one pirate lord or another flags fluttered from the hilltop forts of avalon red rodneys black hand on white christopher moodys swordarm and skull on red cutpurse charlie condents three skulls and crossbones on a long black pennant goldbeard walter kennedys naked headsman holding an hourglass stede bonnets skull and heart and dagger and more besides some of the chieftains hated others and would attack them on sight anywhere else in the hesperian gulf the atlantic or the bay of mexico in avalon though a truce and the rule behind it had held for most of a lifetime you dont shit where you eat red rodney radcliffe sometimes dreamt of uniting all the pirates of western avalon under the black hand he dreamt not of harrying the terranovan towns but of seizing them and ruling themof going from pirate to king only one thing kept him from trying it the certain knowledge that all the other chieftains would combine against him the instant he tried to change them from equals to subjects he knew he wasnt he knew he couldnt be the only captain with dreams like that he also knew he would cut the ballocks off any man who tried to make him bend the knee knowing that kept him from trying to impose himself on the others with his loot and his hostages and his slaves safe inside black hand fortone of the best since it lay close to the harbor and had a reliable well even though it was on high groundhe could relax fields of indigo and sugar cane were beginning to stretch across southern atlantis with sugar naturally came rum at sea rodney doled out a glass of grog to his men each day he took no more for himself lest they think he thought he was better than they were ashore ashore he could drink to his hearts content and so could they when he couldnt steal rum he traded for it like an honest man and he wasnt the only freebooter who did this is the life he told his daughter the rum sang in him but he hadnt drunk himself sleepy yet he hadnt drunk himself mean yet either well of course it is ethel radcliffe was eleven and knew no other none of the women rodney had taken into his bed since her mother had dared mistreat her in any wayor not for long one wench who roused his ire in that regard left black hand fort most suddenly naked and with stripes on her back ethel drank rum too and swore and scratched as she pleased she was a dead shot with a pistol red rodney laughed and tousled her butteryyellow hair one of these days soon by god ill bring you along with me when i set sail blast my mizzen if you wouldnt make a better raider than most of the dogs i could scrape up here do it the pirates daughter said eagerly i want to shoot a dutchman or even a copperskin can i shoot one of the copperskins you brought back sorry love not this lot rodney answered ethel pouted why not her voice took on a sugared whine that could coax almost anything out of her father almostbut not quite because theyre worth good silver to me thats why not rodney radcliffe said and they cost blood to take that makes em too dear to kill for sport whether killing them for sport was wrong didnt worry him silver did silver was one more measure of a mans rank among men but i want to ethel persisted she didnt care to come up short at anythingwhich only proved she was her fathers daughter no red rodney said and the flush that mounted to his cheeks came from choler as well as rum my men listen to me youd bloody well better too if they dont listen i make em sorry you think i cant make you sorry he didnt put his foot down very often when he did he was likely to crush whatever lay beneath it that could include ethel as she had painful reason to remember the whine didnt go away but it did change course well what can i shoot then if you have to shoot something go up on the stockade and shoot the first stray dog you see nobodyll miss that her father answered and after you do get one of the slaveys to chuck the carcass into the bay dont leave it lying there to rot and stink does that suit you you little rakehell id still rather shoot a copperskin ethel said red rodneys face must have sent up storm warnings for she backtracked in a hurry a stray dog will do i suppose better than nothing she hurried away a few minutes later a pistol banged rodney was tearing into roasted honker then and couldnt hear the dog howl he guessed it did though because ethel didnt come back unhappy a smile spread over his face hed done what a father should do hed pleased his little girland hed got her out of his hair for a while he didnt smile so much about the honker what have we got here he demanded this sorry bastards no bigger than a roosters drumstick he exaggerated and by no small amount but hed seen plenty of bigger honker legs begging your pardon sir but its the best the hunters brought back the cook replied likely tell likely tell rodney said when i was ethels age by christ the honkers were three times the size of this miserable bird hunters say sir that the big ones are all goneat least from close enough to avalon to bring them back before they spoil the cook told him they have to shoot the smaller scrubbier kinds instead even those are harder to find than they were once upon a time sweet suffering jesus rodney poured himself more rum will we have to start raising sheep and goats and cows are we farmers or are we men the cook maintained a prudent silence he was no pirate himself hed cooked for the governor of nieuw haarlem in terranova till red rodney captured him and carried him back to avalon after eating some of his food rodney refused a ransom for him the cook hadnt done badly hereor rather he might have done much worse and he was smart enough to know it if he said too much his lot might change in a hurry running out of honkers rodney said bloody hell whats atlantis coming to if were running out of honkers meinheer piet kieft had impressive waxed mustaches and an even more impressive pot belly the governor of nieuw haarlem nodded to william radcliff i do not love your cousin he said in gutturally accented english well your excellency i must say that id wager ive not loved him for longer than you have william replied he has robbed me plundered my ships done all he could to hurt me piet kieft snapped his fingers and poured more rum into his pewter cup did he ever make you jump out a window naked when you were about to futter a serving girl with the best tits in the world he paused meditatively it was a secondstory window oh dear elijah walton said before william could respond to that id heard you were somewhat discommoded in that raid your excellency but i confess i did not realize the full extent of your ah difficulties please accept my sympathies and mine william added he hoped for the serving girls sake shed been about to get on top this is not even the worst of it kieft continued that son of a sow of a red rodney radcliffe that blackhanded bastard he stole from me my prime cook and would not sell him back to me it is war to the knife between me and him yes you look as if youve spent all the time since starving william thought piet kieft hadnt come to stuart to be mocked though well your excellency now is the time to see whether we can pay him back pay him back for sacking my townja kieft said i sack his pay him back for stealing cornelius and making katrina giggle when she sees me instead of opening her legseven if i cut his heart out it is not enough his piggy little eyes flashed he wasnt pretty but william radcliff wouldnt have wanted him for an enemy you have ships walton said mr radcliff here our kindly host has ships i also have ships at my beck and call if we gather together our separate contingents and sail against avalon with overwhelming force it will be the greatest miracle since the resurrection of our lord and savior jesus christ radcliff finished for him your lack of spirit is distressing walton said i dont lack spiritno such thing william replied but who will bell the cat and when and how i admire you sir for persuading meinheer kieft to confer with us nevertheless people have been mooting the fall of avalon since the pirates first seized it that is many years ago now but they hold it still they go on holding it too if we dont work against them piet kieft said i aim to work against themand most against red rodneyno matter what you do but master walton is right we have a better chance if we work together i will do this i do not even claim command that made william radcliff blink that a dutchman would take orders from an englishman at seawas no small miracle itself the dutch reckoned themselves the best sailors in the world and the english would have been hard pressed to prove them wrong england and holland had fought two naval wars in the past generation and the dutch had got the better of it both times well well william radcliff turned to elijah walton if our comrade is so generous can we fail to match him walton frowned my instructions are that an englishman should lead the fleet against the corsairs and what am i if not an englishmanand the man on the spot radcliff asked angrily if you call me a damned honker sir as if i were a new hastings man i will wish you joy of our enterpriseand much luck in taking it anywhere without the aid of radcliff of stuart be not overhasty mr radcliff i pray you walton said all these insults come from your own mouth and none from mine you say this can you prove it will you prove it william pressed or by saying i am but an atlantean will you make me out to be a worthless settler not deserving to associate with let alone lead his betters from the mother country coughing elijah walton answered you cannot deny sir that your roots have been transplanted away from english soil these two centuries past bugger my roots my heart is english radcliff said piet kieft stirred you started this walton you set the pot on the fire will you now take it off and let it go cold because you cannot get all of your way or did you come here for just that purpose so you could go back to london and say i tried but we could reach no agreement against these corsairs before god meinheer kieft i did not walton exclaimed kieft looked around william radcliffs baroque jewel box of a study the bookshelves with volumes in english and latin and french the polished brass astrolable on the wall part decoration part tool the readycut quills and the jars of ink the coffee simmering over a low fire the calico cat curled up asleep on a cushion this place seems english enough to suit me does it not seem to you the same perhaps walton flushed or perhaps it was a trick of the light streaming in through the southfacing octagonal window the veritable englishmans gaze fixed on a honker skull cleaned and polished that held down one of the piles of paper on radcliffs desk the honker seemed to stare back from empty eye sockets oh come now sir william said come now you might see the same the very same in a merchants residence in london or a scholars as a curiosity of natural philosophy deny it if you can instead of denying it elijah walton grunted oh very well he saidmost grudgingly but say it he did shall we style you grand high admiral of the hesperian gulf then he gave a mocking seated bow i care little what you call me william radcliff answered if i do what i set out to do everyone who comes along will try his damnedest to filch the credit from me and if i fail ill be that stupid honker from atlantis and all the blame will come down on my head you win either way mr walton piet kieft chuckled and nodded he too knew what being a settler meant as for waltonhe did not seem entirely displeased at the prospect a pigeon fluttered into the roost at black hand fort pigeons had spread with men in atlantis several native varieties of dove lived here including a couple with wings too stunted to let them fly but there had been no pigeons till people brought them hither this particular pigeon had a piece of parchment tied to its left leg the handler who spied the parchment gently removed it read the note on the inner surface and hotfooted it to red rodneys chamber his knock didnt quite interrupt the pirate captain at play which was lucky for him rodneys companion squeaked and yanked a silk coverletloot from one of the small spanishheld islands south of atlantisup to her chin dont fret yourself jenny he wouldnt dare bother me if it werent important radcliffe said as he pulled up his breeches he also raised his voice whats toward a pigeon from stuart came the voice from the other side of the door ha red rodney threw on his shirt too he was still barefoot but he didnt care he went without shoes aboard ship more often than not the better to feel the deck under his soles i knew it had to be something that mattered and i dont jenny said sulkily but he was already striding toward the door his mind moved perhaps even faster than his feet of course he had spies on the east coast who in his right mind wouldnt he assumed his foes had spies in avalon too they had reason not to love him and reason to try to find out what he was up to with luck he could feed them full of lies and maybe they were trying to do the same to him well hed find out his thumb came down on the latch he scowled at the man in the hallway whats going on mick it had better be interesting his voice warned pigeon just in from stuart skipper mick repeated and held out the message the bird had carried red rodney needed to squint to read it the handwriting was precise but tiny to cram as much as possible into a small space as he read he started to swear youve seen this he demanded i have indeed the irishman answered well keep your mouth shut about it till i decide what to do can you manage that sure and i can youd better by christ dutchmen and englishmen and my own coldhearted cousin if thats not a mix cooked up in hell i dont know what would be they aim to gut us mick gut us like a honker after you knock it over the head are we going to let them get away with it the pigeonkeeper muttered something in erse rodney radcliffe didnt know what it meant but it didnt sound as if the man favored giving their enemies an easy time no one in avalon would what the english did to pirates they caught could make the hardest man shiver of nights and what the english did was a mercy next to what happened when the spaniards got hold of you the spaniards liked whips and they liked fire he read the scrap of parchment again the spaniards didnt seem to be part of the gang william radcliff was putting together rodney assumed his cousin crouched at the center of the plot where else would a spider go returning to english mick asked how do you aim to stop the spalpeens now well have to fight em we cant very well run away now can we red rodney said the other pirate shook his head rodney muttered under his breath could freebooters fight as a fleet they would have to wouldnt they he could see the need would his fellow great captains be able to how many of them were in avalon right now how many would get back soon youll need a grand parley wont you mick said i was thinking that very thing rodney answered a grand parley been a while since we had one the pirate chieftains of avalon were independent princes they parleyed to keep from fighting among themselves rarely for any other reason would they hearken when rodney summoned them theyd better hearken by god he thought otherwise the first well know of the enemy is when he starts cannonading us even figuring out where to hold a grand parley took more in the way of diplomacy than most corsairs had in them he couldnt invite his fellow captains to black hand fort oh he could if he aimed to start the squabble he wanted to head off they would think he was trying to lure them all to one place at the same time so he could get rid of them at once if he got an invitation like that he would think the same thing himself he had to find neutral ground some unkind or possibly jealous soul had called avalon the sodom of atlantis a visitor from the other coast the somber coast had marveled that so many pirates were sick then he saw how the freebooters drank and marveled even more that they werent all dead marys paradise would do if no other place sufficed it was the biggest bawdiest grandest brothel and tavern in avalon red rodney knew he would have to pay mary carleton a goodly sum to take her establishment out of circulation long enough for the chieftains to meet there no one in avalon did things from the goodness of hisor herheart maybe he could get some money back from his fellow captains or maybe not jenny squawked when she heard that red rodney purposed talking with mary carleton you want some poxy trollop she shrilled youll swive her and then youll fetch the foulness back to me id be poxed if i tried buggering goldbeard or cutpurse charlie thats certain sure red rodney replied with a laugh but i want em there to do them a favor not to try to take their favors oh yes jenny didnt want to believe him and you wont even look at the doxies falling out of their dresses theyre as common as a barbers chair they areones out and the next ones in and who was the man who paid five hundred pieces of eight just to see some strumpet naked ive heard the story but i dont know the sorry bastards name radcliffe answered it wasnt meill tell you that if id laid down so much silver idve got more than a look for it sure enoughlikely you would have got the gleets his lady love said however snide jenny was rodney sent a man he trusted to dicker a price from mary carleton she proved more reasonable than hed expected i know which side my breads buttered on she told radcliffes emissary well get enough of the ordinary business now that the black hands back in port that being settled red rodney sent messages to the other chieftains of avalon to the men who would have to lead the fight against the dutch and the english and the eastern settlers if there was going to be one some of them were or had been his foes he sent to them anyhow under flag of truce he hoped curiosity would bring them to marys paradise if nothing else did for he was not in the habit of doing that a captain of an earlier generation when a priest asked him on his deathbed to forgive his enemies answered i have nonei killed them all red rodney wasnt quite so deadly but not from lack of effort some of the other pirate lords promised to come others said no at first patiently rodney sent to them again you hurt only yourselves if you stay away he wrote if you want to go on doing what youre doing you need to hear me when he went down to marys paradise he wore a ruffled shirtnot quite cleanand a jacket of velvet shot through with gold threads that was splendid even if it didnt fit him quite so well as the spaniard for whom it was made he carried a cutlass a dagger two pistols in his belt and a tiny one in his boot his guards dressed more plainly but carried just as many weapons you can futter the wenches if you find any you fancy he told them but god help your scurvied souls if you get drunk youre here to fight if you have to and not to fight if you dont need to no brawling for the fun of it not today and maybe that would do some good and maybe it wouldnt his crew was better ordered than most but men whod put up with royal navy discipline didnt turn pirate to begin with and even royal navy sailors roistered ashore besides if one of the other chieftains men started trouble or if his own followers could claim they did well he would worry about that if he had to the same way he would worry about jenny slipping hemlock into his beer he tried not to think about how black her scowl was as he left black hand fort he had a standardbearer carrying his banner and another carrying a white flag to show he didnt intend to fight unless he had to similar processions wound down from the other fortresses no one pulled out a pistol or fired a matchlock it wasnt quite a miracle but red rodney took it for a good sign mary carleton greeted him under a red lantern welcome she said the room is waiting thank you mistress mary he said more respectfully than hed thought he would she had to be at least thirtyfive but she was still a finelooking woman rum and roast meats sat on the table a couple of captains had got there before him they were already eating and drinking one of them nodded to him saying this is a good spread what kind of nonsense are you going to spout i wouldnt throw away this kind of money to spout nonsense red rodney answered he poured himself some rum and waited to see who would come and who wouldnt to his surprise all the captains hed invited showed up some of them scowled at him some scowled at one another but nobody grabbed for a sword or a gun lets hear your lies radcliffe said bertrand caradeuc in buzzing breton accents a gold hoop glittered in his right ear you want lies go home to your mistress red rodney answered most of the chieftains laughed a few glowered the ones he guessed who feared their mistresses were filling their ears with lies he swigged from his mug of rum and went on the sheep are starting to think theyre wolves the honkers are trying to grow eagles wings the bastards in stuart aim to kill us all and you know this because goldbeard walter kennedy inquired he was an enormous man several inches taller than rodney who was no stripling himself and wider through the shoulders the beard that gave him his sobriquet spilled halfway down his chest radcliffe told exactly how he knew it though he didnt name his spy in stuart we can let them pick us off a ship at a time the way theyre bound to want to he said or we can stand together and show em were not to be trifled with which would you rather how do we know youre not lying so you get to tell us what to do caradeuc inquired because i wont lead us even if you bloody well ask me to red rodney replied the renunciation hurt but he knew he had to make it pick somebody else in this fight ill follow him whoever he is if i have a quarrel with him it can wait till later everything else can wait till later he impressed them with that hed thought he would they werent used to backing away from power they were used to grabbing with both hands they wrangled and shouted and swore and finally chose michel de grammont to command fewer of them hated him than anyone else that seemed a good enough reason to them what kind of high captain he would maketheyd find out xii w illiam radcliff was furious in a coldblooded stuartish way when he got command of a fleet to wipe the pirates of avalon off the map he rashly assumed the fleet would assemble some time before judgment day now he was wondering if he hadnt been unduly optimistic it wasnt as if stuart lacked a fine harbor in which to assemble avalon boasted one as good but assuredly no other anchorage in atlantis came close two rivers and several islands met there and stuart lay at the heart of them all no matter how the wind blew ships could get in and out and find secure places to put up william was hard pressed to think of a harbor in europe or terranova that could say the same he wondered why his severaltimesgreatgrandfather hadnt settled here rather than down at new hastings the only thing he could think of was that edward radcliffe must have been content to put down roots wherever the wind happened to blow him ashore that only proved the founder wasnt so sly as people made him out to be and am i william radcliff wondered he had authority to bind and to loose a whole fleet the only difficulty was that despite promises from both elijah walton and piet kieft the fleet at the moment consisted of his own merchantmen and not one vessel more merchantmen by the nature of things werent warships they werent particularly fast they were built to haul not to sprint and most of the time they werent heavily armed hed done what he could to correct that but guns heavier than twelvepounders were impossible to lay hold of in a peaceful settlement walton had promised heavier cannon to turn merchantmen into reasonable facsimiles of ships of the line but so far the promised guns were as chimerical as the promised ships you will drive trade away and make your friends repent of their friendship if you curse everyone who comes near you his wife remarked one afternoon when his sarcasm curdled into blasphemy i beg your humble pardon tamsin william answered still and all i would take oath you have sworn too many profane oaths already tamsin radcliff broke in i would take oath william repeated stubbornly that the devil has in hell a special firepit he stokes extra hot for the purpose of properly tormenting souls who make promises they do not purpose keeping i am certain all will be as you wish in due course tamsin had a sunny nature she needed it or the master merchants frequent glooms would have oppressed her more if the promise be fulfilled in due course that will not be as i wish radcliff said do you suppose they are sitting idly by in avalon by no means his wife replied more likely than not they are drinking and wenching and dicing and brawling why would they turn pirate if not to do such things she wasnt wrong all the same william said also without the tiniest bit of doubt they are readying themselves for our onslaught against them they will surely have learned of it by now had we moved against them sooner we might have taken them unawares you cannot move alone tamsin said william nodded heavily if i could have i would have long since no for a sea war on such a scale i needs must have confederates and a man who must rely on others to see that certain things are done is a man who must resign himself to knowing they may never be done and are the freebooters of avalon better off in this regard tamsin asked can one man among em snap his fingers and have the others follow his whim like so many trained mastiffs or do they wait upon developments and quarrel over them the same way you and your friends do he stared at her then he kissed her she let out a startled squawk that wasnt something he commonly did in the middle of the day you are a wonder he said a wonderdo you hear me i hear you i am glad to hear you tamsin radcliff said primly but why do you say it because you remind me of something i almost forgot william answered i see all my own troubles but none of my foes yet they must have em for are they not flesh and blood even as am i he scowled red rodney the mangy hound is flesh of my flesh blood of my blood as that fat toad of a walton tires not of reminding me you are not to be blamed for it tamsin was loyal to his branch of the family not by you perhaps in london and in nieuw haarlem too many cant tell the difference between a radcliffe and a radcliff he pronounced red rodneys version of the family name with three syllables as no radcliffe ever born had done his wife nodded so she saw his point he went on if half of them blame me for what he does all the more reason to be rid of him for good she said all the more reason yesand all the less chance william drummed his fingers on his thigh i want to be at sea not tied here waiting if the dutchman and the londoner fail you you should put to sea by yourself tamsin said all our ships put together can beat red rodney radcliffe she pronounced the name with three syllables too we can beat red rodney yes william said we cannot beat all of avalon banded together and the freebooters will fight like cornered rats for they know what awaits them if they lose without marines to stiffen them i doubt my men would fight so well why should they they put to sea to trade not to war they will fight if forced to it yes but not for the sport of it they will fight for moneyor some of them will tamsin said shrewdly a big enough price on the heads of the pirate captains theyve had prices on their heads for years william sounded as gloomy as he felt theyre out there yet robbing and stealing and murdering they make us all look like jackasses his hands balled into fists by god tammy they trifle with us i am no man to be trifled with and anyone who thinks otherwise will to his sorrow discover himself mistaken have you any way to hurry kieft or walton his wife asked he shook his head they trifle with me too and they think i shall forget it because we are on the same side you know me do i ever forget anyone who does me a bad turn no but contrariwise you never forget anyone who does you a good turn either had you not the one quality to go with the other i could not love youand i do a good thing too id go on the rocks without you but unless we lance this abscess on our western coastwilliams mind kept coming back to what lay uppermost within itall of atlantis will go on the rocks and regardless of what piet kieft and the sainted elijah walton may say i do not intend to let that happen black hand fort had a crows nest that was a funny name for it but served well enough it was a big wooden bucket mounted high atop a redwood trunk thicker than a mainmast red rodney radcliffe and his lookouts could go there clambering up the lines nimble as monkeys and see for miles in every direction ethel could too and she loved to do it red rodney wished she wouldnt he told her she mustnt he paddled her behind when she didand he still found her in the crows nest when he went up one morning to look around she flinched when he scrambled over the edge and into the bucket im sorry father she said and then her spirit reviving im sorry you caught me not as sorry as you will be soon he said but his heart wasnt in the threat he had too many other things on his mind when he looked down at avalons harbor he didnt like what he saw too many brigs and brigantines too many sloops too many shallops a few racebuilt galleons but only a few most of the pirates ships were small and swift able to put up a great spread of sail and run after their prey or run away from danger they could fight when they had to but only when they had to how would the fleet of pirate ships stand up against a new english or dutch ship of the line pirate ships rarely mounted anything bigger than twelvepounders they were made to take merchantmen and to flee from naval vessels what if they couldnt flee what if they had to defend their home port he muttered under his breath even in the twentyodd years hed roamed the seas ships of the line had grown larger and more deadly a firstrate manofwar could mount thirty fortytwopounders thirty twentyfourpounders twenty twelvepounders and twenty more smaller guns a broadside from a ship like that would turn a brigantine to kindling and splinters in the blink of an eye in a fight out on the open sea it wouldnt matter because brigantines and sloops and shallops could run away from any ship of the line ever built but if the menofwar were bearing down on avalonif they were doing that the corsairs couldnt very well run not unless they wanted to run away from their town and their harbor and start fresh somewhere else red rodney didnt want to do that neither did the other chieftains or they wouldnt have agreed to fight but agreeing to fight wasnt the same as knowing how to go about it another long look at the ships that lay at anchor inside avalon bay said as much pa that was ethel by the way she called to him shed been trying to get his attention for some little while why arent you thumping me pa you always do when you catch me up here getting a thumping seemed better to her than seeing the regular order of things overturned some people were like that he gave her a straight answer thinking her due one im trying to figure out how our little ships can beat the big ones our enemies are going to throw at us well thats not so hard ethel said with a childs boundless confidence if theyre bigger weve got to be faster and smarter so we hit them and they cant hit back easier to say than to do rodney warned you say that you ethel sent him a reproachful look dont they call you the horror of the hesperian gulf pride at being a horrors daughter rang in her voice they do rodney agreed and i am what they call me he had pride of his own plenty of it he also had worries of his own plenty of them if it were just the sea fight id not worry but those buggers back in stuart want to close our shop down they want avalon is what they want the town cant put on topgallants and spankers and sail away from their bloody fleet he could be more open about his fears with his daughter than with his henchmen or his fellow corsair captains come what might ethel wouldnt call him coward she did point north to the fort warding avalons northern tip to the galleys guarding the gateway and to the other fort on the northern spit that helped form the bay we can keep them out she said confident still redhot rounds and chainshot will make the bally blighters sorry they ever tried to poke their noses in radcliffe grinned his daughter not only thought like a pirate she talked like one too he tousled her hair well chick maybe youre right he said i hope to christ you are he thought but that didnt pass his lips marcus radcliffe was a lean dark weatherbeaten man who wore a honkerskin rain cloak feathered side out above his shirt and breeches he seemed out of place in settled stuart and especially out of place in william radcliffs elegant study radcliff poured radcliffe a glass of sherry your health cousin he said smiling and yours coz radcliffe said to radcliff they both drank marcus radcliffe thoughtfully smacked his lips not bad not bad im more used to ale and beer myself well youre not the only one i drink them a lot of the time myself william allowed but i try to serve my guests something finer kind of you marcus radcliffe sipped again and then again by the way the level of the wine in his glass sank he thought it fine enough william poured the glass full again though the name is the same or near enough we are not close cousins are we not hardly marcus had a harsher accent than william you come down through henry and i through richard my father would always say your line wanted money and got it my line wanted freedom and were still looking for it the more atlantis fills up the harder it is to come by money buys freedom william radcliff said freedom from want freedom from trouble you havent got troubles marcus radcliffe laughed whyd you ask me here then because i have a question and you seem the man best suited to answer it william replied long way from new grinstead to stuart just for the sake of a question marcus said to williams way of thinking it was a long way from new grinstead to anywhere the little town sat far back in the woods west of new hastings more than halfway to the green ridge mountains as far as william knew no towns lay farther from the coast from new grinstead marcus radcliffe and others like him could plunge into the atlantean wilderness with no one to tell them where to wander or when to come home and that was what made williams distant cousin valuable to him here is that question and make of it what you will he said do you believe you could lead an army of a thousand men with all the necessities they would need for fighting upon their arrival across atlantis to avalon by a date to be agreed upon ha marcus said and then you really have it in for red rodney dont you and hes closer kin to you than i am in a word yes william said tightly well its not like terranova marcus radcliffe seemed as thoughtful now as he had tasting the sherry we wouldnt have to fight our way through tribes of copperskins therell be a few in the woods and a few runaway niggers from down in the south but not many and theyd run from an army that size they wouldnt try to fight so that would be all right anyhow or i think it would then you can do it william heard the eager hunger in his own voice i didnt say so im still working it through thats a long march that isupwards of three hundred miles even if youre talking about starting from new grinstead subsisting your soldierswouldnt be easy and it might not be possible why william demanded does not every man who goes into the woods acclaim the marvelous abundance and splendid hunting they afford thats a fact marcus said you want me to go to avalon and be there on suchandsuch a day ready to fight ill do it you want me and ten of my friends to go i think we could do it after that it gets harder no maize to eat the way there would be amongst the terranovans no roads so no supply wagons even horses have a hard timesometimes the meadows are few and far between and youd have to have horses for men cant carry close to a months worth of food on their backs theyd shoot some on the way but a thousand men couldnt shoot enough to stay fed i dont believe the woods hold enough to feed a compact mass of a thousand men he spread his hands im sorry coz the more i think on it the worse the chances look you start with a thousand soldiers you might have a couple of hundred starving souls make it all the way to avalon william would have been angrier at his kinsman had he not feared the same thing he did ask are you sure sure who can be sure of anything before it happens except the lord marcus answered but i do think it likely and in case your next question is whether id care to chance it i have to tell you no im not sure thats your next question mind but i do think it likely do you indeed william gave him a crooked grin well i wouldnt have an easy time making a liar out of you sorry not to be more help coz but i dont care to shit my life into the chamber pot either marcus radcliffe said you have a pungent turn of phrase william observed you ought to write for the gossip sheet they started here you would make everyone despise you than which nothing i am sure would delight the publisher more no thanks marcus said now that ive answered your question for you im for new grinstead again and for wherever else i please as long as you came so far will you tolerate two questions rather than one william asked well i might his backwoods cousin drawled long as you pour me out another glass of that wine those grapes died happy for sure i think i might oblige you there william filled marcus glass again then his own let me try this if we ever see the promised dutch and english ships could i persuade youand you persuade some of your backwoods fellowsto serve aboard my merchantmen as marksmen at sea and as a landing force when we reach avalon i know some people who dont shy away from a fight and thats a fact marcus said dont know whether theyd fancy one on the ocean dont know whether i would myself either i have to cipher that out chances are youll have all the time you require william radcliffe said dolefully the next ship we see of those promised will be the first if my friends treated me that way id make em sorry for itto hell with me if i wouldnt marcus said if my friends treated me so i should make them sorry for it too william replied the gentlemen who promised however are not my friends merely associates with whom i share certain interests i love them not nor they me marcus drained the last of his wine why put in with em then nothing simpler william said because one of the interests we share is seeing red rodney radcliffe damn his black soul to hell hanged in chains signal flags red rodney radcliffe exclaimed in high glee as he stood at the wheel of the black hand do you ever reckon a bunch of bally freebootersd fly signal flags like the bleeding royal navy not me ben jackson answered we have enough trouble getting our own bastards to do like we say most of the time let alone the buggers who fight for somebody else its a corsair fleet its a corsair navy by god red rodney raised his voice to call to the sailor who was raising the flags aloft signal form line of battle quint ill do it skipper quint said and he did hed served in the royal navy himself till he jumped ship at stuart and made his way to avalon piracy suited him better than shouts and curses and kicks from petty officers with the lash or the yardarm waiting if he got too far out of line almost every shallop and brigantine that sailed out of avalon carried at least one man whod been part of the royal navy and knew something about signal flags quite a few men who couldnt write their own names or read them if they saw them were intimately familiar with dozens of flags in the royal navy the admiral could and would punish any captain who refused his orders radcliffe wished he could do that but he would have a war on his hands if he tried and not the one he wanted besides he wasnt the admiral not in the formal sensehed turned the job down the other pirate captains had done just what he hoped they would when they chose michel de grammont to lead them de grammont wasnt even important enough to come to the meeting when he was named the majority of the pirates of avalon were english which made it hard for them to take a frenchman seriously his ship wasnt a big or a strong one in other words he made an ideal figurehead red rodney wished his own ship were built for him from the keel up not sailed out of a dutch port on the terranovan coast in a hail of musket bullets then she could look the way she did in his minds eye with the figurehead of a big black hand below the bowsprit everyone would know her from a mile off and fear herand fear him too that would be very fine not everybody was falling into line the other pirates didnt want to follow his ordersor anyone elses not for nothing were they called freebooters even if obeying someone else would do them good they werent interested if obeying someone else would save their necks they were up against that now it didnt seem to matter the mate saw the same thing maybe we ought to fight dutchstyle and not like englishmen jackson said then itd be every man for himself like and all the ships could do what they do best and they could get blasted out of the water one at a bloody time rodney said ben jackson scowled like any other corsair he liked his own conceits best it works for the dutchmen he said stubbornly they make england bleed every time they tangle of course they do radcliffe replied they have ships to match the english menofwar so they can tangle with em one on one can we do that can any ship in avalon take on a threemasted ship of the line by her lonesome jackson went on scowling but he shook his bullet head reckon not he didnt want to admit it but he didnt have much choice i reckon not too red rodney said so we have to find some other way to beat those scuts if its not fighting in a line what is it he meant the question to make the mate agree there was no other way instead jackson proposed one that surprised radcliffe what surprised him more was that the longer the mate talked the better he liked the idea when jackson finished red rodney threw back his head and laughed out loud he pounded the mate on the back jackson was bigger and probably stronger than he was but rodney staggered him all the same by god we will do that he exclaimed we will and well see how the honest gentlemen of stuart like it he laughed some more william radcliff went down to the harbor almost every day it wasnt so much that he hoped to see warships gathered there he did hope to see thembut after so much disappointment those hopes werent high he went anyway merchantmen came into stuart others sailed out some were his others belonged to his rivals he kept an eye on as many of them as he could if the man who ran a trading firm didnt know what was going on how could he tell the people who worked for him what to do sail ho the cry came from the east from the lookouts who watched for incoming ships pirates had raided stuart a generation earlier and caught the town by surprise that would never happen again stuart had better walls and bigger guns on those walls than was true a generation earlier too it also had more men who could snatch up a musket and fight a generation before stuart had been new and raw a town on the edge of settlement now it was part of the hinterland new raw towns were springing up to the north and to the west sail ho sail ho the cry rang out again and again somebody added its a bloody forest of masts out there william couldnt see them yet and then all at once he did for a moment alarm swept through him that was no fleet of merchantmen hed planned to go after avalon were the pirates aiming to beat him to the punch in spite of stuarts improved fortifications then he breathed easier pirates didnt sail threemasted ships they didnt have the crews to man them maybe a big fleet from terranova was coming in or maybe just maybe by god william breathed seeing the union jack flying from the mastheads of each ship they took their own sweet time but they finally went and did it six ships of the line and six smaller vessels tied up at the quays sailors swarmed ashore to do what they would in stuarts taverns and brothels and in due course elijah walton waddled off the largest manofwar the royal sovereign its figurehead king charles in a flowing curly wig was almost frighteningly realistic he gave william radcliff a bow well flavoredperhaps overflavoredwith irony your fleet admiralas much of it as the dutchmen arent doling out walton said i do not see them here have you any notion when they intend to make an appearanceor indeed if they do no sir i do not william replied evenly but then up until your sails were sighted i would have said the same of the royal navy do you insult me waltons voice went silky with danger if you do we can continue this discussion through our friends after that the fleet may find itself with a new admiral if you are a man insulted by plain facts sir i shall discuss the matter with whomever you please william said had you let me finish you would have heard me counsel a bit more patience so much already having been required he watched walton chew on that at last grudgingly the englishman replied well perhaps it were best to save our bullets for the blighters on the other side perhaps i say if you feel otherwise i assure you i shall endeavor to give satisfaction ill kill you if i can he meant the language of ceremony was a strange and wonderful thing william radcliff bowed if at the end we find each other incongenial we can pursue it then in the meanwhile as you say there are others we should oppose in arms one thing at a time sir one thing at a time walton agreed not the worst motto ive ever heard would you care to come aboard and view your flagship i should be pleased to do so and thank you for the courtesy radcliff said the royal sovereign differed from a merchantman not in essence but in scale elijah walton rattled off the numbers as the two men strode the main deck and the quarterdeck the ship was feet long had a beam of feet and displaced around tons she carried sailors most of them men who could find no easier way to earn a living or whose families had gone to sea for generations walton didnt say that but william radcliff knew it full well even so he sprang from such a family though not all the radcliffes and radcliffs were tied to the sea as they had been in the days of edward the founder marcus and many others had sunk deep roots in the soil of atlantis and you will want to see the guns walton said indeed they and the sails are the point of the whole affair eh radcliff said he ended up admiring them more than hed thought he would his merchantmen went armed too to beat back pirates if they could he was intimately familiar with twelvepounders and smaller pieces that made him think the fortytwopounders on the lower gun deck would have nothing new to show him but he turned out to be wrong the sheer brutal mass of those big iron monsters took his breath away when he remarked on it walton smiled a man who knows tabby cats may think he knows lions toohe may that is until he hears a lion roar that have i never done william said i have it is the most astounding thing walton said when you hear that sound you are afraid you may be the boldest warrior since hercules but you are afraid at some level below conscious thought it is as though the knowledge that this beast eats men were somehow stamped upon your soul interesting i should like the experience one day did you hear a lion in the wilds of africa or at a london zoological garden the latter i fear elijah walton replied i have been off the african coasta place full of sickness of no value to anyone but for the trade in slaves it affordsbut i did not hear the creatures there in london yes strange is it not it truly is radcliff looked back toward the houses and shops of stuart a few built of stone but more from the abundant atlantean redwoods and pines this is a growing town one day soon we ought to have a zoological garden of our own that our folk might see the marvels of other lands and of your own walton said so much of what dwells in atlantis is unique to it william radcliff shrugged our folk are used to honkers and redcrested eagles and cucumber slugs and the like well the explorers and settlers are in regions inhabited for some little while you understand these creatures grow scarce and die out to be replaced by productions more familiar to your common englishman believe it or not sir much of atlantis is a civilized land let it be as you say that was also the language of courtesy and meant walton didnt believe it for a minute one deck higher the long twentyfourpounders threw lighter balls than the carronades below but threw them farther let a couple of these tear through a lightly built pirates scantlings and watch the water pour in william radcliff said with a certain gloating anticipation how can they propose to stand against us walton asked our ships so greatly outweigh theirs the fight scarcely seems fair i cannot imagine their opposing us on the sea william answered more likely they will seek to keep us from entering avalon bay and from sacking their hellhole of a town what other sensible thing could they do none i can see the englishman said he was a sensible man so was william radcliff they were too sensible to see that when fighting sensible opponents acting sensible himself might be the least sensible thing red rodney radcliffe could do aldo cucari wasnt even a pirate he was a fisherman who put to sea from avalon he didnt have enough to make stealing his small substance worth the corsairs while they laughed at him for working so hard but they bought his fish he spoke french with a funny accent and english with a funnier one but when he came to black hand fort and asked to talk to red rodney the ruffians at the gate let him through he didnt quite interrupt a tender moment between the pirate chief and jenny but he came close enough to leave her miffed will we never be free of gabbling little nuisances she grumbled as rodney dressed he only laughed just goes to show you never raised a child sweetheart and away he went a pistol on his belt he knew aldo but you never could tell someone had given the fisherman a cup of wine he had no pistol nor even an eating knife when rodney strode into the room where he waited he jumped up set down the wine and bowed almost double ah buon giorno signore rodney rosso signore radcliffe he cried i is just in from out of the north red rodney nodded thats what they told me by god finding out what was going on up in the north was worth getting out of bed even if jenny didnt think so what did you see up there dutchmens aldo cucari said solemnly three big dutchmens ships of the line six smaller dutchmens like to the ships that sail out of avalon they go east bloody hell of course they do three menofwar half a dozen brigantines or the equivalent six more menofwar from london with a like number of smaller supporters however many merchantmen william clippede radcliff could scrape together at stuart plus their auxiliaries the merchantmen wouldnt have the speed or the firepower of a firstrate ship of the line but theyd be bad enough red rodney glowered down at the small swarthy italian you swear this is the truth by the cross signore aldo cucari crossed himself you could be a papist in avalon or a protestant or a mahometan or even a jew no one cared enough to kill you for it which wasnt true all over atlantis aldo went on by my mothers honor signore people laughed at aldo for working hard but no one had ever called him a coward and if you challenged his mothers honorif you challenged the honor of any mans motherhe was bound to kill you if he could all right then radcliffe said youve told me what i need to know and im grateful the fisherman bowed again it is my honor too signore rodney honors all very well but you cant eat it see what you can buy with these red rodney pressed two gleaming gold sovereigns into aldos callused hand one more bow you is a man of great heart signore and a man of open hands as well i hoped for one sovereigni thought my news is worth one but two two only a man of great heart would give two he stepped forward embraced the pirate captain and bussed him first on the right cheek then on the left frenchmen and spaniards would do the same thing sometimes red rodney clapped aldo on the back and made a joke of it you arent pretty enough for that ah well the fisherman grinned and fired back if i is doing it for looks you isnt pretty enough neither he came very close to dying then even with rodneys gold coins in his hand only blood washed away insults in avalonif you decided they were insults if you laughed them off thoughrodney did i may be ugly but i have fun how about you every so often i find a girl whohow you sayshe no see so good or maybe is too dark to see good who knows who cares i has fun too rodney shouted for more wine the servant who brought it was a copperskinned terranovan native everybody called him old abe hed been in avalon almost as long as rodney had been alive smallpox scars slagged his face but hed lived through the disease and never needed to worry about it again a lot of copperskins turned up their toes in a hurry after they met europeans or atlanteans that was one reason white settlement was spreading on the western mainland though not so fast as it was in previously uninhabited atlantis heres to fun rodney said and aldo cucari drank with him but even as the rough red wine slid down his throat he was weighing the odds nine ships of the line people farther east had hated avalon for a long time theyd always said they had anyhow never till now though had they seemed serious it was hard to get much more serious than nine ships of the line and assorted auxiliaries well they might bethey were bound to begathering at stuart but from stuart to avalon was a long way long in terms of sailing even longer in terms of the spirit that animated each town aldo anyone might think would have fit better in stuart but hed lived there for a little while and didnt care for the dull stolid burghers who ran the place whatever else avalon was dull and stolid it wasnt the pirate captain poured wine with the same lavish hand hed used to pass out money raising his cup he shouted heres to frying my godcursed cousin aldo drank with himwhy not and rodney radcliffe laughed and laughed yes heres to frying him in his own damned pan xiii w illiam radcliffs secretary was a plump nearsighted man named shadrach spencer william was making a complicated calculation about just how much to charge for terranovan pipeweed in london when spencer stuck his head into the office and said i beg your pardon sir but there is agentleman here whom i think you should see he didnt casually say such things one reason hed worked for william for more than fifteen years well send him in then william said setting down his quill lets find out what he has to say as radcliff expected from his secretarys tone the individual in question was no gentleman but a backwoods ruffian who put him in mind of his distant cousin marcus the man carried a parcel wrapped in cloth he wore a wool shirt and suede breeches with fringes no razor had sullied his cheek for several days all the more reason to receive him as if he were the heir to a duchy good day sir i am william radcliff william said bowing i fear you have the advantage of me my name is dill hiram dill the backwoodsman shook hands politely enough then remarked thirsty work riding in from past the edge of town shadrach tend to that would you radcliff said certainly sir his secretary bustled off returning a moment later with a flagon of fineor at least stronggin from nieuw haarlem and two glasses he poured for william and his guest your health sir william said to hiram dill raising his glass dill drank his eyes got wide im bound to be healthy if i pour this stuff down he said itd poison anything that tried to sicken me and thats the lords truth courteously radcliff poured him a refill as dill drank it down with as much alacrity as hed shown for the first sample william asked and what was it impelled you to ride in to stuart from as you say past the edge of town well i was hunting for the pot last night and i let fly with my shotgun at a pigeon flying by and i bagged methis here hiram dill had a sense of the dramatic whatever his other shortcomings might have been he undid the cloth around his loosely wrapped parcel it was a pigeon as ordinary a pigeon as ever hatched atlantis boasted several varieties of extraordinary pigeons one was creamcolored with bright red eyes one too big and heavy to fly had a feathery crest that looked like curly hair one was a dark green bird that disappeared completely against the needlefilled branches of redwoods and pines but this was a plain english pigeon like the ones that cooed and strutted in the streets of stuart hoping for handouts its head was green its body shades of gray and white the only unusual thing about it was a bit of parchment tied around its right leg a message william asked hiram dill nodded william asked another question youve read it well sure dill answered couldnt very well know you needed to see it if i hadnt now could i no indeed radcliff said gravely and what does it say see for yourself the backwoodsman replied his scarred and callused fingers surprisingly deft he undid the message from the birds leg and handed it to william the fine tiny spidery hand defeated williams sight which was beginning to lengthen he called in shadrach spencer read this out for me if you would be so kind of course sir his secretary held the parchment so close to his eyes it all but bumped his nose it says in stuart harbor nine ships of the line twelve armed merchantmen fifteen lesser ships sailing soon against avalon i am not surprised to learn we have a spy amongst us but neither am i heartened to learn it the iniquity some men will embrace william shook his head then he brightened as for you mr dill i freely own myself to be in your debt hiram dill didnt say anything his face however bore an expression remarkable for its cupidity he had brought the pigeon to william for no other reason than to hear those words from his lips william spoke to his secretary in a low voice spencer nodded and hurried off as he had when radcliff asked him to fetch the gin this time he needed longer to return when he did he pressed a small velvet sack into william radcliffs hand radcliff in turn presented the sack to hiram dill with my compliments sir judas could no more have kept from counting the wealth hed got from the romans than dill could have stopped himself from opening the sack and seeing what lay inside five pounds he exclaimed god bless you mr radcliff i didnt look for so much and thats the lords truth too you have earned it i would say earned it and more did i not fear that would make you importunate william said with a smile i have known for long and long that the pirates of avalon spied upon stuart how they spied upon us no one here knewtill now hiram dill grinned back i expect therell be a deal of pigeon hunting in town the next little while i expect you are right mr dill radcliff replied i expect you are just exactly right and i expect someone will be very unhappy when we uncover him for a polecat for a lying tricking snake in the grass what will you do to him something worth watching i hope dill said oh yes radcliff nodded i dont know yet what it will be sir but i promise you that anyone who sees it will remember it to the end of his days red rodney radcliffe was not a happy man when he was unhappy he thought himself dutybound to make everyone around him unhappy too damn it to hell why havent we heard from stuart he growled somebody over there has his thumb up his bum how are we supposed to know when the godcursed fleet is sailing if they dont send pigeons maybe somethings gone wrong with the birds ethel suggested no doubt theyve come down poxed on account of wasting their silver at the bird brothels they need a better class of pigeon pimps red rodney laughed he thought he was funny and that was all that mattered to him his daughter was harder to amuse maybe the fat fools back there have finally twigged to your using pigeons and theyre shooting all the birds they see going out good luck to em rodney said theyd do better to shoot the bugger who sets the birds free he meant that as a sardonic retort to put ethel in her place but the words seemed to hang in the air the more he mulled them over the likelier they felt ethel must have felt the same way for she asked what can you do about it if they have shot him damn all i fear red rodney said morosely id have to get somebody else with pigeons to stuart that might not be easy not if the bastards there are waiting for me to try it you could put pigeons on a scout ship up near north cape ethel said they wouldnt give as much warning as birds from stuart would but they fly faster than any ship can sail radcliffe started to trot out all the reasons why that was a foolish notion but stopped with his mouth hanging open try as he would he couldnt find any instead he gave ethel a big smacking kiss the devil fry me black if you wont command the black hand after im gone youve got the natural wit for it and the charm too ethel simpered she wasnt old enough yet to have the kind of charms she wanted but she also wanted to take a pirate crew into battle even now she would likely do a good job of it he tousled her hair your day will come sweetling but not quite yet ethel pouted he took no notice of her which was her good luck had his temper flared he would have made her sorry instead he called for mick the master of the dovecote nodded and knuckled his forehead when red rodney told him what he had in mind aye skipper we can do thatdamned if we cant he said you were in a sneaky mood when you thought of it eh im not to blame radcliffe said not without pride its my daughters notion well good on ethel then said mick who knew which side his bread was buttered on that very afternoon a pinnace slipped out of avalon harbor armed with only a handful of fourpounders the little ship couldnt hope to outfight even the lighter vessels that would be sailing from stuart but she boasted a broad spread of sail so she had a chance of getting away and she carried several pigeons in wicker cages so even if the enemy did run her down she could warn avalon that danger neared ethel was wild with rage when she found out the pinnace had sailed without her why didnt you let me go she shouted at her father you said i couldve done it i said your day was coming i didnt say it was here rodney replied i say it is ethel screeched you can say all sorts of things he said that doesnt mean you can back them up who says i cant she drew her pistol with startling speed and aimed it at his chest the bore of any firearm pointed straight at you seemed six or eight times as wide as it really was red rodney made no sudden moves furious as she was ethel might have squeezed the trigger first and thought about it only afterwardswhich would have been rather too late for him put that thing away he said shes already sailed and shes miles from here by now i cant call her back not fair ethel wailed the pistol swung away from red rodney he darted forward and grabbed her wrist the gun went off something smashed he didnt see what and he didnt much care as long as that heavy lead ball didnt thump into him ethel was tough and brave and strongand not nearly big enough for any of that to do her the least bit of good rodney got her over his knee and smacked her behind her wailsor maybe the pistol shotbrought people on the run only a mistake red rodney told them shes finding out better now oh no im not ethel yelled oh yes you are by god her father continued to apply himself to her seat of learning you dont aim a damned gun at somebody unless you aim to kill him and youd damned well better not aim to kill the bastard who spawned you have you got that you little hellcat he did his best to make sure shed got it by her tears by her red blotchy face and by his own hot red palm his best was plenty good he didnt stop though until she sobbed enough father enough that took longer than hed thought it would he admired her strength to hold outbut he would have gone to the rack before he said so mind from now on do you hear me he growled yes father she stared down at the floor she didnt try to sit down after he let her go he suspected she would sleep on her stomach when night came this isnt a game dammit rodney radcliffe said roughly this is a war if the buggers in stuart win it theyll knock avalon flat and theyll hang everybody they can catch you had a notion that gives us a better chance im going to use that notion the best way i know how with you or without you i dont have room to do anything else have you got that yes father ethel kept her eyes downcast all right then remember it oh ill remember father she looked him in the face then you dont need to worry about that she turned and walked away red rodney felt as if a gooseor by the weight of the strides a honkerhad just walked over his grave no ethel wouldnt forget till she was dead or he was and her expression told only too clearly which one of those she wanted royal navy ships carried royal marines bullocks sailors called them with affectionate scorn they were tough stolid men in red uniforms who fired from the fighting tops and led boarding parties and raiding parties the ships of the line from nieuw haarlem had similar contingents aboard the dutch marines might have been stamped from the same molds as their english counterparts save only that they wore different clothes william radcliffs merchantmen normally took no marines with them traders fought only in emergencies not as a matter of course and couldnt afford so many mostly idle hands aboard everything that happened between stuart and avalon though would be in the nature of an emergency william recruited hunters from all over englishspeaking atlantis they would not be so well disciplined as their counterparts in the menofwar but he thought they would serve his distant cousin marcus radcliffe came to stuart at the head of a company of sixty backwoodsmen they had no uniforms each wore what suited him and carried the kind of musket he liked best if they came from a mold it was not from the one that had produced the english and dutch marines marcus gave william a salute that would have provoked an apoplexy in a sergeant of royal marines well coz here we are he said hope we can give those pirates a bad time one way or another one way and another i suspect william said yes the backwoodsmen were sadly short on spit and polish he thought they could fight anyway and wished the rest of his recruits left him as confident from now till the fightings over youre a captain with a captains pay good marcus said matteroffactly i dont chase silver as hard as you do but i dont scare it off when it ambles into my sights either fine ill put you and your men into the pride of atlantis william pointed to the ship and do you recollect what we spoke of when last you visited stuart he didnt go into detail not when he hadnt yet tracked down the pigeon fanciers who kept avalon informed of what went on here marcus nodded im not likely to forget come the time you wont find us behindhand you may count on that good i didnt think i would find you so and i intend to count on it william sketched a salute then made his way down to the royal sovereign the admiral the boatswain cried and piped him aboard all the men on deck saluted as he came up the gangplank the naval salute was knucklesout so the person honored couldnt see a sailors pitchdirtied palm among the men saluting on deck was elijah walton we await your orders admiral he said with no irony william could hear standing by him was the royal sovereigns captain a redfaced veteran mariner named adam barber he was the man with whom and through whom radcliff would have to work take us out of the harbor mr barber william said wincing at his accidental rhyme once were on the open sea well have the leisure to shake ourselves out into a proper line aye aye sir barber replied he shouted the necessary orders signal flags fluttered up the lines to let the other ships know what they were supposed to do were pigeons flying out of stuart even now letting the corsairs of atlantis know their doom was on the way men with shotguns waited southwest of the city but the odds of stopping the birds were slim and william knew it sweating swearing sailors hauled up the anchor and the heavy rope that attached it to the ship slowly slowly they made the capstan turn the noise it made was half rumble half squeak their chanty rising over that noise was loudly and jauntily obscene sails unshrouded the masts and spars filled with canvas like a treean imported tree in atlantis where most of the natives were evergreenscoming into new leaf in springtime but a thousand times faster the royal sovereign slid away from the pier slowly at first but then with more speed and more confidence nothing like getting under weigh is there william said well sir i dont think so and thats a fact captain barber replied i suppose other folks can have other notions he turned to the pilot a stuart native who knew the waters of the harbor as intimately as he knew the contours of his wifes body i place myself in your capable hands mr mccormick and ill try not to make you sorry for it sir david mccormick answered as the royal sovereign slid past a clump of barrel trees he swung the wheel a couple of spokes worth to port the deeper channel here lies this way wed likely not go aground anyhow not unless the tide were lower but all the samewhy take the chance eh if i have to take a chance in battle thats one thing barber said it comes with my station you might say taking a chance on the way to battleis something i dont care to do thank you very much choose the deeper channel every time sir that is well said william radcliff put in enough danger we cant steer clear of what we can avoid best we do captain barber eyed him in some surprise meaning no offense sir but you have better sense than i was led to believe elijah walton tried to hide in plain sight well perhaps i do and perhaps i dont william said either way though wed do best to save our fighting for the pirates quarreling among ourselves wont get us anywhere but into trouble red rodney radcliffe waited for a pigeon from stuart letting him know the enemy fleet had sailed he waited and waited but no bird came something was wrong he didnt know what but something was william radcliff wouldnt wait not with all his ships assembled they must have caught your bird fancier jenny said when the pirate chief grumbled about it too bloody right they have rodney said gloomily and if they had what did that mean it meant he was waiting and waiting for a message he wouldnt get it also meant he was damn lucky hed sent that pinnace north god bless ethel he thought without the little ship and the birds aboard it his unloving and unloved cousins ships might have come up to avalon unannounced and undiscovered a surprise would have meant disaster nothing less the whole point of fighting the enemy menofwar was keeping them far away from the corsairs base if they took avalonif they did individual pirates and pirate ships might go on here and there but the present order of things where the freebooters were almost a nation and where their vessels ruled the hesperian gulf would die he took a fat gold ring out of a strongbox and pressed it onto one of jennys fingers it was too big for anything but her thumb red rodney didnt care keep it sweetheart he said she kissed him he was generous enough but not usually so generous as this what did i do what did i say she asked never mind he said youre you thats plenty jenny stared at the thick gold circlet but i want more you always do red rodney said not without affection you make a good pirate jenny huh that didnt suit her the way it would have suited ethel he might have known she wanted to be a fine lady what she was doing in avalon with a dream like thatwell people didnt always end up where they wanted to you had to do what you could with what life gave youeither that or you had to give it a good swift kick and make it do what you wanted women had a harder time there than men did no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than someone knocked on the bedroom door he and jenny were decorously clad this time she didnt have to duck under the covers he opened the door there stood mick ha rodney said is it word from stuart at bloody last maybe hed worried over nothing no skipperfrom the pinnace the irishman held out an unfolded scrap of parchment give me that radcliffe snatched it out of his hands we are not far from north cape he read enemy now coming into sight fleet is about the size you guessed it would be will get away if we can the message was dated the fourteenth whats todays date red rodney demanded the fifteenth isnt it jenny said from behind him mick nodded rodney radcliffe calculated how fast the enemy fleet could sail with reasonable winds they would get to atlantis in three or four more days they would that is unless they were stopped he had the chance to do just that we move he shouted so that both his mistress and the pigeon man jumped he went on shouting too so that first his own crew and then the rest of the corsairs of avalon would pay attention to him and they did the ragged mismatched fleet sailed the next morning aboard the black hand red rodney wore a smile that stretched from ear to ear if william radcliff wanted the pirates wrecked he would have to do it the hard way william radcliff looked discontentedly toward the atlantean coast here in the west with the warm current bathing the shore the weather stayed mild much farther north than it did on the other side of the green ridge mountains i wish wed been able to sink that pinnace he grumbled dont worry admiral elijah walton said william thought the englishman used the title to pacify him the way a mother might give a baby her breast walton went on we made the bastards aboard it beach themselves so they wouldnt be caught they wont pass word on to the freebooters that we bear down on avalonwell get there long before they can you are a clever man sirbut perhaps not so clever as you might be william said how have the pirates been spying out our every move in stuart by pigeon but you seem to have put a stop to that well i can hope i did william radcliff shrugged broad shoulders whether i did or not though i couldnt very well stop the men aboard that little ship from loosing whatever birds they had and i think it very likely they had some why was that ship there if not to spy out our coming no other reason makes sense and they would pass word on to avalon as quickly as ever they could they would know wed have swift ships aplenty and that they might be overtaken themselves only pigeons make sense then walton chewed on that with even less enthusiasm than he used for eating at sea he was not a good sailor not when the ocean turned rough as it had in the voyage up from stuart to north cape well you are right he said at last you are right and i wish to heaven you werent oh so do i radcliff replied but what difference does that make if we fail against the freebooters the ones who ran off the beach before we burnt their pinnace will come down to avalon sooner or later and find their fellows carrying on just as they were before a regiment might be unable to sustain itself traversing a long swath of atlantean terrain marcus radcliffe had made that all too plain to william but a smaller group as long as they kept their heads would not have much trouble finding enough to eat maybe a band of copperskinned renegadoes or escaped blackamoors will fall on them before they reach their promised land walton said maybe but not likely not in this quadrant of atlantis william radcliff said far more negro slaves in the french and spanish holdings in the southeast and the same holds true in lesser measure for the terranovan natives this is the least settled part of the land a pity for it seems no less fruitful than any other and rather more so than some farther east elijah walton said the only thing holding it back is its remotenesswell that and the dampening effect a bloody nest of pirates is apt to have on the settlements of honest men its time will come radcliff spoke with sublime confidence one dayand sooner than many believe especially back in englandthis land will be as well settled as the home islands and far more populous and prosperous walton looked shoreward himself no axe had ever touched these redwoods no farmhouses stood out in the meadow no cattle or sheep or horses grazed upon them no smoke betrayed human habitation anywhere close by a honker symbol of all that was old and wild about atlantis stared incuriously out to sea the englishman neither said anything nor needed to stubbornly william radcliff said that time will come sir not in my lifetime or yours perhaps but it will you may rely upon it we shall also continue with the deposition of the terranovan savages from their longtime haunts until they cease to encumber the western continent there i can scarcely disagree with you not when some of the savages have gold walton said a great pity the spaniards jumped on them first but we have not got poor on spains leavings indeed we havent if the corsairs plundered only spains ships i should not mind them a bit nor i william said but since they plunder me and mine i will end them if i can and with a fleet like this under my command i believe i can do nothing else the fleet was a grand sight spread out across the sea the great ships of the line bunched together in the center with faster more nimble vessels on either wing nothing matched the splendor of a big sailing ships stately passage over the sea it put radcliff in mind of a dowager gliding across the dance floor in skirts that swept out and concealed all the motion of her lower body but for the thrum of the breeze in the rigging and the laundryline sound of a sail filling with wind now and then the journey was almost silent which only added to its grandeur however grand and splendid it might be it wasnt fast enough to suit the admiral he didnt know what he could do about that well actually he did know he could do nothing even with a breeze from the north the fleet had to make headway against the warm current that came up from the other direction farther out in the hesperian gulf the current did not flow but the added distance and the unending uncertainty about longitude made evading the current anything but a sure timesaver we may still come upon avalon unawares walton said we may yes but i doubt we shall william replied oh ye of little faith the englishmans smile took most of the sting from the words i have faith radcliff said i have faith that the freebooters are less foolish than you make them out to be and his faith such as it was was vindicated when shouts from the fleets crows nests came down to the decks sail ho sail ho sail ho sail ho the lookout shouted from high in the black hands rigging sail ho sail ho the third repetition seemed to carry an almost desperate urgency red rodney radcliffe peered north he couldnt see anything from the brigantines deck he would soon enough thoughall too soon sailors had known the world was round long before landlubber scholars realized as much the way things came up over the seas long smooth horizon showed it plain as plain send form line of battle abreast he shouted to the royal navy renegade who made signals for him aye aye skipper quint answered with a grin and ran up the flags not far away the nominal admirals ship would hoist the same signal and hardly anyone would know red rodney had ordered the move first he only hoped the freedomloving captains who commanded the other ships would take the order seriously the bastards on the other side would do what their admiral told them to rodney radcliffe was only too sure of that he usually despised the men of stuart and england and nieuw haarlem for their slavish obedience in battle though he knew how much it mattered he was too busy looking to port and starboard to see what his colleagues and comrades were doing to pay much attention to what lay ahead for some little while when he did turn his eyes to the north again his stomach lurched as if he were prone to seasickness he had never seen such large ships so close before a pirate with an ounce of sense sheered off when he spied a firstrate ship of the line he wasnt likely to last long against one in a straightup fight they were in line of battle the menofwar and their accompanying scavengers all their ships sailed as if animated by a single will so rodney thought anyhow till he spied the gaggle of dutchmen keeping station on one another rather than with their english comrades but they didnt do much harm to the enemy line and conformed to the movements of the rest of the fleet his own ships on the other hand if he hadnt known theyd practiced staying together and fighting as a group he never would have believed it they straggled all over the sea if they formed a line it was a line drawn by a drunk at least they sailed toward the enemy fleet the wind blew from a little north of west which gave the enemy the weather gauge and the choice of fighting or declining battle the big ships sailed forward their masts blooming with sails they werent here to pull back neither was red rodney radcliffe he glanced toward those menofwar then he looked west out toward the edge of his own ragged lineand beyond looking that way meant looking into the westering sun red rodney smiled to himself in some ways this couldnt have worked out better if hed planned it for months he had planned to fight but knowing when the fleets would meet that was luck nothing else and luck favored him now luck favored him as long as he could make a fight of it anyhow a bow chaser on one of the enemy ships fired he saw the puff of smoke and the belch of fire before he heard the cannon go off bow and stern chasers were long guns which gave them more range than the pieces on the gun decks the iron ball splashed into the sea several hundred yards short of the closest pirate ship by the size of the splash it was a twelvepounder rodney muttered to himself twelvepounders were broadside guns on the black hand would a ball from one of them even pierce a ship of the lines thick iron planking hed find out before long william radcliff and the men who sailed with him would want to slug it out at close range of course they wouldthey had all the advantage that way a broadside from one of those monster ships could smash a brigantine to ruins the corsairs fight was slash and dart and run away but avalon couldnt run red rodney hated his cousin with a loathing all the more profound because william radcliff understood that too well individual freebooters could survive even if the worst befell their town their reign over the hesperian gulf that would be over over forever shall we answer them skipper called a pirate at the black hands bow gun it was a pipsqueak fourpounder good for nothing more than frightening ships that couldnt fight back red rodney nodded all the same yes by god he shouted let em know were here to give em what for a moment later the little popgun roared defiance at the approaching fleet its ball also fell short but by less than the first guns had the pirates manhandled it back into position swabbed out the bore thrust in the worm to dispose of any bits of smoldering wadding and then rammed home powder and ball and fired again several other bow chasers on both sides went off one ball struck home with a crash that echoed across the water red rodney eyed the enemy fleet with wary apprehension when william radcliff or whoever was in command judged the time ripe as smoothly as if theyd practiced together for years all the ships of the line and the smaller vessels with them swung to port hard to starboard red rodney shouted to his own helmsman and then to quint signal hard to starboard his own fleets broadside would be puny next to the one that came at it but he had to stand the gaff at least once yes the corsairs would take punishment but they would also dish some out and they would hold the enemy in position for a little while rodney radcliffe glanced west again they needed to do that if they were to have any chance of discomfiting the dogs out of stuart then the enemy broadside spoke and red rodney thought hed fallen into the end of the world the flame the smoke the thundera heavy cannon ball smashed into the black hands rail and decking the brigantine staggered radcliffe felt the shudder through his feet whistling whining splinters flew everywhere a man not six feet from him went down with a gurgling scream clutching at the jagged length of timber that speared his throat blood poured from the wound and from his mouth he was a dead man one who wasnt quite finished dying yet the corsairs broadside answered the one from the enemy even to radcliffes ear it sounded thin and ragged it didnt have the crushing weight of metal the english and dutch and eastern atlanteans enjoyed and it was disrupted by taking hits from those big guns even so a mast on one of the menofwar toppled on deck sailors on that ship ran like ants when a foot comes down red rodney whooped he wasnt so happy when he turned his eye toward his own side one pirate ship was on fire another slewing helplessly out of line with rudder shot away yet another with both masts down the menofwar fired again this time ship by ship they were happy enough pounding pirates to pieces red rodney looked west once more he could only hope the enemy admiral wasnt doing the same xiv w illiam radcliff watched in somber satisfaction as pirate ships crumpled under the thunderous barrage from his fleet aboard the royal sovereign sweating swearing barechested sailors reloaded and ran guns forward to fire again petty officers urged them on with shouts and with strokes from rattan sticks they are fools to try conclusions with us elijah walton said a little to the east a pirate brig caught fire men scurried like mice trying to douse the flames william didnt think theyd be able to they are fools to turn corsair to begin with he said sometimes you have to beat a fools folly out of him a roundshot slammed into the royal sovereigns oaken flank screams following the crash said the cannon ball or its splinters did their vicious work the pirates were brave enough they were almost madly brave to challenge ships so much larger and stronger than their own as if echoing that thought walton said this unequal combat makes me wonder what possible hope of victory the brigands had sir a midshipman still too young to shave dashed up to radcliff sir theres signals from out of the west fireships sir fireships william radcliff said and then something much more pungent than that fireships were every honest sailors nightmare you had to get away from them regardless of what that did to your line let fire get hold of a ship full of men and it became an oven on the instant fireships could do worse than that he still remembered the hellburner of antwerp from the century beforeas who did not it had been loaded with tons of gunpowder and more tons of metal junk and stonesand it blew hundreds maybe thousands of spaniards halfway to the moon if red rodney radcliffe remembered the hellburner too tell the signalman to raise each ship to act independently william said each ship to act independently aye aye sir the midshipman darted away walton peered west shading his eyes with the palm of his hand damned setting sun makes them bloody hard to spy he said yes william nodded and had his unloved and unloving cousin counted on that too william didnt know exactly how smart red rodney was tough and hard yes no doubt smart it wasnt so obvious or it hadnt been so obvious not till now the pirate chief knew what he was doing all right again elijah walton thought along with him this must be why the bugger accepted battle with us to begin with he wanted to hold us in place whilst launching his incendiaries at us that seems much too likely william said unhappily he too peered west now the plumes of smoke from the burning vessels were plain to see befouling a sky that should have been pristine also plain to see was his fleets disorder his ships steered every which way trying to escape those flaming harbingers of doom the pirates had nerve they hadnt just launched their fireships and then abandoned them to wind and wave the weapons would have been much less dangerous if they had instead men stayed on the burning vessels as long as they could steering them toward ships in williams fleet only at the last possible moment did the skeleton crews dive into the hesperian gulf and swim toward boats the fireships towed and it worked damn them one of the dutch ships of the line burst into flame and a horrible beauty was born the sails caught first the sails and the rigging and then the yards and the mast flaming canvas and tarred rope fell to the upper deck starting fresh fire there the dutchmen forgot their gunnery in the frantic quest to save themselves they might forget but their foes didnt pirate ships tenacious as terriers went right on shooting at them before long despairing sailors started jumping into the sea some struck out for the closest friendly ships others simply sank not all men who went to sea could swimfar from it the ones who couldnt decided drowning made an easier faster death than roasting if that choice came to him william radcliff decided he would make it the same way crash another cannon ball thudded into and through the royal sovereigns planking the manofwars gunnery had fallen off while the pirates fought harder than ever and with the ship of the line doing all she could to escape the freebooters fireships the enemy vessels could position themselves as they pleased and give her broadsides she couldnt answer what do we do admiral elijah walton asked hoarsely what can we do before hed always sounded sardonic when he used williams title no longer radcliff was the man who had the authority to save the fleetif he could he opened his mouth to speak before he could a thunderous blast staggered him sure as hell one of the fireships had blown up alongside a british manofwar william was amazed the explosion didnt take the british ship straight to the bottom it did take down two of the manofwars three masts set her afire and leave her helpless in the water maybe some men would get off her but she was ruined what do we do walton asked again desperation in his voice william radcliff looked at the fight he looked at the sun which almost kissed the smokestained horizon whatever they did they would have to do it soon we pull back he said and shouted for a midshipman to relay the message to the signal officer sail for stuart walton sounded as if that was exactly what he hoped to hear but william shook his head no by god theyve slowed us up they did something we didnt look for and they caught us flatfooted they hurt us but we arent beaten unless we own ourselves beaten well fix ourselves up as best we can and get on with the fight upon my soul elijah walton said bodies wrapped in sailcloth slid into the sea a round shot or two at the feet making sure they would sink fresh blood stained the black hands deck and splashed the masts and rigging soon enough it would go dark the stains would seem inoffensive enough thenunless you knew the story behind them the corsairs aboardthose who livedwere in a festive mood after the fireships did their fearsome work the men had watched the fleet that seemed invincible turn away and say it had done all the fighting it cared to do some of the pirates even wanted to go after their retreating foes red rodney radcliffe said no something in the way he said it persuaded even his crew of cutthroats not to press him any further he wasnt sure whether he would have reached for his cutlass or for his pistol if the pirates had pushed but he was ready to kill to keep from fighting any more today with a creak and a groan the pumps started up again a stream of water poured over the side as far as he knew the black hand had taken only one hit at the waterline and that one was patched nowafter a fashion all the same the leak continued it didnt seem to be getting any worse he was no praying man but he thanked god for that well we beat em back ben jackson said the mate had a new bandage on his left calf and walked with a limp damned if we didnt red rodney wished he didnt sound so surprised he tried to hide it with gruff kindness how are you doing ben its a fucking scratch thats all nothing but a fucking scratch jackson spat scornfully i got tickled by a flying toothpick higgins cut it out of me i wouldve taken care of it myself but it always hurts worse when you do your own rodney radcliffe nodded hed seen that too wounds were accidents you were always startled when you got hurt repairing them sometimes required deliberate damage to your own precious flesh hed known many otherwise ferocious men who couldnt face that what do we do now the mate asked i think all the great captains had better hash that out red rodney shouted to the signalman send up repair aboard the admirals ship while theres still light enough for the rest to read it repair aboard the admirals ship the royal navy renegade echoed aye aye skipper how many of the great captains still lived as far as radcliffe knew all their ships but one still floated but the number of dead and wounded on the battered black hand warned that not all of them would have dodged bad luck splash another body swathed in bloody canvas went into the drink red rodney scowled if we win another fight like this were bloody well ruined ben jackson shrugged broad shoulders well skipper were bloody well buggered if we lose too so where does that leave us in trouble radcliffe thought you didnt want to believe what a manofwars broadside could do to a ship and the black hand was lucky that leak wasnttoo bad she still had both masts and most of her yards and rigging men were aloft patching the sails she could go where she needed to go she could fight againif she had to the boat ride over to michel de grammonts ship was a relief while his men rowed him from one brigantine to the other radcliffe didnt have to think about anything the aigle dargent had taken less damage than the black hand rodney radcliffe supposed that was because de grammont hadnt wanted to close with the enemy and so fewer cannon balls had come her way at another time he would have something to say to the frenchman for now it could wait he clambered up over the side is it that we are victorious de grammont asked in accented english for now anyway red rodney said lets go back to your cabin what have you got to drink wine the admiral answered rodney radcliffe hid a sigh he wanted whiskey or rum but wine would do if he drank enough of it it was red and sweet and strongstrong for wine anyhow a couple of mugs began to build a wall between him and what had happened earlier in the afternoon one by one the other leading captains came aboard bertrand caradeucs earring was missing so was his right ear a marksman on one of william radcliffs armed merchantmen had shot it off had the ball flown a couple of inches to the left caradeuc wouldnt have been there goldbeard walter kennedy wasnt hed lost a leg above the knee and probably wouldnt live out the night his younger brother a massive man who carried the nickname brickyard came in his place we beat em brickyard said hed brought his own jug of something strong and swigged from it now we did red rodney sounded so gloomy about it he made everyone else stare at him and he had reason for sounding gloomy too what do we do if they come after us again tomorrow morning were out of fireships and wed never surprise em twice anyhow cutpurse charlie condent stared at him in horror they wouldnt do thatwould they he shook his head answering his own question nah course they wouldnt i lay theyre bound for stuart now tails between their legs how much radcliffe asked a gold sovereign ill take your money ill take it all rightif my damned cousin and his dogs dont take your life youre on by god condent said youll pay me when i see you in avalon or if you turn out to be right ill pay you when i see you thereor ill pay you when i see you in hell red rodney spat when he heard that to turn aside the evil omen so did brickyard kennedy watch your mouth charlie radcliffe said i didnt mean anything by it the other captain said watch your mouth anyway red rodney told him cutpurse charlie condent glared back at another time they might have gone for swords or pistols radcliffe thought about it anyway by the way that glare lingered so did cutpurse charlie but until they knew what the enemy ships were doing they had more important foes than each other we sank some of their ships of the line and wrecked some others bertrand caradeuc said they may have decided theyve had enough if they have we sail home and we fill up our forces again red rodney radcliffe said i know im not the only one who lost more than he wished he did the other captains all nodded hed been sure they would hed never knownhed never imagineda cannonading like that he counted the corsairs lucky that goldbeard kennedy was the only major skipper missing here to radcliffes surprise de grammont spoke up can we fight them again on the sea is anybody aiming to try if they come south again red rodney asked no one said anything for a long time at last brickyard kennedy said we beat em cutpurse charlies right about that they wont dare try to hit us again they sailed away after all we didnt he sounded like a man trying to convince himself as well as his comrades if they sail south in the morning and we fly before em we didnt really win a damned thing today condent added youre right red rodney said and so cutpurse charlie glowered some more and so you led us up here to beat them and drive them away and if we didnt why were we such a pack of damn fools as to follow you eh answer me that you sorry son of a dog rodney radcliffe resolved that he would kill the other captain first chance he got but that chance was not now he sighed we had a chance of doing it we may have done it even yet what other choice did we have let them land by avalon let them into avalon bay what are the forts for if not to hold those bastards out condent returned if we dont do everything we want out here on the open sea we can try something else later radcliffe said if we dont try anything out here and if the forts fail us its over weve lost and even if they do come forward now and have at the forts theyre weaker than they would have been if we didnt fight em here cutpurse charlie condent didnt glare any more he only rolled his eyes so are we he said and radcliffe found no quick comeback for that william radcliff did not order his captainsor even piet kieft who had to rate as a commodoreto repair aboard the royal sovereign he used signal lamps to order the fleet to stop and arranged the smaller faster ships in a circle around the surviving menofwar and merchantmen if the pirates came forward the heart of the fleet would have warning will you not discuss our next move with the officers who needs must make it elijah walton asked him i will not or why am i admiral radcliff returned tomorrow we fight again and if the captains should refuse your order walton persisted i shall construe that as making a mutiny and fire upon any ships failing in obedience william said dear god in heaven walton said you are a man who will eat fire even if you must kindle it yourself i am a man who will see the hesperian gulf cleared of pirates mr walton william said i am a man who will see avalon razed its present populace captured or scattered to the winds and the place settled with men of civil disposition it could be a jewel in the british crown of atlantis rather than a boil on his majestys arse you show yourself a settler no good englishman would speak of his majesty so i am a settler radcliff said proudly i am loyal to london across the seain however dilatory a fashion london may show its loyalty to me but i am also loyal to atlantis and i believe i have earned the right to hold that loyalty as well my forefathers settled here two centuries ago when two more centuries have passed i expect radcliffs to dwell here yet and in two centuries london had better look to its laurels for stuart will grow up to rival it elijah walton laughed william angrily clapped a hand to his pistol the laughter cut off and the admirals hand fell away i do beg pardon for my show of mirth but surely you must see the absurdity of your statement walton said london iswell london stuart makes a very tolerable town for a settlement on distant shores butmy dear fellow have you ever seen london do you know how greatly it outshines your home i took my baccalaureate at cambridgemy father thought that would aid me though we have colleges of our own on this side of the sea radcliff said so yes i have seen london and i do not say stuart compares now not in size not in riches not in wickedness but stuart grows faster time is on our side but for moonlight and distant lamplight waltons plump face was all shadows even if you should prove right i thank heaven ill not live to see the sorry day nor shall i william radcliff said i work towards it nonetheless cleansing avalon of its human wolves will move all atlantis some distance in the desired direction amazing walton murmured truly amazing william didnt know if that was compliment or objurgation nor did he care he had other more immediate worries he called for a midshipman one appeared like a genie from a bottle tell the men at the lanterns to signal the pride of atlantis that i desire to speak to marcus radcliffe as soon as he may come to this ship marcus radcliffe on the pride of atlantis aye aye sir the youngster trotted off williams distant cousin came aboard about half an hour later clambering up on the starboard side william waited near the rail is that you coz marcus asked almost as dark as a copperskins heart here its me william answered how are you and your men did you suffer badly in the fighting are you ready for more we had one dead and three wounded marcus answered one of the wounded can still fight the other two are laid up and well see how they do so you aim to go on with it do you i do william radcliff said without the least hesitation what do you think of that i think the pirates are praying you give it up and go home marcus replied how are they supposed to beat a fleet like this two days running theyll be the ones running if you hit them again youre a radcliffe by god even if our lines arent close william said laughing my only worry is the bastard leading the other sidehes a radcliffe too red rodney radcliffe was up before morning twilight grew very bright he stood on the black hands deck in the wan dawn light and peered north for the time being he didnt see anything the longer he didnt see anything the happier he got maybe the fleet from stuart really had had enough cutpurse charlie could take his sovereign and be welcome to it even if he gloated later any sails ben jackson showed up on deck only a few minutes after his skipper not yet rodney sounded as hopeful as he could the mate grunted good but just as the sun slid up over the eastern horizon a shout came from the crows nest sails ho jackson and red rodney swore together a scatological counterpoint radcliffe was dismayed enough to turn loose a question he knew to be foolish are you sure no doubt skipper the answer floated down sails in the north heading this way youll see em yourself soon enough who else would they be but the buggers we fought yesterday what do we do now jackson asked we signal the other ships in case they havent seen em yet rodney answered evading the mates real meaning after thatwell we have a little while to think he still couldnt see the sails himself though he knew hed be able to before long quint sent signal flags fluttering up the lines most of the other freebooters would already know the enemy was coming well so what you did what you could for everyone on your side to red rodney the idea was new and worth exploring further that his cousin took it for granted never crossed his mind some of the pirate ships returned acknowledgments others went on with what they were doing they wouldnt be able to ignore him and the enemy much longer maybe they realized that if they didnt it wasnt his fault hed done what he could there they are skipper ben jackson pointed to the northern horizon i see em radcliffe said grimly one thing anywaywe can always outsail em the big ones yes the mate said but if they send their brigs and suchlike after us maybe they can bring us to battle and delay us till the bloody stinking shiteating menofwar catch up red rodney swore that hadnt occurred to him jackson was rightno doubt about it no doubt they couldnt take another days hard fighting either that meant their best hopemaybe their only hopewas making a stand at avalon if they drove the enemy fleet back from their base they were still in business south radcliffe shouted his mind made up our course is south down the coast till were home again send up the flags quint well still make the foe sorry he ever came against us at his bellowed orders men swarmed aloft to swing the yards and set the sails to help the abrupt change of course the black hand was making she could turn tightlycould and did one of the enemy ships of the line fired a couple of bow chasers at her but the balls fell far short then she was around and picking up speed on her new course the manofwar fired again again the shot fell short before long the black hand showed the foe her heels occasional cannon fire boomed behind her maybe some of the enemys lighter vessels were catching up to pirates and engaging them as ben jackson had suggested or maybe some of the pirates didnt have the sense to pull back when the enemy came at them if they didnt they didnt have the sense god gave a honker so radcliffe thought anyhow his fellow captains were not in a good position to argue with him looking north he saw plumes of smoke rising into the sky those came from burning shipsthey couldnt very well spring from anything else not on the sea red rodney swore every time he spotted one some of his friends wouldnt make it back to avalon they were also his rivals but he didnt dwell on that not now ethel would scorn him for turning tail that was funny if you looked at it the rightor maybe the wrongway hed laid towns waste hed captured merchantmen past counting and killed and tortured to make sure he wrung every coppers worth of loot from them the wenching hed donehis full lips parted in a reminiscent smile jenny and her predecessors in avalonethels mother among themwere only a tiny part of it hed shown fear nowhere and never you were ruined if you did but he feared facing his own daughter when he got home ethel didnt understand how things worked in the real world her head was full of stories most of them had him as the hero which didnt make him feel any better now the black hand sailed close enough to the west coast of atlantis to let him watch it slide past he knew the look of the coastline as well as he knew the look of the skin on the back of his right hand if one of the great redwoods that marked it fell it was as if hed scratched himself a challenge gun boomed from the fort on the north spit shielding avalon bay he answered with one gun of his own a galley came out to look over his ship a couple of others from avalons fleet were also in sight what happened a man with leather lungs shouted from the galley we lost theyre after us red rodney shouted back the men on the closest galley swore red rodney had already done his swearing now he needed to fight the enemyif he could he cupped his hands in front of his mouth again let me through let all of us throughall of us who make it here weve got to get ready to hold our town what happens if we dont asked the man on the galley radcliffe didnt answer not with words he let his head flop onto one shoulder and jerked up with the other fist pantomiming a hanging the men on the galley cursed some more so did some of his own sailors he wondered why hanging he was sure was the best the pirates could hope for if avalon fell and they got caught drawing and quartering the stakehe shuddered so many nasty possibilities go on in the stronglunged sailor said well whip those bastards yet damned right rodney pumped his fist in the air again this time in defiance of the rest of the world his men cheered so did the other corsairs he waved to them keeping their spirits high wasnt the least important part of the role he played here they would have to fight and soon if they were to make a go of it somebody had to give them orders they all had to work together they couldnt fight crew by crew as ships did red rodney didnt intend to have anyone tell him what to do he aimed to do the telling he got into avalon first the black hand had taken a beating but most of the crew survived after his ship tied up at the pier the men swarmed into avalon they grabbed anyone who looked as if he could carry a musket or a pike or a sword radcliffe harangued his new recruits from just outside of black hand fort the stuart swine and dutch dogs and english idiots think they can take our town away from us he roared are we going to let em no the new soldiers shouted he suspected not all of them meant it a barber cared more about cutting whiskers than cutting throats but if he got them into the line he expected they would do well enough once somebody started shooting at you you damn well would shoot back otherwise the bugger on the other side would kill you no one was keen on that we can fight we can win red rodney insisted plenty of forts inside avalon theres the one across the mouth of the bay too put those together with the galley and the bastards cant get in so whatll they do theyll hang around for a while and then theyll give it up and go home thats what his own crewmen cheered so did the new fish if less enthusiastically he went on telling them what a slaughter theyd visit on the enemy he also warned them what the invaders would do if they won he wasnt subtle and he was graphic he believed what he was saying too by the time he got done he had them believing it with him they streamed along the muddy crooked streets of avalon ready to give their all for the right to go on freebooting good speech skipper ben jackson said i wouldntve believed anything this side of rum could make those wharf rats hot to fight put a cannon ball through my mizzen if thats not a bloody good notion radcliffe said if avalon had plenty of any one thing it was rum he arranged to serve it out to the defenders maybe dutch courage would help them fight dutchmen after hed done all he could outside he went into black hand fort jenny was half glad to see him half afraid avalon would fall in the next fifteen minutesabout what hed expected half an hour alone with her in the bedroom and she was all glad to see himor she pretended to be which served well enough for now but that half hour and the rest of the time since he and his crewmen came off the black hand gave ethel the chance to find out what was going on by the time red rodney spoke with his daughter she knew as much as he didmaybe more you lost she said nothing but scorn in her voice even with the fireships you lost how could you not all my fault only later did rodney wonder why he had to justify himself to an elevenyearold i was hoping we could make them turn around but they wouldnt do it damn their black souls to hell theyve got a radcliff in charge of them too even if he clips his name hell clip your neck if he gets the chance ethel said i knew you should have taken me with you and what could you have done that i didnt your worship red rodney demanded made sure i killed will radcliff thats what his daughter replied how pray tell chainshot barshot redhot shotwhatever it took to sink his ship ethel had all the radcliffe stubbornness sense maybe not redhot shot was almost as dangerous to the ship firing it as it was to the one on the receiving end you had to be desperate even to think about using itunless you were eleven red rodney hadnt been desperate enough all things considered maybe he should have been so thats avalon bay william radcliff raised a spyglass to his eye for a closer look the image was upside down which didnt bother him and fringed in red and purple which did it seemed much closer than it had to the naked eye and that was what he really wanted elijah walton had a spyglass too not a bad harbor he said grudgingly no not a bad one radcliff agreed dryly it was the best harbor hed ever seen and hed seen harbors from valparaiso to stamboul its the people holding it now who are bad those people had long guns in the fortress north of the town guns that outranged anything the fleet carried and a fortress didnt have to worry about firing redhot shot the way a ship did they wouldnt set a fortress of earth and brick on fire the way they would a ships seasoned timbers the northern approach then looked bad so did forcing the channel his spyglass showed him the galleys patrolling it upside down they looked as if they were about to fall into the sky and spill out all their rowers he only wished looks didnt deceive here another fortress at the northern edge of avalon proper also guarded the channel into the bay the town itself had a sea wall to keep invaders from swarming straight ashore william didnt think the guns on the sea wall were anywhere close to being as formidable as the ones in the fortresses inside avalon forts topped half a dozen hills he didnt think they mounted big guns either why would they little guns throwing canister would be all they needed to hold off attackers what is your plan admiral walton asked radcliff understood what the englishman wasnt saying too if this goes wrong its all your faultthat was what he really meant instead of answering directly william turned to the signal officer run up marine commanders repair aboard he said marine commanders repair aboard the lieutenant repeated he waited for radcliffs confirming nod before adding aye aye sir do you think you can get marines over the sea wall walton asked most of it is just a palisade but even so i aim to discuss the possibilities with the men who needs must do the actual fighting william replied the englishman fumed but william didnt worry about that walton wasnt going anywhere not now every ship in the fleet carried marines they were the marksmen in the fighting tops and they went ashore when there was need of that radcliff wasnt sure how many dutch marines spoke english but he didnt worry about that either some of them would and they could translate for their comrades marcus radcliffe came up over the royal sovereigns rail after most of the other marine officers as usual he wore nothing resembling a uniform only homespun wool trousers and a linen shirt his sole ornament was a tail plume from an oil thrush thrust under the band on his colorless floppy hat but none of the true marines with their fancy uniforms and accoutrements seemed inclined to mock the leathery backwoodsman if we land your combined forces south of the town can you march up march in and take it william asked his distant cousin gave back a question of his own before anyone else could speak whatll you be doing in the meantime cannonading william replied marcus radcliffe considered that then nodded well fair enough if you knock down some of the sea wall will you send in sailors to give us a hand it was williams turn to hesitate he was a seaman first last and always sending in landing parties of sailors would mean coming very closedangerously closeto shorebased defenders in the end though he also found himself nodding if we possibly can i understand that the distraction may help you another marine officer said we ought to take a couple of fourpounders off one of our brigs and see if we can drag them up to their palisade down there theyll give us the kind of doorknocker we need good william radcliff said do it the marine blinked just like that just like that radcliff told him it sounds like a good idea the worst that can happen is the guns get left behind if they do youre no worse off than if you hadnt brought them so give it a try by god sir i wish every captain were like you the marine said too many of those buggers cant make up their minds or else they havent got any minds to make up you dont know my coz marcus radcliffe sounded sly hes always sure hes not always right but hes always sure he got the laugh he must have hoped for then went on if not for him we wouldnt be here now and the pirates wouldnt be in the mess theyre in for which i thank you but by the same token we also wouldnt be in the mess were in william said dryly we have to beat them we have to take avalon away from them if we do that we redeem ourselves if they hold us they redeem themselves how can it get any simpler nobody said anything maybe hed made it as clear as he hoped maybe the men were even simpler than the situation they were marines after all and the bullocks did not have a reputation for wit they were human roundshot you pointed them at a target and you used them to smash it flat looting should be good one of them remarked the corsairs have stashed their booty in avalon for years now that might have inspired them more than anything william said he didnt mind as long as something did he was content xv r ed rodney radcliffe woke with a warm bare thigh draped over his and with the sound of thunder in his ears he was used to the one or the other both together were something new he needed a moment to remember he wasnt at sea and another to remember he wasnt in a brothel in some distant port this was avalon this was jenny and this was a fine clear morning with sunbeams sliding between the slats of the shutters on his bedchamber window which meant that wasnt thunder which meant full memory returned red rodney spilled jenny off him and sprang out of bed swearing horribly his lady love let out a most unladylike squawk he was pulling up his breeches when somebody pounded on the door jenny squawked again theyre bombarding us ben jackson shouted through the planks i know i hear im coming dammit radcliffe needed only two strides to get to the door that gave jenny just time enoughor maybe almost time enough red rodney didnt look backto cover herself before he threw it open he rushed to black hand forts palisade no that wasnt thunder that was his cousins fleet hammering at the sea wall and the closer forts with all the guns the ships carried black hand fort was safe enough lying near the bayside it was beyond the reach of even bow chasers but the closer forts were taking a pounding and so were all the shops and dives and houses between them and so was the wall it had been built to hold invaders out but no one had imagined an onslaught like this when it went up even the hardbitten jackson sounded uncertain when he asked can we keep em from breaking in wed better red rodney answered which was nothing less than the truth he looked around someone he would have expected to watch the fireworks with him wasnt here not jennyshed still be cowering under the coverlets butwheres ethel his first mate hesitated again which was most unlike him well he began well what out with it damn you rodneys voice took on a rumble more ominous than the cannonadingor so he intended anyhow well skipper when the shooting started she ran down toward the sea wall to lend a hand where she could ben jackson got it out in an unhappy rush she radcliffe clapped a hand to his forehead why the devil didnt you stop her on account of she was gone before i could jackson answered christ dont you think i would have well yes radcliffe admitted a roundshot hit something made of stone flew high in the air and then crashed down again a plume of smoke rose inside avalon the bombardment had started at least one fire anyhow god damn william radcliff to hell and gone red rodney shouted yes skipper jackson hesitated again then asked what do we do rodney radcliffe didnt hesitate that was one of the reasons he was the captain and ben jackson the mate ill take most of the men down by the sea wall if they send boats against us well make em sorrysee if we dont you hold here with the rest just in case some of our socalled friends think to get gay while everythings topsyturvy the mate nodded ill do it as long as he had his orders or as long as the task in front of him was too obvious to require them jackson was as good as any man unhanged red rodney laughed harshly what happened over the next few hours would tell if they stayed that way armed with muskets and cutlasses and pistols and pikes and hatchets and anything else they could lay their hands on the corsairs from black hand fort rushed west through avalons crowded chaosfilled streets they had to fight their way through every now and again most of the people under bombardment were sensibly fleeing east out of range some of them were armed too if they lacked the mother wit to step aside they paid the price for stupidity what had to be a fortytwopound ball smashed into a grogshop not fifty feet from red rodney the dive was thereand then it wasnt it turned to rubble before his eyes a spinning roof tile caught one of his men in the belly the pirate went down and he didnt get up again they had to brave more roundshot of all sizes as they neared the sea wall one ball plowed a bloody track through the freebooters killing three men and maiming two more before mere flesh could halt its progress radcliffe left the shrieking wounded men where they lay and hurried on another fire had started by the time he got close to the wallstarted and showed every sign of spreading it might wreck avalon even if the attackers didnt get into the town rodney swore some more at the moment that was all he could do he hoped he would be able to go on doing it a cannon ball tore the head off a man only a couple of paces behind him the spouting corpse ran on for several strides before crumpling in a muddy puddle up to the wall at last where was ethel anywhere close by radcliffe looked this way and that he didnt see her anywhere a big roundshotit had to be another fortytwopounderflew only a few feet over his head and crashed down somewhere behind him in avalon were it lowerhe shuddered it wouldnt have had to hit him to kill sometimes the wind of a cannon balls passage was enough give it back to em that high shrill voice could only belong to ethel rodney hurried south along the sea wall there she was and damned if she wasnt commanding a sixpounders crew as if shed been doing it for years the cutthroats obeyed her too maybe they knew whose daughter she was maybe they just knew they needed someone to keep them firing fast smack that was the sound of red rodneys open palm landing on ethels backside she squalled like a cat with its tail caught in a door and leapt into the air murder blazed in her eyes who she shouted then she saw her father and the fury faded oh you i might have known yes you might have by jesus you might have known to stay in the castle where youd be safe if they get over the walls no one is safe ethel answered and shouted for her crewand it was her crewto run out the gun and fire it red rodney muttered under his breath the worst of it was he couldnt even tell her she was wrong marcus radcliffe came back to william radcliff and asked are you all right coz yes dammit this is the third time youve asked me william said in some irritation i am neither woman nor child i can keep up youre neither backwoodsman nor marine either marcus pointed out you know how to tell other people what to do i dont know how you are at doing things on your own hook i cope william said his foot skidded in a patch of mud he flailed his arms for balance but he didnt fall several marines were already muddy so were a couple of marcus radcliffes rustics william hadnt fallenyet swearing sweating marines dragged a fourpounder through the woods south of avalon the guns carriage made for the deck of a ship was less than ideal for rough muddy ground somehow though the bullocks hauling it had managed to keep up with the rest of the landing party they would take out their anger on the palisadeand on the men atop it william hoped not many men would be atop it with luck the cannonading from the fleet would draw all the corsairs to the sea wall then the marines could just walk into avalon that would be wonderfulif it worked marcus radcliffe plainly thought william odd if not daft for joining the landing party but the decision would come here one way or the other it would william wanted to be in place to see it the fleet could go on without him for a while he was sure elijah walton and piet kieft would be just as happy to go on without him had he been in charge of avalon he would have cleared the woods farther from the palisade the landing party could approach almost to within musket shot of the works without being noticed were they all backwoodsmen like marcus recruits they might have got closer yet but even the redcoated marines could hide behind tree trunks and in the midst of fern thickets and hide most of them did while the gun crew aimed the fourpounder at the long wall ahead the gun was of brightly polished brass william could only marvel that no one in the town noticed it till it was almost ready to fire the diversion from the sea must have done all he wanted and more a startled shout rose from the palisade just as the marine lieutenant in charge of the piece said you may fire now sergeant boom the ball wasnt even as big as williams fist but it was plenty big enough to smash one of the upright trunks ahead when it thudded home the marines in the gun crew got to work reloading give them a volley marcus radcliffe bellowed muskets and rifles thundered a couple of men on the palisade went down charge yelled a captain in a red coat marines and backwoodsmenand william radcliffrushed the palisade they all screamed like wild terranovans maybe that would scare the freebooters maybe it would lift their own spirits william could hope so he knew how to shoot and load a musket he had a rapier on his hip not a cutlass he also carried a loaded pistol in his boot he hadnt done a lot of fighting but he thoughthe hopedhe knew how some of the marines hauled scaling ladders forward theyd blasphemously lugged those through the woods along with the cannon boomcrash the cannon smote the palisade again one way or another the landing party was determined to break into avalon only a couple of shots came from the enemy not many corsairs stood on the palisade and some of the ones who did promptly fled when they saw marines bearing down on them radcliff might have done the same thing they had a chance to save themselves if they stayed on the palisade they were bound to be butcheredthey didnt have enough men to keep the bullocks and backwoodsmen from getting up there with them ladders high an officer shouted there wasnt even a ditch outside the palisade to make things harder for the attackers no one in avalon really seemed to have believed attack could come from this quarter believe or not here it was a pirate shot down at a climbing marine the ball hit the redcoated englishman in the face as he fell he brought down two other men below him but others took their places marines were as stolid as men could be in the face of death or maiming william didnt mind letting a good many of them precede him up onto the palisade they were younger and stronger and better trained than he was but he swarmed up a ladder himself he hadnt come this far only to watch he aimed to fight too he almost didnt get the chance a bullet cracked past his head as he hurried toward the closest stairway down into avalon marcus radcliffe was a few feet behind him the backwoodsman chuckled nothing like it when they shoot at you and miss is there better that than their shooting and hitting william agreed marines formed lines and advanced through the streets some people fled before them screaming in fear others charged at them with whatever weapons came to hand marcus backwoodsmen shot down several of those before they got close the leathery nondescript atlanteans carried rifles accurate to a much greater distance than the usual smoothbore musket the marines took little damage from the pirates who closed the pirates fought as individuals the marines as a team they killed methodically without much malice and without much waste motion following their lethal line william radcliff didnt think hed have to do much himself but a man with a cutlass lurched out of a grogshop stared blearily and rushed him william fired his pistol at pointblank rangeand missed he threw the pistol at the corsairs head it struck the man a glancing blow and gave radcliff the chance to draw his own rapier the first stroke from the cutlass almost broke his blade and almost knocked the long thin straight sword from his hand his own first thrust almost spitted the pirate who sprang back just in time but the freebooters foot went out from under him in the mud as the fellow staggered william skewered him the pirate howled like a hound he didnt crumple though the way william hoped he would he kept right on fighting stick him again marcus shouted people arent as easy to kill as youd think how do you know william wondered but that was a question for another time his next thrust caught the corsair in the throat blood rivered out the man gobbled something and finally fell thats the way coz marcus said lets go on and finish the job william brandished the blooddripping rapier yes by god lets you see red rodney shouted they havent the stomach for landing with all the freebooters on the sea wall he wouldnt have wanted to land there either whether the enemy wanted to land or not though they went right on cannonading avalon every so often a roundshot would tear a bloody slice out of the corsairs or knock over some of the palisade which caused more casualties casualties or not the english and the dutch and the men from stuart could pound away from now till forever and they wouldnt break in radcliffe cursed them and shook his fist and cheered whenever the gun ethel went on commanding shot at the ships offshore so much powder smoke drifted in from their guns and the ones fired at them that he coughed between cheers his eyes streamed his face was probably black as an indigogrowing slaves down in southeastern atlantis a man tugged at his arm red rodney the fellow cried even through the roar of the guns rodney heard the fear in his voice what is it he asked an ominous rumble in his own theyre in the city theyre over the palisade and in the city what are you daft were holding em out no i wish i was the pirate pointed south theyre over the palisade down there swarms of emgreat bloody bullocks in red coats killing anything that moves oh christ jesus bugger me with a worm rodney radcliffe said and the enemy had buggered himbuggered him and avalon theyd drawn all the defenders here to the sea wall and then come right up the towns arse what do we do wailed the man with the bad news what can we do weve got to fight em radcliffe said grimly he started pulling men out of the struggle on the sea wall and pointing them back into avalon he shouted he punched he cajoled he swore little by little he started getting the corsairs to pay attention to him they didnt escape the hell of battle even after descending from the wall roundshot from the enemy fleet crashed down at random sometimes they would come down on a man or on a clump of men when that happened it wasnt pretty all the same red rodney shouted keep on damn you keep on the bloody marines will murder us if you dont other pirates with loud voices also urged freebooters into the fight maybe they were captains too maybe they were just men with eyes to see where trouble lay it didnt matter as long as they could see that much nothing else mattered avalon was not a big city the pirate from the sea wall didnt need long to bump up against the bullocks when they saw the men in the red coats they roared in rage and charged with whatever weapons they happened to hold stinging volleys of musketry drove them back and bayonets outreached swords the marines were ferociously well disciplined red rodney had always thought sheer fury could overpower anything that stood in its way discovering he was wrong was bitter as gall it was also almost fatal a musket ball tugged at his left sleeve when he looked down he discovered his arm was bleeding it was only a scratch which didnt mean he wanted it had the ball flown a few inches to the righthe didnt even want to think about that musketeers pistoleros he bawled into the houses shoot from cover dont make it easy for those poxy whoresons hed always been proud of the pirates independence when every man was as good as every other man no man could tell any man what to do if the freebooters wanted to listen to him they would if they didnt if they didnt they would die the marines surged forward the ones with bayonets plugged into the muzzles of their muskets used the weapons as spears impaling corsairs who couldnt get at them to reply other marines kept a deadly hail of bullets in the air so did some enemy fighters in plain clothes they could hit a man at two hundred yards sometimes farther there werent that many of them and they didnt fire fast but they caused trouble all out of proportion to their numbers red rodney sprang like a wolf he beat a bayoneted musket aside with his sword then struck the marine holding the piece his stroke clove the bullock from crown to chin the man toppled dead before he hit the ground but another marine lunged at rodney radcliffe forcing him to jump back or be spitted the pirate chief managed to escape the marine in the second rank stepped up to the first and the line rolled ahead as it had before one dead marine so what radcliffe had always scorned such regimentation a man he thought should fight for himself for his hope of glory or gold or women willing or otherwise to fight because it was your job as if you were a chandler or a cordwainer where was the glory in that nowhere at all which didnt mean it didnt work the marines job or no job advanced the corsairs glory or no glory fell backor else they just fell and did not rise again the marines systematically finished them off one after another for all red rodneys cries and exhortations he couldnt stop the foe fear began fighting fury in his heart william radcliff stood with a pair of marines on the roof of a threestory building in southern avalon hoist the red flag he told them right you are sir they chorused they probably would have said the same thing if hed told them to jump off the roof the building was a house of ill fame to the bullocks undisguised disappointment the girls had fled one of the marines had a big square of red cloth the other carried a long pole that would do for a flagstaff william had some tacks with which to fasten the cloth to the pole once that was done they waved the makeshift flag you could see it a long way with luck even the sailors in the fleet would be able to spy it radcliff hoped they could they were supposed to be looking for the signal it ordered them to put sailors into boats and attack the sea wall the marines had drawn a lot of defenders from it the cannonading had killed moreand should have breached the wall as well if the sailors could gain lodgementsif they could do that then avalon assailed from flank and rear at the same time was bound to fall wasnt it thwock a bullet tore through the red cloth the corsairs might not know what the signal flag meant but they knew they didnt like it as if i care william thought he walked to the edge of the roof for a crowsnest view of the fighting another bullet snapped past his head he ducked that wasnt cowardiceeven the nerveless marines did it but then he stepped backno point giving the freebooters an easy shot at him besides he had a pretty good idea of how things were going his ears could tell him almost as much as his eyes the pirates hadnt given up all the same the marines were steadily driving them back if the sailors could break into avalon by way of the sea wall he wouldnt have wanted to wear his cousins shoes you men keep on he told the bullocks with the signal flag im going down to fight some more as he started down the stairs he heard one marine tell the other i didnt think the old bugger had so much fire in his belly im not old radcliff thought indignantly next to the marines he was he hurried down he almost tripped on the stairs and broke his neck that would have been a humiliating way to show he really was the antiquity the bullocks thought him but he caught himself and went outside without further damage smoke filled the air a lot of it was brimstonestinking gunpowder smokea lot but not all several fires blazed in avalon now fire was always the great fear ashore and at sea once it caught hold it was hard terribly hard to fight even if the pirates somehow threw back the forces that harried them their haven would never be the same their haven will never be their haven again william thought determination filling him he didnt think he could end all piracy in the hesperian gulf by seizing avalon he did hope he could break its back that would be enough to satisfy him it might even be enough to make him go down in history he laughed at himself when that occurred to him as long as his ships could get where they were going without let or hindrance history didnt count two marines came out of a grogshop blood dripped from one mans bayonet blood and brains fouled the stock of the others musket they both nodded respectfully couple of bastards in there who wont bother their betters any more sir said the man with the nasty musket good riddance to them william said may we comb out the rest of the lice in avalon the same way nodding the marines hurried forward toward the struggle radcliff followed more sedately as befits my years he thought with a wry grin he didnt want only pirates picked at random dead he wanted to know their chieftains were gonegoldbeard and cutpurse charlie and the other flamboyant leaders who could gather a goodsized fighting tail behind them with a snap of the fingers and most of all he wanted red rodney radcliffe swept from the face of the earth even if they spelled the name differently red rodney blackened it with every breath he took only fitting then that he shouldnt take many more williams hand tightened on the basket hilt of his sword if he could dispose of his cousin himselfit would be something out of a romance william shrugged he was willing to forgo the gloryand the risk of getting killed instead of killingif he knew someone had put paid to rodney radcliffe a great clamor of musketry broke out to the northwest william almost forgot his cousin the landing from the sea was starting if the sailors could break inavalon is ours he muttered when red rodney radcliffe heard the commotion behind him and to his rightthe commotion from the sea wallhe stopped dead in the middle of a narrow unpaved street had a marine with a charged musket or a bayonet stood close by he would have died in truth his guts spilling over the mud and slops his hopes had been low they sank further now ben jackson knew that clamor for what it was too are they in the mate asked hoarsely can they get in there idont know radcliffe answered under the circumstances it was about the worst thing he could have said what do we do jackson demanded go back to black hand fort and stand siege red rodney only grunted it wasnt a hopeful grunt the great captains forts werent provisioned for long sieges they were strongholds where crews lived from which they sallied and to which they retreated in time of crisis they were made to hold out other pirate bands not determined soldiers no one who built them had imagined soldiers could break into avalon all that flashed through radcliffes mind in a heartbeat he shook his head not unless we have to weve got to drive them out not let them drive us in jackson nodded he could see that too but he listened to what was going on at the sea wall i think they are in damn them he said i think so too radcliffe said that doesnt mean we cant drive them out again thoughdoes it he wished too late he hadnt added the last couple of words ben jackson shook his head like a hunted animalwhich at the moment he was red rodney was another one and he knew it well some hunted animals had teeth and fangs of their own and could turn the tables on their pursuers not many beasts in atlantis did but that wasnt true through most of the world the pirate chief aimed to fight back as long as he could a bullet cracked past him he saw a marine down at the end of the street he pulled a holdout pistol from his boot top and fired at the bullock the marine let out a horrible howl and clutched at his shoulder rodney stared at the pistol in delighted surprise hed hoped to scare the man in the red coat hitting him was an unexpected bonus he wanted to recharge both his guns he wanted to but he had no chance jackson was shouting for freebooters to come up and join them the wounded marines roar of pain brought his comrades at the double they did look after one another no doubt about it marines and pirates smashed together in bloody collision red rodney hacked and slashed he threw one pistol in a bullocks face the marine went down clutching at his nose radcliffe kicked him not far away beset by three men at once ben jackson fell blood spurting from a belly wound and from his throat rodney feared he would never get up again pirates and marines fell clawing and biting at one another till they could fight no more red rodneys band had more men in it than did his foes party but one marine was worth more than one corsair in this kind of brawl a bayonet had pinked radcliffes leg a sword had scored a bleeding line down his right arm he wasnt quite the last man standing but the marines who still lived were hurt worse than he was and drew back out of range of his cutlass backed by three hale marines a middleaged man with a rapier came around the corner when he said you are rodney radcliffe each individual word might have been chiseled from stone damn right i am red rodney snarled who the bloody hell are you the stranger bowed i have the honorif that be the proper termof being your cousin william radcliff at your service he bobbed up and down again rage ripped through rodney you filthy bugger youve ruined me good william said coolly for that was my purpose if you yield now i promise you a quick end i regretthough not very muchi have nothing better to offer ill give you something to regret red rodney shouted youll regret coming up against me facetoface by god you wont gloat over my carcass thats for sure he swung up his sword for a limping charge william radcliff appeared unwounded he also knew how to handle that long thin straight sworda stop thrust almost skewered rodney well there were ways red rodney smashed at the rapier if he could break the blade the other man was his meat but william proved a better man of his hands than the pirate had dreamt he could be he took the slashes and turned them without batting an eye he ran the point of his blade into rodneys left shoulder and rodney could not reach him no matter how he tried then one of the marines fired at pointblank range the bullet slammed into red rodneys chest blood filled his mouth he knew it was a bad wound then he took another one this time in the belly he slumped to his knees you dont fight fair he choked out through growing darkness he saw william radcliff nod indeed not the merchant admiral replied i fight to win nothing less is worth fighting for a third musket bellowed and rodney knew no more william radcliff eyed ethel radcliffe like a man eyeing a beautiful but poisonous snake shed already tried to knife him once now she washe devoutly hopeddisarmed what am i to do with you he asked youd better kill me she answered matteroffactly christ knows ill kill you first chance i get i have no stomach for slaying children he said and we are kin of sorts my shame not yours ethel said if i send you to stuart i will hunt you down the pirates daughter broke in she meant it whether she would mean it a few years from now was a different question for the time being though she was as dangerous as a hogshead of gunpowder in a fire i have no quarrel with you william said mine was with your father well i have one with you for my fathers sake ethel said look to your lifemore warning than a scorpion like you would give radcliff she somehow contrived to make him hear the missing e that separated his name and his kind from hers william thought he would laugh at a death threat from a child at such a threat from most children he would have from red rodney radcliffes daughter no shed called him a scorpion to him she seemed to have all her fathers venom in a small innocentlooking exterior a strawberryblond coral snake he thought uneasily trying to calm her he said weve been merciful where we could ordinary pirates men of no rank who yielded to us may go free many of them will make good enough honest sailors nothing will happen to you nor to is that your mother who jenny ethel radcliffe laughed in his face jesus no just one of my fathers doxies he had enough of em she sounded as proud of red rodney as one of his men might have indeed william said stiffly where ethel spat defiance jenny had offered anything she had to give to keep from meeting the gibbet and she had a lot as hed found out to his pleasure and perhaps even to hers hed never intended hanging her but she didnt need to know that what tamsin back in stuart didnt know wouldnt hurt her a bit william made himself return to the business at hand what shall i do with you he asked ethel again i told you once what i aim to do if you dont care to listen its your funeral she punned with vicious relish she would probably kill the same way it had to run in the blood he made up his mind i will send you to new hastings he said the old town was far enough from stuart to leave him feeling safe you may learn a trade there or pursue such education as fits your pleasure and abilities and i will dower you richly enough to let you marry and enjoy the blessings of domestic felicity or as many of them as a hellcat can enjoy at any rate ethel radcliffe looked him in the eye she didnt spit in his face but he thought she wanted to salve your conscience all you please old man ill kill you anyhow he had her taken away then she went peaceably enough he wasnt going to worry about her any more he told himself he wasnt anyhow it wasnt as if he didnt have other things to worry about elijah walton wanted to place all of avalonindeed the whole west coast of atlantis from avalon northwardsunder the direct rule of the king of england he provided the wherewithal by which it was won he said piet kieft will be surprised to hear it william remarked so will the house of orange and so am i did my armed merchantmen do nothing here did my backwoodsmen not take this town with the royal marines they made their contributions walton said with a grace both easy and radcliff reckoned false but truly what difference does it make unless you are a damned dutchman his majesty already rules the atlantean settlements this would but extend that rule it would not for we have our longstanding rights and privileges to guard against tyranny and misrule william said land ruled straight from london would not say you that his majesty is a tyrant walton no doubt thought he sounded dangerous but hed had little to do with ethel radcliffe i said nothing of the sort sir and will style you liar and knave should you publish it abroad that i did william replied but king follows king as autumn follows summer who knows what the next reign may bring or the one after that elijah walton waved his words away you quarrel over the shadow of an ass i think not william radcliff said nor will the english settlements here as for the french and the spaniards here in this western land one more reason for the crown to rule here to protect you from them walton said william laughed in the englishmans face as ethel had laughed in his as the crown warded off the corsairs he inquired walton reddened you mistrust the spirit in which this proposal is offered by god sir i do indeed radcliff said and i tell you again i am not the only one who will if you wish to see insurrection against the crown flare all through english atlantis you have but to persist in your mad policy you jest walton said you bluff i am willingi am even gladto have the king rule mefrom a safe distance both in travel and in law william said were his rule more intimate it would prove less congenial i am not alone in this sentiment nor anywhere close to it heed me or not as you like i have told you the truth his warning was at least as determined as ethels had been his majesty will not be pleased elijah walton warned radcliff only shrugged and he carried the day no one can stop the radcliffs when they set their mind to something he thought and then remembering red rodneys daughter he rather wished he hadnt part three nouveau redon xvi v ictor radcliff squelched through muck englishmen werent supposed to come this far south in atlantis radcliff thought he must have passed the french settlements and entered spanish territory at the coast it would be there telling who lorded it over a piece of ground was easy enough everyones settlements faded toward nothingness the farther into the interior a man went new hastings had been settled three hundred years before but that was almost as true up there as it was anywhere else in atlantis people who liked exploring for its own sake were thinner on the ground here than they might have been a lot of them went on to terranova beyond the hesperian gulf a broader land it offered that kind of man more scope but you could find something new here if you worked at it plenty of englishmen crossed the green ridge mountains to travel from new hastings and hanover formerly stuart to avalon following a route pioneered by richard radcliffe when atlantis was a strange new world some of them turned away from that route and founded little villages in the hinterland no one knew how many such villages there were a lot of the people who lived in them wanted nothing to do with the outside world and kept to themselves or you could range farther afield as victor was doing so many things here in the south seemed strange to an atlantean whod grown up near new hastings the weather was a good place to start it reminded him of a steam bath new hastings could get weather like that so could hanover down here the news came when it wasnt beastly hot and beastly muggy with the different weather went different plants the theme was the same as it was all over atlantis conifers and what the atlanteans called barrel trees and ferns but instead of the pines and towering redwoods near new hastings instead of the firs and spruces north of hanover that made such splendid masts here most of the conifers were cypresses growing on knees half lifted out of the swamps the rest on higher ground were scrubby pines different from the ones farther north there were more varieties of barrel tree too both frenchmen and spaniards cooked up a formidable spirit from the sap inside some of them and the ferns grew in riotous profusion wherever there was shadow and moisturewhich is to say almost everywhere victor had seen them sprouting from between the bricks of country homes in every shade of green in every size from smaller than his hand to twice as tall as he was they formed the forests understory something almost under victors boot said freep and jumped into the water with a splash he froze for a moment he hadnt seen it till it moved and croaked only a frog he thought down here though only wasnt necessarily so some of the frogs here had bodies twice the size of a mans fist they ate anything that wasnt big enough to eat them others were of more ordinary size but colored black streaked with vivid scarlet or gold or turquoise nothing ate themnot more than once anyhow they were poisonous it was almost as if their colorful hides warned the world to leave them alone a flapjack turtle peered at victor from the swamp all he could see of it were its pointynosed head and snaky neck flapjack turtles made better eating than the frogs but they could fight back one that size could bite off a mans finger with no trouble at all a lizard skittered away into some ferns another one larger eyed victor from a cypress branch well out of his reach both of them were harmless some of the lizards down here though grew longer than a man was talland those were the ones that lived on land it said nothing about the sawbacked monsters that haunted streams the spaniards called them all dragons even if they didnt breathe fire the name seemed fair enough to victor they were formidable beasts with formidable teeth and claws they couldnt flourish up in the english regions of atlantis the winters were too cold victor didnt miss them a bit when up in new hastings he also didnt miss the snakes big enough to coil round these lizards suffocate them and swallow them he kept a wary eye on the fern thickets through which he pushed a snake big enough to kill and eat a dragon was big enough to kill and eat him too they also had flying snakes down here and you didnt have to get into the barreltree juice to see them victor supposed they didnt really fly but the name had stuck they spread themselves flat and glided from one branch to another or from a branch down to the ground either to escape from becoming something elses dinner or to catch their own three or four different kinds had learned the trick one was venomous but the rest werent victors nostrils suddenly twitched he stopped in his tracks his right hand fell to the stock of one of the flintlock pistols he carried on his belt he smelled smoke smoke meant men and men even more than dragons or flying snakes meant trouble men could be doing any number of unsavory things they could be backwoodsmen from englishspeaking atlantis like him down to see what the bretonand basqueand frenchand spanishspeaking settlers were up to they might come from any of the groups that didnt speak english and they might be spying on any of the othersor even on their own they might be settlers whod moved deep into the swamps because they wanted nothing to do with their own lords they might be french or spanish soldiers coming after settlers whod moved deep into the swamps or they might be runaway slaves negroes or copperskinned terranovan natives new hastings had a few slaves and big rich hanover more than a few most of the blacks and terranovans up there were domesticscooks and maids coachmen and body servants rich merchants owned them for the sake of swank and treated them as they would have treated servants of a lighter hue most blacks and copperskins in english atlantis were freemen andwomen things were different here in the south down here slaves worked in the fields and they worked hard the plantations that raised indigo and cotton rice and sugar cane pipeweed and peanuts couldnt have functioned without them getting the most labor from slaves and giving them as little as was necessary to keep them working and to keep them from rising up was an art in these settlements it wasnt an art the terranovans and africans appreciated they took off whenever they saw the chance better to scratch out a free living in the swamps they thought than to live on their masters dubious bounty and if they could get up to the englishspeaking settlements they would probably stay free litigation between settlements from one kingdom and those from another could go on for yearsor it could move a little slower than that plantation owners and overseers hunted slaves with hounds and with guns and sometimes even with fisttrained eagles runaways fought back with mantraps and anything else their ingenuity could devise some of themthe terranovans especiallywere good bowmen victor radcliff knew the first english settlers in atlantis had been formidable archers that was three centuries gone by though these days any white who wanted to shoot something did it with a gun victor thought about giving the campfire or whatever it was a wide berth and going on his way regretfully he shook his head he couldnt be sure hed be able just to go on his way if he knew those strangers were out there in the swamp one of them was liable to know he was here too all the undergrowth was made for snipers and bushwhackers maybe somebody was drawing a bead on him right now when you had a thought like that your first instinct was to duck if you had any brains you followed that instinct too it might save you victor pulled in his head like one of those flapjack turtles he ducked down so the ferns all around did a better job of hiding him then he crawled away maybe he was crawling away from nothing he didnt know for sure he didnt mind making a fool of himself in front of turtles and frogs and oil thrushes and parrots in fact he ended up making a fool of himself in front of a mouse it twitched its whiskers and vanished under a drooping frond a couple of inches above the ground damned things are everywhere victor muttered to himself there hadnt been a mouse or a rat or a dog or a cat in atlantis before settlers started coming now you found them even in the wilderness by contrast honkers had grown scarce especially in longsettled districts before long they might all be gone victor shrugged that wasnt his worry he sniffed again then crawled toward the fire follow your nose he thought well what else could he do when he couldnt see the campfire or hear the people who gathered around it and then he could hear them he froze then moved forward even more slowly and carefully yes the bad french and spanish said they were runaway slaves one negro and two copperskins he thought they had distinctively different accents his own french was nothing special though he could make himself understood another sniff brought him the scent of roasting meat his stomach growled he winceda noise like that could betray him and it was nothing he could do anything about there they were dimly seen through the screen of multiply lobed little leaves victor stayed very still he saw a negro and one copperskin they were cooking a turtle and a couple of big frogs over their fire one of them said something and held up his supper the other laughed runaways all right victor radcliff thought they wouldnt go out hunting him unless they thought he was hunting them since he wasntbest just to slide away after all he was about to do exactly that when someone jumped him from behind while hed scouted the camp someone had sneaked up on him a large strong muscular someone too and as silently deadly as a crawling snakevictor had had no idea anybody was there till the instant before he found himself fighting for his life the fight didnt last long when the sharp edge of a knife kissed victors throat he went limp his assailant laughed low and hoarse figured thatd make you get smart the man said in copperskinaccented french the knife dug a little deeper now you come along with me numbly victor came roland kersauzon peered out from the walls of nouveau redon he was not quite the lord of all he surveyed but he was the lord of a good deal of it and he was named for one famously stubborn man and descended from another roland the warrior might have saved everything but his pride if hed blown his horn sooner and summoned charlemagne back against the spanish mussulmen and francois kersauzon remained a legend in these parts even if he was three centuries dead and gone francois had never set eyes on nouveau redon not in all the years hed dwelt in atlantis it lay only fifty miles inland from cosquer on the blavet hed never gone fifty miles inland or probably even twenty miles inland that would have meant turning his back on the sea francois kersauzon was too mulish a fisherman to want to do any such thing slowly roland made a fist and brought it down on the gray stone of the battlement nouveau redon everyone said was the strongest fortress in all of atlantis french english or spanish and it needed to be roland muttered something a quarter breton threequarters french and all irate if only francois hadnt sold the godcursed englishmen the secret of atlantis for a load of salt cod or even more humiliating for part of a load of salt cod some of the stories put it that way then the bretons would be happy over here the english would be happy over there and merde roland said that kind of thinking was bound to be foolish sooner or later the english would have found these shores on their own but it would have been later than it was which would have been bettercertainly as far as a breton was concerned nouveau redon sat atop a knob overlooking the blavet the river approach was difficult the landward approach except for a narrow road hacked out of rock was harder yet roland didnt see how anyone could storm nouveau redon as long as it had a few soldiers inside the walls he did see a horseman urging his mount up that narrow road even though the rider was alone and unable to move fast muskets and cannon loaded with grapeshot covered his approach nouveau redon was ready for anything by the time the rider reached the narrow plain in front of the town he was sweating and fanning himself with his hat his horse was lathered and blowing he seemed glad to rein in before the main gate after yelling back and forth with the guards at the gate he rode into nouveau redon before long more shouts rang out lord roland come down lord roland lord roland this mans here to see you roland kersauzon said merde again louder this time this was the moment hed been waiting for not to put too fine a point on it this was the moment hed been dreading he hurried down the stairshurried with what the lawyers called deliberate speed the stairway attached to the wall was narrow and steep if a man on it fell he might break a legor his neck reaching the ground without mishap roland rushed to the gate a man could break an ankleor his neckif he tripped on the cobbles too old men grumbled and wished the streets were still unpaved roland didnt miss the stinking mud one bit cobbles made his city as modern as any in europe lord kersauzon said the horseman when roland came up i bring news just here from france he held out a paper folded and sealed with ribbon and wax news kersauzons mouth tightened as he took the letter do you know what it says formally no the rider replied informallywell the words all over cosquer gossip flies faster than the wind all right it wasnt but roland couldnt do anything about it he scraped off the seal and cut through the ribbon with a small sharp knife he pulled from his belt then he unfolded the paper and read it his sight was beginning to lengthen but he didnt need spectacles for reading yet sadly he nodded to himself as if learning that an aged and longinfirm uncle had finally died is it one of the gate guards couldnt hold in the question with a sigh roland nodded again war he said war against england but why the gate guard checked himself he sketched a salute forgive me sir i know the englishthey are dogs and sons of dogs i know most of them are godless protestant heretics bound for hell everybody knows that another guard put in but of course everybody does the first soldier agreed still the english have always been dogs and sons of dogs theyve been godless protestants for a very long time anyhow so why do we have to go to war with them now its the fighting in europe said the courier whod brought the message to nouveau redon roland kersauzon nodded it is indeed we have joined with austria and russia to give frederick of prussia the thumping he deserves the englishdogs and sons of dogs that they arehave sided with frederick and so we shall punish him and england as they deserve the courier and the guards clapped their hands one of the soldiers tossed his hat in the air then he made a frantic grab to keep it from landing on a lump of horse manure with an embarrassed grin he set the tricorn back on his head another gate guard said well whip them everyone cheered again nobody threw a hat this time though the guard pointed to the paper roland kersauzon still held does that just tell you the war is here sir or has it got orders for us too orders kersauzon answered first we are to make sure nouveau redon is in the proper condition to defend itself should it have to wont be hard two or three men spoke together with almost identical words one of them added youd have to be a crazy fool to try and take this place i think so too but whos to say the english arent crazy fools roland answered the guards noddedthey also seemed to think the english were likely to be crazy fools kersauzon went on and youre right it wont be hard to ready the town its strong to begin with and weve kept the works and the garrison in good order thank god he glanced down at the sheet but theres more than that what is it again several men asked the question in chorushe knew how to tell a story and spin it out we are to gather together an army from all the settlements under the rule of the king of france and to march against the english and take away what has been theirs for too long he replied grandly so it is commanded of us and so shall it be when the guards huzzahed this time several hats went flying a couple of them landed on the ground but none luckily in the horse dung townsfolk came out of shops and taverns to see what the commotion was about when the guards shouted out the news fresh commotion spread one of the men asked the spaniards are on our side is it not so he sounded anxious and with some reason men who followed the king of france were almost as likely to reckon spaniards dogs and sons of dogs as they were englishmen true no one could accuse the spaniards of being godless protestant heretics but if spain allied itself with the godless protestant heretics of england that could prove unfortunate in atlantis where english and spanish settlements lay to the north and south of frances kersauzon slew the soldiers worry with a smile they are on our side yes their ships will join with ours their soldiers will slay englishmen wherever they find them we have but to stretch forth our hand and the english settlements here will fall into it like a ripe apple how the men cheered then they danced in a circle spinning now widdershins now sunwise had an english army been anywhere close by it could have marched into nouveau redon without firing a shot but the english were far away roland kersauzon danced as enthusiastically as any gate guard why not his orders were to ready an army and advance oh he was also ordered to ready defenses at need but he took that as a formality after all if he was advancing he wouldnt need to defend would he of course not that was so obvious even an englishman could see it victor radcliffs bad french saved his life the three runaways whod grabbed him feared he was a slavecatcher once they realized he was nothing of the sort and especially once they discovered he was an englishman they treated him like a longlost brother one of them as hed thought was black the other two copperskins they fed him turtle and frog and fish and snails having convinced them he wasnt french he wondered if he ought to eat the snails but the runaways did with every sign of enjoyment and so he did too each snail gave him a couple of bites of tasty meat the shells were the size of a mans clenched fist you wouldnt have found snails like those chewing up the lettuces in a garden outside paris you might not have found them up by new hastings either and you wouldnt have up near hanover big snakes and lizards stayed in the south where the weather never got worse than mild snails spread farther but not too much the hot sticky southern climate suited the negro fine in his vile french and worse bits of spanish he said it reminded him of africa as far as the two copperskins were concerned he was welcome to it they knew more spanish than french and even a few words of basqueas much as any foreigner was ever likely to learn they spoke to each other in spanish too after a while victor realized they were from different clans or maybe different countries the language of one made no more sense to the other than hungarian did to an irishman the negro called himself blaise the terranovans went by francisco and juan those werent the names any of them had been born with they gave victor their real names and laughed at him when he mangled them you white men so many things you cant say blaise told him victor radcliff smiled and shrugged he could say one thing i am a free man neither negroes nor copperskins raided white mens lands for slaves they didnt know how to build the ships or the guns that would have made such a thing possible their people did have a yen for the trinkets white slavers used to buy chattels and save themselves the trouble of fighting for them blaise and francisco and juan had a yen for freedom at first as they started traveling north they seemed to think victor had been wandering through the swamp for his own amusement they didnt expect him to know what he was doing there white men they are without hope away from their towns blaise said instead of arguing victor vanished one second he was walking along beside his new companions the next they went one way and he another he didnt warn them he would do it he just ducked off behind a barrel tree and headed off on his own he listened to them exclaim francisco swore juan started to laugh maybe this blanco maybe he knows something he said maybe or maybe he just got lost blaise was as reluctant to think a white knew what he was doing as many whites would have been to give him the same credit then victor reappeared and tapped him on the shoulder am i lost or are you he asked politely blaise almost jumped out of his skin how you do that he demanded magic victor said deadpan that won him more attention than he wanted the terranovans and the african took him literally he wasnt sure whether they wanted to use his sorcerous talents to help them escape bondage or to kill him so he couldnt bewitch them his ghost will haunt us even if we do kill him blaise muttered when he thought victor was out of earshot victor smiled his most enigmatic smile that set the black and the two copperskins muttering once more they stopped bothering him and he soon proved he could stay with them he also showed he knew how to huntand he had a flintlock rifle and a pair of pistols he could have had all that and eyes in the back of his head without their doing him any good even the fiercest most deadly warrior had to sleep sometimes he solved the problem by pretending it wasnt one if he took sleeping around them for granted they wouldnt think he was afraid to that would give them one less reason to knock him over the head he hoped when he woke up the next morningwell he did wake up the next morning nothing else mattered off in the distance a hound bayed and then another and another theyre after me juan blurted his bluntfeatured face going as pale as it could after all of us francisco said sensibly although victor suspected they were after him in particular he didnt say so it might alarm his new companions or they might decide he was lying they were runaway slaves after all people trying to hold on to an expensive investment had good reason to hunt them with dogs why would anyone do such a thing to a white man though the french had their reasons victor knew that too well mentioning those reasons struck him as unwise francisco juan and blaise might decide they could sell him to the french for their liberty they might prove right too amazing how many people couldnt keep their mouths shut even when their lives depended on it victor had never had that trouble anyhow well we have to get away no matter whom theyre chasing he said easy to say blaise replied not so easy to do as if to back him up the hounds bayed again on a different more excited note they have our scent best thing to do then is to make sure they dont keep it victor said here there is water juan said this makes it harder for them but harder is only harder si he sounded worried let them come victor said the runaway slaves stared at him he pulled a small leather pouch and an even smaller bottle from a larger pouch on his belt sprinkling fine black powder from the small pouch he explained this is ground pepper he also dabbed a few drops from the bottle on the ground and the nearby leaves and that francisco asked that is the gall from the snake called the lancehead victor said dogs do not like it hed committed a serious understatement francisco and juan might not have understood how large the understatement was blaise did the negro burst out laughing then he took victor radcliffs face in his two large hands and kissed him first on the right cheek then on the left sure enough hed had a french master and now he said we should get out of here we will know when the hounds areconfused wed better juan said they hurried off to the north the dogs howls grew louder no matter how they hurriedfour legs moved faster than two before too long though the hunting howls changed without warning to sudden frantic yips all the runaways laughed then blaise kissed victor again victor could have done without the familiarity but found he couldnt blame the black man for it roland kersauzon rode down to the coast to see how the muster was going cosquer might have belonged to a different world roland hadnt seen the sea for years or missed it he was and was proud to be a man of atlantis not one who looked back to europe hed never been to europe nor did he care to go there when he got to the coastal settlement he found a new reason to be unhappy at the quays along with ships from france and spain and portugal and their settlements in atlantis and on the terranovan mainland farther west lay others from england and from her atlantean colonies war declared no one in cosquer worried about that not when there was money to be made in high dudgeon roland repaired to the harbormasters office war yes indeed a great pity that worthy declared would you care for a cigar monsieur no thank you roland said icily he had his vices but pipeweed wasnt one of them i would care to know however why we tolerate ships of the enemy for all you know they are full of spies oh i doubt it mon vieux the harbormaster replied he lit his own cigar at a candle then puffed out a cloud of aromatic smoke what would they need to learn of our city that they do not already know how many troops we have in it how many ships of war the state of our shore batteriesi could go on roland kersauzon scowled at the lackadaisical official i am charged with defending the settlements and with carrying the war to the enemy in the north how can i do that pray tell if he learns everything we aim to do before we do it the harbormaster let fly with more cigar smoke forgive me but i think you are getting excited over nothingit could be over less than nothing if they want to fight in europe they are welcome to but why should that foolishness trouble us eh bad for trade leaves hard feelings and doesnt really settle anything anyhow theyll just fight another stupid war in twenty years time to fix up what they didnt get right this goround roland had the uneasy feeling that that might be so nevertheless he said i am charged with doing as well as i can this time that means seizing enemy ships in the harbor and preventing them from sailing to enemy ports but it will cause such a disruption the harbormaster protested and the english will only do the same to our ships so what do we gain it is a necessary military measure roland said see to it at once and if i refuse the harbormaster asked i have the authority to demand your obedience roland kersauzon said softly perhaps because he didnt shout and carry on the harbormaster looked stubborn and shook his head with a sigh kersauzon drew one of the flintlock pistols he wore on his belt the click when he cocked it filled the harbormasters office the mans eyes crossed fearfully as he stared down the bore of the weapon which could not miss from a range of less than a yard still in a low voice roland continued and i will blow your stupid head off if you give me any more back talk is that plain enough for you you are a madman the harbormaster gasped sweat starting out on his face very much at your service sir roland said with a polite nod i am also a patriot can you say the same but of course with that pistol aimed an inch above the bridge of his nose the harbormaster would as readily have confessed to being a chinaman in the name of god put up your gun and will i see action if i do roland amended his words action of the proper sort i should say not foolishness if you summon someone and try to have me arrested he will be sorry and you will be sorrier do you understand and even more to the point do you believe me oui monsieur the harbormaster choked out the pistol is most persuasive i thought it might be that is one of the reasons i carry it roland said complacently he swung the flintlock aside and eased the hammer down very well no duress lets see how you do now the harbormaster didnt disappoint him the functionary exploded into motion shouting and waving his arms roland kersauzon followed him to make sure all the shouting was to the point it was people stared at the harbormasterhe probably hadnt moved so fast in years but once they stopped staring they did what he said they did it with more enthusiasm than he seemed to expect too they swarmed aboard one ship from england or english atlantis after another if they did some private pillaging while they were aboard roland intended to lose no sleep over it this was war and if he had to remind people what that meant well he would victor radcliff stared in dismay through the screening of ferns to the ford ahead the french soldiers at the ford had no idea he and the three runaways were there but the soldiers presence was what dismayed him you said no soldados this time francisco didnt sound happy with him i didnt think there would be victor answered you say no soldats last time too blaise used bad french instead of bad spanish i didnt think theyd be there either dammit radcliff said they never are except now somethings happened si we happen juan said no no no victor shook his head we arent important enough to cause all this we shook the ones on our trail a while ago now these buggers shouldnt have any idea were around but theyre here anyway im as surprised as my greatgrandfather is that a saying in your language blaise asked what does it mean not a saying in my language a saying in my family victor replied my greatgrandfather was the man who took avalon away from the pirates a long time ago ah avalon i know of avalon juan said blaise nodded francisco didnt but it didnt matter for the sake of the story one of the pirate chiefs was my greatgrandfathers cousin victor went on my ancestor killed him but brought his daughter back to new hastings she was only a child so why not she grew up she married she had children of her own and one day more than twenty years later she went up to hanoverit was still called stuart back thenand she called on my greatgrandfather he was old and rich by then and glad to see hertill she pulled out a pistol and shot him dead he spoke a mixture of spanish and french to give them all a chance to follow and they did well enough they laughednot too loud because the soldiers werent far away as surprised as your greatgrandfather blaise agreed what did they do to the pirates daughter to the pirates daughter they hanged her ethels last words were i told him i would pay him back and i did were pigheaded we radcliffs victor spoke not without pride juan had a more practical question are you stubborn enough to know another ford or do we build a raft to get across victor pointed toward the green ridge mountains there is another one about half a days travel west it means more doubling back to get you to settled country and properly set up as freemen but he spread his hands we go blaise said the black plainly led the runaways neither copperskin argued with him not many men knew about the more distant fordfewer on the french side than on the english victor judged what he and his companions would do if it was garrisoned toohe would worry about then hed never been one to borrow trouble he found enough as things were most people did the sun was sinking in the west when they found the ford they scouted it with unusual care but no french troops seemed anywhere close by victor crossed first his firearms above his head to keep them dry the runaways followed through the waistdeep water theyd all come out dripping onto the north bank when an english voice shouted hold it right there or well ventilate you several men with bayoneted muskets emerged from the undergrowth ive never seen soldiers here before victor exclaimed also in english you bloody clot dont you know theres a war on a sergeant demanded he sounded tough but not unfriendly victors accent disarmed him a war victor blinked now that you mention it he said no xvii a t roland kersauzons order french soldiers had seized a bridge over the erdre the river that formed the border between the french and english settlements the english called it the stour they had to fight a brisk little skirmish to do it had they moved a couple of days later enough enemy soldiers might have come south to forestall them do you see roland said to anyone who would listen there is a lesson here speed counts even a small delay and the english would hold a bridgehead on our soil not the other way round because he commanded the army the other officersand the sergeants and the cooks and the grooms and anybody else who chanced to be within earshotcouldnt simply walk away from him they had to listen to his words of wisdom some of them had to listen several times he repeated himself without shame most of the time without noticing he was doing it supply wagons rolled up from cosquer and from nouveau redon in days gone by hunting could have kept a good part of the army fed so old men insisted their fathers had told them anyhow but no one had seen a honker near the coast for many years oil thrushes hadnt vanished but they were getting scarce too even more ordinary ducks and geese had been heavily hunted and so roland and his soldiers ate sausages and smoked pork and onions and hard cheese and biscuits baked almost hard enough to keep weevils out of them they washed down the unappetizing food with vin tres ordinaire and with beer that wasnt much better some of them drank from the erdre instead roland discouraged that it was more likely to lead to a flux of the bowels there are towns upstream he reminded the menand reminded them and reminded them where do you think they empty their chamber pots into the river naturellement we ought to call it the merdre not the erdre he was inordinately fond of the pun others who heard it smiled widely the first time smiled politely the second time and stopped smiling after that roland who didnt keep track of whod heard it and who hadnt found his subordinates sadly lacking in a sense of humor two drummer boys beat out a brisk tattoo as the main french force followed the skirmishers across the erdre and into english territory roland kersauzon rode across on a white horse if a man was going to lead an army he needed to be seen leading it so thought roland along with every other european commander of the eighteenth century he paid a price the gold braid and epaulets on his blue velvet jacket weighed almost as much as a backandbreast of days gone by more gold braid ornamented and weighed down his tricorn the hat did shield his eyes from the sun but it was heavy enough to make his neck sore he sighed with relief every time he took it off he could have doffed it any time he chose no one would have doubted who led the french settlers he could have but he didnt he was as stern with himself as he was with the men in his charge they marched on leaving a garrison at the bridge to make sure the english didnt nip in behind them and take it away roland felt very grand and martial his soldiers seized livestock and supplies from the farms they passed the army would eat better because of it scouts rode in front of the main force kersauzon didnt want to get taken by surprise hed known for years that englishmen werent to be trusted he didnt care to have them prove it against his army and so when a sharp racket of musketry rang out up ahead he called to the buglers blow form line of battle then blow advance on the foe the horn calls rang out the gap between the first and the second stretched longer than roland would have liked the french force was less thoroughly drilled than it might have been garrisons from several towns had been melded together to make an attacking force they were brave enoughkersauzon had no doubts about thatbut they hadnt marched side by side for years theyd be veterans by the time this campaign ended but they werent yet roland rode forward with the advancing infantry to see what the trouble was he didnt need long the english had picked a spot where trees came close to the road on both sides and run up a barricade of logs and boulders there they were shooting from behind it which let a handful of men thwart a much larger number roland didnt think that was sporting but the english settlers doubtless didnt care we will give them a few volleys from the front he said while we keep them busy we will send men into the woods to either side once they flank the enemy out of his position we will tear down the barricade and resume our advance hed never commanded troops in battle before everything seemed bright and clear and obvious he gave his orders with confidence the soldiers eagerly obeyed confidence in a leader brought out confidence in his men his men approached the barricade a couple of english settlers popped up and fired at them one bullet missed the other grazed a soldier in the leg he had to fall out but called to his comrades as they marched past go on go get them dont worryill be with you again soon they moved to within sixty yards or so close enough for a decisive volley then two blunt ugly little cannon muzzles poked through cunningly concealed openings among the logs they were threepounders light field guns that could keep up with cavalry on any reasonable ground a man cried out in english both guns belched fire and smoke at the same time they also belched canister at that range they couldnt have missed if they tried men from the first three or four rows of french settlers fell as if scythed the ones still standing looked around in surprise as if wondering where their friends had gone some of them shot at the enemy most were too startled or too appalled roland kersauzon was appalled too a man who stopped canister at close range wasnt picturesquely wounded as the man pinked by a musket ball had been he was blown to rags to bloody fragments a butchers shop would have been ashamed to sell and no matter how mutilated he was he didnt always die right away the shrieks from maimed soldiers chilled the blood where are our cannon monsieur a lieutenant asked theyre coming up roland said unhappily the line of march had got longer than it should have he hadnt tightened up for he hadnt expected to do any serious fighting for a while there was another lesson if you didnt act as if a battle might break out any second you were making a mistake and that one had a corollary mistakes in wartime could be fatal this one had been for too many of his men only luck none of those lead balls tore into his own belly or smashed his skull what do we do now monsieur the lieutenant asked shall we charge the barricade while they reload too late roland learned caution he shook his head no if they have another gun waiting theyll murder us he turned to the bugler blow fall back although that horn call wasnt particularly mournful in and of itself it seemed so to kersauzon because of what it ordered fall back the french settlers did dragging their wounded with them dead men and pieces of men lay where theyd fallen the hot iron stink of blood fouled the air would the english come out to attack would their cannon start firing roundshot which could kill from much farther than canister whatever they did they wouldnt enjoy it for long once the outflankers got behind them they would have a thin time of it the lieutenant pointed at the barricade monsieur i believe theyre pulling out roland raised a spyglass to his eyes like a ship captains glass or an astronomers it inverted the image while magnifying it sure enough the glimpses of enemy soldiers the barrier gave him showed they were withdrawing either they were cowards or more likely he decided with regret theyd figured out his plan and wouldnt wait around to be trapped so they are roland said heavily well we can let them gothis time then well tear down the barrier and advance again well be more careful from now on ill be more careful from now on he meant the young lieutenant politely nodded once in english atlantis juan and francisco went their own way francisco talked of traveling overland to avalon and then crossing the hesperian gulf and going back to terranova how he would find his own clan again victor radcliff had no idea he was welcome to try though juan simply wandered off maybe he went looking for his own folk too maybe he just went looking for work or a woman or whiskey or whatever else he might want he was a free man here so was blaise but he seemed inclined to stick with victor you do interesting things monsieur he said in his oddly accented french i think i do more interesting things myself with you than without you victor had never hadand never wanteda body servant he couldnt very well tell the negro that staying with him was pointless because hed be spending so much time in the woods blaise could take care of himself there at least as well as victor and maybe better and sovictor found himself stuck his fiancee thought it was funny margaret dandridge was a levelheaded girl from a new hastings trading family hes very sweet she told victor and hes sharphes already starting to pick up english i know victor answered hes learning to shoot too they wouldnt let him do that while he was a slave hes good at it i think hed be good at anything he turned his hand to youre lucky to have him then meg said i suppose so victor didnt sound so sure after a moments hesitation he explained why do i have him or does he have me he had plenty of other things to worry about no one in the english settlements had looked for the french settlers to move so aggressively after war broke out an english army was supposed to be on the way across the sea everyone had thought the french would do the same so forces from the two mother countries fought it out but roland kersauzon had other ideas english atlantis had to dance to his tune one way or another either the settlers had to recruit forces of their own or they had to yield to kersauzon without fighting and hope the professionals from the home island could rescue them they recruited of course every farmer with a shotgun for bagging ducks and driving off wild dogs every backwoodsman with a rifle made a likely soldier the men who joined on their own or were dragooned into the service of crown and settlements got green coats of several different shades some of cotton more of linencotton came from the french and spanish south because he was an experienced backwoodsmanand because he was a radcliffvictor acquired a majors commission with gilt epaulets on the shoulders of his green coat he didnt particularly like the emblems of his rank they made him a better target no one wanted to listen to him so he wore the epaulets in camp when he got to the field he could take them off somehow blaise acquired a sergeants stripes he wore them proudly victor hadnt asked for any rank for him maybe he got it by magic maybe he knew which palms to grease though he had precious little money for greasing victor thought the negros new status would cause trouble and it did a hulking young man named aeneas hand told him ill be damned if i let a lousy nigger order me around blaise was there to hear that he tapped hand on the shoulder you no like he asked in english flavored by both french and his african birthspeechhe was a quick study no i dont the white manwho had perhaps four inches and forty pounds on blaiseset himself his hard hands balled into fists what are you going to do about it you turdcolored monkey flatfooted without changing expression or even seeming very interested blaise kicked him in the crotch aeneas hand let out a startled grunt and folded up like a clasp knife blaise kicked him again this time in the pit of the stomach hand couldnt have fought back after the first disaster the second left him on the ground desperately struggling to breathe blaise kicked him one more time in the side of the head hand went limp did you kill him victor asked nah the negro shook his head he hadnt even broken a sweat he continued in french throw water on him he wake up head hurt two three days same with balls and belly he looked down at aeneas hand what he call me i dont understand it never mind victor said in the same language if you knew you would have killed him a couple of other recruits came over to stare at their fallen comrade godalmighty one of them said what happened to him he offended the sergeant here victor pointed to blaise and he found out that wasnt such a good idea didnt he sure did the man looked from aeneas hand to blaise and back again offended him did he if he really went and got him mad i reckon hed be in pieces wouldnt be surprised victor radcliff agreed fetch a pail of water and souse aeneas with it hes learned a lesson i hope nobody else in this company has to hand had begun to stir by the time the water cascaded over him sure enough it revived him blearily he looked up at blaise you dont fight fair he said fight fair fight fair that startled the black man out of english and into profane french sacre merde blaise thought for a moment before going on in english again you right i no fight fair i fight i win only way to fight i sergeant he tapped his stripes you mess me again i kill you understand aeneas hand nodded then winced and looked as if he wished he hadnt water dripped off his chin and from the end of his pointed nose reckon i do reckon i do what blaise touched the chevrons again reckon i do sergeant the big recruit allowed good blaise allowed himself a smile he reached down and hauled hand upright we get on now and they did having been so thoroughly beaten aeneas hand spread the word that blaise was sudden death on two legs a couple of smaller incidents with other recruits did nothing to show he was wrong victor radcliff began to wonder whether he or his man would have worn the epaulets had blaise been born with a white skin gravediggers spades tore into the soft brown earth dirt thudding on dirt had an ominously final sound roland kersauzon watched as a priest gabbled quick latin over the shrouded corpse then jumped away a sicklysweet stench rose from the body it wasnt because the young soldier had stayed unburied too long hed died that night only a few hours before this dawn but smallpox had its own fetor roland muttered to himself too many soldiers were dying of smallpox and measles men who grew up on farms out in the countryside and spent their lives alone in the woods missed the diseases in childhood when they were most often milder catch them then and you were immune forever after catch them as an adult he rubbed his arm he had smallpox scars there but nowhere else hed missed the sickness as a boy himself hed been inoculated with it at nouveau redon and taken a light case now he was as immune as if hed been through a harsh bout caught by accident inoculation had come to the french settlements from the english to atlantis from england and to england hed heard from turkey he wondered how widely it was practiced in english territory here were the english settlements recruits less likely than his own men to come down sick he hoped notthat could decide who won the war the gravediggers tipped the corpse into the hole theyd made both of them had smallpoxslagged faces they feared no contagion the priest was unmarked no wonder he didnt want to stay by the body a moment longer than he had to but a dying man or a dead one needed a hope of heaven if a priest wouldnt shrive him hed surely go to hell instead if a priest died after shriving a few men what then then you find another priest roland thought with luck a man who carries the scars on his own face that would be moreeconomical till this moment kersauzon had never thought of priests as expendable munitions of war but they were that they were also other things didnt mean they werent a veteran sergeantone who bore the marks on his facecame up to roland and saluted voice as mechanical as an artisans automaton he said monsieur im sorry to have to report to you that in my company alone we have another half a dozen sick two of them i fear arent at all well if a veteran sergeant said something like that the priest would perform his office again before long nom dun nom roland burst out so many and just from your company oui monsieur who would have imagined the underofficers voice could become even more colorless than it was already and other companies will be reporting similar calamities kersauzon persisted if they are honest i think they will how are we to go forward with so much sickness the sergeant didnt answer that not in words his eyebrows said youre the commander why are you troubling me with that its your worry and it was kersauzon sighed thank you for letting me know youre dismissed he received another precisely machined salute and the underofficer made his exit other sergeants and lieutenants did report sickness in their men one lieutenant reported himself unwell the hectic flush on his face and a bright glitter in his eye said hed be worse before long roland said nothing of that past telling him to lie down and take it easy but were in english territory monsieur the young officer protested we should move forward we willin a while roland said but we need to have a healthy army if we are to fight with any hope of victory nestce pas oui the lieutenant said and argued no more more and more reports came in this is a disaster kersauzon cried hed expected the bloody flux among his men but so many casualties from smallpox and measles took him by surprise the corporal whod brought the latest word of men down with smallpoxand of others afraid to get anywhere near themshrugged then the marks on his face said hed been through the disease and come out the other side its war monsieur he replied but if i attack now it will be like trying to strike with a broken hand roland said another shrug from the corporal then dont attack monsieur wait for the english to come to you chances are their army will have as much sickness as ours fifty years earlier that assuredly would have been true but if the english inoculated more than his own side did smallpox would trouble them less and he knew they did inoculate more the procedure had its risks every once in a while someone came down with a bad case of smallpox instead of the mild dose that gave immunity most of the time though a wild case was far more dangerous he consoled himself by remembering that the english couldnt inoculate for measles or fluxes of the bowels and not all of their soldiers would have had pus from a smallpox sore rubbed into a cut on the arm some would still catch the disease on their own some yes but how many fewer than were catching it among his own troops roland kersauzon was glumly sure of that he dismissed the corporal with more respect than he usually gave underofficers the man had helped him make up his mind which was more than that miserable lieutenant had done he stood on english territory he decided he would stand for a while till the sickness burned through his army and burned itself out freetown could wait victor radcliff rode into new hastings from the north blaise rode with him the negro had never ridden a horse till he escaped from bondage no one would ever mistake him for a polished equestrian now but he stayed on the gelding and didnt complain about being saddlesorethough he did walk with the bowlegged gait of a man with rickets new hastings narrow winding streets and halftimbered houses made victor wonder if the tudor age really had passed away he laughed at himself as that went through his mind the town was older than the tudors its founding lay in plantagenet times plantagenets tudors stuartsall gone new hastings went on english ships they come blaise asked thats what the semaphore said victor answered word passed from fishing boats still out to sea it is clever the semaphore blaise lapsed into french to say that and went on in the same language in africa we have fires that go from hill to hill to pass messages beacon fires victor said in english beacon fires blaise repeated the phrase i remember and he would too but the semaphore it is better than the beacon fires it can say more of things just more things victor told him more things blaise also said that again he shrugged it is a peculiar language english victor found french and spanish peculiar when they differed from the tongue hed grown up speaking to what strange african language was blaise comparing english radcliff wondered how much trouble he would have learning it he had more important things to worry about those ships would carry english regulars to stiffen the ranks of the raw atlantean troops victor assumed the redcoats wouldnt have to worry about the sicknesses that had weakened the colonial force the regulars would already have lived through them by now he and blaise rode past the big allplanked warehouses that stood near the harbor and then out toward the quays their timing couldnt have been better if they were on the stage in hanover a firstrate manofwar was just tying up with several smaller beamier transports right behind ahoy victor called to the men on the ship of the line he descended from fishermen but the nautical word felt strange and unnatural in his mouth may i come aboard who are you a mate asked he pointed at blaise and whos the monkey a low growl from blaises throat said he understood that radcliff had hoped he wouldnt the atlantean officer answered i am major victor radcliff of the local militia with me is my man blaise he stressed man more than he might have otherwise the mate stayed unimpressed and why should the general want to see the likes of you eh because his men and ours will be fighting the french victor suggested well is will the mate said but then just before victor might have drawn his pistol the fellow grudgingly nodded all right i suppose you can see im wont do too much arm he shouted orders a gangplank thudded down victor came aboard blaise at his heels everything aboard the manofwar spoke of order discipline restraint confinement at home in the wide woods of atlantis victor immediately mistrusted the atmosphere behind him blaise muttered in his incomprehensible native tongue he would have crossed from africa to atlantis in the hold of a slave ship mistrust radcliff realized was bound to be the least of what he felt here but for those mutters and a hooded glance toward the mate though blaise held his feelings in check ahhwhere do i find the general victor asked lubber the mate muttered radcliff felt as offended and as ready to punch him as blaise would have if the man had said nigger in the same tone of voice with a resigned sighwhat could one do about the ignorantthe mate pointed and said is cabins on the poop deck back at the stern thank you victor replied meaning anything but then the mate pointed again ere e comes now so you dont ave to go back there wouldnt want you getting lost would we before victor could rise to that sarcasm the mate raised his voice your excellency general sir this officer from the settlementshis tone and the way he jerked his thumb at victor showed he was giving him the benefit of the doubtwould like to ave the honor of speaking to your excellency for a moment yes yes the general commanding the english expeditionary force was refulgent in scarlet and gold if the uniform made the man he was a made man indeed personally he was less prepossessing about sixty jowly with a pinched mouth that said hed lost most of his teeth when he nodded to victor the wattles under his chin wobbled i am major general edward braddock and you sir victor saluted major victor radcliff your excellency i am pleased to welcome you to atlantis more pleased than i am to be here i shouldnt wonder braddock replied i hoped they would give me a command on the continent but he shrugged and that loose flesh swung back and forth again a man goes where he is ordered not where he would tell me something of the french dispositions sir they are halted in our territory about thirty miles below freetown victor said no light of intelligence kindled in the generals eye from which victor concluded he did not know exactly where freetown lay with a mental sigh the atlantean added a gloss about a hundred ten miles south of where we are now i see edward braddock nodded perhaps in wisdom his next questions were cogent enough why are they halted why didnt they go on to assail this place deserters say theres sickness among them your excellency victor answered ah braddock nodded again that would come of using raw troops wouldnt it you neednt worry about my lads coming down sick by god if they didnt catch the great poxlet alone the smallyears ago they werent half trying his chuckle held a curious mix of contempt and affection your excellency i had that very thought as i was riding down here it should help us indeed well come ashore march down to wherever it is that the froggies got stuck in the mud drive them out of our settlements and then go on into theirs braddock said should be a straightforward enough job of work youll be able to keep us victualed i expect i think so sir radcliff paused if i may say he paused again yes well out with it man i dont bite the english officer said gruffly the only thing i wanted to say sir is that it may not prove quite so easy as you make it sound victor told him atlantis is a different place from europe dont i know it braddock had said he would rather have fought on european soil now radcliff saw how true that was scowling braddock went on still and all soldiering is soldiering what works in france works in prussia and russia and india weve seen that i daresay it will work here too i hope so your excellency victor replied a horseman rode into the french encampment from the north he shouted roland kersauzons name roland ducked out of his tent i am here he said what have you learned the rider dismounted a young groom led the horse away english soldiers have landed at new hastings sir the rider said how many do you know no sir but the rumor is that they have a general in command so they are not a small force the scout spoke fluent english one reason roland had chosen him he continued and the rumor is they are marching this way is it kersauzon said tonelessly it was a rumor he would rather not have heard english regulars under a general major general edward braddock the scout pronounced the name with a certain somber satisfaction emboldened by rolands silence he pressed on is it that we shall also have soldiers coming from the mother country if it is i have heard nothing of it roland replied i am what we have we are what we have at least the man hadnt asked whether a general was coming from france which bespoke a certain basic courtesy kersauzon realized hed answered the question regardless of whether it was asked what shall we do the scout asked the english regulars they are said to be men of extraordinary discipline of extraordinary ferocity as well how can we hope to stand against such soldiers that only angered kersauzonangered him more perhaps because similar doubts flitted through his own mind do you piddle down your leg when you hear an englishman is coming he demanded monsieur i should hope that i do not the scout replied with dignity but when many englishmen come with an english major general commanding them i confess i am not altogether easy in my mind very well roland said it wasnt but it also wasnt anything he could do anything about he gestured sharply you may go it wasnt quite youve brought me bad newsget out of here but it wasnt so far removed from that either rather to his surprise the scout did remember to salute before leaving that left roland there by himself also an uncomfortable place to be he had nothing to do but brood about what lay ahead his army had shown it could stand against whatever the english settlers of atlantis threw at it against regulars from across the sea he wasnt nearly so sure those men were trained to stand in line to load and fire to step forward and take their wounded or slain comrades places and then to charge home with the bayonet all without regard for their own safety unlike them his troops were not such fools they wanted to fight yes but they also wanted to live kersauzon scratched his chin whiskers rasped under his nailsa man could not stay properly shaved in the field he frowned if he fought this braddocks fight line against line what could he do but lose but what other kind of fight was there the kind where his mens fighting style had the advantage and that of the english regulars did not of course put so it seemed obvious but how to turn an obvious abstraction into reality he called the scout back the man came with ill grace he was gnawing on some meat stuffed between two slices of bread an english fashion that seemed to be spreading and why not it was fast and convenient and filling mouth full the scout mumbled monsieur i wish you to tell me of the land ahead roland said i am seeking a particular kind of terrain after a heroic swallow and another equally heroic bite the scout mumbled again and that would be something on this order roland described it as minutely as he could have you seen anything like that another swallow another bite more muffled talkthe man suddenly seemed capable of speech only with his mouth full well now monsieur i think i just may have he swallowed again andmiracle of miraclesemitted several clear words when i was coming back here you understand yes roland kersauzon quivered with eagerness how far distant not too the scout replied or so roland thought at any rate the fellow was eating again had he fasted all through his mission would he starve to death unless he stuffed his face with meat and bread now not too roland repeated hopefully the scout nodded that let him eat and communicate at the same time and lessened his risk of choking to death roland tried to get more out of him could we establish ourselves therewherever this place isbefore the english come across it hed timed things as well as he could he finished the question just as the scout swallowed that didnt stop the man from taking another bite before answering roland supposed nothing short of a lightning stroke from god could have he looked up toward the heavens nothing god might have been baal in the old testament he was talking or pursuing or on a journey or maybe he was sleeping and needed to be awakened at lastand as indistinctly as everthe scout said oui monsieur i think we can do it without much trouble good roland said and it was good then we shall xviii m ajor general braddock didnt lack for confidence once we drive the french rabble out of english territory we shall go on to the capture of nouveau redon and then march down into the spanish settlements thus completing the conquest of atlantis for the crown he declared at supper the evening after his army began moving south from new hastings the officers whod accompanied him from england nodded victor radcliff wondered whether the distinguished major general had bothered checking a map he was talking about marching hundreds of miles presumably he would need to leave garrisons along the way how many men did he think he would have left by the time he came to the southern tip of atlantis victor saw that the rest of the atlantean officers were as appalled as he was they knew how big atlantis was whether braddock did or not none of them said anything though radcliff thought the march down to the border would be plenty to show the general from across the sea hed underestimated the size of his new command or maybe braddock had overestimated what his regulars could do by atlantean standards they werent big men one picked regiment had soldiers all over five feet seven which was not a great height on this side of the atlantic the rest of the english troops ran smaller still they were tough though no doubt about that their legs might not be long but they could outmarch the bigger atlantean recruits they seemed as immune to fatigue as they were to fear and to smallpox they traded filthy jokes in halfcomprehensible dialects as they trudged along they took their trade as much for granted as fishermen or wheelwrights or glassmakers braddock raised his goblet which held a fine madeira that had crossed the ocean with him to the king to victory and to glory he said to the king to victory and to glory the assembled officers chorused victor radcliff drank the toast with everyone else nothing wrong with it as long as everything went smoothly even victor thought the rugged foot soldiers from england ought to be able to bundle the french back over the border a handsome victory here might let them assail nouveau redon the french stronghold was said to be very strong if the defenders were battered and demoralized thoughwell who could say what might happen then by now not having blaise at his side felt odd the negro had made himself indispensable in a hurry he was off eating and drinking with other officers servants and with the cooks whod served up these succulent beefsteaks and rib roasts victor wouldnt have been surprised if the servants were eating better yet major radcliff braddock called yes your excellency victor replied surprised at being singled out i looked to be dining on honkers and other native fowl the englishman said that would have been something out of the ordinary at any ratesomething i havent done before instead we havebeef nothing wrong with beef mind you but i did not cross the sea to eat of it sir weve long since hunted the honkers out of these coastal districts victor said here we are nearly as settled as you are back on the home island and our crops and livestock reflect it we do i believe have more terranovan turkeys here than you raise in england and we make more use of maize as well but honkers honkers these days are rare anywhere east of the green ridge mountains and less common west of the mountains than they were how disappointing braddock said if i had to come here i looked for a thoroughly exotic clime to reward me with its novelty but i find england has got here ahead of me it has sir victor agreed perhaps after the war is won you might be interested in journeying into the interior with me there i promise you will find things you would not within sight of st pauls perhaps i might indeed major and i thank you for the generous offer braddock said one more good reason to clean things up as quickly as ever we may the march resumed at first light the next morning one more sign braddock wanted to get things over with in a hurry yawning and grumbling profanely the redcoats from england made up the core of the army greencoated atlanteans were good enough for scouts and vanguard and rear guard if there was a battle their place would be on the wings again the english regulars would take center stage farmers waved as the soldiers marched by they had however universally taken the precaution of driving their horses and cattle and sheep and pigs and chickensyes and turkeys tooaway from the armys line of progress victor wondered how they knew soldiers plundered as naturally as they breathed eastern atlantis had been peaceful for many many years however they knew they were right chattels whose owners were rash enough to leave them on display disappeared a chicken here a hatchet there and the english regulars werent the only ones who stole the atlanteans lifted things as if theyd been soldiering and plundering for years victor radcliff didnt know whether they were admirable or awful some of them could have had farms along this road he said then theyd be hiding not stealing thats so msieu blaise agreed but they dont so they arent right victor said sometimes blaises english was as compressed as a semaphore signal victor wasnt sure whether that was a defect or the sign of a profound mind blaise didnt worry about it as far as victor radcliff could tell blaise didnt worry about anything most of what that proved was how little victor really knew the retainer who doubled as an underofficer a man snatched from his native land and sold into slavery among strangelooking people who spoke not a word of his languagesuch a man might find a thing or two to worry about or maybe even three a farmer on horseback came up from the south to report that the french army was moving again major general braddock took that as good news we shant have to storm their field fortifications then he said that might possibly have proved tricky if we meet them in the open though god hath delivered them into our hands he used the oldfashioned verb form to show his confidence if they had fieldworks your excellency why would they move out of them victor asked if they spent so long in one place why would they not have built fieldworks braddock returned and the atlantean had no good answer for him radcliff asked the same question of blaise a few minutes later maybe we find out the black man said that struck victor as much too likely positions positions roland kersauzon felt like a director putting on a play unlike a director he had a cast of thousands and unlike a director in a crowded little theater he would have an audience of thousands too he had to keep that audience interested and intrigued just long enough the english regulars and their settler allies were coming theyd be here soon his own cavalry was skirmishing with the enemys atlantean horse holding the scouts away so they couldnt divine what was going on here no one was trying to hold back the main english force on the contrary dress your lines roland shouted to the ranks of musketeers who took their places athwart the road they would stand and volley against braddocks fearsome regulars for a while and they would pay for it too he stood with them he lacked the gall to order others to do what he dared not do himself he would have been safer if hed had it he also would have been a stranger to himself when he looked north he saw a cloud of dust against the sky the redcoats and the english settlers were getting close then well good roland didnt want to stand out here in the meadow under the hot sun all day he would have been cooler as well as safer in the trees behind his horribly exposed soldiers or in the woods to either side of the meadow he wondered why european generals insisted on fighting battles in the open they could control their armies better if they could see everything that was going on true it hardly seemed reason enough but if braddock was looking for a standup fight the french settlers would give him onefor a while pistols banged not very far in the distance his horsemen were falling back against the english atlanteans as they had orders to do he didnt want to stop the enemy advance only to channel it a little as long as they kept the other sides cavalry away from the woods they were doing their job horses trotted toward him across the meadow those were his riders they waved to the musketeers as they approached and then rode past to either side some of the musketeers were incautious enough to wave back their sergeants screamed at them they wouldnt make that mistake again a few horsemen reined in and looked at his force from well out of musket range then wheeled their mounts and rode back to the north those were the english atlanteans scouts getting a look at his dispositions roland knew what he wanted to look like but in war as in the theater you could never be quite sure that what the audience saw was what you wanted it to see well hed know soon here came the redcoats already deployed in line of battle advancing to the bleat of the horn and the tap of the drum they wore tall hats to make themselves seem bigger and more fearsome than they really were as they drew close though roland realized most of them were shorter and skinnier than the greenclad atlanteans who flanked them as long as they were shooting that wouldnt matter everybody who aimed a loaded musket was the same size but it might count against the english in the bayonet charge or on the other hand it might not the redcoats approached the field with the professional arrogance of men who knew exactly what they were doing and had done it plenty of times before their matteroffactness was daunting can we beat them monsieur a young lieutenant asked so roland wasnt the only one whose knees wanted to knock they think we are going to play their game the french commander said more calmly than he felt if we do that theypresent certain difficulties theyll slaughter us he meant and hoped the lieutenant didnt realize it this is the best arrangement for doing something else nestce pas certainement the youngster replied he kept his eyes on the steadily advancing regulars his thoughts were still on them too for he continued so long as they give us the chance to do something else yes so long as kersauzon agreed nothing in war is certain i would be the last to claim anything different but i believe that fighting where we are as we are gives us the best chance of victory the redcoats marched right into musket range their sergeants went on dressing their lines even then they could have started shooting so could the french settlers when the pause held a heavyset elderly englishmanhe was close enough to see clearlyrode out in front of his force and tipped his hat in the direction of roland kersauzons army kersauzon gravely returned the courtesy the englishman rode off to one side of the line so as not to get in the way of his sides musketry bugle calls rang out english and french the front rank of soldiers in both armies dropped to one knee the second rank stooped to shoot over their heads the third rank stood straight to fire above the heads of the second now roland kersauzon shouted at the same instant as his english opposite number yelled what had to be the same thing fire rippled across both battle lines smoke clouded the air bullets flew oh how they flew one of them tugged at rolands sleeve another knocked the hat off his head he caught it before it fell he needed a moment to be sure but no neither of those musket balls touched his tender flesh not all his men were so lucky some fell and lay still more staggered away in pain and disbelief the stink of blood and that of shit from bowels pierced by bullets or loosened by fear filled the air along with gunpowders choking reek having fired the first three ranks of frenchmen retired to reload the next three stepped forward to take their places their muskets were loaded and ready to fire roland knew succeeding volleys would by the nature of things grow more ragged than the first two that was certainly true for his halftrained troops but the redcoats fired and reloaded fired and reloaded faster than mere mortals had any business doing they got off three volleys for every two from the french settlers sometimes two for one if the settlers tried to hold their ground much longer the englishmen would either charge home with the bayonets that glittered at the ends of their guns or simply slaughter them with that deadly massed musketry retreat roland shouted retreat enough buglers still stood to amplify the command the frenchmen streamed back in among the treesthose who still could by jove weve got them now major general braddock said in more than a little satisfaction the crash of volley after volley made his horse skittish but he himself stayed as calm as if he were in his drawing room almost in spite of himself victor radcliff was impressed and he was impressed at what the redcoats were doing to the french settlers in front of them the settlers were brave if they werent they couldnt have stood the gaff as long as they had but they were getting chewed to pieces the training that made an english regular would have been reckoned cruel if inflicted on a hound on a manbut cruel or not it worked the regulars delivered their fire with a speed and volume victor wouldnt have believed if he werent seeing it with his own eyes blaise saw the same thing these men ugly these men bad but these men they fighters he said whoops and cheers from officers and sergeants announced the french debacle theyre running the cowardly dogs an underofficer shouted gleefully order the pursuit braddock commanded in a great voice horns and human voices carried out his bidding hurrah the soldiers shouted as they tramped forward still in neatly aligned ranks and all hell broke loose when volleys tore into the redcoats from both flanks they left victor confused for a moment the enemy was in front of them the enemy was broken was fleeing the enemy was he realized leading them straight into a trap no had led them smoke rose from the left smoke rose from the right more musketry tore into the redcoats from either side cannon boomed their roar deeper than that from the flintlocks the roundshot enfilading the english tore great holes in their lines and the french settlers whod volleyed with braddocks regulars hadnt fled incontinently as victor thought they had once they reached the cover that trees and ferns gave they turned around and started shooting again each man blazed away as he saw fit it wasnt the deadly hail of bullets a good volley produced which didnt mean it wasnt galling the french settlers also proved to have field guns hidden in the woods to the rear of their lines they fired roundshot and canister the range was long for canister but not too long regulars fell in clusters when the showers of lead balls struck home my god we are undone major general edward braddock sounded astonished disbelieving they tricked us the dirty scuts by the way he said it the french settlers had no right to do any such wicked thing can we break them victor asked more from duty than from hope the veriest child could see that the english regulars under fire from the front and both flanks were the ones being broken so could braddock no this day is not ours i fear me best we withdraw to save what we can while he stopped wincing and set a hand on his prominent belly youre wounded your excellency victor said sure enough blood stained the gray vest braddock wore under his long red coat he still had spirit nothing serious my dear boy i assure you i he winced again this ball struck the right side of his chest i say blighters are using me for a pincushion today he coughed and grimaced and flinched red foam burst from his nostrils he would die then no surgeon could cure a wound like that even if fever didnt take him after the bullet in the belly a musket ball gashed victors horse the animal screamed and bucked he fought it back under control another ball drew a bloody line across the back of his hand the redcoats lines neat no more were bloodied too they stolidly tried to fight back in an impossible position bedeviled by foes they couldnt seefoes who didnt fight the way they were used tothe undertaking was hopeless blow retreat victor shouted to the buglers he looked around for blaise the negro hadnt fled he hadnt got shot down go to the other wing tell the buglers there to sound retreat too on my orders and general braddocks sound retreat on your orders yes sir if blaise had any nerves he kept them in a place where they didnt show off he rode ill get you out of here your excellency radcliff told the english general kind of you to say so young fellow but i fear me im done for the red foam was on braddocks lips now too i know somewhat of wounds ill not go anywhere far not with what ive caught your courage does you credit sir victor could say that and mean it braddock faced death with as much equanimity as any man hed ever seen he waved the praise away ive done good fighting in my dayand some not so good i fear here at the end ive loved a lot of pretty women too and more than a few of them loved me back i hoped to be shot at a more advanced age by an outraged husband but no man gets everything he wants come away please maybe the doctors can do you some good even as victor spoke he knew they couldnt so did edward braddock quacks might kill me faster you mean but i die fast enough without them save yourself radcliff pay these backwoods frenchmen back if you see the chance go on your luck wont last if you stay here mines already run dry he sagged in the saddle he wouldnt be able to sit his horse much longer tears stung radcliffs eyes youll be avenged your excellency england will be avenged yes yes braddock said impatiently he coughed again this time a steady stream of blood came from his nose and dribbled out the corner of his mouth his face was going gray biting his lip victor turned his horse and rode back to the north by ones and twos and in small groups redcoats were stumbling out of the fight every so often a man would turn and fire at what might have been pursuers most of the regulars wanted nothing more than to get away one of them nodded at victor in a friendly enough fashion cor them frenchies buggered us with a bleedin pine cone this time didnt they well victor admitted what he couldnt deny yes did the general make it out the redcoat asked afraid not hes got two woundsbad ones belly and chest i dont think hell live much longer radcliff replied blimey the englishman said so whos in charge then you victor looked around he didnt see any officers who outranked him anywhere close by i think i may be for now anyhow well mr atlantean sir wot the ell do we do next the soldier said lets get away from the enemy first radcliff said then well look around and see what weve got left and after that well try to decide how we can go on fighting or do you have a better idea if you do speak up id love to hear it if you want ideas from the likes of me things are buggered up the soldier said arent they victor asked again in all seriousness the redcoat laughed they are indeed sir for fair no what you said sounds good enoughfor starters anyway yes for starters victor agreed and thats about where we are now isnt it starting from the beginning i mean oh no sir the englishman said after wot appened to us wed better start before that eh victor only wished he could say the man was wrong ravens and vultures spiraled down out of the sky to feast on the dead the ravens didnt mind pecking at the dying either though the vultures shunned anything that still moved roland kersauzon had seen plenty of dead and dying men before but never so many all in one place quantity he discovered had a quality all its own then a redcrested eagle struck at one of his men walking over the battlefield and badly wounded him roland had thought the enormous birds of prey were gone from eastern atlantis but evidently not he wondered what they ate with honkers hunted nearly to extinction hereabouts this one plainly wanted to eat mans flesh it fought with wings and beak and talons and furious screeches when his soldiers tried to drive it from its screaming victim one of them finally knocked it over the head stretcher bearers carried the injured man back to the surgeons his shrieks would go unnoticed there among so many others roland had to make himself go watch the medicos at work and comfort men as they endured bullet probings and amputations with nothing to dull the pain but a leather strap to bite on or if they were lucky a slug of rum why did you come at all monsieur one of the surgeons asked the mans leather apron was all bloody so were his arms to the elbows he sounded genuinely puzzled as he continued the rest of us are here because we have no choice yes i understand roland fought not to wrinkle his nose against the butchers reek of blood his wave took in the charnel house and the rest of the field but all this is my responsibility im glad to accept the victory but how can i without seeing what it costs believe me monsieur most commanders have no trouble whatever the surgeon said along with two burly aides he went on to the next wounded man hold him tight boys he told them cant let him run away while we ply our trade eh the soldier screamed how could he help it when an iron probe penetrated his pierced flesh roland turned away working hard to control his face and his stomach he was relieved when a junior officer came up to him that gave him something to think about besides suffering excuse me sir the lieutenant said but the english prisoners wish to know what is to be done with them i will talk to them kersauzon said my english is not of the best but it will serve and some of them it may be will know a little french yes that is so the lieutenant replied he took roland to the prisoners who looked as apprehensive as the french commander would have in their boots since those boots were finer than the ones a lot of his soldiers had the redcoats probably counted themselves lucky to be wearing them still some of the englishmen stood in their stocking feet so theyd already met plunderers you are safe roland told them in his rusty english your lives are safe you will not be armeduh harmed will you parole us sir asked a man whose chevrons proclaimed him a sergeant you will agree not to fight again until exchanged kersauzon asked first in his language and then in theirs sure enough a few english soldiers did speak french they translated for the others inside of half a minute all the prisoners were nodding eagerly we will sir the sergeant said and thank you for the handsome offer roland wondered whether he ought to hold some of them as hostages to make sure the rest kept their word he decided that would give the redcoats ideas they didnt need they were professionals they had honor you will give your paroles to my men in charge of receiving them roland resolved to appoint such men as soon as he left the prisoners then you may go north if that is what you desire he knew his english was stilted but it served can we get back what your men stole from us when we surrendered that sergeant like any good underofficer was always looking to turn an inch into a mile but kersauzon shook his head be joyousuh be thankfulthey did not hit you on the head did you never plunder a foe who me your excellency oh i might have done that a time or two the sergeant didnt waste breath denying it roland kersauzon would have called him a liar if he had with a grin the saucy fellow went on couldnt hurt to ask nor help roland turned away before long the redcoats were giving their names to the french settlers roland chose to take them the military clerks wrote the names on paper borrowed from the bookkeeper over his protests the few englishmen who could write signed their names beside the transcriptions the rest made their marks then still showing the formidable discipline theyd displayed in battle they marched away heads high backs straight by their pride they might have won what will you do now monsieur one of the clerks asked will you go into freetown with their army shattered the english can hardly stand against us part of roland thought he ought to do exactly that the enemy would be dismayed and disorganized but he was dismayed and disorganized himself the sight of a real battlefield would do that to anyone and his own force if not dismayed was also disorganized the men whod volleyed with the redcoats had fallen in windrows the english might be good at only one kind of warfare but they were monstrously good at that and so roland temporized first we shall bury the deadours and theirs when that is done i shall decide where to go next oui monsieur the clerk didnt argue he even explained why you beat them you showed you know what you are doing bodies thudded into long trenches some for the french settlers others for the redcoats and english settlers priests read prayers above them maybe even the enemy heretics or some of them would reach purgatory and not burn forever in hell kersauzon hoped so anyhow he ordered major general braddock buried in a grave of his own and had a wooden marker with braddocks name set over it even when caught in a trap the english commander had fought gallantly his wounds were at the front as befit a brave man after thatafter that roland ordered the army to camp for rest and recuperation he still stood in englishsettled territory his own settlers had smashed english professionals he was satisfied for the time being one of his lieutenants was not monsieur do you know what hannibals aide told him when he did not march on rome as soon as he beat the legions at cannae no roland replied but i suspect you are about to tell me ignoring the sarcasm the junior officer nodded he said you know how to win a victory but not what to do with it roland only laughed i will take the chance and i will say to you that freetown is hardly rome we do not win the war by taking it and we do not lose the war if we leave it in english hands for a while we cannot go farther while the english hold it the lieutenant said stubbornly new hastings hanover they are far away one thing at a time roland said the lieutenant sighed but he didnt argue any more victor radcliff found having the paroled redcoats back in hanover caused more trouble than it solved they knew they wouldnt be fighting any more for a while and jeered at their comrades whod escaped without getting captured several fistfights followed in short order sending the paroled men north solved some of the problem but only some the englishmen who remained under arms still seethed with resentment as long as they all shared the same risks no one thought anything of it when some did while others didnt the less lucky ones naturally disliked the idea of marching into battle while their friends stayed away the mere idea of parole bewildered blaise no one has to feed prisoners this way victor explained when we capture french soldiers well send them back under parole and put a like number of our men into the army again why not put them in now blaise asked the french they dont know if they recapture a paroled man who isnt properly exchanged they can shoot him victor replied its a question of honor too what is honor blaise asked victor thought of falstaff in henry iv part what is honor a word what is that word honor air a trim reckoning who hath it he that died o wednesday doth he feel it no doth he hear it no it is insensible then yea to the dead but will it not live with the living no why detraction will not suffer it therefore ill none of it honor is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism that would be more than blaise needed to know and in the wrong spirit too victor tried a different approach honor is keeping promises even if keeping them isnt to your advantage if both sides in a fight have honor they can trust each other to follow the rules of war it means we treat prisoners and enemy civilians well knowing the enemy will do the same blaise scratched the tightly curling hair on top of his head you and the french do this he asked we do victor said not without pride you are both mad then blaise declared it could be that you are right radcliff fell into french in which tongue the negro was still more fluent but if we are both mad the same way it makes fighting the war easier for the helpless without changing who wins or loses honh blaise said a sound wordless but eloquent in its skepticism prisoners the french take prisoners you take you should sell for slaves that shocked victor we dont enslave whites he exclaimed i know you should then you would know more about slavery than you do blaise replied still in french the man holding the whip he thinks one thing the man tasting the whip he thinks maybe something else you are a free man here victor said in english reminding the negro hed come out of frenchheld territory if slavery paid more up here in the land of wheat and maize and lumber it might have caught on better in english atlantis too radcliff didnt mention that plenty black men plenty copper men not free down south blaise replied also in english you say to them help us and you free you get big army fast french spaniards they much unhappy he was probably right whether he was or wasnt mattered only so much to victor radcliff the white man touched his left epaulet with his right forefinger you see this blaise i am a major of atlantean volunteers i do not decide things here cest dommage blaise said and then the same thing in english pity i suppose so said victor who had never tasted the lash he wondered whether spreading a promise to free slaves where they were now would be honorable reluctantly he decided it wouldnt it would involve the french in a guerrilla war against their own servitors with all the horrors that entailed war as it was fought these days was a business of army against army and impinged on civilians as little as possible a slave uprising couldnt help doing just that you want to win this war eh blaise said well yes we wouldnt be fighting it if we didnt radcliff said give blacks and copperskins guns best way the negro seemed ruthlessly matteroffact make french sorry at home they no fight up here no more you may be right victor said that was polite and committed him to nothing to his surprise blaise realized as much you waste a chance he said you not get many better ones you have to do all your fighting yourself war is harder maybe you lose what then victor hadnt seriously imagined losing he wondered why not the french settlers had just devastated some of the best infantry in the world why wouldnt they do the same to the redcoats remnants and to the settlers odds and sods who were all that was left between them and new hastings and hanover maybe they would i think i would pack up and go somewhere else avalon perhaps or the terranovan mainland victor said im not too old to make a new start but we arent whipped yet either not even close no eh blaise let the question hang there no by god victor radcliff insisted if kersauzon had pushed us hard we might have fallen to pieces but he didnt and we wont were getting stronger by the day with more atlantean recruits coming in honh blaise said again he didnt believe it he saw the english soldiers and paroled prisoners quarreling among themselves and he thought that meant the whole army was weak he might have been right too victor didnt want to believe it which didnt mean it wasnt true we wont win if we give up victor thought as long as he remembered thathe wasnt giving up so what he might lose anyhow xix f orward roland kersauzon shouted he gestured to the buglers and drummers their martial music underscored and amplified the order several thousand men moved at his command as if he were a puppet master manipulating marionettes and so he was though he used obedience not actual strings still it was a heady feeling like a slug of barreltree rum sliding hot down his throat into an empty stomach a courier rode up from the south and handed roland a letter roland examined both the man and the seal with care he would not have put it past the perfidious english to sneak in a false but frenchspeaking courier with a forged message to confuse him and his troops but both the courier and the impression stamped into the wax seemed authentic kersauzon broke the seal with a clasp knife unrolled the letter and read what does it say monsieur a lieutenant asked have we been reinforced the way the englishspeaking atlanteans were as a matter of fact we have roland said if this is true two thousand of king louis men have landed at cosquer and are on their way north to us he turned to the courier again how far behind you are they do you think theyre foot soldiers sir the fellow replied with a horsemans natural scorn i left them in my dust as soon as i set out well yes of course kersauzon said and you were riding relays of horses so that made you all the faster we cant expect them for some time then i would think not sir the courier agreed nom dun nom roland muttered unhappily i dont want to wait for themweve already waited long enough but i dont want to go into battle without them either what to do what to do its your decision sir the lieutenant said roland kersauzon could have done without the reminder hed been the soul of decisiveness marching up into english territory hed got his backwoodsmen and halftrained militiamen a victory even he thought improbable against braddocks professionals now he wanted to rest on his laurels he wanted to yes but he feared that if he tried he soon would have no laurels to rest on maybe hed even made a mistake pausing after the battle if hed pressed on right away well he hadnt but he would now he turned back to the courier go tell the soldiers from the mother country i am advancing he said i look for their support as soon as they are able to give it oui monsieur the courier repeated back the message roland noddedhe had it right neither the man nor his horse seemed thrilled at hurrying back in the direction from which theyd come but the rider sketched a salute and rode off in the meanwhile the lieutenant said in the meanwhile we go on kersauzon said firmly we would go on even if the king of france left all his men across the sea what will you do sir if the french from francethe younger officer smiled at his circumlocutionhave an officer with them who wants to take command the way general braddock took command for england spit in his eye roland thought but he couldnt say that if there was such an officer it would surely get back to him and so roland was circumspect for once in his life i will point out to him that i am more familiar with local conditions than he is likely to be i will also point out that general braddocks misfortunes demonstrate how important familiarity with those conditions may prove what if he chooses not to listen the nosy lieutenant persisted what will you do then hope he has an unfortunate accident roland kersauzon couldnt say that either the theoretical officer slogging up the coast behind him would surely believe he aimed to arrange such an accidentand the usurping dog wouldnt be entirely wrong i will do the best i can roland said i will do the best he permits me to do surely he will value your experience the lieutenant said but of course roland murmured he didnt believe it even for a moment a french officer sent to atlantis would feel the same way prisoners said the english officer sent to atlantis had felt as if he were exiled from civilization and it might be true an officer whod disgraced himself at the court might well suddenly find himself carried across the sundering sea to do what he could for a country that didnt care to look him in the eye any more now roland had to do things quickly and do them right before the hypothetical officer could take charge and make a mess of whatever he touched he swore at himself for all the delays hed tolerated well hed tolerate them no more cant you move faster you lazy lugs he shouted what are you waiting for are your feet stuck in the mud theyd better not be by god one of the soldiers grumbled that roland had some part of himself stuck somewhere else he was not talking about feet or mud roland listened without rancor soldiers were going to grumble it was part of what made them soldiers as long as they grumbled while they marched kersauzon didnt mind a bit if you want us to hurry so much now why didnt you start us sooner a sergeant had the nerve to ask that to his face atlanteans who spoke english always bragged about how frank they were and how they spoke their mind to anyone no matter who and no matter when the french settlers here didnt waste their time bragging about such things they just did them and the sergeant expected an answer sighing roland gave him the straightest one he could because i didnt know my own mind till now ah the underofficer weighed that then nodded it happens sir i kind of wish it didnt happen here though roland kersauzon sighed again i wish it didnt happen here too sergeant i hope to correct my error im sorry if that means wearing out your boots so am i the sergeant said i hope we can fix things thats all me too roland said and sighed one more time the frenchmen are coming the frenchmen are coming the frightened cry echoed through the encampment the english settlers and redcoats had made south of freetown it also echoed through the streets of freetown itself some of the townsfolk showed the confidence in the men defending them by packing whatever they could into wagons and carriages or onto the backs of horses and mules or onto their own backs and heading north at the best turn of speed they could manage blaise delivered a oneword judgment on that yellow then he asked why is a coward yellow in english not in french not in my old tongue either victor radcliff only shrugged i dont know why you might as well ask why we call a cow a cow and not a sheep because we do thats all it doesnt help the negro said reproachfully i know it doesnt victor replied im sorry and im sorry that so many of the people in freetown are sheep they dont think we can hold the enemy when one runs the rest follow and they all go baa baa baa he mimicked a sheeps bleat well what i have to say to them is bah he waited to see whether blaise would notice the difference between a bleat and a sound of contempt the negros broad smilewhich seemed all the broader because his teeth showed up so well against his dark skinsaid he did no flies on blaise by god that wasnt a saying in french either and probably also wasnt in the africans native tongue bah is right sir blaise said they is silly fools they are radcliff corrected his bodyservantturnedsergeant nodded he made fewer and fewer mistakes victor suddenly wondered if he threw one in every so often just to keep from making people suspicious that wasnt the most reassuring thought hed ever had instead of pursuing it he went on despite our losses we have more men than they do even now and still more coming in all the time yes sir blaise didnt sound impressed its true dammit victor said in some annoyance there had always been more englishmen than frenchand bretons before they finally amalgamated herein atlantis the english came to carve out farms or to fish or to take advantage of the marvelous lumber here some of the bretons fished too that seemed to be in their blood but more looked for the same kind of work most french settlers sought as overseers on the broad slavefilled estates that raised sugar and indigo and cotton and lately terranovan pipeweed that left themand the spaniards farther south stillthinner on the ground than the english were all the same blaise had good enough reason not to sound impressed numbers mattered only so much the surviving redcoats had had their confidence jolted by marching into a trap seeing their captured comrades freed on parole hadnt helped their morale either and the militiamen from the local settlements werent so eager as they had been before their first taste of battle victor hoped they wouldnt run if they had to fight again he hoped so yes but he couldnt be sure blaise found a new and unpleasant question is true sir they have real frenchmen from france now like braddock he real englishman from england i hear its true radcliff said i dont know it is for a fact but i hear it is and if it is someone in the royal navy needs a talkingto by god talkingto blaise rolled his eyes need to kick somebody in a boat kick him he mimed clutching at his crotch that would be good after a moment victor shook his head that would have been good but its too late to fret about such things now the frenchmen are here and we have to stop them if we can we do it blaise sounded confidentbut then he generally did looking around to make sure no officers from england were in earshot he added how you like command sir dont be silly victor said im not in command here that english lieutenantcolonel the earls son blaise laughed he dontdoesntknow anything but he not so dumb he know hedoesnt know anything some men they dont know anything and they dont know they dont know anything you know erright that bemused victor radcliff for a couple of reasons the negros syntax he was convinced would have bemused anybody and blaise all unknowinglywhich fit his discourse well enoughwas reproducing part of the argument from platos recounting of the apology of socrates sure enough the english officer approached victor later that afternoon i hear the french settlers are on the march he remarked he was a few years younger than victorin his early twenties probablyand with fresh features and babyfine skin looked younger still yes your excellency i hear the same victor said if at all possible we should stop their taking freetown losing it would be a black eye the young englishman said yes sir i quite agree radcliff said how do we go about doing that the lieutenantcolonel asked all too likely that theyll outnumber us the result of another standup fight would be worrisome to say the least victor nodded so it would sir im not sure about the numbershe wouldnt call the english officer wrong not to his facebut theyre bound to have the advantage of morale what what are we going to do then what can we do then raised in the traditions of continental european warfare the young lieutenantcolonel thought standup battles were the only possible way two armies could meet seeing as much victor understood better how general braddock had come to grief your excellency if i might make a suggestion no victor wasnt in command he couldnt start throwing orders around but if he could gently steer this overbred but willing youngster in the right directionhe talked for a while hoping the englishman would see reason well well the young man said at last you wouldnt see such an approach taken in france or the low countries or the germanies of that i am quite certain still and all though the socalled klephts in the balkans might attempt an undertaking of this sort victor radcliff would have had a better notion of whether the lieutenantcolonel approved or not had he ever heard of klephts before since he hadnt he made do with the question directly shall we go ahead and try it then your excellency the englishman looked quite humanly surprised i thought i said so major maybe he had but not in any language victor understood no matter though saluting victor said now its so very plain sir that even a settler can understand it the lieutenantcolonel nodded victor had bet himself a shilling that the man wouldnt notice irony and sure enoughnow he had to collect ill take it out of the frenchmens hides he thought muskets banged from bushes by the side of the road roland kersauzons horse snorted and sidestepped he brought it back under control without even noticing what he was doing keeping the horse in line was no problem keeping his army in line was proving a much harder job a couple of his soldiers were down from this latest bushwhacking one clutched his leg and swore a blue streak the other shot through the head lay still the poor fellow wouldnt rise again till judgment day a troop of french settlers plunged into the bushes after the assassins the whole army stopped which was undoubtedly what the english skulkers had in mind this wasnt the first time theyd disrupted his march or the fifth they were doing it every chance they got and why not it worked it worked much too well half an hour later the pursuerswhod gone after the bushwhackers without orders indeed against ordersreturned proudly carrying the corpse of one greenjacketed raider the wretch or his friends had managed to wound two more of them before they caught him roland wondered whether hed been dead when they did if he hadnt been theyd taken care of it immediately afterwards it did not behoove an officer to inquire too closely into some questions the only thing roland said was lets go on now on they went an hour later they came to another likely spot for an ambush roland kersauzon ordered troops into the trees that came down too close to the road before the frenchmen could get into the woods they were fired upon two of them went down neither wound seemed serious but even sothey lashed the trees with musketry then satisfied theyd done what they could they approached againand were fired upon again these miserable english wretches are like mosquitoes a lieutenant exclaimed in exasperation their bites are almost harmless but they can drive a man mad and sometimes you can sicken from the bite too roland said sadly learned doctors would have laughed at him when they talked of malaria they spoke of miasmas and fetid exhalations to him that only meant they didnt know what caused the sickness well neither did he or not exactly but he did know there had been no malaria in atlantis when his multiply greatgrandfather founded cosquer three hundred years before it came here about the same time as african slaves did and soon spread from them to whites how did it spread through the air or perhaps through mosquito bites some illnessessyphilis gonorrheaneeded contact to spread from one person to another someunfortunately including measles and smallpoxdidnt maybe malaria fell into an inbetween category or maybe you dont know what the devil youre nattering about roland thought it wouldnt have been the first time he had other more urgent things to worry about that lieutenant was worrying right along with him too how are we going to stop the english from harassing us like this monsieur he asked it was an uncomfortably good question since kersauzon had no good answer for it he picked nits instead those arent redcoats lieutenant english regulars dont know how to fight like this theyre atlanteans settlers doing the work in place of men from overseas very well sir the junior officer said how do we stop the english atlantean settlers from harassing us then he spoke with admirabletruly frenchprecision roland kersauzon wished he didnt now the commander had no excuse not to answer the questionno excuse except for his utter lack of a good response we cannot keep dancing to their measure he said at last well how do we keep from doing that he could see the question in the junior officers eyes it would have been in his eyes too if someone had tried to palm that reply off on him but the lieutenant was more polite than he likely would have been and didnt ask the question out loud eventuallyafter much too longthe french settlers did manage to drive away the bushwhackers roland hoped they did anyhow by then it was about time to encamp for the night roland ordered an early halt hoping to fortify the position well enough to make sure no one could assail it during the hours of darkness things got no better the next morning a couple of batteries of horse artillery came out of the woods to the west unlimbered and fired one quick roundshot per gun at the french settlers line of march before tearing away again some of the iron balls flew high others tore holes in the settlers files one luckless fellow tried to stop a rolling cannon ball with his foot that sent him off to the surgeons who had to cut off the shattered appendage his shrieks and those of the other wounded men set roland kersauzons teeth on edge then the french settlers came to a veritable fortress made from logs and mud cannon inside the fieldwork fired on them musketeers defended the artillerymen when rolands own field guns returned fire the mud and dirt smothered the balls impacts are we going to have to put on a regular siege with saps and parallels the way we would in europe a sergeant asked by god i hope not roland answered it wasnt even a proper siege because they hadnt surrounded the enemys work the english had no trouble supplying and reinforcing the fort somewhere south of here the regulars from france were slogging forward roland had hoped to win glory without them now he wished they would get here to lend a hand cosquer had never seemed farther away he refused to send a messenger south to ask where the regulars were if they wanted to hurry that was their business hishis had stalled he didnt care to admit it even to himself but it seemed pretty plain that he couldnt drive the englishspeaking atlanteans out of their fort he couldnt go on and leave it in his rear either all of which left him some unpalatable choices he could swing far inland the drawback being that most of what was worth having lay close by the coast or he could turn around and retreat he didnt want to do that it would only give the regulars from france the chance to mock him and take over from him the best thing he could think of was staying where he was till the regulars caught up with him he hadnt cared to do that beforehed thought he could just walk into freetown and present them with a fait accompli well it wouldnt happen now no matter how much he wished it would if you will forgive me monsieur you run a curious campaign a sergeant told him part of the time you are more cautious than you need to be the rest you attack like a madman if i think i can win i will fight roland replied if i dont i wont what is so curious about that it could be that you push too hard when you push it could also be that you dont push too hard when you dont push if you take my meaning the sergeant was not too young and not too skinny roland couldnt blight his military career outside of this expedition he had none he was bound to be a baker or a miller or a carpenter or something else respectable a solid tradesman who knew how to lead because he did it every day and if he felt like speaking his mind he would go ahead and do it roland did him the courtesy of taking him seriously maybe youre right i cant prove youre not but even if you are wouldnt you rather have a commander like me than one who doesnt push when he should hmm the sergeant considered that as carefully as he would have considered an offer for an upholstered chair well youve got something there sirno doubt about it how much youve gotwell just have to see they arent coming sir the scout reported damnation victor radcliff said feelingly sorry sir the rider said they pulled back out of range of our earthworks and theyre strengthening a position of their own oh too bad victor said hed hoped to lead the invaders into temptation and then trap them the way theyd trapped braddock and the redcoats the french settlers commander had seemed so intrepid why wasnt he intrepid enough to stick his head in the noose i thought wed poked and prodded them enough so theyd do something stupid too the scout said guess i was wrong though that the scout was wrong was one thing that victor radcliff turned out to be wrong was something else again it had much more important consequences he drummed his fingers on his thigh he must be waiting for the french regulars to come up then hell burst out of his fieldworks like an abscess and infect the whole damned countryside the scout pulled a face youve got a gift for the revolting phrase dont youuh sir the polite addition was plainly an afterthought may the frenchies do him as much good as braddock did us naughty naughty victors reproof was also insincere king george did everything he knew how to do for us did everything he knew how to do to us dont you mean the scout said when major radcliff declined to rise to the bait what went through his mind was amazing how i think like a fisherman even though my line hasnt gone to sea for a while the man sighed and tried a new tack and again well if the froggy buggers wont come out and play what do we do then have to think about that victor answered have to talk with the senior english officer too oh yes sir charlie a lot hell know by his accent the scout was a new hastings man and so especially likely to look down his nose at officials from the mother country by his sarcastic tone and by his casual use of the lieutenantcolonels given name he lived up toor down toall the things people said about new hastings men grinning radcliff made as if to push him away go on be off with you he said for all the world as if he were an irishman himself blaise had been quietly standing not far away sometimes people called him major radcliffs shadow he wasnt quite black enough to fill that role but he came close the scout hadnt hesitated to speak in his presence nobody did not any more what will you do he asked victor what i said id do victor replied ill talk to the lieutenantcolonel and well decide together and if you dont like his ideas victor shrugged hes senior to mebut i may be able to get around that i hope so sir blaise said oh there are ways victor didnt go into detail he didnt know what the details were not yet but he knew there would be ways if you were determined enough you could always find them when he approached the young english lieutenantcolonel dont think of him as charlie or else youll call him that and then the sky will fall victor told himself that worthy said as i see things major we have two choices we can wait for the french regulars to join the settlers and then receive them on ground of our choosing or we can try to defeat the settlers before the regulars arrive the disadvantage being that we should have to move against their fortified position does that seem to you an accurate summation those are two things we can do certainly sir radcliff replied i can think of others that might serve us better can you indeed the english officer raised an elegant eyebrow hed have a title of nobility one day if he didnt already would you be so good as to expatiate on them as to what victor wondered he was damned if hed inquire though and he thought he knew what the englishman had to mean we could send a raiding party into french territory by land through the backwoods he said that way wed make the enemy dance to our tune instead of dancing to theirs and who would command such a party the lieutenantcolonel asked you if you like sir victor said i have done a lot of exploring in the interior i know i could find plenty of men who wouldnt starve in the woods very well thats one thing the englishman said you told me there were others so i presume you have at least one more in mind i do sir victor radcliff agreed we could take boats and land down the coast in french territory do our raiding and then either come back the way we went or go into the interior depending on which seemed best the english officer studied him again i presume you would command this mission im suited for it i dont know anyone who has a better chance of making it work victor said which would you do if you had the choice i believe id go in by land sir victor said that way we start giving the enemy a hard time all the sooner you wouldnt take so large a party as to hurt our chances of defending against the french here oh heavens no sir we couldnt victual that kind of party anyhow victor said a relative handful of men moving swiftly and raising havocthats what ive got in mind i see the lieutenantcolonel nodded well why dont you recruit such a party and set it in motion i think you will do the french some harm with it and i also suspect you wont be sorry to have me out of your hair he gave the atlantean a crooked grin victor radcliff grinned back that cuts both ways unless im sadly mistaken you wont be sorry im not nagging you any more who me the english officer gave back a look of exaggerated innocence ah if only we were on the same side they both laughed radcliff stuck out his hand the lieutenantcolonel took it what began as a clasp ended up a trial of strength they were still laughing when they broke it off neither sure who had won or if anybody had whatever roland kersauzon had been expecting in a french general louisjoseph marquis de montcalmgozon wasnt it he had fair curly hair blue eyes a cupidsbow mouth and the beginnings of a double chin he also had an illustrious pedigree on both sides of his family with shortcomings like those roland should have hated him on sight he should have but he didnt despite the marquis failings of appearance and birth two things were plain he was an honest man if he werent he wouldnt have been a soldier and he wouldnt have let himself get sent to atlantis and he was a soldier all the way down to the tips of his elegantly manicured fingers you did well to beat them once he told roland pitting raw troops against regulars is a dangerous business but you got by with it now there are regulars on your side as well we should take advantage of it oui monsieur was all roland could manage as if he were a raw recruit himself a general from the mother country who actually wanted to fight no roland hadnt expected that oh braddock had wanted to fight but hed made a hash of it kersauzon didnt think this much younger frenchman would wed better win soon montcalmgozon added if we dont i doubt we shall win later the trouble we had getting men across the sea oncei doubt well try it again if we do i doubt well succeed the english are alert now they have more ships than we do and better sailors they can bring more soldiers to atlantis any time they choose we are not so lucky they have more settlers too roland said it seems strange and most unfair france is a larger country than england but england has more ships and more folk who want to live here where is the justice in that i ask you france is more sufficient unto herself than england said the general from the mother country england needs to draw more things from the sea and from across the sea and her poor peasants come here or go to terranova to find something better than they have at home try to convince a french peasant that there is anything better than what he has at home he will laugh in your face for your trouble it is a pity roland said many things are montcalmgozon agreed nowi understand a fieldwork ahead troubles your line of advance i should like to go forward with you and reconnoiter if you dont mind but of course monsieur to say anything else would have left kersauzon open to an imputation of cowardice may i offer one suggestion first i would be delighted to hear it put on the habiliments of a common soldier drawing attention to yourself without reason is the height of foolishness and some of the riflemen in this fort can hit a target at a startling range the marquis frowned i mislike doing such a thing after all i am who i am do you intend to do the same i do it is not lack of courage that provokes me monsieur but i do not care to entrust the campaign to my secondincommand if you feel otherwisewell in that case you will do as you please they approached the makeshift earthwork in ordinary clothes louisjoseph proved a fine horseman roland might have known he would the nobleman eyed the countryside with keen interest such curious plants my botanical friends in paris would be most intrigued i believe it your excellency roland replied i have heard that the natural productions of terranova are more like europes than are those of atlantis i have heard the same montcalmgozon said i believed it before i came here now i am convinced of it i wonder why it should be so terranova is farther from europe than atlantis is roland said the marquis shrugged you ask the wrong man perhaps the savants i mentioned might find an explanation for you me myself however no i regret to say i am but a simple soldier a soldier he was indubitably simple roland kersauzon smiled to himself hed heard men mock themselves before he knew the peril of taking one of them seriously when he did montcalmgozon would have ridden right up to the fort if a musketeer inside hadnt fired a warning shot in his direction that was only a smoothbore piece and didnt come particularly close it did say the greencoated men inside would pay more attention if the french officers didnt desist well sited well made montcalmgozon murmured more than half to himself yes i can see that it would be an obstacle how do we get aroundor get through roland asked they seem light on artillery the french general replied if we cannonade them it could be that soldiers might break in under cover of the bombardment it seems to me worth a try in any case my own artillery train is considerably more extensive than yours lets prepare then roland kersauzon was glad french regulars would share the butchers bill with his men it would be high if things went wrong he caught motion from the corner of his eye a messenger i wonder what he wants he didnt wonder long the man delivered his news in a staccato burst the damned english have sent a raiding partyor maybe an armyover the border to the west they are stealing and burning and committing god only knows what other outrages besides roland swore so did montcalmgozon expecting the english to sit around waiting for trouble would not do they wanted to go out and cause it instead now locals and regulars had to figure out what to do about that xx w ar was wicked and evil and woeful so the good book insisted war brought pain and misery and suffering so anyone with an eye to see could tell war ruined hopes and buried young men and sent years of patient toil up in smoke and when everything that went up in smoke belonged to the enemy when he hurt and was miserable and suffered war could be a devil of a lot of fun so victor radcliff discovered as his band of brigands swooped down on one plantation after another no border guards tried to keep them out of the french settlements in atlantis maybe there were guards farther east but not where he broke in it wasnt far from the place where he and blaise and the two copperskins from terranova had escaped the untender welcome of the french settlers victor wondered what had happened to the frenchmen whod been here then they were probably with the army south of freetown your old master anywhere around here he asked blaise the negro shook his head no sir farther south were far enough south already too far by god a raider said wiping sweat from his face with his sleeve by his accent he came from croydon or one of the other towns north of hanover no he wouldnt be used to weather like this especially not in november ferns here sprouted from the sides of stone fencessometimes from the sides of stone buildings barrel trees grew in abundant profusion lizards as long as a mans leg scurried through the undergrowth some of the snakes were big enough to eat men and victor asked are there crocodiles in the rivers down where you were oh yes blaise nodded matteroffactly but crocodiles in africa too be careful mostly no trouble mostly the man who came from somewhere near croydon didnt sound reassured life is life blaise said with a shrug mostly no trouble as good as it gets the french now they has mostly got trouble his grammar stumbledon purposebut he wasnt wrong barns and plantation houses went up in flames the raiders hadnt come to set black and copperskinned slaves free but they didnt stop them from plundering and taking off for the north why do you do this an old woman asked victor as a stately home where her family might have lived for generations burned to the ground have i ever done anything to you monsieur he bowed by no means but an army of french settlersand by now i daresay french regulars as wellhas invaded lands that belong to my king and my countrymen shall we let them get by with that without repaying it where and as we can go fight these other soldiers then they have wronged you it could be i have done you no harm the old woman started to cry ruins everything ruins victor didnt know whether the redcoats and english settlers below freetown were strong enough to fight the french straight up he knew the force he commanded wasnt strong enough to do anything of the sort but he knew some other things too if we make your settlements howl he said your generals will have to leave the land they invaded and come back to defend their own what good does that do me the woman howled as the roof on the house collapsed in a shower of sparks it did her no good at all as victor knew but that wasnt his worry he aimed to make all the french settlements howl the way she did with the small force at his disposal that might have been more than he could reasonably expect to do if you thought small though you wouldnt end up with much march on he shouted to his men and march they did some of the plantations had young women on them as well as or instead of old ones some unfortunate things happenedthe young women would surely have agreed victor tried a couple of soldiers at drumhead courtsmartial and hanged them when they were convicted afterwards those kinds of outrages stoppedor if they didnt the offenders got more careful as blaise said mostly no trouble was about as much as you could hope for why you slay them the negro asked they hurt enemy too rape is a crime even when a soldier does it radcliff said you think the french they dont fuck english women with a limited vocabulary blaise could be very blunt they probably do victor answered with a sigh but if they get caught french officers will punish them they use the same laws of war we do laws of war as before when he heard that phrase blaise was bemused you white people plenty smart but sometimes i think you crazy too maybe we are but if were all crazy the same way it evens out victor radcliff said some of the french were crazy in a different way crazy enough to try to fight back against half a regiments worth of men they paid for their folly victor made a point of ensuring that they wound up dead he also made a pointthough a quieter oneof looking the other way when his men took their women in among the trees maybe you not so crazy after all blaise remarked maybe not victor said with a sigh or maybe the extent to which i am a beast marks the extent to which i am a sane man the negro frowned dont understand that dont trouble your head about it radcliff set a hand on his shoulder im not sure i understand it either im not sure i want to understand it his raiders pushed east and south in the direction of the ocean he didnt expect to wash his hands in the atlantic pretty soon the french would scrape together enough militiamen to bar his way the farther east the english went the more towns and villages they ran into and towns and villages had lots of men in them men with muskets hastily pressed into service didnt make the best soldiers but victor was uneasily aware his own men had been amateurs not long before if you lived through a couple of skirmishes you got an idea of what needed doing again blaise had his own idea of what needed doing should say all niggers here free msieu victor copperskins too you get more fighters and the french settlers they cant do a thing without those people he was bound to be right about that slowly victor said i have no orders to do any such thing why you need orders blaise demanded if we win this war i think england will take away the french settlements in atlantis victor said maybe the spanish settlements too and so blaise cared nothing for that most niggers and copperskins are free in english lands now slavery makes no money up in the north the crops wont support it victor replied things are different here how can you raise cotton or indigo or rice or even pipeweed without plantations how can you have plantations without slaves blaise looked at himlooked through him really we dont use money in africa maybe we lucky you put money ahead of free if all the slaves down here are suddenly freed everyone in these parts is liable to starve negroes and terranovans and whites alike victor said pay people to work the farms blaise said they do it i bet it could be victor admitted say it is then everybody free blaise exclaimed maybe or maybe everyone is free to starve paying workers costs more than keeping slaves if there is no profit the plantations go to ruin victor said blaise was a shrewd man no two ways about it make people who buy from them pay more he said and all the plantations in terranova will undersell us so we go to the dogs just the same they grow cotton and rice and indigo in india too and i hear they will grow pipeweed there soon radcliff said i hear about terranova blaise said where is this india place beyond terranova and an oceanon the far side of the world more world than ever i think the negro said terranova yes i hear some about itcopperskins talk you know they use slaves in this india place i have no idea victor radcliff had never worried about it all he knew about india was that it was supposed to be rich and it had tigers and elephants hed seen a tiger once in a zoological garden some highminded cousin had set up in hanover it looked hungry it looked angry too prowling its toosmall cage and lashing its tail but blaise persisted if they dont use slaves how you say we need slaves all i said was i dont have the authority to free slaves victor answered politicians have to do that sort of thing soldiers cant i can tell slaves to run offthats a measure of war freeing them is more than i can do i have reason the first time blaise said which showed he still knew more french than english white people are crazy despite cold rain and mud french regulars marched in perfectly dressed ranks and columns just like english redcoats and as the french settlers had maneuvered the redcoats into a trap so the english settlers tried to return the disfavor their fort had fallen but they sniped at the french from whatever cover they could find and they refused to fight fixed battles what ridiculous excuse for warfare is this montcalmgozon demanded indignantly it is what i warned you to expect roland kersauzon replied they fear your men would win in any standup fight as we would the commander from the mother country broke in oh no doubt monsieur roland said politely he didnt want to argue with the nobleman that didnt necessarily mean he thought montcalmgozon was right his settlers had shocked the english redcoats maybe the english settlers could do the same to french regulars as i said before this is curious country montcalmgozon remarked where it is settled it seems european enough where people do not dwell though the plants and animals are quite different now and then you will see a familiar tree or bush or animal living amongst the native oddities but only now and then in my grandfathers day i am told you would never have seen such a thing settlements then were smaller and stuck closer to the coast roland said since those days we have brought in more plants and animals that suit us deer and foxes roam the forests now rats and mice infest our homes and barns cats hunt themand whatever else they can find dogs run wild too so do chickens and our ducks and terranovan turkeys so you believe the native productions will vanish montcalmgozon asked a pity to see sameness imposed on the world i am i hope a modern man your excellency kersauzon said if that which comes from europe or from terranova serves our needs better than atlantis native productions why should we not have it in the early days here men feared to go outdoors because redcrested eagles might slam into them from behind and chew at their kidneys as the vulture chewed at prometheus liver now those flying monsters are few and far between and i confess i miss them not a pin he remembered how horrified hed been when an eagle attacked one of his settlers once lions hunted in greece not so long ago wolves prowled everywhere in france montcalmgozon said now the lions are gone the wolves grown scarce i agree this is better but will the innocuous go by the wayside along with the dangerous that i believe would be unfortunate it could be so roland said will you eat beef or mutton at supper tonight either will do the frenchman replied why do you ask the cattle and sheep are imports too so are the horses we ride roland said as you observed they are useful before montcalmgozon could go on several muskets barked from themostly nativewoods a french regular yelled a profane lieutenant ordered a troop of men to go after the ambushers and not to come back without the degenerates tripes on their bayonets the soldiers charged in amongst the trees they wont catch them roland predicted mournfully and why are you so sure they are excellent men the marquis said they are excellent men standing in a battle line and beating down another battle line roland kersauzon answered unless some of them were poachers or robbers before they put on the uniform what do they know about chasing woodsmen through the forest montcalmgozon only shrugged what do these atlantean rats know about getting chased by frenchmen they knew enough to get away the regulars came out of the woods without any enemy soldiers alive or dead in their grasp and with hangdog expressions on their faces their worst casualty was a sprained ankle two of them supported the man who proved to have tripped over a root the injured soldier went into a casualty wagon along with the regulars the english settlers had shot the interrupted march resumed not a good business montcalmgozon grumbled certainly not monsieur roland could hardly disagree with that adding i told you so would have been rude a slightly superior manner conveyed the message just as well they were both french after all another rider came up with more news of devastation from the south montcalmgozon heard him out stonyfaced roland tried to match the nobles dispassion but it wasnt easy to the man from across the sea the plantations destroyed and the people killed or dispossessed were only pieces on the board to roland the estates belonged to kinsmen and friends and acquaintances the losses were personal it could be your excellency that i might have to detach my native soldiers to pursue this marauding salaud of a radcliff he said that would disturb the primary goal of this campaign which is to seize freetown montcalmgozon said with a frown ensuring that the french settlements in atlantis are not destroyed is also an important goal nestce pas kersauzon returned feh the french general raised a hand the english attempt a nuisance raid nothing more if we weaken our striking force to contain them we play into their hands he had a point and roland knew it nevertheless he quoted matthew for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul montcalmgozon aimed an unfriendly look his way i have to think of this struggle as part of one that goes on all over the world we fight england in europe and in india and in terranova as well as on these shores france fights england all over the world roland kersauzon said i fight england here i have to think of what is best and what is worst for the french settlements in atlantis what is best for them is what is best for france the marquis insisted not necessarily roland replied now they aimed glares at each other montcalmgozon looked ready to aim a pistol at roland as well the atlantean did not want to fight the french commander and not only because he had no idea what would happen in a duel even if he won a duel against montcalmgozon he lost so it seemed to him at any rate in icy tones montcalmgozon said you had better explain yourself if we take freetown you win a grand and glorious victory for france kersauzon said then very likely you and your regulars sail away if the english destroy everything weve built up farther south what good does your grand and glorious victory do us they cannot the french nobleman said but with an uncertain edge to his voice if my soldiers accompany yours marching away from the enemy invasion what the devil will stop them roland asked you are a difficult man only to my enemiesmonsieur roland bowed in the saddle will half your men suffice to deal with these raiders montcalmgozon inquired after a sour sigh they spent the next twenty minutes haggling as if roland were trying to squeeze a few extra sous from the nobleman at the fish market montcalmgozon finally consented to let roland have twothirds of the soldiers he thought his by right anyway kersauzon wanted morehe wanted all of them but he took as many men as he could without pistols at dawn as you got older you learned that sometimes you had to be satisfied with less than everything you wanted from life rolands men burst into cheers when he told them that most of them would be heading south they knew as much as he did about what was going on down thererumors spread like wildfire he wondered how long it would have been before they started deserting not very unless he didnt know them he said nothing to montcalmgozon about the cheers the young marquis wasnt deaf he could hear them and draw his own conclusions what those conclusions were he didnt discuss with roland and kersauzon didnt ask him either messages took their own sweet time traveling from the english and local forces in front of freetown and victor radcliffs raiders he was on his own down in the french settlements by the time he got news and reacted to it it was badly out of date and so he didnt worrytoo muchwhen he heard that the locals and redcoats had fallen back into freetown what good did worry do the english lieutenantcolonel in charge of the defense had energy remembering another of victors suggestions he sent a schooner full of menmostly atlanteansdown the coast to land behind the french force and waylay the supply wagons coming up to it for a little while his letters boasted of the havoc that little band was wreaking a fine piratical band he called them perhaps not knowing that victors branch of the broad and spreading radcliffe tree found nothing fine in piracy then the english officers tone changed i have not heard from the men sent south for some little while he wrote and fear they may have suffered a misfortune god grant i be wrong further despatches showed only too clearly that he wasnt wrong something final had happened to the raiders victor did worry about them though he led far more men than the english officer had committed to the secondary raid they shouldnt have been snuffed out like that he told blaise they were too large a band to be extinguished like a candle with a brass lid over it maybe they run into more men the negro said maybe more men run into they them radcliff corrected absently but with all the french fighting men up near freetown his voice trailed off what you thinking blaise asked victor didnt like any of what he was thinking he heard what the french were doing up in english territory of course the enemy would hear what he was doing farther south in atlantis and this was their native land just as the english settlements had spawned his raiders if roland kersauzon decided not to sit back and let victors men ravage plantations down hereif marching south hed brushed aside that schooners worth of harassers im thinking we may have more difficulties ahead of us than i looked for a little while ago victor answered blaise frowned what you say from a man whod made his first acquaintance with the english language not long before the question was reasonable french soldiers may be moving against us forced to simplify his own thoughts victor got a lot into a few words ah blaise understood him this time what we do good question radcliff replied he wished he had a good answer simple or complex he gave the truth as best he could see it i dont know yet have to find out how many frenchmen are moving can we fight them do we have to run what then war here harder than war in africa blaise said more things to think on of course were civilized was victor radcliffs first smug thought but how civilized was war no matter how you fought it not very not so far as he could see well do the best we can thats all he said they went on at the first plantation where the locals didnt flee fast enough he stole horses to add to the handful he already had he sent riders out ahead of his main body to make sure no suddenly returning french settlers surprised him all the scouts he chose spoke fluent french they couldand wouldclaim they were refugees if anybody wondered what they were doing riding around the countryside one of them winked at him before setting out if i find me a tavernkeepers pretty little daughter i may settle down right where i do the man said in that case youll never see me again a military commander of the officialand officioussort would have thrown a fit victor only laughed and said do as you please herbert but if we find the tavern youd best believe well burn it down god curse you english dogs to the most fiery pits of hell herbert said hotlyhis french was fluent indeed victor radcliff laughed again slapped him on the back and sent him on his way in the back country roads had been narrow rutted tracks through the trees some of them probably started as honker trails victor knew that was so here and there in the english settlements as his men pushed into more settled terrain the roads got wider the trees were cut back from either side the ruts remained if anything they got deeper and muddier from greater use parrots with yellow and orange faces squawked at the advancing settlers blaise said parrots in africa too these not just like but close make me think of home across sea more of them here than farther north though they come up there too victor said cest curieux blaise remarked and then remembering his english strange yes strange so many things here there not same but parrots in this place and in that place he smiled coming up with the right word in both places why well there are parrots in terranova too victor radcliff said especially in the hot southern parts maybe that has something to do with it and maybe it doesnt he thought europe and northern terranova shared many plants and animals or had similar forms where nothing remotely like them existed in atlantis natural philosophers had spilled barrels of ink trying to explain why as far as victor knew none of them had come close to a satisfactory solution if they couldnt agree about why so much of atlantis flora and fauna was so peculiar he wasnt likely to find the answer on his own he wasnt even likely to worry about it very long a couple of muskets boomed up ahead a high shrill shout rose les anglais the farm the french settlers fought to hold wouldnt have been worth burning if they hadnt defended it but the families and friends who did their best to drive away the marauders couldnt have understood that they battled with grim determination from farmhouses and outbuildings and would neither retreat nor give up cochons one of them yelled from a barn this is our patrimony you will not take it from us no matter how fierce and stubborn they were they had about as much chance of beating radcliffs men as a fiveyearold sent into the ring against a champion prizefighter a rifleman picked off the french farmers one after another from a furlong away less accurate musket fire made them keep their heads down raiders worked their way forward and torched building after building fire drove out some of the french settlers others grimly died in the flames the defenders wounded a handful of men they delayed the english advance by less than an hour smelling the stink of charred flesh victor shook his head not worth it he said brave but not worth it run is better blaise agreed things justthings he gestured run get more things when more time go later victor gave him another new word he also sent him a quizzical look so running is better eh youre not a brave man eh you could have fooled me brave when i have to brave if i have to the negro replied if i no have to i run brave again later maybe his sly smile said he was showing off the new vocabulary on purpose a redcoat or one of the french regulars would call you a coward for talk like that victor radcliff said blaise only shrugged dont care live coward fix things dead brave fool he pointed toward the burning houses and outbuildings indeed victor said blaise raised a questioning eyebrow i should say so victor exclaimed blaise noddedhe got that victor fought to hide a grin the negro sergeant was too dark and too lean to make a proper falstaff himself but he would have enjoyed drinking with him they were both a particular kind of practical man victor hadnt tried talking with blaise about falstaff and not just because of the clowns views about honor he would have had to quote shakespeare to have it make sense to blaise and even then it wouldnt have made sense to him shakespeare had written only two lifetimes earlier but english wasnt the same now as it had been then in africa victor said suddenly when old men talk about how their grandfathers talked and about how their grandsons talk do they notice any difference after some thought blaise answered they say young boys have not enough he frowned looking for a word like slave for master he offered respect radcliff suggested thank you sir respect yes they say young boys have not respect for old like in their day old men had been saying things like that since adam started complaining about cain and abel it wasnt what victor meant do they say the words now are different from the way they were in the old days i no hear that i never hear that blaise shook his head oh well victor shrugged he wondered how much french had changed since shakespeares day that might be an interesting question to ask roland kersauzonif the two of them werent otherwise occupied trying to blow each others heads off right now that seemed unlikely roland swept out his right arm there is another band of the accursed english brigands hunt them down baying like wolves his soldiers swarmed after the fleeing men from the english settlements the phrase occurred to roland even though hed never seen or heard a wolf so many of the stories that came from france featured them he could picture them plainly bigger than dogs shaped like foxes but gray and ferocious a few of the men whod come south to disrupt the french armys supply lines still showed fight most of them though wanted no more than to get away with their lives theyd had a high old time shooting teamsters and plundering wagons they hadnt come down here to fight when the numbers werent all in their favor but when kersauzon detached his settlers from montcalmgozons regulars they had no trouble overwhelming the company or so of men kicking up trouble along the coast muskets bellowed puffs of gray smoke marked where shooters stood that familiar sulfurous smell made roland smile but he wished gunpowder didnt so clearly point out every man who fired if anyone ever devised a powder that didnt smoke he would win a great advantage in war in the meantime his men and the enemy used what they had the english settlers fought from cover instead of standing in a neat line till they got shot down that didnt change the result but did make things take longer rolands men were settlers too they advanced by little skittering rushes some of them fired to keep the english busy while the others moved up at close quarters it came to bayonets and swords and hatchets and knives and fists and teeth only a handful of english settlers surrendered cursed raiders they might be but they had courage you arent supposed to be here you damned nuisance a wounded prisoner told kersauzon that is the best place to be where you are not supposed to the french commander replied your friends thought so oui well what if we did the prisoner said jesus this leg hurts nobody ever went and shot me before quelle dommage roland said as if he meant it what will you do now the captive asked go on and give your other band of raiders the larger one the same kind of surprise we just gave you if god grants that that be possible roland answered frankly why not the prisoner wasnt going to escape steal a horse and gallop off to tell victor radcliff an army was coming after him such things happened in romances but not in life what will you do with me the man inquired maybe hed meant that all along give you to the surgeons of course kersauzon said we are not barbarians to torment you for the sport of it we are french you are english we are all civilized men is it not so boy i hope it is the enemy muttered apprehensively he went on what do you think the surgeons will do remove the musket ball unless they decide it is better left alone this happens sometimes but not often remove it easy for you to say its not your leg will they give me whiskey to drink and a bullet to bite on we use rum and a leather strap roland said rum will do the english settler said eagerly he didnt compare the effectiveness of the bullet and the strap rum you shall have kersauzon promised he gestured to the prisoners guards take him away away the man went wounded french settlers were already howling under the surgeons ministrations roland couldnt distinguish the prisoners cries of torment from those of his own troops wounded men all made the same noises roland wished he wouldnt have had to waste time dealing with the seaborne raiders they were only a nuisancethough montcalmgozon whose supply of victuals theyd interrupted probably would have expressed a different view roland didnt care about the fancy french noblemans opinions here neither did the men who followed him they knew too well what victor radcliffs bandits were doing to the property and persons of people who mattered to them they aimed to stop the bandits as soon as they could he wondered whether had he loosed his men as raiders they could have wreaked as much havoc on the english settlements as the enemy was doing down here regretfully he decided it was unlikely up in englishheld territory farms were smaller villages were more common and people lived closer to one another the english had a better chance of mustering a scratch force that could slow up raidersand raiders who had to slow up were raiders in trouble none of the anguished messages coming out of the southwest made him think the english settlers had had to slow down much if they wanted to they could probably go all the way down into the subtropical settlements that belonged to the king of spain kersauzon blinked if the english did invade the spanish settlements what should he do about it spain and france were allied against england in the european war they were allies here tooin theory but roland would have been most affrontedwhich was putting it mildlyhad spanish soldiers entered the french settlements no doubt the spanish authorities assuming they woke up from their long long siestas would be just as unhappy about french settlers fighting on their steaming soil and yet the spaniards were probably even thinner on the ground than the french victor radcliff brigands could do a lot of damage down there who would stop them anybody a messenger roland shouted he had paper and ink and a quill with him at all times the responsibility that went with command he was already writing when a young horseman came up and waited expectantly what do you need monsieur the rider asked take a letter to his excellency don jose valverde the governorgeneral of spanish atlantis in gernika you also need to know what it says in case it should be damaged i am asking don jose for permission to follow the english raiders into his territory if they go that way i have no designs against spanish atlantis i aim only to destroy the raiders give me that back if you would be so kind after several tries the messenger had it straight roland sealed the letter sealing wax being another essential for a man of his position and handed it to him sketching a salute the youngster rode off to the south gernika roland thought hed never been there himself he didnt want to deal with the spaniards under these circumstances what you wanted though and what you got xxi e ven the trees down here were strange some barrel trees dwarfed barrelsand men others had round trunks full of sweet sap victor radcliff had already enjoyed the rumlike drink the french and especially the spaniards brewed from it conifers were different too in floral wreaths cypress meant mourning here in southern atlantis cypresses just grew locals used the timber in their buildings even if it wasnt as good as pine or redwood the farther south victor and his men went the more mossy beards hung from cypress branches and the more snakes lurked in the trees and in the undergrowth one of the raiders was bitten he died in short order despite having the wound cauterized and being given all the rum he could drink to keep his heart strong some of the snakes had rattles at the ends of their tails like many of the venomous serpents victor knew farther north again like those farther north some shook their tails before striking but had no rattles to warn their victims and some simply skulked and struck some were probably harmless but after the death victors followers werent inclined to take chances if it slithered and they saw it it died do they have poisonous snakes in africa too radcliff asked blaise oh yes here you dont have the negro used a word in his own language he drew a picture of the kind of snake he had in mind in the dirt he used a twig with a confidence a lot of sketch artists might have envied that broad flare behind the head that must be a cobra victor said they also have them in india i believe people there tame them and teach them to dance to music you see this you know it is so blaise asked wellno victor admitted then it is a lie i bet blaise sounded very sure of himself he was willingno eagerto explain why too mess with these uh cobras you have to be mad crazy crayzee he liked the sound of that word i wont tell you youre wrong victor radcliff said it seems crazy to me too but people do crazy things sometimes you crayzee with cobra snakes you are not crayzee long blaise spoke with great conviction radcliff suspected he knew what he was talking about anybody who spent too much time fooling around with venomous serpents of any kind was taking his life in his own handsand its fangs his scouts reported that the french settlers were moving against his men from the northeast as hed suspected they might they had more men than he did he was sure of that since he didnt think he could meet them on even terms he saw only two choices he could try to ambush them or he could avoid meeting them at all had they been the regulars from france he would have tried an ambush one had worked against braddocks redcoats another might well work here but not against other settlers they knew the tricks of the trade as well as victors men since this was their country they probably knew them better avoid then down the tracks that led south toward the spanish settlements he went those tracks were truly wretched most of the real roads in the french settlements ran from east to west from the seacoast to the interior the same was also true in the english settlements but to a smaller degree with far more people starting to crowd a similar amount of land the northern settlements needed and had a real road network now the english settlers plundered more thoroughly and didnt burn till after theyd robbed theyd eaten up the supplies theyd brought with them and were living off the countryside radcliff had known that would happen it worried him all the same what do we do if they burn in front of us blaise asked one hot sweaty afternoon it was early spring but it felt like what would have been high summer in new hastings or hanover blaise had unerringly put his finger on victors greatest fear we starve the commander answered ah maybe blaise hadnt expected anything that blunt on the other hand maybe he had he showed only what he wanted to show the french settlers didnt burn their own homes and plantations to keep victors force from moving forward maybe they didnt think of it or maybe they were simply less ruthless than radcliff and his colored sergeant if they were he wanted to make them pay for it he discovered hed left french atlantis and entered spanish atlantis when the lordlet whose house hed just burned cursed him in most impure castilianactually in the hissing andalusian dialect more commonly used here and in terranova victor surprised the hidalgo by returning the uncompliments in the same language why do you do these things to me the spaniard cried looking disconsolately from the english settlers running off his livestock to his house going up in flames our kings are at war victor answered with a shrug you are one of the settlers from the north the spaniard said i thought you had no king england has a king just as spain has a king victor replied if the king of england wars against the king of spain that makes the two of us enemies the english settlements in atlantis victor reflected remembered their loyalty to king george only when england warred against france or spain the rest of the time the settlers were more inclined to complain about how england didnt want them making things on their own or trading with other realms instead of buying from the mother country none of that mattered a farthing to the spaniard he saw his property burning and being stolen you offered no resistance radcliff told him we spare your life because you didnt you can rebuild you can start over the spaniard bowed which didnt hide the hatred smoldering in his eyes i hope you do not put yourself out too much senor with this generous favor you grant me he said if ever we meet again maybe i will do the same for youbut it would not be wise to count on such a thing then i wont victor touched a finger to the brim of his hat hasta la vista senor and we shall see who does what to whom if we should run across each other again whoever sees the other man first will do it the spaniard said which struck victor radcliff as all too likely roland kersauzon had heard that englishmen complained frenchmen moved too slowly to suit them he thought the english settlers were jittery fools frenchmen moved at just the proper pace as anyone but a fool could see but to him the spaniards seemed to have inbred with the fistsized snails that gnawed on ferns and barrel trees down here in the south the snails were excellent with garlic butter their speed howeverand that of his excellency don jose valverde of spanish atlantisleft something to be desired why does he not answer kersauzon grumbled to anyone who would listenand to people who got sick of listening god only knew what horrors the english settlers were wreaking on spanish atlantis well actually that wasnt quite true roland had a pretty good notion the same kinds of horrors theyd inflicted on french atlantis and yet the spaniards promised that if he presumed to enter their territory without don joses leave they would fight him as hard as they fought the english or even harder he believed them such idiocy perfectly suited spanish notions of honor were they doing what was advantageous to them such a thought never entered their heads they were doing what a hidalgo ought to do as they saw it past that as best he could tell they didnt think at all he wished the devil would bread don jose valverde and fry him for a cutlet over the hottest fire in hell satan had to keep a special chamber or firepit in which to torment people who wouldnt answer their mail roland knew too well that he couldnt linger too much longer hard by the border of spanish atlantis keeping his army fed wouldnt be easy and pretty soon malaria and bloody fluxes and maybe even the dreaded yellow jack would break out a force the size of his needed to keep moving if it was to stay healthy especially in this miserable climate but if he went away who won victor radcliff did damn his black heart he had no compunction about roving through spanish atlantis he wandered as he pleased destroying whatever got in his way and he didnt need to wait for permission from don jose blasted valverde we ought to boot these spanish guards out of the way and do what we need to do one of rolands lieutenants said and then we would be fighting the english and the spaniards for the rest of the war kersauzon answered gloomily and the spaniards would fight us too never doubt it for a minute they understand spite they dont understand much else god knows but they understand spite after what seemed forever and was really a week later than hed hoped a horseman finally came up from gernika roland almost dragged him out of the saddle the rider presented him with a letter gorgeous with multicolored ribbons and seals when the spaniards made something official they made it official all of which mattered not two pins to roland what does the miserable thing say he demanded monsieur i have no idea the fellow replied another fellow gave it to me and said here take it on to the french commander oh was all roland said to that it sounded more deadly than an hours worth of inspired profanity he got a little satisfaction from tearing off the ribbons and cracking all the seals then he unfolded the letter some secretary must have written it the handwriting was improbably perfect the french in which it was written was also perfecteven a governor on a distant shore needed a decent command of the language of diplomacy and the letter was perfectly infuriating with all due respect to the french commander the governor of spanish atlantis wrote i am confident we shall be able to treat these english marauders as they deserve without requiring assistance from him or his men therefore while appreciating his generous offer i must decline it i of course remain his most obedient servant the fancy squiggle under the body of the letter probably came from don joses own hand what does it say monsieur the horseman asked it says that the governor of spanish atlantis is a godcursed fool thats what roland answered if he hadnt used such rough paper i would wipe my backside with it and better than it deserves too as is he tore the letter in two and let it fall to the ground with the bits of ribbon and wax then he ground the pieces under his heel and stalked away his officers exclaimed in amazement and fury when he gave them the news the spaniards couldnt catch the pox in a brothel one of them exclaimed how do they think theyll catch the english settlers and why do they think theyll beat them even if they do catch them i have no answers for this roland said sometimes observing another mans stupidity you find yourself compelled to admire it you want to watch and see exactly how it leads him to disaster this seems to me to be one of those times what do we do now the captain asked kersauzon made handwashing motions as if he were pontius pilate if don jose doesnt want our aid he wont get it i intend to leave some of our men here near the border if the english settlers come backno when they come backour soldiers can slow them down till we bring more troops to bear with the rest i aim to go north again montcalmgozon at least has the sense to know we men of french atlantis are worth something the spaniard will find out the captain said hell also find out his own men have not the value of a counterfeit sou yes i do believe he will roland kersauzon spoke with the anticipation any man might show while contemplating the discomfiture of someone he despised a slow smile spread across his face and soon too a company of spanish settlers formed a line of battle ready to stop the english invaders if they could victor radcliff didnt want to show all of his men at once for fear of making the spaniards run away he brought them forward out of the woods a few at a time after exchanging a volley or two with the enemy with roughly even numbers he could show more of his hand will you look at those oldfashioned buggers he said staring at the swarthy soldiers a couple of hundred yards away how do you mean blaise askeda handy question that fit almost any situation why their officers are wearing helmets victor answered a couple of them even have corseletsbackandbreasts armor good idea no blaise said good idea yesif youre fighting savages without guns victor said the spanish conquistadores had gone through the copperskinned natives of terranova like a dose of salts but that was a long time ago now no european armies used armor any morearmor stout enough to turn bullets was also heavy enough to slow a man down and make him uncomfortable and in this weatherif those spaniards werent stewing inside their fancy ironmongery he couldnt imagine why not he wore linen and wool and felt stuck in a pot waiting for a housewife to throw in the onions the spaniards really did encase themselves in metal his men started banging away at them without waiting to form a neat line he doubted the enemy would find that sporting but it wasnt his worry and the gunpowder smoke screened the reinforcements he ordered out of the woods the spaniards were brave they tried to advance against his musketry and didnt seem to understand why it kept getting heavier more and more of them fell they didnt break though till he sent horsemen around their flanks that did it like a lot of inexperienced troops they were as wary as so many virgins about flank attacks his men didnt pursue very far they plundered the enemy dead and did what they could for the living victor was relieved to find the english hadnt lost more than a handful of soldiers he couldnt afford heavy losses because he couldnt imagine how the english settlements would reinforce him way the devil down here way the devil down herewhen the phrase first crossed his mind it was more one of annoyance than anything else but old scratch would have felt right at home in this part of atlantis if hell wasnt like this hot steamy swampy snakeinfested place satan was missing a trick blaise had a furrow on his left arm where a bullet had grazed him he hissed when a surgeon poured rum on the wound stings dont it the surgeon said cheerfullyhis arm was fine yes blaise ground out through clenched teeth got to get it clean if i can the white man said down here a woundll fester easy as you please victor hadnt thought of that one more reason for satan to set up shop in spanish atlantis he went over to a prisoner you cant beat us you know he said in his bad spanish the captive only shrugged god was against us he said a bloody bandage covered one ear or more likely where the ear had been you can go home if you want to radcliff told him the spaniard went from dejected to suspicious in one fell swoop victor went on you can tell people not to fight us any more thats all if they dont fight we take what we want but we dont hurt people if they do fight we make them sorry even if i tell them they wont listen to me the spaniard predicted with the gloom so common in his folk they listen to our muskets they listen to our bayonets victor said a dead spaniard lay on the ground not far away hed been gutted like a trout a bayonet was the last thing hed ever heard if you are crazy enough to let me go i will say what you want me to say the prisoner said he was eyeing the dead spaniard too but i promise nothing if the fighting keeps on no tengo la culpa yes i know it wont be your fault victor said go on though you wont be the only one we turn loose to spread the word something shrewd glinted in the captives dark liquid eyes if we go you dont have to feed us you dont have to doctor us you dont have to bring us alongor kill us if we get in the way or make trouble he was right on every count victor radcliff smiled yes and so he said blandly you are an englishman but you are not a stupid englishman are you the spaniard said i hope not victor replied with a thoughtful nod the prisoner got to his feet and left the field an english settler looked back toward victor who nodded and waved for him to let the spaniard go with a shrug that might have matched the prisoners earlier one for fatalism the sentry did radcliff preached the doctrine of nonresistance to other spaniards and sent them off to the east too that done he went back to see how blaise fared the negro stood there opening and closing his fist making sure all the tendons still worked the way they were supposed to not too bad radcliff ventured no not too but nobody ever shooted me before blaises grammar still sometimes left a bit to be desired he looked down at the bandage the surgeon had given him it will make a brave scar though was that more of his eccentric english or did he mean exactly what hed said victor wasnt sure did you pay back the man who did it victor asked the negro nodded oh yes sir that him there he pointed to the gutted spaniard i am a blooded warrior again he wont argue with youthats certain sure victor agreed so blaise won his warrior stripes whenever he killed somebody victor knew of white menenglish french and spanishwho shared the same attitude his little army couldnt stay in one place very long it soon started eating the countryside bare it moved on plundering small farms and plantations the way it had all through french and spanish atlantis some of the hidalgos tried to fight back others didnt maybe the released prisoners hadnt spread the word maybe the men defending their property just didnt want to listen spaniards could be as stubborn as englishmen two days later radcliff got a new surprise his vanguard ran into spaniards coming their way the new arrivals werent soldiers but men women and children with no more than the clothes on their backs and whatever they could carry save us they shouted when they saw the english soldiers they spoke spanish of course hold fire victor yelled for the benefit of his men who didnt understand the language theyre friendly devil you say an unconvinced settler declared ignoring him victor asked the nearest spaniards why do you need us to save you because the slaves have risen up one of them cried the copperskins and the blacks they want to kill us all whats that bugger going on about at least half a dozen men who spoke only english asked the same question in almost identical words instead of answering them right away victor radcliff glanced over toward blaise the negro knew some spanish by the predatory smile on his face he knew plenty to understand that heading up through french atlantis toward the northern border and the war against the english settlements roland kersauzon was not a happy man he would gladly have sent don jose to hell or to london whichever was worse hed known about spanish arrogance before but the refusal to let him enter spanish atlantis proved he hadnt known all about it he was more than halfway back to the war hed left behind when a courier coming up from the south caught him from behind the man looked to have ridden hard for a long time he thrust a letter into rolands hand roland stared at the fancy seals and ribbons bedizening it dont tell me this is from oui monsieur the courier replied from his excellency the governor of spanish atlantis i dont know what he says i dont care what he says kersauzon growled i might like to meet him with seconds but any other way i think not do you want that then the other horseman pointed to the letter at the same time as he used his other hand to pat his blowing mounts neck want it dear god no roland said but i supposei supposeid better read it anyway he took a certain satisfaction in ripping off the ribbons and breaking the seals if he tore the paper a little toowell so what the first thing he saw when he opened the letter was that the secretary hadnt written it it was in don joses own cramped script and began general kersauzon please believe that i abase myself before you with all my heart i beg you to return to the land that previously rejected the helping hand you put forward well well roland said and then again well well here we do have something out of the ordinary what is it the courier was no less eager for news than any other mortal but roland waved him to silence he was still reading not only do the english afflict us yet don jose wrote but we are also tormented by a servile insurrection their invasion has touched off we are in danger of being murdered in our beds by those who should aid and comfort us and you must know this is a sickness which if not nipped in the bud may soon infect french atlantis as well nom dun nom kersauzon muttered and then a couple of breton obscenities he only half understood whats going on monsieur the courier asked once more the slaves in spanish atlantis have risen up roland replied which made the other man swear in turn roland went on now the spaniards want us to pull their fat from the fire are we going to do it the courier demanded and did his best to answer his own question lord knows they dont deserve it no they dont roland kersauzon sighed which doesnt mean they wont get it anyhow don jose is right about one thing damn him an uprising could easily spread from his land to ours if we kill enough slaves the rest will remember their manners pretty quick said the man whod brought the letter or if they dont we can bloody well kill them all they couldnt roland knew that perfectly well even if the courier didnt without slaves french atlantisand spanish atlantis toowould grind to a halt but they would also grind to a halt from an uprising you couldnt let slaves get away with rebellion or with thinking they were as good as their masters the whole system would fall apart if you did even once and so reluctantly kersauzon called to a bugler and said blow halt obedient but puzzledthe french settlers had been pushing hard toward the northeastthe man obeyed the soldiers werent sorry to stop soldiers were never sorry to stop from everything roland had seen some went off to take a leak others lit up pipes or cigars roland rode out in front of them my friends i am sorry to have to tell you that we must reverse our course again he said the men muttered among themselves who spilled the chamber pot into the soup this time one of them asked in spite of his own fury roland smiled that sums it up only too well mon vieux he said i learn that the slaves in spanish atlantis have risen he held up the letter to show how hed learned it the governor wants our help against themand i suppose against the english settlers who inspired the revolt and if we would rather not see an uprising in our own settlements we would do well to give him what help we can they weighed that with grave attention not many of them came from plantation families but even ordinary farmers who were doing well for themselves had a couple of negroes or copperskins to give them a hand like plantation owners they had to worry about their property absconding with itself one by one they started to nod somebody said its a damned nuisance but wed better do it once we get down there again we ought to kick that damned spaniard around the block another soldier added which brought more nods damned slaves are jumping on the spaniards when theyre down yet another man said we need to teach em they cant get away with that kind of crap with us that too produced a growing chorus of agreement you are gentlemenand it hasnt turned you into blockheads the way it has with the spaniards roland said his soldiers grinned and nudged one anotherthey liked that roland wasnt lying either he pointed back the way theyd come aboutturn mes amis we have two jobs of work to do and with luck we can do both of them at the same time had montcalmgozon or the french regulars watched the settlers reverse their course they probably would have laughed kersauzons army wasnt long on spit and polish it didnt drill constantly the way a european army did but it could fight when it had to it had already proved that as far as roland was concerned an army that could fight didnt have to look prettyand an army that looked pretty was worthless anyhow if it couldnt fight he rode past the marching men to take his place at the head of the army once more the soldiers seemed profanely determined to punish the slaves the english settlers and the spaniards for making them march and countermarch roland smiled to himself if that wasnt the right attitude for an army to have he couldnt imagine what would be victor radcliff knew less about copperskins than he wished he did far fewer had been brought to the english settlements in atlantis than to those of the french and spanish farther south meeting with the leaders of the slave revolt in spanish atlantis taught him how proud the copperskins were why shouldnt we kill all the whites one of them demanded his spanish name was martin he had another one the one hed used in the broader lands of terranova but victor couldnt begin to pronounce it martin would have to do black eyes blazing he went on they dont care if they kill us he is right even if he is a blackfoot he is right another copperskin said not all of them came from the same tribe they were as different as portuguese and germans and polesif you were a terranovan yourself europeans tended to lump them all together just as the terranovans spoke of whites without separating spaniards from frenchmen from englishmen the fellow who wasnt a blackfoot went by the name of ramon he continued give us weapons and we will make the masters howl we have not many weapons to spare victors spanish was imperfect so was the spanish the copperskins spokeand they were imperfect in different ways everybody had to back and fill and try again every so often martin scowled at him you dont want to give them to us you mean he growled his right hand folded into a fist how are you any better than these spanish putos como victor returned his blandest smile simplewere on your side what would happen if you asked the spaniards for arms reluctantly martin nodded he didnt like the point but he saw it but ramon said we dont ask no spaniards for nothing what he want from the spaniards we take por dios bueno victor said but you make them all join together against you why do you care martins grammar was better than ramons then they dont fight you so hard they still fight us victor wondered what his superiors would want him to do here his orders were to start no slave insurrectionsnot directly and he hadntnot directly but the enemy of englands enemywas a handy fellow to have around we can help you somejust not so much as you probably want anything is better than nothing martin said but more are betteram betterthan less ramon said well the ones who do fight us dont fight you victor pointed out and meaning you no disrespect we are better fighters than you are you think so do you martin was as affronted as victor would have been ifno as victor had been whengeneral braddock told him the redcoats made better soldiers than his settlers i do think so victor radcliff gave back the same kind of answer braddock might have we have better discipline and more experience he didnt talk about weapons not when they were a sore spot and he didnt impress the copperskins we has something you will never has ramon said again without much grammar but with great sincerity whats that radcliff stayed polite almost disinterested hate ramon needed no grammar to get his point across hate sends you into battle victor agreed hate without experience and discipline sends you into battleand gets you killed that also didnt have the effect he wanted so what martin said do you know what we do senor do you know what they make us do with what we do dying in battle is a relief an easier ending than most of us would find any other way it is if you lose thats certain sure victor thought spanish vengeance was proverbial up and down atlantis before he could say anything along those lines ramon added we may die but we kill too he got things right there help us kill martin said urgently thats all we want lets see what we can do victor said he gave the slaves a few muskets he gave them some bar lead and some bullet molds he got his men to cough up some of the swords and bayonets and dirks theyd taken from frenchmen and spaniards and he found that the copperskins were easily pleased what didnt look like much help to him seemed a great deal more to them they were so used to getting nothing anything at all might have been a miracle now we make the spaniards to pay ramon exulted brandishing a rapier he plainly had no idea how to use victor stepped away from him have a care with that you can hurt your friends with it not just your foes ramons gaze was measuring and which is you i dont want to be your enemy victor answered evenly if you make me your enemy you wont want that either do you understand me understand the copperskins voice was grudging but he did nod he might not like what he heard victor didnt care about that but ramon and martin needed to see that they would be fools to antagonize the englishmen who were their only friends in this sweltering land blaise had a different question for them do you lead blacks as well as terranovans or do the blacks have their own leaders ramon and martin looked at each other we have blacks in our bands martin said slowly bands with black leaders have terranovans in them too we both hate the spaniards worse than we hate each other blaise grunted victor might have done the same thing if the negro hadnt beaten him to it that was aninteresting response blacks and copperskins could work together blaise had escaped with a couple of terranovans after all but they knew they were different from each other as well as from the whites who exploited them guiding pack horses loaded down with weapons and lead the terranovans headed back to their own folk blaise muttered something in his native language victor looked a question at him the negro seemed faintly embarrassed means something like damned hardhead copperskins he said this time victor did grunt what do they say about you damned lazy mallates blaise answered without hesitation mallate is like you say nigger ive heard it before radcliff replied i wasnt sure you had oh yes i hear mallate i hear nigger blaise said cant help it if i black doesnt wash off he made as if to scrub at one arm with the palm of the other hand good when i run awayi am hard to see in woods other times he shrugged i all right where i from you all right where you from terranovans all right where they from nobody from atlantis right everybody should be all right here that sounded good atlantis might have been a place where everyone could come together in equality it might have beenbut it wasnt not yet anyhow victor radcliff wondered if it ever would be lets smash up the spaniards first he thought we can worry about everything else later xxii e veryone in french atlantis called the stuff that hung from the branches of cypresses and from the round trunks and outswept leaves of barrel trees spanish moss roland kersauzon had always taken the name for granted now approaching the frontier with spanish atlantis for the second time in a fortnight he really noticed how spanish moss grew more common the farther south he went he also noticed how deferential the spanish frontier guards were when he returned to the border they bowed they scraped as don jose had said they abased themselves before him if you had let me cross when i came here last time things would be better now roland pointed out in his deliberate spanish oh but senor things were different then said the teniente in charge of the frontier post we had orders to prevent you from entering spanish atlantis and we were honorbound to obey them no matter how idiotic they were roland said acidly yes i mean no the young teniente frowned you are doing your best to confuse things senor he sent kersauzon a reproachful stare he had a long thin spanish face a drooping mouth dark eyes and heavy black eyebrows a face god might have made expressly for reproachful stares in other words roland gave back a bland polite smile i always do my best he said which left the spaniard scratching his head but neither the teniente nor his tiny garrison did anything to hinder the french settlers who followed roland into spanish atlantis that was the point given the inefficiency with which the spaniards ran their settlements kersauzon had feared that the frontier guards wouldnt know their governor had begged him for help spaniards were indeed the kind of people who would open fire for the sake of honor regardless of whether honor and sense lay within screaming distance of each other the first copperskin the french settlers saw in spanish atlantis took one look at them then spun around and ran like a rabbit in the early days of settling atlantis there had been no rabbits any more than thered been sheep or cattle or horses there were plenty of them now maybe more than in france for they had fewer natural enemies here of course like a lot of frenchmen kersauzon was fond of lapin aux pruneauxor lapin prepared any number of other ways too should we shoot him monsieur asked a practicalbut not quite practical enoughsergeant i daresay we should have shot him roland replied he hadnt been practical enough either too late now too late it was without a doubt the terranovan had vanished into the undergrowth he knew where he was going pursuers wouldnt roland could hope he would tread on a viper in his headlong flight there were enough or rather too many of them down here in the south but that unlikelihood aside the copperskin had got away which meantwhat the fellow was bound to be a slave he was also obviously a slave not tending to his masters affairs was he a slave who was part of a band of rebels that was less obvious but it matched the way he acted would his band of rebels want to tangle with rolands french settlers unless that band was a lot bigger than kersauzon thought likely they would have to be crazy to try it then again plenty of white men were crazy why not copperskins and negroes as well where do we go now monsieur the sergeant asked roland realized he should have inquired of the snooty spanish teniente he was damned if he would turn around again even if it was only half a mile or so this time he hadnt seen any white menlet alone white womenon the road since entering spanish atlantis that had to mean the uprising was a serious businessor that the whites thought it was anyhow which might not be the same thing the sergeant deservedneededan answer kersauzon scanned the southern horizon he knew just what he was looking for the thickest smoke when he found it in the southwest he pointed we go there it turned out to be farther away than hed expected which meant the fires down there were bigger than hed thought no one seemed to be fleeing toward his army several negroes and copperskins fled from it the french settlers caught a negro the man tried to deny everything if you are as innocent as our lord why did you run from us roland asked in reasonablealmost frenchtones the black replied if you saw lots of men with guns senor wouldnt you run too not if i thought they were friends kersauzon said i thought you were ingleses the negro replied los ingleses are the friends of no one but themselves youre right about that by god roland said they will use you against the spaniards and the spaniards against you they will try to get the spaniards to fight you instead of them they dont care what happens to you as long as it helps them no doubt you are right senor the negro said but how much does it matter if you are a drowning man you grab for whatever you can get your hands on if it turns out to be a logbueno you are saved if it turns out to be a crocodileat least you dont drown crocodiles and the other toothy horrors usually called by the spanish name for lizardslagartoswere even more common in streams down here than they were in french atlantis there were hardly any near the english settlements those lay too far north for the big reptiles to stay comfortable through the winter all things considered roland would rather have drowned if a crocodile or lagarto was his other choice he also needed to ask why did you have to run from los ingleses after all they gain if you rise up against the spaniards you said it yourself senor the negro replied with dignity i am a man i am not a tool to be taken down from a shelf used and then put back slaves are nothing but tools to los ingleses if these englishhe pronounced the name properly and about as badly as kersauzon would havesaid rise up and we will help you become free menif they said that i would be their man forever but they do not they care nothing for freeing us all they say is rise up and make los espanoles some trouble this does not inspire me for some reason roland kersauzon swept off his hat and bowed to the black man who stared at him in astonishment it would not inspire me either monsieur roland said i assure you of that he gestured you may go you are freeof me anyhow but you and your men are still fighting for the damned spaniards and against the slaves the negro said it is our duty roland said simply if you turn me loose it is my duty to kill you if you get in my way and if i have the chance the negro said i need to go after the spaniards first but you are their ally tell the other slaves to wait until los ingleses are gone from this land if they do we will not raise a finger against them roland said my quarrel is with the english not with you this is a good bad bargain but it is still a bad bargain the black man said if los ingleses are not here the spaniards will have nothing to distract them from us they will put us down and they will make us pay for rising against them but if we fight them now while they also have to worry about the english we have a chance to beat them maybe not a good chance but a chance he wasnt even wrong not as long as he was talking about spaniards if the slaves did beat their spanish masters the french would invade and try to suppress them even the english would probably do the same thing they might not have many slaves in their own settlements but they didnt mind making money from other peoples bondsmen and roland was sure the english aimed to seize french and spanish atlantis for themselves if they won this war they wouldnt want negroes and copperskins running around burning things and killing people no not when those same negroes and copperskins could be harvesting crops and putting black ink not red in the ledgers kersauzon made as if to push the slave away you had better leave now before i come to my senses and decide to hold you instead the negro bowed politely you may try senor i dont think you will have much luck then he disappeared so quickly and so effectively that he might have been part of a conjurers trick a leafy fern stirred for a moment deeper in the undergrowth a bird let out a startled chirp hes a nuisance a sergeant said you should have got rid of him while you had the chance it could be roland said but even if i would have how many more just like him are there the sergeant had no answer for that neither did roland not in numbers but he knew there were swarms of them victor radcliff found himself and his little band of english marauders in an odd predicament they helped protect spanish fugitives from the wrath of their uprisen slaves and they gave aid and comfort to the africans and terranovans against the men who were convinced they had a right to own them blaise didnt mind that on the contraryone day he hurried up to victor almost jumping in excitement a woman here she speak my language he exclaimed well good victor said that must be nice whats her name they call her maria blaise answered she has a name in our language too it means in english little star pretty radcliff remarked i can talk with shewith her blaise made a face dont always have to think through different kinds funny words justtalk he really did jump into the air then but the leap put radcliff in mind of a dance step he got to see maria a little later he didnt think her especially pretty but then blaise didnt seem to find white women especially pretty either the black man and woman could talk together all right their language seemed full of clucking and mooing noises to victor but he knew how delighted he would have been to find an englishspeaking woman if he were stranded in west africa voice dry he said you might want to tell her we still have some fighting to do you cant marry her till thats taken care of blaises skin was already dark but it got darker as he blushed good thing she doesnt talk english she think you making promises for me i can tell her myself in spanish or in french if she knows it victor said helpfully never mind blaise saidin english maybe i marry sheher maybe i dont dont got to decide now though what are you two talking about in that funny language maria asked in fluent spanish you better not be talking about me when i cant understand what youre saying were talking about the fighting senorita victor radcliff replied in the same language we still have to beat the spaniards and you will fight to the last slaves last drop of blood to do it maria had a tart wit we are here in spanish atlantis victor said we fought our way through french atlantis to get here we would fight the spaniards even if the slaves did not rise up against them she weighed that blaise plainly hung on her decision victor was surprised to discover he cared too you had to take maria seriously some people had that gift at last she nodded bueno the spaniards have plenty to answer for and so do you ingleses for selling them so many slaves from africa she didnt knowradcliff hoped she didnt anyhowhow deeply involved in the slave trade his family was you could make a lot of money off negroes plenty of people had if you didnt sail to africa yourself your hands stayed clean while you did it too radcliffs and radcliffes were welcome in all the best places in english atlantis wed better be he thought we founded a lot of those places but that was an argument for another day lets get moving he said we dont do anyone any good sitting around like snails on a leaf they left more mansions in flames as they moved south the spaniards who took refuge with them cursed them because they didnt do more to put down the rebellious slaves the slaves cursed them because they didnt do more to help the uprising getting sworn at by both sides at once suited victor radcliff fine to him it meant he was following about the right course he heard rumors the governor of spanish atlantis had let soldiers from french atlantis come south to deal with the english settlers he disbelieved those rumors as long as he could if they proved true they would make his life harder but he sent scouts out to the north as well as to the south the only thing worse than having the french settlers there would be having them there and getting taken by surprise a scout rode up from the south shouting the sea the sea why you smile blaise asked victor what so funny bout the sea blaise had never heard of xenophon victor would have bet the scout never had either but more than years earlier the greeks escaping the persian empire had raised that same crythalassa thalassawhen they finally came to the black sea for xenophons greeks coming to the sea meant finding the broad highway home things werent so simple here who could say what kind of ships lay off the coast any at all british spanish french all of them at once banging away at one another as if these were the bad old days of the pirates of avalon victor again remembered ethel radcliffe whod shot his greatgrandfather muleheaded stubbornness seemed to run through every branch of the radcliffe line he needed some of his own here and some luck if this venture wouldnt be remembered as another piece of radcliffe damnfoolishness lets go down to the sea he said weve come all this waywe shouldnt leave the last few miles undone the ocean here was nothing like the cold greengray one off hanovers muddy beaches the water here was turquoise it looked warm enough to bathe in the sand leading down to it was golden as a pretty girls hair an enormous black bird glided past overhead it had a leathery red sac under its throat several crocodiles unhurriedly ambled off the beach and into the ocean too bad victor radcliff thought with so much firepower at hand they would have been easy to kill and even though crocodiles were ugly they made better than tolerable eating victor focused on the crocodiles and the frigate bird blaise was the one who pointed farther out to sea and said what ships are those damnation victor exclaimed several frigates cruised along on that lovely blue sea his first horrified thought was that some french or spanish admiral had got much too clever for comfort it could cause him all kinds of trouble if he didnt move his men off the beach those ships could bombard them and damn all he could do about it or they could land raiding parties strike at him and then get away before he could respond just by being there they denied him the seacoast he felt trapped between their anvil and the hammer of roland kersauzons french settlers what to do monsieur blaise asked good question radcliff answered dully he raised a spyglass to his right eye for a closer look at the ships if they were french frigates he might persuade their skippers he and his men were spaniards conversely if the ships were spanish maybe he could fool the captains into thinking he was kersauzon it might work for a little while anyhow though what good it would do he wasnt quite sure he was looking for somethinganythingto try that was all he slid the shiny brass tube out a little farther to bring the frigates into sharper focus then he started to laugh and once he started he had a hard time stopping he wanted to keep on braying idiot mirth up to the sky that was only a couple of shades lighter than the sea somebody not far away said hes gone clean round the bend he has what you see someone else asked that was blaise his accent distinctive reluctantly victor lowered the telescope those ships out there he couldnt go on he started laughing again instead you better tell us now blaise sounded almost threatening several of the white men around victor looked the same way he took a deep breath and held it as long as he could then he let it all out and did the same thing again trying to flush the laughter from his system only after that did he try to speak once more those ships out theretheyre english that got him a load of profanity and obscenity covering as much relief as he felt himself as usual blaise was a man of direct action he snatched the spyglass from radcliffs hand and raised it to his own eye he didnt understand how the lenses bent lighthe thought it was magic well victor didnt understand why the telescope worked either he did doubt whether witchcraft had anything to do with it lack of understanding didnt mean he couldnt focus like victor he accepted the colorfringed upsidedown images as the price of magnification and like victor he started to laugh even if not so loud or so long fuck me he said reverently they are english shipses what are they doing here someone asked which had also crossed victor radcliffs mind are they waiting for us maybe they are by god victor said but whether they are or not they can give us a ride home the phrase deus ex machina ran through his mind if those ships werent the visible hand of providence stretched out on the watersif they werent then they were somebodys idea of a cruel joke victor refused to believe that he called out an order show all the union jacks we havethe bigger the better the flags had grown tattered in their journey through french and spanish atlantis victor didnt care they wouldnt be mistaken for the emblem of either enemy kingdom they wouldnt beand they werent the nearest frigate sailed closer yet victor imagined its captain peering shoreward through a spyglass just like his own before long the ship lowered a boat it stopped just out of musket range of the beach ahoy shouted someone aboard his voice coming thin over the water who are you what are you doing here victor explained then he asked the same question of the bosun or lieutenant or whoever he was in the boat we were ordered down here to find you the man replied looks like weve gone and done it too what will you do now that you have bring you back of course good god victor said not that we arent glad to see you but who sent you down here how did you know where we were i hear it was that army bastard lieutenantcolonel whatshisname charlie the sailor answered showing his scorn for anything in a red coat he got your despatches looked at a map and said go there youll just about find him and we just about did didnt we bless my soul victor murmured thinking an englishman stodgy just because he was an englishman wouldnt do the officer had used his imagination and used it well his scheme wouldnt have worked unless england ruled the seas but england did and he took advantage of it and with roland kersauzons french settlers nipping at his heels radcliff was glad he did what do we do blaise asked we go back to freetown thats what victor answered and we dont have to fight our way through spanish and french atlantis or plunge into the western wilderness to do it blaise considered but not for long good he said leading the raiders onto the ships was a long tedious job victor formed a rearguard perimeter and kept it in place as long as he could after a while it wouldnt have done much good there werent enough soldiers manning it had kersauzons troops descended on them then it would have been embarrassing to say the least but luck had been with radcliff all through the filibustering expedition and it stayed with him now he and blaise were the last two men from the raiding party to step into a boat blaise grimaced last time i went in ship they took me from africa he said victor knew what hellholes slave shipsblackbirds they called themwere he knew but blaise knew this wont be that bad victor told the negro better not blaise said grunting sailors pushed the boat into the sea their mates pulled them aboard they plied the oars like clockwork automata the land receded the frigate drew nearer victor was delighted if blaise was too his face didnt know about it roland kersauzon stood on the golden beach cursing don jose he cursed the governor of spanish atlantis in his rising and setting his waking and sleeping his eating and shitting he wished the governors wife would take the pox from him and he wished don jose would take the pox from his wife if hed made up his mind roland howled if only he had a mind to make up the englishmen were gone theyd flown the coop no actually they hadntthey could no more fly than honkers could roland had hoped to shoot them down the way settlers shot honkers too and he might have done ithe might well have done it since he was sure he had more men than they didif only don jose hadnt sent him away before urging him back had the governor of spanish atlantis been a woman toying with her lover that would have been one thing but he was a man of responsibility toying with the fate of his settlements yes the english raiders were gone kersauzon had brought the french settlers through the madness of the slave uprising theyd done their sharemore than their share probably since the spanish settlers seemed notably reluctant to fightto quell it theyd got on victor radcliffs trail thanks to the wreckage radcliffs raiders left behind a blind man could have followed it but it ended here and the englishmen were gone they hadnt sprouted wings they hadnt dug into the ground like blind snakes though roland would gladly have consigned them to hell and he didnt suppose theyd grown fins and scales either which didnt mean they hadnt left by sea the royal navy was the strongest one in these waters roland didnt know how the enemys ships got to the right place at the right time but manifestly they did nothing else was possible what do we do now monsieur a lieutenant asked like kersauzon he was looking out at the lovely deep blue treacherous sea a tern dove into the water it came out with a wriggling fish in its beak a big black frigate bird the sac at its throat like a scarlet pigs bladder harried the tern till it dropped the fish the frigate bird snatched it out of the air and flew off with it radcliffs english settlers might have been frigate birds too like this one they were getting away with their robbery what do we do roland echoed what can we do we go back and help montcalmgozon he is the man facing the enemy right now the lieutenant sighed its a long march and it will seem even longer because weve done so much of it before dont i know it roland started swearing at don jose again when he ran downwhich took a whilehe said what other choice have we got though would you rather stay here do you like running after the spaniards negroes and copperskins good god no the junior officer exclaimed well all right i would have chased you into the ocean if youd said yes kersauzon told him we go north if the slaves harry us we make them sorry for it if they dont we leave them alone any objections no sir the lieutenant said then lets go roland raised his voice and gave the men their new orders they liked the idea of leaving spanish atlantis so did he he suspected the spaniards made a lot of money from their settlements here but they made even more from the gold and silver of terranova the ones who lived here were the ones who couldnt make a go of it there they acted like secondraters and came down hard on their slaves because they lacked confidence in themselves we need shoes monsieur a soldier called weve done a devil of a lot of marching you know yes roland nodded it could be that some will come down in the supply wagons everyone laughed knowing how unlikely that was even victuals had been in short supply lately he went on or it could be that you will find some lying around with no one using them the men pondered that but not for long they grinned and nudged one another theyd foraged to keep themselves fed now they had official leaveor what amounted to itto forage to keep themselves clothed roland suspected the spanish settlers would soon regret that he also suspected don jose would soon bawl like a branded calf he suspected he himself would grow remarkably deaf to the governors protestations where are the englishmen asked a spanish cavalry officer encountering the french settlers tramping north what have you done with them he spoke french with a trilling spanish accent why they are in our rucksacks of course roland replied we will keep them there until we quit spanish atlantis and i promise you by god and all the saints that they will trouble you no more in your rucksacks the spaniard frowned since his eyebrows grew together above the top of his nose he looked fearsomebut since he had only a handful of men behind him not nearly fearsome enough to intimidate roland if i ride south and find them marauding if you do you may track me down and do as you please to me roland broke in but for now monsieur you may get out of our way for we are on the march he raised his voice forward his men rolled down on the spaniards the luckless officer and his squadron could get out of the way or get trampled the spaniards got out of the way the road was muddy the meadows to either side were muddier the horses had to keep moving lest they start to sink the officer looked daggers at roland who wondered if the fellow would draw his pistol and start a fight even if he was supposed to be an ally and even if he was hopelessly outnumbered he seemed angry enough not to care but no matter what he thought he didnt do anything once the french settlers passed him by would he get back on the road would he ride south and discover that the english really had vanished from spanish atlantis and would he conclude from that that kersauzon really did have them in their rucksacks when you were dealing with spaniards you never could tell when you were dealing with englishmen you never could tell either the french were the only sensible people in the world roland was convinced of it and even among the french there were unfortunate gradations marquis montcalmgozon for example though surely a good fellow did not seem nearly so sensible as a man from french atlantis theyre going to seed over there in europe roland thought sadly the sound of gunfire ahead snapped him out of his musing scouts forward he called well find out what that is then well put a stop to it one way or another fix bayonets and load your muskets before long the scouts came back it was a brawlalmost a battlebetween slaves and spanish settlers in what was no doubt usually a sleepy little town about what kersauzon had expected lets go he said if the blacks and copperskins run from us well and good if not its their funeral they ran hed thought they would they were brave enough but had little in the way of organization they could fight settlers who also didnt know what they were doing real soldiers advancing in neat ranks with bayonets gleaming under the subtropical sun no the slaves melted into the woods cheers from the spaniards failed to warm the cockles of the french settlers hearts the town was big enough for two cobblers shops the french settlers looted both of them they cleaned out the taverns too some unfortunate things probably happened to a few of the local women roland thought that was too bad but he didnt intend to do anything about it as long as the soldiers followed orders when it came time to leave they did fewer cheers came to them when they left than when theyd arrived somebody fired an old fowling piece at them as they marched away none of the junk in the gun barrel hit anybody if some had the french settlers probably would have turned around and done a proper job of wrecking the town as things were they just kept going you know monsieur the copperskins and blacks will come back as soon as weve gone a couple of miles a sergeant said but of course kersauzon replied what do you want me to do about it well sir the spaniards said we could come in if we helped them with the slave uprising the underofficer pointed out roland told him what the spaniards could do about it in the telling he violated as many commandments as he could without having either a sculptors tools or someone elses wife handy the sergeant a man as accustomed to harsh language as anyone of his rank stared in goggleeyed admiration having slowed down a little roland said i came down here to fight the damned english settlers if i cant do that here ill go where i can do it by god any questions mais non certainement pas the sergeant said hastily and went off to find somewhere to bathe his bleeding ears if the slaves got in the french settlers way rolands men went through them if the slaves didnt the settlers ignored them they took what they needed from the surrounding countryside as if in hostile country the locals took to running from them and occasionally as in that one village shooting at them the french made them sorry when they tried it a courier from don jose rode up to roland when he and his men were once more nearing the border with french atlantis in accented french the man cried his excellency the governor demands to know why you have not performed the function he required of you and why he has received reports that you are plundering the countryside we are plundering the countryside because we have to eat and he never arranged to feed us roland replied and we are now returning to the more important fight the one against england but the slaves still torment us the spaniard cried if you cant put them down by yourselves then it could be that they deserve to be the masters roland said the couriers jaw dropped he sputtered and fumed finally after some effort he got out this is intolerable if you do not care to tolerate it you are welcome to attack my army roland said so is his excellency i do not promise you the most hospitable of receptions however you will pay for thisthis insolence the courier said weve already paid for spanish insolence kersauzon replied without it we would have been able to come to grips with the english settlers a long time ago instead they got away should i thank you for that if you werent already running away from our country we would drive you out like the dogs you are the spaniard said roland looked at him consider monsieur you are perhaps not in the best position to throw insults about how many muskets could point at a man on horseback at a shouted order or even without one the courier seemed to make the calculation and not to like the answer he found his hand slipped toward the dragoon pistol he wore on his right hip then jerked away as if the pistol butt had become redhot youll be sorry he warned im sorry already roland said sorry don jose doesnt know his own mind sorry your slaves hate you so much what of yours the courier retorted not like that i hope roland added but only to himself most of all im sorry this has been a chase after a wild goose a wild goose that has flown since i cant follow by sea i must go by land as best i can and so i say farewell to spanish atlantis and you had better pray your own folk here do not do the same god will punish you for this desertion the spaniard said he hashe sent me you did he not roland replied his men laughed the spaniard glowered the french settlers began to march and the courier had to move aside or get trampled into the mud onward roland cried xxiii w hen victor radcliff strode down the inflexibles gangplank and onto the quays at freetown the clever english lieutenantcolonel whod sent the flotilla into southern waters stood waiting for him victor threw the englishman the snappiest salute he knew how to give much obliged to your excellency he said i thought you might need a hand or at least find one er handy so i did what i could the officer replied now that were back here what did you have in mind doing with us victor wiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his sleevehe had no kerchief it was high summer and as hot here as it had been in spanish atlantis montcalmgozon presses us hard the lieutenantcolonel said he has proved himself an able and aggressive soldier and of course he has a solid body of french regulars he has however few settlers or other irregulars with him not until roland kersauzon catches him up this being so radcliff saluted again he also grinned this being so you want us to drive him as crazy as a honker in mating season whilst i should not have put it quite that wayyes the english officer smiled too well i expect we can do that i expect the boys will look forward to it as a matter of fact if i can get them out of town fast enough victor said im sorry the officers smile melted away i dont follow that if we stay here long some of them will get drunk some will get poxed and the more enterprising lads will manage both victor radcliff told him oh i see the smile returned why they might almost be regulars theyre men your excellency victor wondered how much experience with soldiers the englishman had had before king georgeor more likely king georges ministersordered him across the sea less than he might have had victor was pretty sure of that blaise and the other sergeants lined the greenjacketed settlers up in neat ranks no one would escape to the fleshpots of freetown such as those were if the underofficers had anything to say about itand they did we got here ahead of the buggers from french atlantis one of the sergeants rasped the frenchies who are up herell be sorry we did too as victor walked out in front of the assembled irregulars he reflected that the tough pockmarked man with three chevrons sewn to his left sleeve had just given his speech for him philip is right he said and watched the underofficers chest expand and his shoulders rise and straighten now we make the french regulars as sorry as kersauzons men made general braddock we owe em that much dont we agreement came loud and profane the settlers had got caught along with braddock and his redcoats they would have if the english general wanted to listen and if honkers could fly forwardmarch blaise shouted bugles blared drums thumped the men paraded through freetown tavern owners came out of their establishments and stared wistfully at the stream of men who wouldnt be customers sergeants and lieutenants made sure the men didnt sneak off to taverns or to bawdy houses a couple of plump extremely welldressed women who looked as disappointed as the publicans probably presided over those establishments more settlers and the surviving redcoats who hadnt got captured and paroled held freetown against montcalmgozon and his men the french commander wasnt carrying on a formal siege with saps and parallels but his campaign wasnt far removed from it hed been pushing the english lieutenantcolonels forces back on the town had he had more artillery he could have made things even worse they were bad enough as it was the french marquis didnt have enough men to surround the town and keep his lines tight at the same time the english lieutenantcolonel said well major radcliff from here on i leave you to your own no doubt fertile devices they seem to have met all requirements in french and spanish atlantis thank you sir victor said in glad surprise i dont know if i can handle that much responsibility for a moment the englishman was nonplused then he realized radcliff might not be altogether serious he smiled thinly i dare hope youll manage so do i victor realized he was liable to find himself in the middle of warm work he shrugged hed done that before one more time couldnt be too much worsecould it of course it could you stupid fool a voice inside him screeched if you stop a musket ball with your chest or with your face youll see how much worse it could be too would meg want anything to do with him if he came home with a patch over one eye or missing half his jaw if she did would it be from love or from pity at the english lieutenantcolonels orders the redcoats started a brisk dusk skirmish with marquis montcalmgozons frenchmen they stirred up enough trouble to draw french reinforcementsand to let victor and a large band of settlers break out through a weakly held stretch not far away who goes there a frenchman asked victor shot him in the head with a pistol down went the enemy soldier dead as a stone a look of absurd surprise on his face with the larger racket of musketry close by no more frenchmen came running to see what had happened to pierre or louis or jean or whatever his name was out away into the countryside that was what victor had in mind south he called to his men quick quick i want to get on their supply lines the way you bastards wanted to get on the whores back in freetown coarse baying male laughter answered him the settlers bumped into a few more frenchmen as they hurried away from the lines around the town but only a few the french soldiers regretted itbut not for long never for long the settlers urged on by sergeants and officers put as much space as they could between themselves and the main body of their foes the french were foreigners here several of the settlers knew the roads and woods and streams the way they knew the hair and tendons and veins on the backs of their handsand from equally long acquaintance oh sure major one of them said id bet anything theyll bring their victuals and such up the graveyard road its a devil of a lot wider and straighter than the honkers beak cheerful name ned victor remarked they call it that because its the road that goes past the graveyard ned answered matteroffactly nice spot for an ambush not far from there now youre talking victor said it was a good spot for an ambush too pine woods grew close to the road on both sides one day before too long victor supposed settlers would cut them down for fuel or timber but it hadnt happened yet lush ferns growing under the trees would further screen the greenjacketed english settlers at dawn the next day radcliff sent a spry youngster up a tree to keep an eye out for approaching wagons inside of an hour the lookout hallooed victor wasnt astonished an army needed a lot of supplies to keep goingand the french officers farther south wouldnt know hed broken out of freetown shoot the horses and oxen first victor told his men we want to make sure the wagons dont get through on came the wagons oblivious to danger hooves thumped in the dirt of the roadway axles squeaked wheels rumbled as the wagons got closer victor could make out the jingle of harness and the drivers laughing and talking to one another fire he shouted the woods exploded in flame and smoke down went most of the draft animals others wounded but not slain screamed and reared and tried to bolt some of the men in the wagons screamed too a handful had the presence of mind to grab for pistols and muskets and fire back they even hit a couple of settlers as victors men swarmed out of the woods and over the wagon train dont let any of them get away to the south victor shouted we dont want the enemy to know what were doing this time with surprise so complete obeying his order was easy the settlers rounded up the luckless drivers and guards they put wounded animals out of their misery some of them started butchering dead ones roast ox would be tough and horse steak would be gluey but victor had eaten plenty worse so had many of his men they also plundered the wagons and came away with everything from wine and brandy to pigs of lead burn what we cant use victor said dont leave anything montcalmgozons men would want maybe the fires would draw french regulars if they did the french would find that the settlers had got loose the enemy settlers wouldnt find the settlers themselves though victor had them marching down the graveyard road less than an hour after horror descended on the wagon train and they rounded a bend that afternoon and almost ran into another northbound wagon train get em victor commanded not the most precise order ever issued maybe but one that told what he wanted done he got it too the frenchmen outnumbered twenty to one never had a chance they couldnt turn around and they couldnt fight back he feared one or two of them did manage to escape from the rear of the train if someone there jumped on a horse and galloped south as fast as the beast would take him he could get out of musket range before any settlers came close to him it wont be so easy next time radcliff told blaise as the wagon trains funeral pyre rose into the sky the negro only shrugged we can still do it victor nodded yes i think we can too they came across no more wagons before they camped for the night victor sent a company led by locals crosscountry to the road called the honkers beak if the french aimed to use the poorer road to sneak past him theyd be doomed to disappointment he also told off some men to bury the lead theyd taken his force had plenty for its needs more important now was denying it to montcalmgozon the settlers to whom he gave the order grumbled but hed expected nothing else somebody had to do it a good days work he said just before rolling himself in a blanket a mighty good days work cant you go any faster roland kersauzon called to his men the marquis will need us i only hope he doesnt need us already begging your pardon monsieur but youre up there on a horse one of the french atlanteans replied easier to go from here to there on a fine gelding than it is on shanks mare he was gaunt and poorly shaven hed done about as much marching as a man could do all he had with him were a musket and a bullet pouch and a powder horn when he got the chance he could fight what more did you want from a soldier roland sketched a salute you shame me would you rather ride for a while i can walk the settler shook his head no what difference does it make now and i suppose you need to be up there so you can give orders and make people pay attention to you no doubt he was right all the same for the rest of the day roland felt guilty about riding he also fumed as hed fumed ever since he reached the southern shore of spanish atlantis just too late and found the english fled no hed been fuming longer than that ever since don jose refused to let him enter spanish atlantis well don jose had paid for his stupidity but the french cause was paying too what was montcalmgozon doing now what were the english regularsand the english atlanteans damn themdoing against him what were they doing to him messengers had told roland all was well with the french regulars up in english atlantisbut he hadnt had any messengers from montcalmgozon the past couple of days maybe that didnt mean anything maybe the marquis had nothing new to report or maybe he was too busy attacking freetown to have time to deal with anything less important maybe kersauzon had a hard time believing it the other maybe was that maybe something up north had gone wrong keep moving roland called again the next morning pretty soon well be over the border then well be living off the enemy not our own countryside before they got to the border between french and spanish atlantis they found out some of what had happened up toward freetown a man riding what was obviously a cart horse reined in in front of them and shouted its all buggered up whats all buggered up roland demanded everything the teamster seemed bound and determined to give as little information as he could what happened to you what happened to your friends roland asked little by little he teased the story from the man the english were waylaying supply trains how long could montcalmgozon go without food and munitions how had the english broken out of freetown when the teamster said the attackers wore green jackets roland got his answer to that those were victor radcliffs men the men he hadnt caught in spanish atlantis like quicksilverlike his own troopsthey could slip through any tiny opening he wasted a few seconds swearing at them again and at don jose well its up to us then he said if we can break through and open the supply lines the regulars will take care of the english as long as the army holed up in freetown doesnt get more reinforcements by sea he thought uneasily the royal navy was stronger than the french sea forces just as the english atlanteans had more ships than their french and spanish counterparts but he couldnt do anything about that he could only fight on land and if the english settlers lay athwart his path he was readyno eagerto bull them out of the way the sooner he did it the better too he could see that all too plainly how much trouble is the french general in he asked monsieur i have no idea the teamster said we never got close enough to find out nom dun nom roland muttered he wanted to order double time no matter what he wanted he didnt do it even if hed ridden more than hed marched he had a good idea of how much his men had left if he exhausted them before they ran into the english settlers his fight was lost before it started how much did the enemy have left theyd done a lot of marching and fighting too yes theyd sailed back from spanish atlantis but ocean voyages didnt build a mans strength considering the horrible food aboard ship even a forced march crosscountry might be easier or it might not pretty soon he wouldnt have to wonder any more one way or the other he would know so would victor radcliff if my ancestor hadnt sold your ancestor the secret of atlantis for a mess of salt cod kersauzon shook his head three hundred years too late to fret about that now the first kersauzon the one from brittany made the mistake everyone else had been paying for it ever since what will you do monsieur the teamster sounded uncommonly worried roland blamed him not a bit uncommon worry just proved the man understood the situation roland was uncommonly worried himself he gave the only answer he could go forward find the foe wherever he is fight him beat him what else is there nothing the teamster hesitated i only hope the stinking greenjackets dont pop up out of nowhere on you the way they did with us if i hadnt been on one of the last wagons in the train i never would have got away you didnt know what you were running into thanks to you we do roland said they wont surprise us if they beat us they will have to beat us when we know where they are by god my friend i dont believe any englishmen ever born on this side of the sea or the other can do that i hope youre right the man said me too roland thought but he would never share that with anyone else had he had his way he wouldnt even have shared it with himself victor radcliff tried to be thorough he tried to be cautious so many things could go wrong in war even when you knew as much as you could about what the low sneaky scoundrels on the other side were up to major general braddock and too many of his men had discovered to their cost the difference between as much as you could and enough he and his settlers were moving south away from marquis montcalmgozons men if they were going to run into trouble or if trouble was going to run into them it was most likely to come up from the south toward them but likely chances werent the only ones along with stationing scouts ahead of the band of settlers and out to either side radcliff also put some men well behind his main body he perplexed blaise that frenchman he wants freetown the negro said he not going to come after us just in case victor replied i want to be like a hedgehog so no one can bugger me by surprise then he had to explain what a hedgehog was because atlantis had none blaise got it in a hurry oh a he said something unpronounceable at least by a white man we have them in my country i not know you know them well i do they have them in england and france and spain too again victor wondered why atlantis was missing so many creatures common in europe a lot of those beasts or ones much like them were also common in terranova to the west so far as he knew though terranova had no hedgehogs and he had more urgent things to worry about than hedgehogs and honkers one of the scouts hed left behind in the north rode into camp that evening on a lathered horse theyre on the move the man exclaimed theyre heading this way who the french radcliff was astonished why we might have made them hungry but not that hungry not this fast dont know why the scout said stolidly aint my station to cipher out why you set me there to tell you what i done did that yes you did victor nodded why was his job and he understood what montcalmgozon was up to no better than he understood the atlantean dearth of viviparous quadrupeds are a lot of french regulars moving or only a few looked like a bunch the scout replied somethings gone wrong for them up at freetown then has to be so victor said the scout only shrugged what can we do about it now victor wondered aloud he dreamt of catching montcalmgozon in an ambush to repay the french for what theyd done to braddock to his own regret he knew he didnt have the men for it were english soldiers chasing them he asked hopefully how the devil do i know the scout said i saw those bastards in blue acoming when i did i stuck around long enough to see it was a good mob of em and then i got out o there you did right victor said he muttered to himself now he knew more than he would have without those carefully placed scouts but however much he knew it wasnt as much as he needed to know he would have to decideand to actwith incomplete knowledge all generals had to do that how many of them got their noses rubbed in it like this though done with me the scout asked my backbones trying to saw clear through my stomach go eat theyre roasting a couple of beeves over there victor pointed the beeves were actually oxen from the french supply wagons but if you complained about every little thing tell them i said to give you a mug of wine tooand theyd better not have drunk it all up now youre talking the scout hurried away victor was gnawing on roastwell halfcharred halfrawbeef himself when another scout rode in this one out of the south theres a bunch of damned frenchmen camped down there major he reported french regulars or french settlers victor asked the answer to that might tell him something about which side was winning the naval war in the atlantic settlers the scout answered eyeing the toasted meat on a stick with a longing that said hed had no supper same buggers whove been dogging us all along kersauzon marched the legs off them to get them up here so fast victor said the scout only shrugged he didnt care go get yourself something to eat victor commanded ill worry about the rest of this the scout seemed only too glad to obey and victor did worry hed wondered if he could catch montcalmgozons troops between his anvil and a hammer of redcoats now he wondered if hed got caught between hammer and anvil himself as far as he could tell neither group of french soldiers knew the other was close byand neither knew his settlers lay between them as long as he could keep them ignorant like that he was fine if they started acting together he was a long way from fine he was in more trouble than he knew what to do with have to keep them from finding out then but how he could wait for montcalmgozon or he could wait for kersauzon he couldnt wait for both of them at once if he tried they would smash him between them all at once he started to laugh then he summoned his officersand several sergeants who had their wits about them he didnt name blaise but no one said anything when the black man joined the council radcliff found he was glad to have him there no one could say blaise couldnt take care of himself and help others do the same no one tried to do any such thing either which victor found interesting he spent a couple of minutes summing up the evenings news bread on both sides of us and were the meat in the middle he finished that kind of quick meal struck him as a damned good idea how do we make sure we arent dead meat in the middle asked the sergeant named philip puffing on his pipe the english settlers had lifted plenty of pipeweed on their raid through french and spanish atlantis well thats why i called you together heres what ive got in mind victor spoke for another couple of minutes then asked what do you think philip puffed again the pipe jerked up and down against his teeth as he said we will be dead meat if youre wrongsir now tell me something i didnt know victor answered dryly which drew a chuckle of sorts from the veteran underofficer victor went on but we cant stay where we are and let them grind us to powder does anyone think im wrong no one admitted it thus encouraged victor went on and we cant slide off to the west and let the two french groups get together again that would cost us more trouble than we want now and later he waited again again nobody contradicted him he spread his hands this looks to me to be the best we can do off to one side blaise nodded in the fading firelight his dark skin should have left him next to invisible somehow it didnt people noticed blaise were he an actor he would have upstaged the others in the company at every turn and it wouldnt have been because he was a ham it was because he was who he was a lieutenant said well if it doesnt work out the way you think it will chances are we can get away from regulars blaise nodded again so did several other sergeants so did the officers at the council with that lukewarm approval victors plan went forward a rifle banged the report was distinctly sharper and louder than a smoothbore muskets something seemed to tug at roland kersauzons hat he took it off it had two neat holes through the crown perhaps an inchperhaps less than an inchabove the top of his head another rifle spoke a lieutenant riding a few feet away from him swore and clutched at his left thigh skirmishers forward only on the second word did rolands voice break like a boys hed needed a moment to realize just how close a brush with death hed had french settlers trotted north more gunfire greeted them a little more slowly than he should have roland realized those werent mere snipers harrying his force somebody didnt want his men going forward somebody here could only be the english redcoats or settlers he wondered by the way the foe fought he guessed he faced settlers they didnt come out into the open in neat lines nothey fought from under cover of ferns and from behind trees they fought like his men in other words nowhow many of them barred the way only one way to find out hed had more men than victor radcliff when he was chasing the english leader he thought he still did he sent soldiers forward on the open ground and through the woods if the enemy wanted to stop them he was welcome to try here and there french settlers going forward fell but not very many of them went down and they didnt fall across a broad front roland smiled to himself bluff as hed thought they couldnt stop him they were just trying to slow him down he sent more settlers up against radcliffs men he also sent orders for runners to come back and keep him informed about what was going on they told him the english werent standing and fighting in his mind that confirmed that they were nothing but a harassing band press them roland shouted break them close in behind them and wipe them out he rode forward himself though he stayed in the open so runners could find him at need he fired a pistol at a man in a green jacket the english settler stayed on his feet roland swore and pulled his other pistol from his belt by then the enemy soldier had vanished among the pines rolands men couldnt quite break the english settlers they forced them into headlong retreatbut only so much of it wherever the woods grew thicker the foe fought harder there turned out to be more of them than roland had thought at first too they werent just a thin skirmishing line to be thrust back and then broken or shoved aside they had reserves cunningly placed to make life difficult for an advancing opponent another bullet snapped past rolands head he ducked without even thinking people did when someone shot at them you couldnt help it no matter how much you wished you could only a handful of men seemed immune to the reflex darkness came down at last the french settlers had pushed the enemy back several miles roland was pleased with himself all the french settlers seemed pleased with themselvesall but the wounded surgeons worked on them by firelight their cries split the night but those heartbreaking shrieks werent what killed roland kersauzons pleasure he suddenly wondered how and why so many english settlers stood between him and montcalmgozons army how had victor radcliff got past or got through the french regulars whatever hed done it couldnt be good news for the frenchmen from across the sea which immediately brought up the next question what to do about it his first impulse was to order his men forward right away regulars barely even thought about night advances too many things could go wrong with carefully dressed lines rolands men though could play bushwhacker as well as their foes in the end he waited for dawn as he rolled himself in his blanket he wondered whether hed regret it later victor radcliff wished for artillery he might as well have wished for the moon while he was at it his men couldnt very well have carried cannon as they sneaked through the french lines but now montcalmgozons men were trying to blast his force out of the way the frenchmen had plenty of fieldpieces and listening to the roar of guns from behind them so did the redcoats whod pushed them out of their lines and were driving them south if the english settlers could hold the french regulars were trapped if victors men had to retreatwell he didnt want to do that not with the french settlers coming up from the south one of these days historians would understand exactly how this campaign worked they would walk the fields and forests they would read accounts from survivors on both sides and in all four groups of combatants they would issue learned dispassionate judgments for anyone actually going through the fight confusion and fear reigned regulars without guns of their own could never have withstood the cannonading the french were giving to victors men regulars would have stood out in the open in neat ranks and let themselves get butchered victor had watched it happen to the redcoats his own men knew betteror fought differently anyhow they sprawled on the ground and hid in back of whatever cover they could find some of them had even dug scrapes with bayonets and belt knives piling up dirt in front of the shallow holes to stop or deflect bullets here and there cannon balls killed more often than not they harmlessly shot past victors settlers who werent packed together anywhere near so tightly as regulars would have been as long as the frenchmen kept cannonading his soldiers he couldnt do much to reply they stayed out of musket range even his few riflemen had trouble reaching them he shouted encouragement to the english settlers as long as they didnt break they made montcalmgozon sweat the french commander had worries of his ownor radcliff devoutly hoped he did he was harried from behind as the distant racket of gunfire in victors ears proved with any luck at all he would have to turn around and face the troops pursuing him if he did he wouldnt be able to deal with victors men that would be very good which was putting it mildly victor was thinking just how good it would be when a rider on a lathered horse galloped up from the south major the french settlers are attacking us down there the man said and pointed back over his shoulder damnation victor said and then something more pungent in french and then something still more pungent in spanish another cannon ball thundered past them but that was the least of his worries how hard are they pressing you he asked as hard as they can the courier replied damnation radcliff repeated that wasnt what he wanted to hear he didnt doubt it though if roland kersauzons men had got this far north they would try to bull through his blocking force if theyd got this far north this fast theyd done some fancy marching but that was a different story altogether for gods sake hold them back we cant have them pitching into our rear right now not when weve got warm work in front of us like this french cannon bellowed again victor knew he made a good target he stayed out in the open while most of his men had taken cover the courier flinched a little as the ball flew by but held his ground he gave victor a thin smile really major i never would have noticed heh victor touched the brim of his hat in a halfsalute acknowledging the mans coolness go on get back out of range before they ventilate your kidneys let the men know they need to hang on no matter what the settlers do to them ill tell em the horsemans grimace was as understated as his smile dont know if theyll be glad to hear it with a shrug he wheeled his mount and rode back toward the south he hadnt been gone more than a couple of minutes before the french cannonading suddenly stopped montcalmgozons lines reformed in the sudden nearsilence the french nobleman was bound to have a rear guard of his own trying to hold off whatever trouble lay behind him a horn call rang out over the field the sun glittered off bayonets being fixed as all the french soldiers made the same motion at the same time the horn rang out againa different call this time those bayonets flashed fire once more as the frenchmen lowered them one more call and with a fierce shout as much of montcalmgozons army as he could spare advanced against the english settlers it was glorious it was grandiose it was frankly terrifying hold your fire till theyre well within range victor called he knew a certain amount of pride that his voice didnt wobble here and there riflemen opened up on the french they could hit at ranges well beyond those a man with a smoothbore musket could use a few bluecoated enemy soldiers stumbled and fell but only a few the rest stepped over them and came on a hundred yards away from victor the frenchmen halted the first rank of soldiers dropped to one knee the second rank bent low above them the third stood straight they all fired together bullets snapped past him one hit his horse with a meaty thunk the beast squealed and staggered he jumped off before it foundered he had his two pistols and a rapier they didnt seem enough to repel the french get down major somebody behind him yelled better shooting over you than through you that struck victor as excellent advice he flattened out as the frenchmen dressed their lines a moment later with more cheers they charged his men greeted them with the best volley they could this wasnt just fire to annoy the enemy and gall him the charge staggered when it met that wall of flying lead french soldiers clutched at themselves and screamed as they fell but the ones who werent hit came on victor fired first one pistol then the other he thought he hit one enemy soldier from one knee he threw a pistol in a startled frenchmans face he might have broken the mans nose then he sprang up and skewered a bluecoat who was too slow to protect himself with his bayoneted musket and then he ran for his life back toward the trees no one spitted him from behind no one shot him in the back none of his own men shot him in the chest or belly though musket balls whipped past him in both directions a dead settler with a fully loaded rifle lay behind the first pine he came to the man looked absurdly surprised at catching a bullet just above the bridge of the nose he must have been about to fire when he got hit victor snatched up the rifle there came a man in a fancy uniformplainly an officer the frenchmans sword had blood on it victor fired the officer spun then slowly crumpled holy god someone bawled in french the generals down i got montcalmgozon radcliff thought dazedly we take surrenders he shouted also in french the enemy soldiers started throwing down their muskets and throwing up their hands xxiv t hey were breaking finally after a running fight that had gone on all through the day the english settlers in front of roland kersauzons men had had as much as they could take theyd managed to get across a creek running east to the ocean and were still defending the fords but roland was sure his army could force a crossing he looked west toward the green ridge mountains they were barely a smudge on the horizon but as usual clouds piled high above them the sun was setting in blood as it sank into those clouds can we get over this miserable stream once night falls roland asked his lieutenants they looked at one another nobody spoke right away at last one of the junior officers said im afraid i dont know where the shallow stretches are several other men nodded as if hed said what they were thinking nom dun nom roland muttered he dismissed the lieutenants and summoned sergeants and corporals they made an older more raffish group than the one hed sent away he put the same question to them i can find a ford a weathered sergeant said confidently i used to run traps up here i know whats what hed poached in other words since this was english territory roland grinned good thats what i wanted to hear as soon as its nice and dark well get moving but the english atlanteans knew where the fords were too they started bonfires on their side of the creek at each one of them to make sure rolands men couldnt catch them unawares roland took the sergeant aside i know what youre going to ask me the trapper said did they miss any youre rightthats what im going to ask you roland agreed did they no damn them the sergeant said well if you want to go five miles west theres sort of a ford they may not have covered i cant tell about that one from where we are now reluctantly kersauzon shook his head wed get scattered all over the landscape if we tried it and theres no promise radcliffs men dont have a fire burning at that ford too is there monsieur the only promise is were going to die sooner or later the sergeant answered i want it to be later in the arms of a beautiful woman if her husband shoots me even thats not so bad but i know you dont always get what you want not in this life you dont isnt that the sad and sorry truth her husband eh kersauzon shook his head the sergeant grinned and winked and nudged him in spite of himself roland laughedfor a moment but the smile slid from his lips as he went on well have to pay more to cross that creek come morning the uncouth backwoodsy french atlantean shrugged a shrug a paris boulevardier might have envied every business has its costs he said since we arent going to go tonight shouldnt we grab what rest we can an excellent idea roland said briskly even when he wrapped himself in his blanket sleep didnt want to come he knew he was keyed up that accounted for some of his troublesome but not all the english atlanteans on the north side of the stream were godawful noisy raucous snatches of marching songs floated through the air so did the sounds of tramping feet as if large numbers of soldiers were on the march for a little while roland worried there under that ratty tattered blanket then he chuckled trying to bluff him were they did they think he would believe theyd been reinforced and hold off on account of that if they did they were making a bad mistake some of them were making their very last mistake chuckling once more he slid headlong into sleep that veteran sergeant shook him awake the earliest traces of morning twilight grayed the eastern horizon time for the dance already roland asked around a yawn i think so the sergeant jerked a thumb toward the north across the creek but those noisy baboons keep tripping over their own clodhoppers they want us to think every englishman in atlantis is hiding among those trees kersauzon said scornfully well i dont care what they want i am not a fouryearold to be fooled by such tricks well get our men fed well get them across the stream and well get back together with marquis montcalmgozon breakfast was less than he wished it were stale hardtack and gamy sausage but a little ballast in the belly was better than none he took no more than any of his soldiers as soon as the men were fed he formed them in long columns one in front of each ford the troops at the head of each column would suffer not all of them would fall though as they charged through the waistdeep water and they would drive the english atlanteans before them once they got across ferns rustled and quivered in the woods on the far side of the creek drums began to pound hearing those drums made the hair at the nape of rolands neck quiver no he whispered hoarsely its not possible but it was it was not only possible it was true greencoats emerged from the greenery and formed up opposite his own men there were more of them than he would have expected to find in a rearguard detachment that made one nasty surprise things got worse as the drums continued to bray redcoats broke cover and took their places beside the english atlanteans their sergeants bellowed and swore till their alignment was perfect what are those salauds doing here a soldier said maybe the question was meant for roland maybe for an uncaring god roland feared he knew the answer only one seemed likely somehow montcalmgozons french regulars had come to grief the english had broken the siege of freetown and now they intended to break the french settlers too monsieur should we not withdraw a lieutenant asked urgently there are a devil of a lot of englishmen on the other side of the stream yes there are roland heard the bleakness in his own voice and they know where the fords are as well as we do if we pull back what will they do next eh the junior officers mouth twisted he didnt have to be elijah the prophet to foretell the future here theyll come after us too right they will kersauzon couldnt even tell his men to give the foe a volley oh he could but it wouldnt do much good in his infinite wisdom hed ordered his force into an assault formation only the few soldiers at the head of each column could open fire whereas the english no sooner had roland realized the english could open fire when and as they pleased than they did the greencoated settlers simply started shooting as they saw fit the english regulars delivered a volley under the direction of their officers and sergeants then methodically reloaded for another one and rolands men lurched back not only could they not reply effectively but they were so bunched up that not even smoothbore muskets could miss some of them fell othersthe ones who couldreeled away from the southern bank of the stream crash that second volley tore through the french settlers they broke running for any cover they could find roland was surprised to find himself still imperforate he yelled himself hoarse trying to stem the rout he might as well have saved his breath because none of that yelling did any good at all victor radcliff rode across stamford creek bodies lay on the far bank other french settlers wounded but not dead stretched imploring hands out toward him he went on past them somebody on his side would take care of them sooner or later he wasnt sure just howmaybe drag them off to the surgeons maybe knock them over the head if none of the wounded enemies pulled a pistol or tried anything else foolish odds were most of them would survive the english lieutenantcolonel rode beside him the young officers face radiated enthusiasm by god major i do believe weve really done it this time weve broken them he waved happily and its mostly because your men held the french regulars in place until we could come down on them from behind well done much obliged sir victor replied and much obliged to you for coming down on them when you did we couldnt have held much longer they would have broken through us in another hour it was a bit of a nearrun thing wasnt it the lieutenantcolonel said no one knew whod be the heroes and who the goats till it all played out eh just for a moment his grin slipped pity about brigadier endicott though yes sir victor agreed politely brigadier daniel endicott had commanded the english regulars whod landed in freetown and given the force there strength enough to break the french siege hed had the bad luckcertainly for himto put his face in front of a musket ball a few days earlier not ten minutes afterwards his secondincommand got shot in the leg that left the young lieutenantcolonel the senior english officer able to serve in the field none of which broke victors heart endicott had looked to be even more of a book soldier than the late major general braddock and colonel harcourt was no improvement the lieutenantcolonel by contrast had begun to understand that war in atlantis wasnt the same as war on the manicured fields of europe coming right out and saying so seemed the opposite of useful musketeers fired from the woods ahead sudden puffs of smoke marked their positionsor where theyd fired from anyhow anybody with a grain of sense would go somewhere else to reload and shoot again not far from victor an english atlantean swore clutched his calf and sat down in the dirt he drew a knife and cut at his hose to get cloth for a bandage im out of the fight for a while he said matteroffactly youll do fine the surgeons will fix you up in nothing flat victor wondered how big a liar he was the english lieutenantcolonel shouted orders redcoats advanced on the wood a few more shots came from it one or two english regulars fell the rest went on in among the trees no doubt some french atlanteans escaped from the southern edge of the forest but when the redcoats emerged several of them held up their bayonets to show the blood on them good show the lieutenantcolonel said weve dealt with the one bunchnow all we have to do is finish rounding up the other and the war here is as good as over then we see where it all ends up at the peace table that brought victor radcliff up short to him atlantis was the world but the english officer reminded him things didnt work that way england and france and their allies were also fighting in europe on the terranovan mainland and in india a stroke of the pen a swap of this settlement for that could annul everything won here with blood and bullets they wouldnt trade away everything weve donewould they those last two hesitant words showed that victor knew they might its not up to me major nor is it up to you the lieutenantcolonel replied the diplomats make those choices our task here is to ensure that they can bargain from a position of strength more redcoats came out of the pine woods theyd taken a couple of prisoners they prodded the disgruntled french settlers along with their bayoneted muskets one of the captives had a hole in his breeches and was bleeding but not too badly victor guessed his prodding had been more forceful than he would have liked the english atlantean wondered what the prisoner had done to deserve it then he wondered if the man had done anything the fellow likely counted himself lucky to be alive even if he was injured victorious troops were supposed to take prisoners yes but in battle all kinds of things that were supposed to happen didnt and just as many things that werent supposed to did weve smashed up montcalmgozons regulars victor said if we can do the same to kersauzons settlers well be in about the strongest position we canin atlantis anyhow i hear the rest of the war is going pretty well i hear the same the lieutenantcolonel said by what the regulars newly come to freetown tell me weve smashed the french and their native nabobs in india thats good news victor said it is indeed they put up a better fight than we thought they could i know that for a fact the english officer said and as for the remnants of the french forces herewell we should be able to settle them without too much trouble i expect he might have been the picture of confidence sir victor radcliff said gently i do want to remind you that the late general braddock said the same thing oh yes of course the englishmans tone was indulgent but whilst i dont care to speak ill of the dead general braddock committed some serious tactical blunders i hope we can avoid those yes sir major radcliff nodded so do i had the english pressed their pursuit harder they might have bagged all the retreating french settlers roland kersauzon was only too bitterly aware of that even as things were he had to fight a couple of sharp rearguard actions he sacrificed men he couldnt afford to lose to keep from losing everybody there were bad bargains and then there were worse ones well have a better chance inside french atlantis he said again and again trying to hearten the men he had left and trying to keep retreat from turning to rout if we have to we can stand siege at nouveau redon id like to see the damned englishmen try to take it i wouldnt someone behind him said rolands head whipped around he wanted to know who sounded so hopeless but all the men close by tramped along with their heads down none of them seemed ready to single out the fellow whod spoken what probably lurked in all their minds it lurked in rolands mind too however much he wished it didnt no matter how he tried to cheer up his troops his own spirits were at low ebb how could it be otherwise discovering that the english settlers had escaped him in atlantis was bad discovering that the settlers and redcoats together had put paid to montcalmgozons proud regulars wasnt just bad it was catastrophic hed beaten redcoats once when they obligingly marched into his trap trying to cross the creek to attack victor radcliffs men hed stumbled into theirs maybe we should see what kind of terms we can get had anyone else suggested that roland kersauzon would have been furious but he could make the suggestion to himself he knew he wouldnt follow through on it theyre going to try to take away everything weve got left a sergeant said with weary cynicism roland nodded thats rightthey will thats how greedy they are the english cochons so we wont let them eh if you bother a turtle what does it do it pulls back into its shell and good luck making it come out again you aim to pull us back into our shell monsieur the underofficer asked if you have a better idea id love to hear it kersauzon replied a lot of commanders might have said that for forms sake he meant it but the sergeant only shook his head roland went on the longer we hold out the better the chance something good will happen somewhere else if it does were saved the sergeant said when he paused he nodded again though what went through his mind was well we may be saved anyhow if the english seized all of french atlantis but for nouveau redon things were unlikely to go back to the status quo ante bellum no matter how long a siege the town withstood and the enemy might do just thatthere wasnt much resistance except for his settler army that raised another question how long could the fortress hold out roland didnt know the exact answer not in days but he knew the form the answer would take nouveau redon would stay free as long as the food held out and as long as there was no treachery munitions were not an issue the fortress had plenty a spring near the center of town ensured the fortress wouldnt run short of water the food could last a very long time especially if his army expelled civilians so it fed no useless mouths roland had overseen the victualing of nouveau redon himself hardtack and sauerkraut and smoked meat and dried fruit were uninspiring anyone who said anything else was a damned liar they could keep body and soul together a long time though treacheryroland gnawed on the inside of his lower lip the longer the siege went on the more hed have to worry about it if someone decided relief was hopeless but thought he might cut a deal with the army investing the fortressif that happened nouveau redon was in danger as roland rode southback toward the border between english and french atlantisone other possibility occurred to him if the plague broke out inside the fortress he might have to surrender whether he wanted to or not disease was a roll of the dice if the pestilence or dysentery or typhus struck the invaders they would have to give up the siege they deserve a pestilence dont they god he aimed what was half a prayer half a suggestion toward the sky maybe god would listen maybe he wouldnt any which way roland figured hed made the effort had the bridges over the erdre been down he probably wouldnt have been able to get back to nouveau redon to stand siege but they still stood roland and his men had come north over themcome north over them more than once in fact after crossing back into french atlantis he ordered the spans fired he didnt like that but saw no other choice right now slowing the enemy down was almost as good as beating him almost roland and his survivors kept on retreating victor radcliff watched smoke rise up over the stour theyre burning their bridges behind them he said for once literal truth and no cliche theyll have men defending the line of the river then if they be not utter fools the english lieutenantcolonel sighed wearily and utter fools they are not they could not have caused us so much trouble if they were well get over the river victor said kersauzons on the run he wont leave enough soldiers behind to seriously hinder us the english officers eyebrow rose for a moment victor wondered why then he realized hed committed a solecism he smiled if the lieutenantcolonel could worry about his grammar as well as the campaignmore power to him and after a moment the englishman unbent enough to admit i think you make a good prophet although the french settlers had burnt what they could the stone towers supporting the bridges wooden superstructure still stood and the redcoats had with them the usual contingent of military engineers victor hadnt expected to need their services until and unless the english army besieged the french but they proved valuable here at the border one thing atlantis had was an exuberant profusion of lumber axe blows rang out along the side of the river the engineers did not try to recreate what the fleeing french settlers had destroyed the redcoats cared only about making a way across that they did the romans whod bridged the rhine for julius caesar would have approved well well the lieutenantcolonel said after riding across one of those improvised bridges so this is french atlantis he looked around doesnt seem much different from english atlantis does it no sirexcept its full of frenchmen victor replied what had the english officer expected something that looked like france in the towns english atlantis looked like england farms there grew europeanand sometimes terranovancrops but the countryside remained stubbornly atlantean if anything french atlantis seemed more atlantean than the country farther north far fewer people actually lived here that meant the landscape had changed less than it had where englishmen settled pines and barrel trees stayed common right up to the very edges of towns victors soldiers had no trouble catching oil thrushes in the woods they ate better than the redcoats who relied on rations and viewed local foodstuffs with suspicion i aint gonna eat one of them funnylooking things an english sergeant declared maybe if i was starvingbut i aint victor didnt think oil thrushes were funnylooking hed grown up with them as he had with the goodsized thrushes with dull red breasts that english atlanteans called robins to him the small bright robin redbreasts of the home island would have looked strangehad he ever seen one only men from roland kersauzons rear guard and occasional freelance bushwhackers slowed the english armys advance when the redcoats caught a franctireur they hanged him from the closest suitable tree as a warning to other locals if they want to fight us let them put on uniforms and join an army the lieutenantcolonel said i would respect them then and treat them as soldiers deserve to be treated but this contemptible skulking must cease and we shall make it cease by whatever means prove necessary here and there english atlanteans had picked up guns and attacked the invading french forces no doubt montcalmgozons men had hanged the irregulars they caught did that stop the english atlanteans from harrying them victor radcliff doubted it but he didnt quarrel with the english officer that worthy had tradition on his side and didnt seem inclined to listen to anyone who disagreed besides what was wrong with hanging frenchmen after all the trouble theyd caused victor wouldnt have shed a tear to see the lot of them strung up neither would blaise ought to hang everyone who buys and sells slaves he said that would touch off a revolt in french atlantis victor was sure of it the locals might understand and forgive the execution of guerrillas anyone who went off and did something like that took his chances but the french atlanteansand the spanish atlanteans farther southwere convinced they had the right to own human chattels and didnt africans sell you to the white slave traders victor asked blaise nodded hang them too he said they serve it he made a face deserve it his english got better by the day it still had a long way to go though before long the direction in which roland kersauzons men were retreating grew obvious hes going to stand siege in nouveau redon victor told the english lieutenantcolonel well well just have to winkle him out of there in that case the english officer certainly didnt lack for aggressiveness whether he lacked for brains might be a different question its a formidable place victor warned it wont be easy to take hes never come up against proper engineers either the lieutenantcolonel said how much can engineers do against solid rock victor asked the english lieutenantcolonels smile was indulgent almost sweet i believe youve got the question backwards major you should ask how much can solid rock do against engineers back where he started roland kersauzon hadnt expected to return to nouveau redon except in triumph he hadnt imagined the english atlanteans stood a chance against brave french soldiers hed thought he could beat them with settlers by god he had beaten the redcoats with settlers that should have decided things it should have but it didnt he failed to count on english tenacity the enemy kept fighting their raiding band made roland separate from montcalmgozonbut he never did catch up with victor radcliff he damned don jose all over again he could deal with his enemies but god protect him from people who claimed to be his friends and english tenacity also meant sending more redcoats across the ocean no more french regulars came to atlantis maybe the english wouldnt let them but maybe king louis and his ministers simply couldnt be bothered with sending reinforcements roland wouldnt have been surprised either way ordinary people streamed out of nouveau redon roland wanted no one there who couldnt carry a musket the fewer mouths he fed the better as long as he had soldiers on the walls and supplies in the storerooms he was ready to defy the worldor at least those parts of it that spoke english one good thing sprang from the wreckage of his hopes he worried a little less about disease than he had before you couldnt catch smallpox or measles more than once so the learned doctors promised him and for once he was pretty sure they were right the ones who could catch them already had and had got better or died he posted a strong garrison of reliable soldiers around the storehouses that didnt seem so important now which was why he hastened to take care of it if the garrison was in place before people started fretting about hunger it would stand a better chance of stopping troubleor making sure trouble didnt startthan if he put it in place after soldiers started tightening their belts he hoped it would anyhow for now his mens fighting spirit was strong well whip those english cochons right out of their boots wont we sir said a youngster on the wall he shook his fist at the north just let them come but of course well beat them roland wouldnt have weakened such enthusiasm for the world as for letting the english settlers and redcoats comehe and the force he had left couldnt very well stop them he knew that too painfully well if he could have he would have he made a point of checking the artillery we will dismay them with our range a grizzled gunnery sergeant said were up much higher than they are you comprehend it gives us the advantage yes i comprehend perfectly roland said they will be sorry that they have tried to rob us of the jewel in the crown of french atlantis the gunners face lit up that is well said monsieur im glad you think so roland kersauzon had never particularly believed he had a knack for the telling phrase if he came up with one now it was bound to be as much by luck as for any other reason and how much would it matter one way or the other if the enemy seized the rest of the crown of course he would start prying at the jewel someone would have to come to its rescue someone would have tobut would anyone do it no one from french atlantis was likely to come to his aid such force as these lands could provide he had oh there would still be armed men among the settlers but there was no other army of settlers and there would be none not to relieve him if any army formed it would be to quell servile uprisings he was bitterly sure of that what would the enslaved negroes and terranovan natives here be doing now what theyd done in spanish atlantis it seemed much too likely what hope from across the sea then would the mother country send another force of regulars to help its atlantean settlements even if king louis wanted to do just thatsomething of which roland had no assurancewhat connection lay between desire and ability king george had reinforced his redcoats that argued england was winning the war at sea so did victor radcliffs mortifying escape the best will in the world might not let france ship soldiers across the atlantic if it didnt in that case why am i still fighting why not surrender now roland wondered he would save his own skin and he would save the lives of so many settlers who had already suffered so much for french atlantis and for france but he could not make himself yield while still able to fight if they want me so much let them come and get me he thought he didnt know what was going on in the wider world he could only guess and even if his guesses were right now fortune might reverse itself while he held out he could hope so and he was too damned stubborn to quit here i stand he murmured if a german protestant had said the same thing once upon a timeroland knew little of protestants and even less of germans oh the english lieutenantcolonel said when he got his first good look at nouveau redon yes sir victor radcliff replied in lieu of i told you so the nut wont be easy to crack im afraid so it would seem the english officer said after a moment though his chin came up the meat inside will be all the sweeter then once we get at it it will victor didnt want to say if we can get at it the lieutenantcolonel might think he lacked confidence he also might think the same thing himself first things first the englishman said well surround them cut them off well offer battle if they come out to engage us so much the better roland kersauzons not that foolish victor said i wish he were well we can hope he will be the lieutenantcolonel said radcliff only shrugged you could always hope but hoping for something and counting on it were very different he hoped the englishman understood that up on the walls of nouveau redon a cannon boomed the ball fell far short of the settlers and redcoats the gunners must have known it would victor recognized the shot for what it was defiance a breeze from the green ridge mountains blew the blackpowder smoke toward the ocean they wont act so bold when we cut them off from the river the english lieutenantcolonel said victor stared at him didnt he know anything about this place he aimed to besiege they dont depend on the blavet for water sir the atlantean said carefully no eh well cisterns go dry even if it takes longer they dont depend on cisterns either victor said no the englishman really didnt know anything about nouveau redon they have a spring and its never been known to fail we may be able to starve them out we may be able to take the town with saps and parallels wont be easy the lieutenantcolonel said victor nodded the ground rose sharply toward the citadel and grew stonier the higher it got not promising terrain for digging trenches im afraid well be here quite a while victor said we just have to pray we can keep our own men suppliedand that sickness doesnt break out if it does he spread his hands as if to say what can you do we are going to take that fortress the english lieutenantcolonel might have been an old testament prophet he sounded utterly sure he was telling the truth radcliff envied him his certainty the old testament prophets had had god on their side victor hoped his army did too he hoped so yes but he was less sure of it than people like elijah had been the lieutenantcolonel shouted orders horns blared drums thumped soldiers moved out to encircle nouveau redon the opening steps in a siege were as formal as those in a gavotte then the englishman gave his attention back to victor tell me majorhave you read caesars gallic war yes sir victor wondered why on earth the other officer chose this moment to ask that question a bit touchily the atlantean added we arent all barbarians on this side of the ocean i can give you all gaul is divided into three parts or talk about the aurochs and the other curious animals of the german forest if you happen to have a copy with you i can even make a stab at construing sentences though i confess my latin isnt what it was fifteen years ago dont fret dont fret the lieutenantcolonel said which only left victor more fretful than ever the english officer continued upon my honor major i meant no slight by the question please accept my assurances on that score very well sir victors voice stayed stiff the english officer pointed toward nouveau redon frances fleursdelys flag still fluttered defiantly up there can you give me precise bearings on where inside the town that spring rises i cantno sir but im sure you can find out if you inquire among my greencoats some of them will have spent more time inside than i have radcliffs curiosity roused why if i may ask perhaps we can match the famous fate of uxellodunum the englishman replied whatever uxellodunums fate had been it wasnt famous to victor he presumed it was set forth in the gallic war if it was he didnt remember it suppressing a sigh he said i fear you must enlighten me sir enlighten him the english officer did finishing no guarantees of coursethere never are in warfare but it strikes me that this is our bestand quickestchance of securing a victory at reasonable cost victor radcliff did something hed thought he would never do he doffed his hat to the lieutenantcolonel if we can bring that offif we can id give twenty pounds to be a fly on the wall and see the look on roland kersauzons face he is a difficult man the lieutenantcolonel said im sure he thinks the same of youand of me victor replied and chances are hes rightand so are you all things considered i would sooner lay siege out here than stand siege in there as would i the englishman agreed montcalmgozon had me mured up in freetown which wasless than pleasant but my position was still open to the sea your settlers returned and then we were reinforced from england only the angels could reinforce kersauzon now he wont ask for them even if god would give them hes a proud man victor said if you dont know that you dont know him at all xxv r oland kersauzon hadnt thought a lot about what being besieged might be like hed never imagined it could bore him but it did one day seemed the same as another hed started losing track of how long hed been shut up here how much longer could he stay till the storehouses emptied and then a little while after that but when they would had no simple answer if he kept his men on full rations as long as the food held outhe was an idiot or a man who expected to be relieved soon assuming those two werent one and the same threequarters rations half rations when to swing from one to the other those were the worries that weighed on his mind but what difference did it make if he decided tomorrow not today not much and he knew it had he worried about waterhe didnt though the spring was what it had always been what it always would be god had loved nouveau redon when he sent the cold pure water bubbling up through the rock hed also loved the settler who first realized what that spring meant an impregnable fortress for french atlantis the english werent even trying to take it or not trying very hard oh they were advancing their saps and parallels little by little they had yet to bring cannon within range of the walls though roland doubted whether they could the ground rose steeply and grew rocky in a hurry every new move forward would get harder and go slower once in a while guns on the wall would fire a cannon ball killed a team of oxen hauling something toward the closest trenches the gunners whooped and capered proud of their shooting magnifique roland said dryly when he learned what the celebration was about now the damned englishmen will have themselves a supper of beef that made the cannoneers faces fall they hadnt had a supper of beef for a while now oh some beef went into the sausages they gnawed on but no one in his right mind inquired too closely about what all went into sausages better not to know better just to eatas long as the sausages held out and roland proved right the redcoats and greencoats butchered the murdered oxen and roasted the carcasses mother nature was in a cruel mood the wind carried the savory smell of the cooking meat straight into nouveau redon rolands supper was a hard cracker some barley mush and a chunk of tough stale sausage not quite so long as his thumb his stomach growled enormously at the wonderful aroma wafting over the walls also once in a while riflemencommonly settlers in green coats which made them harder to spotwould sneak forward from the enemy lines and snipe at the defenders a rifleman had a chance of hitting a man from more than a furlong the surgeons got reminded they were there for a reason and the whole garrison got reminded they were in the middle of a war im almost grateful to the english roland remarked to a sergeant after a man took a flesh wound they make sure we dont go slack oui monsieur the underofficer nodded then he pointed out toward the river they stay busy themselves too see how much dirt and filth they dump into the clean water sure enough the blavet had been clear enough to reflect the skys blue till it came alongside the english works encircling nouveau redon but it ran brown and turbid as it flowed on toward the atlantic they are a filthy people themselves and it shows in everything they do roland said the sergeant nodded again but rolands eyes narrowed as he surveyed that muddy stain in the river i wouldnt have thought they were digging enough to put that much muck into the water it doesnt come from nowhere the sergeant said true enough and the river was cleanwell pretty cleaneast of here before they came roland shrugged no river that ran past a town could stay perfectly clear but the blavet hadnt looked like that before the redcoats and the english settlers were still working at their saps could they be working enough to make the river so muddy rolands shoulders went up and down once more as the sergeant said the dirt didnt come from nowhere so the enemy had to be digging that much scornfully the sergeant said ill bet they dont have the sense to draw their water upstream and piss downstream roland kersauzon laughed ill bet youre right once this little thicket of redwoods had shaded a house outside nouveau redons walls against the sun now it kept the french settlers shut up inside the town from seeing the opening to the mine under their mountain victor radcliff wondered whether the english engineers were wasting time and backbreaking effort how long do you suppose all this will take sir he asked the english lieutenantcolonel as long as it takes the officer replied time is one thing we have plenty of he checked himself as long as the men stay healthy anyhow theres always that victor agreed and as long as the french dont manage to bring any more regulars to atlantis they were lucky to do it once by god the englishman spoke with the unconscious arrogance of a man whose kingdom had got used to ruling the seas theyd be more than doubly lucky to do it twice heres hoping youre right victor left it there returning to his earlier question can your miners even begin to guess how long theyll need have you talked with them about it i have the lieutenantcolonel replied but as long as it takes still seems to be the best answer i can give you they will need some uncertain amount of time to dig their way under nouveau redon and then some other uncertain amount of time to cast about for the root of the spring so to speak adding one uncertainty to another can but yield a larger uncertainty i fear and of course there is no assurance that even seeking they will find what they seek the siege naturally continues notwithstanding their success or failure naturally victor echoed he looked up at the fortress as long as it held out english rule over atlantis remained uncertain once it fell if it fellthen the only way the french and spaniards could regain power and influence was at the negotiating tableabout which victor knew too well he could do exactly nothing if one of king georges socalled diplomats cared nothing for land to which he couldnt ride in a day or twowell in that case so much of this fighting would have been for nothing victor made himself shrug if his greencoats and the english regulars failed those socalled diplomats would have less to work with all he could do was all he could do he aimed to do it a miner stripped to the waist and muddied all over carried another basket of spoil on his back out of the tunnel opening the dirt wouldnt go into the river till after nightfall to keep the defenders from realizing how much of it came from this one spot the miner looked up at sky and sunshine as if he hadnt seen them for years bloody good to breathe fresh air he remarked to no one in particular victor believed that he wouldnt have wanted to scrape away far underground in stygian darkness illuminated only by candles and feeble lamps never knowing if all the countless tons of earth and rock above him were about to cave in and crush him to jelly timber shored up the passage into the earth but all the same the man sighed ah well back to it he grabbed the empty basket and vanished once more into the bowels of the earth brave fellow the english lieutenantcolonel said hed been watching the miner too then he is victor agreed can they really dig a straight line under the ground or will they lose their bearing they check it by compass inside and out the english officer replied so the chief engineer assures me they have had a deal of practice at this sort of thing grubbing out coal on the other side of the ocean you know theyre beginning to do that here too up in the north radcliff said fewer trees close by where theyre needed than there were when settlers first found atlantis and coal burns better which also has its uses but i dont think anyone could pay me enough to make my living underground nor me the lieutenantcolonel shuddered he seemed glad to point upward toward the town at the top of the hill could your riflemen snipe a bit more than they have been lately we dont want the foe to think weve given up on taking the fort by ordinary means ill take care of it sir victor promised we dont even have to hit them so long as they know were shooting at them just so the english officer smiled a peaceable sort of war is it not it sure is victor said if this scheme worked if the french gave up a few days later one of his riflemen came back swearing i had him in my sightsthe french commander old damned whatshisname the man said had him in my sights and i firedand i missed bugger me with a redwood cone but i missed what kind of range victor asked not too longa furlong and a half bad luck victor said shooting uphill like thatits hard and you dont practice it much i should have got him the rifleman refused to be consoled well maybe youll get another chance victor said not one that good dammit still disgruntled the other settler stomped away he turned out to be right too at least he didnt come running back to victor claiming hed plugged roland kersauzon neither did anyone else the commander of the french settlers went right on directing the citadels defense victor began to wonder whether nouveau redon would ever fall then one day the engineers digging far below the fortress ran out of the tunnel theyd labored on for so long waters starting to drip through the wall exclaimed a muddy man with a pickaxe clenched in his right fist we can hear it flowing by too by god victor said he solemnly clasped hands with the english lieutenantcolonel what do you do now the english officer asked his men how do you ruin the spring without drowning yourselves three of them went back into the shaft theyd evacuated each man rolled a hogshead of black powder ahead of himself and trailed fuse out behind after what seemed a very long time the engineers emerged from the tunnel once more one of them bowed to the lieutenantcolonel and said if youd care to do the honors your excellency i should be delighted the englishman lit a twig at a small fire that crackled nearby he touched it to each of the three fuses in turn one by one they hissed to life with three victor thought one of them will surely reach the powder and at least one did boom the ground shook under victors feet he shook hands with the english lieutenantcolonel again how long before we know whether we did what we wanted to do he asked shouldnt be long major one of the engineers replied a few minutes later water started flowing out of the tunnel mouth victor and the english officer and the engineers joined hands and danced around in a circle what they could do theyd done now they had to see what it did to nouveau redon boom roland kersauzon was on the wall when the ground shuddered under his feet a lot of gunpowder had gone off all at oncesomewhere but where he looked back at his town no great cloud of smoke rising there his men hadnt done their best to blow themselves up then the english not anywhere roland could see the bulk of nouveau redon hid some of their line from him but he would have thought any explosion big enough to make things jump like that would have produced a sizable cloud of smoke maybe he was crazy maybe being up on the wall made the explosion seem bigger than it really was a crew of cannoneers were also looking around wondering what had happened when their eyes met his they shrugged almost in unison laughing he returned the gesture half an hour or so later people started shouting his name here i am he called what is it the spring somebody called from the narrow winding streets the springs gone dry what roland yelped thats impossible it may be impossible the man down there replied but its true merde roland said nom dun nom dun nom he hurried down off the wall going down stairs shouldnt have made his heart pound like that in fact going down stairs didnt make his heart pound like that fear did sure enough no water gurgled from the mouth of the gargoyle who capped the spring it juststopped a stillplump cook said a few minutes after the ground shook itstopped roland cursed again this time even more vilely than before the cook gaped at him roland hardly noticed he was seeing men far belowground men working with spades and adzes and picks hed never dreamt they could penetrate to the living heart of his mountain underestimating what the english could do did not pay what now monsieur the cook asked nouveau redon has no cisterns who would have imagined we needed them who indeed roland said dully he looked up to the sky a few white clouds lazily drifted across the blue he wanted gray sweeping away the sun he wanted rain downpour deluge no matter what he wanted god wasnt going to give it to him men could live on halfrations for months maybe even years they could go with no food at all for a month take away their water and they were helpless inside a week not all the water inside nouveau redon had vanished of course but if no more came in if the weather stayed fair the way it looked like doingwhat could the defenders do then he saw only one answer it wasnt a good answer but it wasnt an impossible answer either drawing himself very straight he said we fight by god having decided to do that he wasted no time he sent runners hotfooting it all over nouveau redon the sooner his men went out and assailed the english the less they would suffer from thirst in the meantime rain might buy him a few more days butanother glance toward the sunny heavensno no rain in sight as his men gathered near the northern gate he rose till he stood in the saddle and told them what they needed to know i am sorry to say it my ducks but the english have pulled the rug out from under our feet they have murdered our springwe have no more water coming into the town but we are not without hope plenty of water flows down there right below our feet all we have to do is go take it weve fought englishmen beforeand weve beaten them before too one more win and the war is over we can do it a great cheer rose the french settlers certainly thought they could do it believing a thing possible went a long way toward making it so roland had a pistol on his belt a pistol in each boot and a slashing sword loose in the scabbard you will follow me he said you will not turn back till i give the order and i will never give that order another cheer rang out forward a sergeant shouted in a great voice in an instant the whole army was crying out the word forward forward forward the gates opened the men streamed out of them and formed a line of battle enemy rifles began firing as soon as the french settlers came into sight here and there a man fell the settlers were veterans by now and acted as stolid about losses as regulars could have roland pointed down toward the river lets go he cried cheering the army went cannons roared fire licked at the french settlers from the trenches ahead neither english atlanteans nor redcoats emerged to fight on open ground the enemy fired from his earthworks if he could shoot down the whole garrison from nouveau redon without exposing himself to much danger he would do it without a qualm of conscience a cowards way to fight or else a tradesmans so roland saw it which didnt make it ineffective oh no more soldiers came running through the spiderweb of trenches to take their places in front of the french settlers roland realized his men would have to break through before the english got enough fighters in place to stop them well they were close to the first trench line now a musket ball caught his horse in the neck blood fountained impossibly red in the sunshine the horse let out a bubbling shriek and staggered roland sprang clear before it went down he brandished one of his pistolsthe sword would have been more dramatic but he could do more with the pistoland shouted im still fine lets go on and give them what they deserve his good sense proved itself a moment later a redcoat swung a musket toward him but roland fired first he missed but he made the englishman duck the enemys shot went wild roland threw the pistol at the next closest redcoat then drew his sword and jumped down into the trench the sword got blood on it in short order roland got blood on himself too but it wasnt his an english regular almost spitted him with a bayonet but got shot in the side before he could thrust again the redcoat sank with a groan rolands blade flickered like a vipers tongue it was quicker than any bayoneted musket but the bayonets had more reach french settlers swarmed over the english defenders the french outnumbered them here and also had desperation on their side as soon as roland was sure theyd killed or driven back enough enemies he scrambled up onto the northern edge of the trench and ran on toward the next line follow me he yelled again some of his men did others went through the trenches connecting the inner ring of works to that outside it had the english settlers and regulars had their wits about them they could have plugged those connecting trenches with a few men but the attacks mad fury unnerved them and the french settlers rushed into the next ring how many of these battles will we have to win roland wondered unchivalrously stabbing a greencoat in the kidney from behind the man shrieked and dropped his musket whereupon the french settler he was facing gutted him with his bayonet but more and more greencoats and redcoats rushed to the fray the english settlers and regulars might be too unnerved to fight with proper tactics but they werent too unnerved to fight not all the frenchmen who got into the second ring of trenches came out of it and still more english soldiers poured into the brawl from the works all around nouveau redon the longer clearing the trench took the harder it got we have to move on down toward the river roland called but what they had to do and what they could do might be two different things roland fired both his remaining pistols he hit a redcoat with one ball he wasnt sure about the other in the mad melee all around him he wasnt sure of much he hung on to one pistol carrying it reversed in his left hand some swordsmen used a lefthand dagger to beat aside their foes weapons and to do damage when they could the pistol worked about as well roland clouted a settler over the head with it when the man got too close for him to use his blade come on kersauzon shouted again and again we have to keep moving but their progress got slower and slower the english atlanteans and regulars were continually reinforced no more french settlers came forth from nouveau redon roland had put all his weight into the one blow hed had to hope it would prove enough now he wasnt so sure there was the blavet with only one more ring of trenches in the french settlers way come on roland shouted once more by god my friends we can do it he looked around his menhis friends as so many of them werehad melted away like snow in springtime most of the ones who came forward with him bled from one wound or from more than one he discovered to his surprise that hed taken several wounds himself he didnt remember getting any of them the heat of battle could be like that now that he knew he was hurt all the little wounds started to pain him he ignored them as best he could if the french settlers could get past the last enemy trench past the redwoods just beyond it but the greencoats and redcoats knew what the french had to do gunfire spat serpents tongues of flame at the oncoming french settlers the corporal next to roland groaned as he took a bullet in the belly he folded up like a concertina a fieldpiece thundered and then another one how had the english manhandled guns to where they were needed most but how theyd done it didnt really matter that theyd done it did canister tore through the oncoming french settlers it blew one man right out of his shoes roland sat down hard he looked at his right leg in absurd surprise it wasnt bleedingtoo much he tried to stand again he managed to do it which proved the leg wasnt broken it could takesome weight he hobbled forward brandishing his sword hurrah the french settlers shouted as they threw themselves toward the last english defenses the english settlers and regulars still wouldnt come forth to fight the french mantoman they stayed in those earthworks and behind those trees and poured lead into soldiers who were in a desperately poor position to shoot back another man near roland dropped roland grabbed his musket and used it as a stick to help himself hobble forward he was almost to the trench when a black man wearing sergeants stripes took dead aim at him he knew it was all over at least as far as he was concerned then the white man next to the negro knocked the gun barrel to one side surrender the white called in fair french you fought bravely what more can you do i may die but i wont surrender roland answered come out here monsieur and we will see which of us is the better man what difference does that make the greencoat said i have the stronger kingdom and that does make a difference it makes all the difference in the world if you want to fight like a coward it does roland would have laughed at himself if things werent too grim for laughter he could barely stand up and he challenged the english settler to single combat if that wasnt suicide what was this was this whole charge into the teeth of the english position hed feared as much when he ordered it but he still didnt see what else he could have done without water nouveau redon would have had to give up soon the attack had had some chance some but not enough last chance monsieur the english settler warned be damned to you monsieur roland replied im sorry the greencoat said youre a brave devil but that wont do you any good either he turned to the negro beside him go ahead blaise roland tried to spring forward it wouldnt have worked on two good legs the musket ball caught him square in the chest he fell on his face in the dirt blood filled his mouth as his vision dimmed a katydid the size of a mouse scuttled past his face and burrowed under a clod of dirt he coughed he choked blackness enfolded him i never dreamt theyd come this far the english lieutenantcolonel said a few of them got through and got away victor radcliff said i never thought they could do that they were formidable were the english officer echoed thats a lovely word by god isnt it though victor looked around for his negro sergeantcumbodyservant and saw that he was going through a dead enemy soldiers pockets the victors take the spoils he thought aloud he continued if blaise hadnt shot their leader there at the end we might still be fighting he exaggerated but not by much when roland kersauzon fell it took the heart out of most of the french settlers still on their feet they threw down their muskets and rifles and swords and put up their hands by then the redcoats and english settlers were glad enough to accept their surrender surgeons worked on wounded all the way from the riverbank up to the gates of nouveau redon where the fighting was sharpest dead men in red and green in french blue and colonial homespun lay piled together in death each one quiet now where he had fallen the twin stinks of pierced bowels and bloodso much bloodfilled victors nostrils only one thing worse than a fight like this he murmured rubbing at a cut on his left arm he was one of the lucky ones but for that hed come away unscathed what could be worse the lieutenantcolonel still seemed stunned at the struggle the french had put up losing victor said bluntly well yes the english officer admitted after a moments surprise there is that so there was redcoats and greencoats robbed disconsolate enemy survivors of anything they happened to carry kersauzons men were in no position to complain anyone who presumed to resent the thefts wouldnt live long had the french settlers triumphed they would have done the same to their foes everyone on both sides knew as much what are we to do with them the english lieutenantcolonel seemed to be talking more to himself than to victor victor answered anyhow the ones who are left we may as well send home his wave took in the windrows of corpsesfar more french than english because kersauzons men had pushed the attack and pushed it in large measure out in the open even after they get there french atlantis will have a great swarm of widows and a great swarm of english settlers coming south to console them the lieutenantcolonel might be stolid and earnest but he had a certain basic shrewdness i shouldnt wonder victor said french atlantis is ours now theres no army left that can slow us down much less stop us plenty of plantations plenty of ordinary farms plenty of shops in the towns that will need men to run them there wont be enough frenchmen to do it not after weve killed off so many of them and our settlements have always been more populous than theirs look at the way were spilling across the green ridge mountains they have new marseille over on the west coast but thats just another little seacoast town now the englishman glanced up to make sure blaise was busy plundering in a low voice he said how do you suppose your bonny english settlers will like turning into slaveholders victor radcliff shrugged its a way of life down here how else are you going to run a plantation i dont care for it the lieutenantcolonel said slaverys against the law in england you know i dont either but its not here not in our terranovan settlements either victor said where slaves and money go together who complains about slaves does that surprise you sir well when you put it so perhaps not the english officer replied i shouldnt care to buy and sell other men myself though neither would isir victor said slowly but i wear cotton when i dont wear wool or linen much of what i wear is dyed with indigo i enjoy pipeweed sometimes i eat rice when i dont eat maize or wheat isnt it the same for you yes of course it is the lieutenantcolonel said but no sir no buts not in that case radcliff broke in if you use what slaves make but dont care to own them yourself arent you like a man who eats pork but doesnt care to butcher hogs the englishman opened his mouth then closed it again after a moment he tried again you are a bloody difficult man major thanks i do my best victor said not without pride this may all prove moot you understand the englishman said with a sigh not quite of resignation victor radcliff nodded i understand much too well if the gentlemen who all speak french sit down together and decide to hand this country back to the people who just now lost it nothing we can do to keep it this side of insurrection i should not recommend that either the english officer said it would be foredoomed to failure you may well be right sir victor said politely though less than convinced that the officer from across the atlantic was i am operating on the assumption that it will not come to that i am also operating on the assumption that those diplomatic gentlemen will not be so foolish as to squander what we won at such cost you are likely to be right yourself the englishman said england had the power to take french atlantis and god has also blessed us with the power to prevail elsewhere in the world we may throw france some small sop when this war is over to prevent her utter humiliation but i see no reason to throw her a large one in my view french atlantis is too large and too important to return it once having fallen into our hands we agree victor smiled that is not something a settler and a man from the mother country can often say these days we have been tested in adversity you and i the other officer replied and unlike the king of babylon god did not weigh us in the measure and find us wanting not yet anyhow victor said smiling still do you suppose that with french atlantis in our pocket we could sweep down through it and pick up spanish atlantis as well i tell you frankly sir the slaves whove risen against their masters would likely give us a harder fight than the spaniards can put up i doubt that not at all the englishman said still and all though thats a long march and one with uncertain supply lines into a country notoriously unhealthy i should hesitate to undertake it without orders from london my greencoats did it victor said we lived off the land and we had no trouble doing it what is easy for irregulars is often difficult for regulars the lieutenantcolonel answered irregulars often have a certain amount of trouble remembering that the converse also applies or do you think your men could have stopped the flow from the spring here radcliff knew his men could have done no such thing even trying would never have occurred to him that long underground burrowhe shuddered no he wouldnt have wanted to try that your point is well taken sir he admitted generous of you to say so the englishman told him i also fear i cant promise the timely appearance of the royal navy which you were able to enjoy you might have known a certain amount of embarrassment had the french and spanish atlanteans succeeded in combining against you the ships plucked you off the beach in the nick of time the lieutenantcolonel had a cats politeness he wouldnt come right out and say such a thing but victor understood what he meant you may be right sir he answered insincerely still and all not much danger of a francospanish combination against us now is there weve whipped the french settlers once and for all was what he meant and the englishman couldnt very well mistake him to his credit the redcoat didnt try no not much he said but i still believe we would do better to ensure our conquest of french atlantis than to go haring off after something grander yet do you on this side of the ocean know the proverb about the bird in the hand and those in the bush iveheard it victor said the english lieutenantcolonel chuckled at his reluctantindeed his reproachful to say nothing of nearly mutinoussubordination after a victory like the one theyd gained here chuckles came easy had roland kersauzons men beaten the redcoats and greencoats and escaped en masse to continue the war the english officer wouldnt have taken that hesitation so lightly victor went on a lot of the birds here though dont fit in the hand redcoats led glum french settlers into captivity some of those settlers were in their stocking feet if they hadnt been whipped out of their boots theyd lost them as spoils of war pretty soon the english settlers and regulars would plunder nouveau redon too victor would have been surprised if some of the more enterprising fellows werent already starting french atlantis will fit quite nicely i do believe the redcoat said it is a good handful victor allowed why argue now sure enough triumph was a great sweetener he took off his hat and saluted the english officer we won it together colonel cornwallis cornwallis returned the salute we did indeed major radcliff xxvi v ictor radcliff didnt like hanover he never had he didnt think he ever would the place crowded too many people into too small a space army encampments did the same thing but encampments were different everyone in themwell almost everyoneaccepted military discipline and knew his place not in hanover people hopped after their own pursuits as singlemindedor as mindlessas the big katydids that bounced across atlantis fields and forest floors they all wanted more than they had and they werent shy about grabbing what they wanted with both hands so if victor had had any kind of excuse he would have stayed far away from the brawling metropolis of english atlantis but he had none he was the hero of the war against the french a hero had to be seen had to be praised to make a proper spectacle for the people victor dully and dutifully paraded at the head of a regiment of greencoats ah well he said over his shoulder to blaise who strode along behind him one good thing about this nonsenseif the boys cant get laid tonight they arent half trying what about you sir the negro said his voice sly not tonight anyhow victor answered he was no saint when he was away from margaret though he had no bastards he knew about not tonight he repeated im going to the feast for all the fancy radcliffs and radcliffes should be gruesome but it cant be helped your friends you choose but youre stuck with your relatives not all the radcliffs and radcliffes at the banquet proved excessively fancy some of the young pretty women wore the name only because of a marriage connection they were no blood kin to victor at allbut they were interested in getting to know him more intimately he got to know one of them much more intimately in a servants tiny room under the stairsand he was smiling benignly at her husband some distant cousin of his five minutes later that was amusing even if he didnt tell blaise about it afterwards but neither the parade nor the fete nor the naughty sport under the stairs would have drawn him to hanover by itself all three of them together wouldnt have what brought him to london in smallthe towns proud boastand kept him there was the certainty that details of the peace treaty would come to hanover before they came anywhere else in atlantis he rode down to the harbor every morning sometimes with blaise sometimes alone ships of all sizes and ages came in from england and her settlements around the world and her allies some of the people knew that talks to end the war were going on no one seemed to know how they were going and then one afternoon a swift rakish royal navy frigate the glasgow sailed into hanover when victor asked the officer of the deck if he had news of the peace that young lieutenant looked down his nose at him and demanded why do you presume that you deserve to know i am major victor radcliff without me the ministers wouldnt be talking about french and spanish atlantis victor answered now sir who are youand who is your next of kin his hand dropped to the butt of the pistol he wore on his belt the naval officer lost much of his toploftiness ibeg your pardon major we do bring that word as a matter of fact if you tell me what it isat oncei wont ask any more personal questions of you victor said i wont kill you he meant and the lieutenant knew it well the younger man needed to gather himself at last he went on french atlantis comes under english sovereignty it is opened to english settlement without restriction the dons keep spanish atlantis but england gets trading concessions there we take most of french terranova too and almost all of french india radcliff cared nothing about india and only a little about terranova the lands on this side of the hesperian gulf were wide enough for him he nodded to the lieutenant thank you thats good news it wasnt so good as it might have been he would have loved to see the union jack flying over spanish atlantis too but the spaniards werent rivals as the french had been history had left spain in a backwater france on the other hand could have stayed ahead of england had she won this war she could have but she hadnt who the devil are you talking to jenkins a senior naval officer demanded scowling down at victor this is major victor radcliff sir the lieutenant answered the man who helped our regulars take french atlantis huzzah said the captain or whatever he was more troublemakers for the crown to worry about would you rather they were here sir victor said would you rather all atlantis flew the fleursdelys what a ridiculous notion the senior officer said it is now sirbecause we won victor replied the officer sputtered and fumed victor caught only a few words damned settlerslot of nervearrogant scut then the fellow spoke more coherently as if this miserable halfbaked place mattered a farthings worth in the grand scheme of things sir to an englishman it may not radcliff said yet there are those of us who call atlantis home and who love it and who would have grieved to see it lost to the french not least after so much effort and so much blood expended to preserve it yes yes the naval officer still sounded impatient i see you can make pretty speeches when you care to well youve got what you want the french get a few islands off the terranovan coast where they can raise sugar cane to their hearts content and wewe get atlantis although im still damned if i know why we want it an obstacle to navigation thats all it is and no one will ever persuade me otherwise victor radcliff bowed then i shant make the effort but perhaps one day time will tell you what you dont hear from me when victor had the chance to read the full terms of the peace he found that they said nothing about the race of a prospective settler in french atlantis he told blaise you ought to go down there youre a clever man and an able onethose two dont always march together youd get rich before you know it and you could throw it in the frenchmens faces the only way i get rich there is i buy niggers and copperskins blaise said slowly only way anyone gets rich down there he runs him a plantation with slaves well yes victor admitted you do need them in french atlantiswhat was french atlantis i mean he paused some slaves whove got free do run slaves themselves now that isnt against the law down there either dont happen real often blaise said no it doesnt but its not illegal blaise set his chin he didnt have the bony promontory that graced the lower jaws of a lot of white men somehow though the lack made him seem more stubborn not less done been a slave he said and added several french and spanish pungencies to the remark dont want to do that to anybody else someone else will if you dont victor said i daresay youd make a better master than someone whod never seen it from the other side this time blaise laughed in his face that startled victor radcliff and angered him too he wasnt used to such discourtesies from a negrocertainly not here in hanover though he would have tolerated them better on campaign or out in the woods if im a master im as rough as anybody else blaise said you have slaves you got to be or they dont work they dont do anything i know i was one he jabbed a thumb at his own broad chest dont want to do that so i wont i stick with you major radcliff sir he saluted mixing some mockerybut not a lotinto the gesture of respect gravely victor returned the salute youll never get rich that way he said blaise shrugged dont care about gettin rich care about he paused considering about not hatin myself yeah i care about that have it your way you will anyhow with the war over victor didnt need a sergeantcumbodyservant any more if he went back to exploring he didnt need a body servant either an explorer with a servant was like a musket with a chamber pot having one added something absolutely unnecessary which wasnt to say blaise couldnt take care of himself in the wilderness he could at least as well as victor could himself and if victor dismissed him blaise could take care of himself in english atlantis too blaise might be black but he was as generally competent a man as victor had ever met that went a long way towards explaining why the two of them got along as well as they did even if victor had never thought of it in those terms well if you dont want a plantation how do we reward you for shooting roland kersauzon he asked money is good blaise said seriously what you reckon hes worth he was always ready to haggle he looked so ready now victor started to laugh are you sure youre not a jew under your skin he said blaise took the question literally dont even know what a jew is theyre white people who arent christians victor replied too foolish to know the truth in other words they dont believe in god blaise asked they believe in god but they dont believe jesus is his son oh like muslims blaise said it was victors turn to be confused a bit of backandforth made him understand blaise was talking about mahometans a bit more made him understand that the black man knew much more about them than he did how do you find yourself so well informed he asked some of the tribes north of us they muslim blaise answered they send their men want us to be muslims too missionaries muslim missionaries victor radcliff said wonderingly now ive heard everything we christians send missions to africa too you know muslims send missionaries they take slaves christians send missionaries they take slaves blaise said uswe believe what we believe we dont send no missionaries do you take slaves radcliff asked oh yes people we catch in war things like that blaise said we dont work them the way the french and spaniards do though dont have big plantations he paused these jews they send missionaries no at least ive never heard of it if they do victor tried to imagine what would happen to a jew proselytizing in rome or paris or londonor hanover come to that nothing pretty the jews knew better that in turn made him wonder why christians and mahometans didnt he found no good answer blaise wasnt finished these jews they take slaves some rich jews own them im sure victor said they buy and sell them now and again most of that trade though at least between africa and atlantis lay in christian hands uncomfortably he finished they dont raid the coast to grab them anyhow huh blaise said a thoughtful grunt maybe i turn jew then victor didnt tell him that kind of conversion was against the law he wasnt sure it was or needed to be who not born to the jewish faith would want to assume all the burdens it entailed speaking of those burdensdo you want to get circumcised fancy word whats it mean blaise said victor told him what it meant the negro set a protective hand in front of his privates muslims do that too why would anybody want to i dont know why mahometans do it i didnt know they did jews think god requires it of them blaise took the hand away he was getting ever better at aping white peoples notions of polite manners aint gonna be no jew he declared amen victor said unaware hed just come out with a hebrew word when victorand blaiserode south into what had been french atlantis no customs barrier delayed them at the border there were no customs barriers between english and french atlantis any longer no more than there were between new hastings and hanover king george ruled them all the innkeeper at whose establishment they stayed was french they both spoke his language that pleased him they also both stayed reasonably sober and reasonably quiet that pleased him even more men from english atlantis filled the inn to bursting they shouted demands in english the innkeeper understood them well enough so close to the old border it wasnt as if hed never had englishspeaking guests before the war made him an involuntary english subject but by the way the newcomers acted french might have been as dead as aramaic they drank they pinched and patted the barmaids they ate as if theyd just discovered food they bragged about the fortunes they were going to make by screwing the frenchies that the innkeeper was listening and might decide to season their capon with rat poison never seemed to cross their minds they went on drinking they brawled and broke crockery brawling that will go on your scot the innkeeper cried he might put rat poison in the beer and wine and barreltree rum too what makes you reckon well pay you a hapenny you filthy motherless scut one of them bawled a heartbeat later he found himself staring down the barrel of victor radcliffs pistol a pistol aimed at your face as victor had reason to know seemed to own a bore as wide as a fieldpieces youll pay your scot right now and then youll get the devil out of here victor said quietly in the sudden vast silence he didnt need to shout and if i dont the trader had nervemore nerve than sense as far as victor was concerned he said in that unfortunate circumstance your heirs will be responsible for what you owe this gentlemanand for the cost of your funeral add in the farthing youre actually worth and it comes to a tidy little sum the other settlers bloodshot eyes crossed as he stared down the barrel of the pistol who the hell are you anyways throwing orders around like youre gods anointed i am major victor radcliff victor answered evenly if i have to ask your name sir you will not be glad of it i promise you that nowdo as i told you or prepare to join the majority thats fancy talk for die ben another trader said in case ben was too dense or too sozzled to figure it out for himself he wasntor he didnt let on that he was i know what its fancy talk for dammit he said with an effort he looked at radcliff rather than his weapon put that miserable thing away so we can talk this over like a couple of sensible people i am not a sensible person and do not pretend to be radcliff said i have spent this whole war killing people who got in my way if you think one more will bother me to the extent of a fart on a dung heap you are making what i assure you will be your last mistake ben considered victor knew the questions that had to be uppermost in his mind could he knock the pistol aside before victor blew his head off if he could could he win the brawl that would follow a split second later he must not have liked the answers he came up with he said im going to reach down for some money ill do it slow and i wont go for anything else that all right by you yesas long as you mean it if you dont i promise that my friend and i will make youbrieflywish you did your friend you mean thatcolored fellow ben was almost but not quite too slow he did have the brains to realize tagging a guntoting negro with an ugly name wasnt the smartest thing he could do he took out enough money to cover his tab and then some after setting it on the table he walked off into the night anyone else victor inquired or can you see screwing the frenchies will be the same as screwing yourselves from now on no one seemed inclined to argue with him shorttempered men who carried pistols often went without their fair share of disagreement something hed noticed before and was inclined to take advantage of on the other hand he didnt fool himself into believing hed magically convinced the english settlers of the error of their ways lack of disagreement wasnt the same as agreement he suspectedno he was surethere would need to be laws to make sure the english didnt screw the frenchiestoo badly quite a few people would get rich down here before those laws went into place if ben wasnt one of them victor would have been surprised audace audace toujours laudace blaise remarked as he and victor undressed for bed the innkeeper gave the two of them a room to themselves none of the traders from english atlantis would have wanted to bed down with them anyhow as far as victor was concerned it was mutual he only shrugged it wasnt so audacious as all that not when you were there to back my play but who backed mine blaise asked two bullets then he made as if to strangle himself oh nonsense victor said what do you want to bet the innkeeper has a pepperbox pistolor more likely a blunderbuss loaded to the muzzle with scrap ironunder the bar he would have backed us both maybe blaise said unwillingly but maybe too slow to do us any good too the devil take worrying about mighthavebeens victor said we did it we got by with it and theres an end to it and now why dont you blow out that candle so we can get some sleep blaise did the room plunged into darkness scented with hot tallow victor never found out whether he or blaise started snoring first which probably meant he did nouveau redon would never be the same english engineers systematically demolished the walls that had warded the great fortress of french atlantis for so long that made sense to victor even without the spring the site remained dangerously good he wasnt surprised to discover french settlers could see that as well as he could theyd also noticed that the english regulars charged with wrecking their works spoke no french with smiling faces the locals called the engineers appalling names with those same smiling faces they called victor radcliff some appalling names too he smiled back and replied in his best french ah but if you think im bad you should see your own mothers the setters whod been making sport of him stopped their mouths falling open monsieur comprehends one of them said in alarm monsieur bloody well does victor agreed monsieur also comprehends that you would do well not to bait the engineers if they find out the tenth part of what youre saying to them you are all dead men it would serve you right too blaise added and who are you the settler inquiredcautiously most of the time french settlers didnt want to hear anything from negroes or copperskins most of the time they didnt have to owning a man meant you didnt have to listen to him owning a woman meant you didnt have to listen to her either that could beand often waseven more convenient having made one mistake though this fellow didnt want to make two a surprisingto victor a dismayingnumber of people didnt care how many they made i am sergeant blaise black of the militia of the english settlements blaise answered pride ringing in his voice he must have taken the surname on the spur of the moment it certainly suited him he went on i also have the honor to be the man who shot roland kersauzon nobody asked him any more questions after that the french settlers couldnt disappear fast enough now look what you did victor said blaise shrugged in a way that showed hed lived among frenchmen i told them the truth whats wrong with that in english he sounded ordinary in french he could be eloquent maybe he still knew more french than english maybe the difference lay in the genius of the two languages as for his questionnothings wrong with it victor radcliff answered that doesnt mean its a pleasant thing to do with another shrug blaise said they were throwing filth at us you gave them something to think about so did i all right victor said mildly he did warn the captain in charge of the engineers that the locals were less friendly than they seemed the grizzled officer said well i cant tell you im amazed the brothel we went to tried to give us a freshly poxed girl so wed have something to remember her by and what did you do about that victor inquired the captain made a fist tore the place apart now we dont pay for it any more we have fun anyhow these french women his opinion of them was at least as low as the jeering french settlers opinion of him and his men that wasnt surprising even if it was a little sad as long as it didnt start a riot it also wasnt victors worry he said im just glad youre making sure they wont use this place as a strongpoint against us again you never can tell the captain said theyre liable to start rebuilding as soon as we get done and leave well need to keep an eye on them to make sure they dont i think we can do that victor said and the problem will solve itself before too long i suspect hows that sir the graying english officer asked when there are as many english settlers as french here no one will want to use this place as a fortress i hope not the captain didnt sound convinced victor wondered why not and then all of a sudden he stopped wonderinghe knew to this englishman settlers were settlers and what blood they sprang from hardly mattered they were all potential rebels potential enemies radcliff tried not to bristle in any obvious way that would only have proved the captains point for him im as good a subject of king george as you are victor wanted to scream it screaming it wouldnt have done him any good though the captain would have thought he was protesting too much of course if this fellow and others like him despised settlers simply because they were settlers wouldnt he make them despise him too the odds seemed good blaise was thinking the same thing what can you do with such people he murmuredin french i dont know victor replied in the same language what is that jibberjabber youre going back and forth in the english engineer aimed the question at victor did you learn this niggers language so you could talk it without anybody knowing what youre saying no you fool victor exclaimed its french dont you know french when you hear it i should hope not the redcoat sounded proud of his own ignorance if its not english its not worth learning didnt they ram latin and greek down your throat victor asked now taken by surprise not me again the captain sounded proud i came up through the ranks i did im not one of those rich buggers who got to go to oxbridge or camford or one of those fancy places im an officer on account of im bloody good at what i do dont need any damned foreign languages to know how to build a wallor how to take one down either good god victor said some merchants in new hastings and hanover were as proud of what they didnt know as this fellow victor had always pitied them the captain on the other hand frightened him how much do you know about atlantis not bloody much and i dont care to find out more the englishman responded damned place is full of frenchies and niggers and copperskins thats all i need to know isnt it king george has got to step on it with both feet and im bloody proud to be the toe on one boot i think we better get out of here monsieur before i kill him blaise said through clenched teethstill in french also in french victor replied you would have to wait in line i outrank you they walked away in a hurry that manthat man he is more dangerous to atlantis than roland kersauzon blaise spluttered to him everyone here is a slave everyone not just me i dont like when people think i am still slave but i know why i am black in a white mans world it happens i understand even if i dont like but that man he paused again to him you are slave too everybody from atlantis is slave as far as he is concerned why he stopped breathing hard its not england victor radcliff said how can it be any good if its not england he was joking and then again he wasnt if he didnt laugh hed burst into tearsor maybe grab the pistol on his belt but you are from england too blaise pointed out yes im from england but im not of england my people havent been of england for three hundred years victor said our friend back there what friend the negro broke in thats what i mean victor said our friend back there is of england anybody whos not of england is below the salt to him he had to explain below the salt to blaise once the negro understood he asked what about king george he is of england does he think atlantis is below the salt too telling blaise that george was a thirdgeneration german and the first sovereign of his dynasty to be fluent in english struck victor as a waste of time it also struck him as sure to confuse the black man besides even though it was all true blaise had a perfectly good point hes my king too i have to hope he remembers that atlantis and english terranova and india and the rest of his realm matter as much as england does victor said and if he forgets blaise inquired victor did the only thing he could do he shrugged he was hardly in a position to tell the king of england what to do nor did he ever expect to be if he forgetsill just have to worry about it then the closer to spanish atlantis blaise got the more he muttered under his breath at last when victor came right out and asked him what was on his mind he explained why the french they have slaves but only a few really like to have slaves the spaniards most of them like to have slaves they have slaves because they enjoy owning other people not just to get work out of themis that what you mean victor asked yes sir thats what i mean blaise nodded emphatically i still dont talk english so good so i dont know how to say it right but that is just exactly what i mean probably goes a long way towards explaining why the slave rising in spanish atlantis wasisso bad victor said should give the blacks and copperskins guns help them kill off the spaniards blaise said they deserve it we cant do that victor radcliff replied the treaty we signed made us promise we wouldnt blaise only looked at him and so blaise didnt know much about treaties he wouldnt have cared if he did he only knew what he wanted and how to go about getting it next to that nothing else mattered i cant do anything about it people know me too well it would get noticed and the spaniards would scream bloody murder and under the treaty theyd have a right to victor gave blaise his most severe stare you cant do anything about it either youre my righthand man and people know it youd get blamed and id get blamed and england would get blamed you cantyou hear me i hear you the negro looked mutinous im sorry sergeantby god i am sorrybut thats an order victor said if you break it i wont be able to help you and i wont even try blaise said something in his own language victor didnt ask him to translate he didnt want to know they didnt see eye to eye about this they never would coming up to the border was something of a reliefat least it gave victor something else to think about two spanish soldiers stepped out of the customs post they glowered at seeing a white man and a black together what do you want one of them called in spanishflavored french do you speak english victor answered in his own language no and i dont want to either por dios the soldier reverted to his native tongue his comrade spat in the roadway what do you want the man asked again he didnt raise his musket but he looked as if he wanted to victor wondered what would happen if he said who he was his raid into spanish atlantis had touched off the slave rebellion that still sizzled would these spaniards shoot at him to pay him back for what hed done to their settlements he decided he didnt want to find out i am here following my kings orders he said which was at least indirectly true he wants to make sure that the border between his new realm and yours is quiet and safe and secure then he shouldnt send out a white man with a mallate the spaniard replied nothing is quiet and safe and secure with mallates around blaise said something incandescent in spanish both soldiers at the border post started to raise their guns dont do that victor said also in spanish you insulted him first and if you shoot us you will start a war not only that you will lose it if you lose it you will see english law in spanish atlantis do you want that english law was much easier on slaves than spanish law was the border guards knew as much they lowered the muskets with haste that would have been comical in a setting less grim victor radcliff was lying through his teeth and he knew it if england kept slavery as it was in french atlantis she would do the same thing here blaise also knew he was lying through his teeth what victor told the spaniards went dead against what hed said in all the arguments hed had with the negro victor wondered if blaise would throw that in his face to his relief blaise didnt while the two of them disagreed they showed a common front against the spaniards you are not permitted to enter into spanish atlantis not withhim along one of the spanish soldiers said he spoke to victor alone as if blaise were nothing more than a beast of burden why do you think i want to enter it to eat lizards to let mosquitoes eat me victor said keep it and welcome as long as you dont cause trouble i can report to the king that he doesnt need to take it away from you yet blaise added the spaniards spoke with each other in low voices you have seen what you came to see now you should go said the one who did the talking for them gladly victor said their turn will come blaise said as he and victor rode north again without a doubt victor agreed one day soon england will hold all of atlantis and then what blaise asked i dont know victor said taken aback it will be a better place than it is nowim sure of that better how blaise persisted freer victor thought of freedom in terms of not needing to worry about foreign foes blaise looked at things rather differently i dont know victor said again
