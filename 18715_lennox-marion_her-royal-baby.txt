marion lennox her royal baby chapter one tammy was up a tree when royalty arrived royalty might be unusual but being up a tree wasnt tamsin dexter spent half her life up trees she was one of australias youngest and brightest tree surgeons and tammys passion was propagating treating or as a last resort felling trees and planting new ones to take their place employed by the australian national parks service tammy was as usual working in the remote bushland that she loved so much she was part of a team but today she was working happily and successfully alone she had nothing to do with royalty but someone was under her tree right now and he certainly looked like royalty or maybe he was a duke or maybe he wasnt royalty could he be an admiral or something maybe she didnt know she conceded tammys working knowledge of royalty dukes and admirals was strictly limited were admirals as young as this maybe not what the stranger was wearing probably wasnt an admirals uniform she decided as she checked him out more closely he was dressed in a sleek expensively cut suit embellished with rows of braid medals and tassels hed arrived in a gleaming limousine which was now parked under the tree she was working on and a uniformed chauffeur remained in the driving seat someone else was climbing out of the car now the second man was older and wore no braid or medals but he still looked like some sort of official which of the pair looked more out of place tammy couldnt decide royalty or official it didnt matter but she knew who looked the most interesting royalty definitely royalty the man shed decided was royalty was tall he was well over six feet she thought though it was tricky to judge from so far above him he was immaculately groomed with jet black hair thickly waved and raked back his hair looked carefully arranged to suit the official status of his uniform but perhaps ungroomed it would be the sort of tousled thatch that tammy infinitely preferred in her men her men she grinned at the direction her thoughts were taking that was a laugh her men her men were a figment of her imagination figment or not this man looked great wonderful he was strongly built and had a sort of chiselled look about him like one of rodins statues his bone structure was superbintensely wonderfully masculine what else some things were obvious he certainly wasnt the sort who lived in the bush even without the royal regalia he looked the type whod be at home drinking caf√© latte or sipping wine in trendy city bars with a sleek little lamborghini parked nearby she knew the type and it wasnt her type at all cheap tea boiled on a campfire with a few eucalyptus leaves thrown in for flavour was more tammys style so what on earth were these two men and their chauffeur doing here she swung lazily back in her harness and considered the bureaucrat was about fiftytwenty years or so older than the royaltytypeand he was podgy he was wearing a dark suit and his shirt had a tootight collar in comparison the younger man looked smooth intelligent and sophisticated what a pair in combination they looked almost absurd here they were in the middle of the australian bush and they were dressed as if they were expecting a royal reception and to receive them there was only tammy swinging thirty feet above their heads what did they want miss dexter the bureaucrat called and tammy frowned miss dexter that was her what were this lot doing looking for her this is ridiculous the royalty guy was saying the sort of woman im looking for wouldnt be working in a place like this tammy thought about that and agreed wholeheartedly how many miss dexters were there in the world thousands she decided these guys had wandered off a movie set and needed directions to find their way home miss dexter the bureaucrat called again this time more urgently but still tammy didnt respond she stared down at the men below and as she did she felt her insides give an unfamiliar lurch maybe it was a premonition maybe they werent in the wrong place at all maybe they spelled trouble miss dexter the bureaucrat called again in a tone that said that this was his last try and she took a deep breath im up here what can i do for you the voice from above his head made marc start the foreman down the road had told him tamsin dexter was working in this clearing and hed reacted with disbelief what on earth was one of laras family doing working in a place like this hed been wondering that pretty much constantly for the last twentyfour hours when the private investigator hed hired had told him where he could find her ive found your tamsin dexter shes twentyseven shes single and shes working as a tree surgeon with the australian national parks service shes currently working in the national park behind bundanoon bundanoons on the canberrasydney highway so if you take an hour or so after the canberra reception you could find her the private investigator had come with excellent credentials but marc had reacted with incredulity how could a tree surgeon be sister to a woman such as lara it didnt make sense it must be the wrong tamsin dexter hed decided and hed sworn in vexation at the potential waste of time he needed to work fast but the government reception in canberra had been unavoidable as broitenburgs head of state marc would step on too many toes if he visited australia and refused it soif he had to attend it wouldnt hurt to detour through bundanoon and see if he could find the woman now he stared upward and it was as much as he could do not to gasp out loud tamsin was slim and wiry andtough he decided or maybe serviceable was the best way to describe her she was dressed in workmanlike khaki overalls and ancient leather boots the boots were the closest thing to him swinging back and forth above his head they were battered and torn and the laces had been repaired with knot after knot what else she was young and obviously superbly fit her riot of jetblack curls was caught back with a piece of twine curls spread out to tangle glossily around her shoulders they looked as if they hadnt seen a brush for a week though that might be unfair if he was hanging where she was maybe his hair would look tousled as well he forced his gaze to move on assessing the whole package her skin was tanned and clearweathered almost wide clear eyes gazed calmly down at him and he found himself wondering what colour they were brown like her sisters he couldnt tell from here but what he could see was a perfect likeness of lara hell even the similarity made his gut clench in anger the detective had been right this was the tamsin dexter hed been looking for hed found her can i help you she was looking down at them as if they were the odd ones outwhich considering their clothes wasnt surprising she was still swinging from her harness reluctant to come down unless it was really necessary it was necessary i need you he told her why youre tamsin dexter yep still she made no sign of descent her attitude said she had work to do and they were interfering with it miss dexter this is his royal highness marc prince regent of broitenburg charles interrupted tugging his collar in anxiety he wasnt comfortable in this situation and it showed could you please come down what would the ramifications of being rude to royalty be the two men watched as she clearly thought about it and decided her best option was to swing a while longer hi she said at last to marcthe goodlooking oneand then she looked across to charles the podgy one with the sweaty collar if your friends a prince who are you im charles debourier im ambassador to dont tell me let me guess ambassador to broitenburg yes and broitenburg isumsomewhere in europe she grinned a wide white smile that was so totally different from laras careful painted smile that marc caught his breath at the sight of it what was he thinking she was too much like lara to interest him he told himself savagely and he didnt have time to waste thinking about women especially this one you dont know where broitenburg is charles demanded and the womans smile widened she had a huge advantage over themthirty feet in fact ive never been much interested in geography she told them and i left school at fifteen great she was laras sister and illiterate besides marcs feelings of dismay intensified broitenburgs bordered by austria on one side and germany on the other charles was saying but tammy was clearly unimpressed oh right come to think of it i have heard of it its small huh its an important country in its own right charles snapped i guess it must be to send an ambassador to australia she grinned again well it was nice to met you your highness and your ambassadorship and it was good of you to drop by but i have a job to do before dusk i told you marc said stiffly i need you shed been preparing to climb again but she stopped at that why do you have trees in broitenburg yes but im not interested in job offers she sounded as if she was serious marc thought incredulously she sounded as if she seriously thought hed travelled all the way to australia and come to find her in this outlandish place dressed in this ridiculous rig to ask her to look after some trees he hated it he hated this ornate overthetop uniform he hated charless damned ostentatious car and his chauffeur he hated royalty and the only way to get rid of it was via this chit of a girl im not offering you a job he told her stiffly and she stared then why im here to ask you to sign some release papers marc told her so i can take your nephew back to broitenburg where he belongs silence the silence went on for so long that it became clear there was lots going on behind it this was no void for want of anything to say this was a respite where all could get their heads around what had been said tammy had hauled herself up onto a branch and now she sat stock still staring down as marc stared back up at her she was accustomed to people hunting for her with job offerswhich was crazy as she didnt intend to leave australia ever againbut this was crazier still charles discovered there were ants crawling over one of his shoes and started shifting from foot to foot he glanced up at tammy and then at marc before returning his gaze to the ants annoyed or maybe to block out the silence he started stomping on them his action gave tammy more breathing space excuse me but those ants are protected tammy said at last almost conversationally as though the previous words had not been said at all youre in a national park the ants here have more rights than you do charles swore and shifted sideways onto more ants he swore again and cast an uncertain glance at marc and then when marc didnt speak he shrugged and headed for the car hed done his job he hadnt taken on an ambassadorship to stand under trees being bitten by ants i said i want to take your nephew marc said at last and tammy interrupted i know what you said but i dont know what youre talking about marc nodded hed expected as much thered been no wish to come to her sisters funeral thered been no contact made with the child if it wasnt for the immigration authorities he could pick the little boy up and take him back to his country right now she probably didnt even admit responsibility for him at the thought of henrys neglect he felt his face darken with anger if youd been in contact they would have told you id requested he be returned but they need your consent um she was regarding him as if he was slightly off balance who are they the childs nanny and the immigration authorities he snapped and now he could control himself no longer you cant object youve shown yourself to be the worlds worst custodian if i hadnt been paying the nannys salary hed be in foster care right now you and your sister and your motheryou should be locked up the three of you of all the uncaring he caught himself anger would achieve nothing he told himself grimly this woman didnt want the child it was enough that she signed the papers and he could be done with the entire mess im sorry he said stiffly but your sisters dead your mother doesnt give a damn and apparently neither do you all i want is the release papers you sign them for me ill take henry back to broitenburg and youll never see him again her look of confusion was absolute henry hadnt she even bothered to remember the little boys name marc thought back to the bereft little boy hed left in sydney and felt his anger rising all over again your nephew i dont have a nephew that took him aback he stared up at her of course you do theres no of course about it you must have mistaken me for someone else i only have one sisterlarawho i havent seen for years thats the way we like it last time i saw lara she was attached to a millionaire up on the gold coast and if youre asking me if she has children id say youd have to be joking lara would no sooner risk losing her gorgeous figure through childbearing than she would fly now if you dont mind it was absurd marc thought the whole scenario was absurd she was lifting a drill and any minute now shed turn it on drowning out his words with her noise but shed said her sisters name lara it confirmed what he had already been sure of this woman was laras sister but what had she said she hadnt seen her for years the anger faded dear god then she didnt know lara dexter was your sister is she snapped and he heard the sudden surge of fear behind her irritation he took a deep breath he hadnt expected this what the hell was the mother playing at if she really hadnt been told he stared up at the girl in the tree and thought where on earth did he go from here there was nowhere to go but forward there was no easy way to say what had to be said miss dexter im sorry but your sister was married to my cousin they were married three years ago jeanpaul and lara were killed at a ski resort in italy five weeks back they have a child henry whos currently living in sydney hes being cared for by a nanny whose wages ive been paying but his carehis care is less than satisfactory hes ten months old im here to ask your permission to take him back to broitenburg tammys world stopped right there she froze the drill in her hands seemed suddenly a stupid thing to be holding and she stared at it as if she didnt know what it was she had a makeshift bench set up on the branch she was sitting on carefully she laid the drill down and stared at it some more lara wasdead i dont believe you she whispered still not looking at the man below she was concentrating on the drill as if working out its function was the most important thing in the world there was a part of her that didnt want to move forward from this moment thirty seconds ago this stranger hadnt said any of this that was where she wanted to be back in time laradead im sorry he said and something inside her snapped im sorry too she flung at him im sorry about this whole damned mess i dont believe any of it you come here in your outlandish stupid costume like youre a king or somethingwhich i dont believewith your stupid chauffeured car and your tame politician and you stomp my ants and interfere with my work and tell me lara is dead lara is dead i dont believe it will you come down no she made to pick the drill up again but his voice cut through her confusion and her rage miss dexter you need to face this your sister is dead will you come down from the tree please she flinchedand she thought about it for about three minutes she simply sat on her branch and stared down at him he stared back his face calm and compassionate it was a good face she thought inconsequentially and maybe that was another way of avoiding acceptance of what hed just said kind strong determined his eyes were calm and sure promising that he spoke the truth she could accept or reject what he was telling her his eyes said that the truth was here for the taking the minutes ticked on and he had the sense to let her alone to allow her time to believe his face stayed impassive his eyes never wavered and finally she faced the inevitable she believed him she decided at last dreadfully she believed him despite the incongruity of the situationdespite the craziness of what he was wearing and what he was sayingwhat he was telling her was the truth and with that knowledge came the first ghastly wash of pain her little sister lara had wanted nothing to do with her for years lara and their mother lived in a world of their own that tammy had nothing to do with but for the first years of laras life it had been tammy whod cared whod acted as a surrogate mother as far as a child could because their own mother hadnt known what was involved in the job of mothering before lara was born tammy had nothing when lara had become old enough to join forces with their mother she had nothing again but for that short sweet while lara was five years younger than tammy twentytwo lara was dead a vision of the little girl shed loved and cuddled through her childhood lurched into her mind and with it came a pain that was well nigh unbearable the colour washed from her face and she put a hand on her branch to steady herself come down marc said strongly and tammy took a deep breath and came to a decision there was no going back she had to face it she swung her legs over the branch adjusted the harness and slid down she came down too fast tammy had been abseiling up and down trees since she was a child she could do it in her sleep but now she was almost past thinking and her hands slipped as she adjusted the rope she came down faster than she should havenot fast enough to hurt herself but fast enough for marc to step in urgently to catch her to steady her and to take her weight as she hit the ground which left her standing right against him his hands on her shoulders to balance her her slight body being supported by his stronger one strong strong described him absolutely she thought his whole body was rocksolid tammy was five feet six and slightly built diminutive in the presence of this much larger man hed caught her and held her without apparent effort and now he was staring down at her with the first trace of concern in his face are you okay she thought about it okay okay was a long way from how she felt right now his hands were gripping her shoulders and she had an almost overpowering compulsion to place her face on his chest and burst into tears no she hadnt cried for as long as she could remember and she wasnt about to start now im fine but her voice wobbled you truly didnt know your sister was dead she concentrated fiercely on the row of medals pinned to his chest she even counted them six the fabric of his suit was a fine worsted wool she thought nice she could bury her face in his chesthide from the pain that was threatening to overwhelm her you didnt know he said gently as he put her away from him still holding her but forcing her to look up at him his fingers were under her chin cupping her face to meet his eyes a girl could drown in those eyes a girl might want to anything but face this scorching ghastly pain imy sister and i have beenapart for ever she whispered we dont i see he didnt his voice said he was totally confused and tammy made a herculean effort to make her voice work my sister and i didnt get on im sorry dont be she let herself stay motionless for one more long moment as if drawing strength from the warmth and size of him then she hauled herself bleakly together and pulled away he released her but the way he did it was curious it was almost as if he was reluctant to let her go questions she had to ask questions she needed to knowbut she didnt want to she must you saidshe died in a skiing accident yes his face was still calm she was standing two feet back from him gazing up into his eyes as if trying to read him trying to find some sort of comfort in his calmness hhow they took out a bobsled his face tightened for a minute as if in anger they took it on a black runa run for experienced skiers only bobsledding in those conditions is madness im afraidim afraid theyd been drinking the knot of pain in tammys stomach tightened oh you fool she thought bleakly lara you fool it took an almost overpowering effort of will to go on so it was so hard to speak it was as if her voice didnt belong to her shelara was married to your cousin yes and your cousin died too jeanpaul died yes she couldnt see what he was thinking his face was still impassive was there pain there she couldnt tell im sorry i guess were both sorry he had a nice voice she thought dispassionately deep and rumbly it was tinged with what sounded almost like a french accent but it was very slight hed been well schooled in english she wasnt supposed to be thinking about this mans voice or maybe she was still using thoughts to distract herself lara was dead what else had he said they had a baby i cant believe that you dont know about this marcs voice was suddenly rough tinged again with anger that your mother didnt tell you my mother knows of course your mother knows i flew her to broitenburg for the funeral they were buried with a state funeral last month her mother would have enjoyed that tammy thought inconsequentially going off on another tangent as her mind darted back and forth trying to avoid pain she thought of isobelle dexter de bier as a grieving mother at a royal funeral isobelle would have done it brilliantly she could almost guess what her mother would have worn it would have been something lacy and black and extremely elegant shed have worn a veil and thered have been a wispy handkerchief dabbing at eyes that welled with tears that were never allowed to fall waswas she alone your stepfather came with her oh of course which stepfather was this tammy bit her lip anger welling isobelle didnt bother to marry her lovers any more which was just as well tammys mother had been up to husband number four when lara was born lara was dead lara was buried and thered been a funeral she should have been there she thought bleakly she should have been there as shed been there for lara since birth of all the things her mother had done to her maybe this was the worst to bury lara with only her mother you were fond of your sister marc didnt understand he was staring at her with the same confusion she was feelingmaybe even more so once she said brusquely a long time ago youve completely lost contact yes and with your mother do you think my mother would admit she has a daughter who was a tree surgeon that she has a daughter who looks like this his calm gaze raked her from the toes up but his face stayed impassive and his voice stayed gravely calm she couldnt tell what he was thinking i cant say he told her maybe not maybe definitely look i think i need time to take this in she was glaring at him now maybe her anger was misdirected but she needed space to come to terms with what shed learned have you got a card or something to tell me where i can contact you i need she hesitated but she knew what she needed to be alone shed learned early that solitude was the only solution to pain it didnt stop anything but alone she could haul her features back into control adjust the mask and get herself ready to face the world again can you just leave me be contact me tomorrow if you must but for now im sorry but i cant do that why not i need to be back in sydney tonight and then im leaving for broitenburg immediately marc told her ive brought the release papers with me you need to sign them then ill take henry back to broitenburg and let you have all the solitude you want chapter two he hadnt expected this marc hadnt known what to expect of laras sister but it certainly wasnt the woman standing before him she looked bereft he thought and he accepted that she really hadnt known about her sisters death which led him to isobelle their mother what sort of mother would not tell one daughter about anothers death it wasnt any of his business he told himself savagely his job was to get the papers signed and get out of here heaven knew a trip to australia at this time was a luxury he couldnt afford jeanpauls death had left a huge mess at home he needed to collect the child and go he just needed the signature but judging by the look of devastation on the face of the girl before him it was going to be tricky maybe he could just push the papers in front of her and say sign maybe she would she looked so shocked he could push her right over and she wouldnt fight back he shouldnt do ithe should give her timebut it was his country he was fighting for henrys country henrys inheritance and his own freedom i need you to sign he repeated this time more gently and he motioned to the car i have the papers here what papers the release papers i still dont understand what youre talking about she was standing as if shed been turned to stone her face was totally devoid of colour and he thought she looked as if she was about to topple over she looked sick he made an involuntary gesture of comfort holding out a handand then he pulled it away what was he thinking of he needed as little contact here as possible he couldnt possibly comfort this woman i need the release papers to allow me to take henry back to broitenburg she thought about that lara did have a child yes i didnt know she looked up at him her eyes bleak with shock i didnt know anything about a baby it was a despairing wail surely if shed had a child she would have contacted me if she was in trouble your sister wasnt in trouble marc told her she married jeanpaul and she had everything shed ever wanted a royal marriage servants luxury you cant begin to imagine she never would have wanted a child marc nodded that fitted with what he knew of lara but there was an explanation jeanpaul needed an heir he told her he was crown prince of broitenburg he wouldnt have married lara if she hadnt been prepared to give him a child tammy thought about that too and it almost made sense maybe with laras warped sense of values marrying royalty would be worth the cost of having a child she knew her mother and lara so well she knew the way they thought money and status were everything for lara to be a royal bride yes it was a price lara might well have been prepared to pay so she had a child henry yes but you said henry was here in australia in sydney lara sent him back to australia about four months ago why does it matter yes it does matter anger and sadness were surging back and forth and now anger won you tell me my sister married and had a baby and was royal and is now dead you tell me you want the baby and when i ask questions you say does it matter her eyes narrowed why are you here obviously my mother didnt think it was worth telling me of my sisters death and my sister didnt bother to tell me of her marriage or the birth of her child so why are you here now what are you demanding that i sign what does all this have to do with me marc took a deep breath he didnt want this he just needed a signature and then hed leave he had enough complications without this and looking at her face he knew a complication was looming right now your sister named you as henrys legal guardian in the event of her death he told her if henry was still in broitenburg it wouldnt matter but because hes here your department of foreign affairs say i cant take him out of australia without your permission it was all too much tammy stared at marc for a long long moment and then silently slipped her harness from her shoulders she lifted a radio handset from her belt she didnt look at marc doug she said into the radio and marc thought back to the foreman hed met down the road organising the rest of the teamtwo young women and an older man thatd be doug then the people in the big car who were looking for me she was saying theyve told me that my sister and her husband have been killed and their babymy nephewis alone in sydney can i leave my gear here and have you pick it up im going to sydney and i need to leave now there was a crackle of static and then a mans voice raised in concern yeah i know its the pits tammy said bleakly but ive got to go doug no i dont know how long ill be away as long as it takes put lucy onto the tree im working on now she has the skills but for now ill be in touch then she laid the handset on the ground with her harness she lifted a backpack that was lying nearby and heaved it over her shoulder it was an action that spoke of decision youre going back to sydney now she asked still with that curious detachment yes but but nothing she told him take me with you take you to sydney yes why its obvious isnt it she snapped you tell me i have a nephew and im his guardian he doesnt need you that was blunt she paused and bit her lip so he has someone who loves him she demanded and it was his turn to pause he has peoplea nanny whos caring for himand once i have him back to broitenburg ill employ someone thoroughly competent competent the word hung between both of them and marc immediately knew that it wasnt enough thats not what i asked she said he knew what she meant but was helpless to offer more i why on earth did lara send him home i dont know he admitted honestly it seemed odd to me but jeanpaul and lara were in paris four months ago then they were in italy and switzerland ive seen neither of them since just after the child was born it wasnt until after their death that i knew the child had been sent to australia the child that was a mistake the brief description was chilling even to him and it made everything suddenly worse bleaker marc thought about it and amended it henry he said gently and tammy flushed yeah henry the child how old did you say he is ten months and hes heir to some royal thing yes and so you want to take him back to broitenburg so he can be looked after by nannies in the lap of luxury until hes old enough to be king prince marc corrected her broitenburg is a principality prince then whatever she said distractedly it makes no difference are you married what you heard are you married no i so who gets to play mother to henry i told you hell have nannies the best but as legal guardian i get to decide whether he goes or not shed cornered him he hadnt wanted to admit it get her signature and get the child at home it had seemed easy if you refuse to let him return to broitenburg ill apply for custody myself he said stiffly you do that youre going home tomorrow did you say good luck getting legal custody by then he took a deep breath trying to control his temper thered been no one near the child for months and now this until five minutes ago you didnt know of the childs existence you cant want him so why do you want him hes part of the broitenburg royal family a very important part he has to come home but maybe hes my family too tammy muttered she swung open the front passenger door of the limousine and tossed her pack on the floor then she climbed in after it sat down against the luxurious leather and stared straight ahead refusing to look back at marc maybe he needs me as i see it its up to me to decide so are you going to take me to sydney or are you planning on making me catch a bus either way im signing nothing until ive seen himand maybe not even then it was an incredibly strained journey how could she just pick up her pack and leave marc wondered most womenall the women hed ever metwould have taken hours to prepare hours to decide but tammy appeared to have everything she needed in the battered pack at her feet and wanted nothing else i have a tent a sleeping bag a toothbrush and enough food and water for twentyfour hours she told him when he enquired how she could just leave her work and make the journey to sydney without further fuss we were planning to camp out tonight so now youre planning on camping somewhere in sydneys parks he asked and she glowered and went right on staring straight ahead ill get a hotel you neednt worry about me just show me where my nephew is and ill look after myself im not asking any favours from you he was right up there with all the people whod failed to tell her of her sisters death and the existence of her nephew he thought grimly her loathing sounded clearly through the tightclenched words he was useful as a tool for getting her to see her nephewnothing more so how the hell was he to get her to sign release papers itd have to be money he thought as he sat back beside charles and the big car nosed its way towards sydney she looked as if she didnt have a penny to spare her sister had married for money money would no doubt buy henry for him he had to play it right though he had to give her time to settle if he offered money right at this minute she might throw it back at him just to spite him no let her see the babytell her how much it cost to pay for decent childcaregive her time to realise how impossible it was for her to keep the child in australia could he do that in one night he must he thought he must he had to get home the problems jeanpaul had left were massive if he wasnt careful the entire monarchy would crumble that would be okay if there was a decent government to take its place but jeanpaul had been running the country like a miniature despot for years milking it for every penny he could hed manipulated the parliament so that politicians were paid peanuts and if you paid peanuts you got monkeys there had to be major political reform and the only way to do that was to ensure the continuity of the royal line which meant getting henry home but it was so complicated he hadnt realised lara had registered henrys birth in australia he hadnt thought lara would have had so much gumption the knowledge had shocked him but henry now held dual citizenship the australian authorities wouldnt let him leave without tammys sayso so what was supposed to have been a flying visit to collect his small relative was turning into a nightmare tell me whos looking after him tammy asked from the front seat and he had to force himself to think about his response a nanny i know what she is tell me about her im sorry but you dont know shes an australian girl marc said reluctantly knowing that what he was saying wouldnt reflect well on any of them i employed her through an agency after the woman who came here with your mother left my mother lara sent henry back here when your mother last visited her i gather your mother saw them in paris when henry was about six months old when your mother came back to australia lara asked her to bring henry with her my mother tammy swung around to stare at him in incredulity my mother would never agree to look after a baby no they agreed about that marc thought about what he knew of isobelle and his lip curled in contempt henry came with a nanny from broitenburg your mother installed them in an expensive hotel in sydneywhich lara was supposed to pay forand left them then it seems the nanny wasnt paid shed been given a return flight to broitenburg so she left the first i heard of it was last week your mother had assured me at the funeral that henry was being cared for in australia and i assumedi assumed he was with your family the assumption was stupid the next thing i heard was a message from your department of social services to say henry had been abandoned i managed to employ an australian nanny through an agency here set them back up in a hotel and came as soon as i could there was a sharp intake of angry breath and then more silence what was she thinking marc thought but he knew what hed be thinking if it was him receiving this news he knew what he had thought when hed received the phone call from australia saying henry had been abandoned hed been stunned hed known isobelle had taken the little boy back to australia and hed assumed that shed had his care in hand but his phone call to laras mother had elicited exactly nothing the childs arrangements have nothing to do with me isobelle had told him when hed finally tracked her down she was somewhere in texas with her latest man recovering miraculously from her daughters death and obviously far too busy to be concerned with her grandsons welfare yes the child and the nanny lara employed came back with me four months ago and i last saw them in sydney i assumed jeanpaul and lara had left the girl well provided for its no fault of mine if the wretched girls done a bunk marc had stood by the phone and had willedachedfor his cousin to still be alive so he could wring his selfish neck then hed set about doing everything to shore up the countrys political stability before hed come to find his cousins baby son heir to the throne and hed found this hell be well looked after from now on he said angrily his fury matching that emanating from the front passenger seat from tammy i promise i know he will be tammy muttered but she was speaking to herself not to him the hotel henry and his nanny were staying in was one of sydneys finest on the rocks in sydney harbour the limousine nosed into the driveway a uniformed concierge bowed and opened the door to marc then looked askance as tammy climbed out too there was a plush red carpet leading to the magnificent glass entry a waterfall fell on either side of the doorway over carefully landscaped rocks inside the wide glass doors tammy could see chandeliers and a vast grand piano the strains of chopin were wafting out over the sound of the gently tinkling water this was where marc had installed henry and his nanny money clearly wasnt an issue with his highness prince marc but she didnt intend to be intimidated tammy dumped her pack on the red carpet wiped a little dust from her overalls and looked about her with every appearance of nonchalance will you be all right charles had emerged from the car and was looking at marc with some anxiety he seemed to think tammy might somehow contaminate marc you dont wish to stay at the embassy tonight your highness ill be fine here marc glanced at his watch if you could collect me and the boy at eleven tomorrow the flight is at two ill do that with a last worried glance at tammy charles disappeared back into the limowhich left marc and tammy standing on the red carpet together a prince with his princess tammy looked marc up and down then glanced down at her worn boots and almost smiled almost smiling was actually a long way from what she felt like doing take me to henry you dont want to clean up first she glared at him then really glared how old did you tell me henry was ten months you think hes going to judge me because of a little dirt ino so whats the problem the concierge was still hovering holding the door for them to enter but by his expression tammy could tell that given half a hint hed grab her and haul her away she looked the type whod be annoying the customers not paying to be here its all right she told him im not about to mug his royal highness i just want to see my nephew she heaved her pack up over her shoulder and stomped through into the plush foyer leaving marc to follow marc stared after her for a long momentand then shrugged and followed the suite henry and his nanny were occupying was on the sixth floor marc knocked once knocked again and the door finally swung wide most peoples first instinct would be to glance at the viewfrom this position it was spectacularbut sydneys opera house and the harbour bridge beyond held no interest for tammy her eyes were all on henry she brushed past marc and was in the room before he was he was just like lara lara had been the loveliest baby tammys sister had been born with a fuzz of dark curls and huge brown eyes that had seemed to take over her entire face shed had a smile that could light up a room and here was henry and henry was just the same the only difference was that this little boy wasnt smiling he was seated in his cot beside the window watching the harbour below his eyes were wide and wary but there was no trace of the smile his mother seemed to have been born with as tammy and marc came through the door he turned to see who was entering his world but there was no hint of expectation in his eyes he looked like a child who had no one the nanny had been reading tammy saw a paperback had been hastily thrust aside and a daytime television programme was blaring the little boy was wide awake but he was simply sitting in his cot there wasnt a toy in sight his only distraction was the window and the nanny had been watching television and reading dear heaven tammy dropped her pack and was across the room in seconds gathering the little boy into her arms as if he was her own as her face nestled into the familiar curls as she smelled the familiar scent of baby powder andwell just babyit was all too much until this minute what marc was telling her had been a fairy tale but this was real henry was real for the first time in years she burst into tears the child didnt respond he held himself stiffly against her his small body rigid his expression didnt change at all slowly tammy pulled herself together she was aware that the other adults were watching her without commentthe nanny who looked about sixteen and marc their expressions were wary as if they didnt know where theyd go from here which was maybe just as well as tammy didnt know where she was going either there was a vast armchair beside her she sank into it perching henry on her lap so she could look at him properly the little boy gazed back up at her and then his gaze returned to the window windows were more important than people his expression said henry it was a faint whisper against his cheek but the child didnt respond he doesnt answer to his name the nanny said as if it was something tammy should know hes only ten months old that didnt make sense hes sitting up tammy said hed been sitting in his cot as they entered is he crawling yeah then surely he should know his name if hes crawling that means hes developing fine i guess the nanny said indifferently hes pretty advanced but he still doesnt respond does he say anything no why should he why should he indeed the little boys stare was lacklustre as if he was bored with what was before him maybe if tammy had been staring at the same view for weeks on end do you play with him tammy asked and watched as the girl cast a furtive glance at her novel of course i do of course nothing her fury was mounting until she felt like hitting out she was hugging the little boy to her and that stopped her raising her voice but her fury was barely disguised in her whisper this isnt normal ill get him a proper fulltime nanny when we return to broitenburg marc told her and tammy could hear the uneasiness in his own voice he knew what the problem was kylie was employed via an agency and the situation was urgent i was lucky to get her at short notice so hes been with kylie or someone like her since his parents died tammy was stroking the little boys curls trying to find some sort of response from him or longer has he been with nannies since birth id imagine so marc told her i dont know does anyone know she rose then standing to her full five feet six inches and glaring at the pair of them she held the baby against her as if she was prepared to battle the world on his behalf does anyone know anything about how my nephew has been cared for hes obviously been fed and clothed has anything else been done i anything at all tammys rage was threatening to overwhelm her have you ever seen anyone give this little boy a hug has anyone ever played peekaboo with him has anyone loved him marc bit his lip he was on the back foot here and he knew it hell be looked after when he gets home no she snapped or at least not by you he wont nor any of your nannieseven if you have nannies by the thousand if laras named me legal guardian then i can only be thankful henrys at home right now hes staying in australia and hes staying with me thank you very much for bringing his situation to my attention prince whateveryournameis but i dont think we need trouble you further if i can just collect his things ill take him now but im his legal guardian the rest of you can go to hell chapter three she wasnt budging tammy didnt release the child for a moment almost as if she feared if she put him down marc would snatch him from her she held him tight and moved around the room collecting anything that looked like his and tossing it into a heap on the armchair can we talk about this marc demanded and tammy shook her head theres nothing to talk about you cant take him watch me you cant afford to keep him that stopped her she whirled to face him her face rigid with fury no she snapped i cant afford to keep himlike this she motioned around her at the fivestar luxury and the glorious views but if you think this is what he needs then youre mistaken he doesnt need money he doesnt need nannies and views and room service he needs hugs and cuddles and someone who cares which youve shown very clearly that you dont i do yeah pull the other leg it plays jingle bells will you slow down she was tossing a packet of milk formula onto her pile with such ferocity that it bounced onto the floor no please no have you thought it through how can you look after a baby i can look after a baby better than you you obviously dont have the money for decent childcare who says i dont another formula packet hit the first and suffered a similar fate marc leaned over and retrieved both packets setting them side by side on the chair behind them the nannykylielooked on with wideeyed wonder you dont have spare money i just need to look at you to tell mistake bad tactical error there was one packet of formula open tammy lifted it up stared at itand then threw it straight at marc it sprayed out in all directions covering him with a white misting powder the parcel hit him midchest and slowly slid to the floor the action shocked them all tammy stopped dead and stared at the whitedusted man before herand then she winced im sorry she said at last i shouldnt have done that its my best uniform he told her but was that a slight quiver in his face surely not surely he couldnt be close to laughter and why did she suddenly feel she was fighting back the same emotion i guess you have hundreds more at home she managed and he nodded yeah but theyre at home gee youre going to have to travel home like that then i do have other clothes brocade and velvet and the odd crown and stuff she agreed im not always dressed up in this rig bully for you she purposefully turned her attention away from his powdercoated formand the sudden and unexpected gleam of laughter in his dark eyesand concentrated on her pile again fiercely do you have anything i can put these things in i have no idea he was watching her fascinated kylie do we have anything we can put these things in i dunno kylie said resentfully the nanny was looking more confused by the minute if shes taking the kid does that mean you dont want me any more his aunt has authority to care for him ill pay you to the end of the month marc told her and her face cleared all right then im fed up with this job anyway she beamed at tammy as if she was releasing her from a life sentence and began to be helpful theres suitcases in his bedroom youre not his aunty tammy are you tammy paused yes she focused on the girlsort of it was actually really hard not to stay focusing on marc the dangerous gleam was still in marcs eyes he might look ridiculousa prince with powder coatingbut he still packed a lethal punch big and handsome and magnetically attractive but she needed to concentrate on what the nanny was saying you knew about me she managed theres this letter addressed to you its in one of the suitcases a letter from who i dunno kylie said i saw it when i packed away the baby stuff hed grown out of its addressed to a tamsin dexter and underneath is written aunty tammyin quotation marks like the titles a bit of a joke theres no address or i would have posted it fetch it marc told her his eyes resting on tammy he was clutching at straws now this might buy him some time somehow he needed a way of talking this woman into seeing reason and it was growing less possible by the minute tammys anger was still firing her actions and the worst part of it was that her anger was reasonable henrys treatment made him furious himself sure kylie cast an uncertain glance at the pair of them and flounced out of the room fetch the whole suitcase tammy called after her i need to pack this stuff okay but the girls voice was muffled she was already foraging in what must be enormous storage cupboards this was some hotel marc and tammy were left glaring at each other the only thing between them one little boy henry gazed back and forth between this unlikely pair of adults his face showing no emotion at all you cant just take him marc said conversationally and tammy raised her eyebrows in polite disagreement yes i can you said hes an australian citizen and im his aunt and his guardian youre not even his uncle no but but nothing blood counts your mother has given me permission he told her but even he knew he was clutching at straws the more he saw of tammy the more he realised that she was intelligent and she discarded his statement before he could finish saying it my mother would promise anything if money was involved if lara made a will naming me henrys guardian surely thats what matters marc took a deep breath fighting for words look miss tammy tammy said pleasantlyand waited tammy can we at least discuss this thats what im doing youve already made up your mind to care for my nephew yes i have i dont have a choice because i dont see that anyone else is doing it i promise youhell be looked after in broitenburg by nannies no kylie isnt a good example shes not is she tammy agreed politely she picked up the book kylie had been reading and grimaced the vampires slave a little bedtime reading for henryi dont think you can see as well as i can that theres been minimal attention paid to henry hes had his physical needs met and thats all and yet you employed her i was desperate i had to find someone fast and i was on the other side of the world and it took you weeks to come and check on him great good worrying well now hes in his aunts care so you dont need to worry any more you dont understand i need him she raised her eyebrows at that you need a baby yes why hes the heir to the throne she thought about that for a whole two seconds before rejecting it entirely as a reason for anyone needing a baby then he can be heir to the throne right here she told him im not giving him back he can ascend to the throne or whatever he has to do when hes old enough to choose for himself but youthe lot of youhave shown yourselves to be incapable of caring for a baby and youre capable he demanded goaded strangely enough yes she flung at him im even experienced i dont believe you well there you go then distrust on either side we make a perfect pair this was getting out of hand can we at least talk he said urgently stay here tonight ill pay for a night for you in this hotel tammy took a deep breath anger was threatening to overwhelm her gee she said as if awed in this hotel a proper bed with sheets and everything theres no need to be sarcastic theres no need to be patronising you need to stay somewhere she did his words made her hesitate her fury and her grief made her desperate to be alone but henry was cradled against her his belongings were piled on the armchair but she needed more than his possessions she needed to find out everything about the child she intended to take care of things like immunizations allergies maybe this man didnt know but somewhere there must be records maybe she couldnt flounce out of his life quite yet he could see her weakening and pressed his point stay tonight kylie can keep the child and well talk if you call henry the child one more time she said carefully then ill walk away and never look back henry is henry she hugged him closer hes his own little person and its time everyone started treating him as such so no kylie isnt going to look after henry ill look after henry but we need to talk then we talk with henry i cant cant incorporate a baby into your busy schedule too bad she looked around as kylie appeared with the suitcase thanks she sat on the floor perched henry on her lap and started tossing belongings into the case she handled henry as if she coped with a baby all the time what on earth was her story marc wondered what was her background did she have kids of her own the investigator had said she was single but he knew nothing about her she was still in her filthy overalls but already henry was relaxing against her leaning against her breast as if hed found himself somewhere that might be home and looking down marc felt a tug of something he didnt recognise this woman was as far from his world as any woman had ever been he thought all the values hed been brought up to hold dearall the values the women in his world set store bythey simply didnt matter to tammy he had to persuade her to release the baby he must she wasnt going to do it the impossibility of the situation crowded in on him and for a moment he closed his eyes in sheer desperation when he opened them he found tammy looking up at him with curiosity youre in real trouble then she asked and for the first time there was a trace of sympathy in her voice he might as well be honest he had nothing else to lose im in trouble she regarded him for a long minute and then seemed to come to a decision give me couple of hours alone with henry now she told him and then ill stay in this hotel tonight ill take a room here and after i get henry to sleep we can have dinner together is that okay it wasnt okayit wasnt nearly enoughbut it was all he was going to get fine great she threw the last of the things in the suitcase and jammed it shut then took the letter kylie was holding and looked at it with something approaching fear she stared at itand then shoved it into her backpack as if it might contain poison okay lets get me shifted into another room and well go from there you can stay here marc said stiffly theres no need to hire another suite im paying for this place to the end of the month im not staying in your suite tammy said firmly i have enough to pay for myself theres no way im being dependent on you your highness ill take my own room and ill see you at seven tonight not before and that was that as seven approached tammy was more confused than ever confused that was an understatement her head was spinning grief and anger and shock were tangling in her mind like some horrible grey web not letting her go but underneath underneath there was henry nothing else mattered she thought shed booked herself a bedroomnot the suite marc had tried to book for her but one shed chosen herself even in her much more modest room the bed was kingsized tammy perched herself and the baby in the middle of the bedclothes and simply sat with him she hugged him and crooned to him and tried and tried to make him smile he watched her with enormous eyes as if she was a part of his windowsomething to be regarded with vague interest but not interacted with she ordered baby food from room service and a grave waiter appeared with a tiny bowl of stewed apple she sat henry on her lap and his mouth opened like a little bird he was obviously accustomed to being fed but not like this she played aeroplanes with him as shed once played aeroplanes with his mother he looked at the spoon she was waving in front of him as if it had betrayed him he was obviously accustomed to being fed efficiently and fastnothing more undeterred tammy kept right on playing she turned him around so he was facing her and the spoon was spinning nope henry you have to catch the aeroplane here it is whoooooo the spoon spun in circles in front of his eyes touched his tongue darted away again and then swooped in tammy giggled and henrys eyes moved to her as if she was the most mysterious creature hed ever seen lets do it again shall we she asked still laughing and the aeroplane started its tortuous circle again and on the fifth swoop henrys eyes lit with what tammy hadnt yet seen a tiny gurgle came from deep within his throat and his rosebud mouth curved up into a smile and tammy reached out to hug him in delight and darn near burst into tears again this would work her world had been turned upside down and she wasnt sure where she was but one thing she was sure ofwherever she went there went henry she cradled him until he slept and then finally reluctantly set him down in the hotel cot he needed toys she thought he neededsomething there hadnt been a single toy in that cold huge room she could hardly bear to take her eyes from him but it was sixthirty reluctantly she showered and changed into clean jeans and a tshirt which was all her backpack provided then hauled a comb through her washed curls and settled down to wait for marc and to read her letter it was from lara written four months ago it had been stuffed in the suitcase and left unread for all this time it was important she was rereading the letter for the third time when a knock at the door announced marcs arrival for a moment she considered not answering but thenhe had brought her here she thought he had paid for a nanny for henry if it hadnt been for marc then tammy might never have learned of henrys existence the letter might have stayed unread for ever henrys fate didnt bear thinking of she set down the letter and crossed to open the door fury still her overriding emotion but the man on the other side of the door took her breath away for a moment she forgot all about her anger whew his royal highness prince regent of broitenburg dressed in royal regalia was really something but just plain marc casually dressed in jeans and an opennecked shirt was something else entirely his hair was now ruffled and curled his grey eyes were smiling the laughter lines on his tanned face creasing into deep and delicious crinkles his smile was questioning and his eyes searched the room until he found the sleeping henry whew indeed he made her want to take a step back or maybe he made her want to take a step forwardbut she wasnt going into that henrys asleep already he was still smiling and it was a smile that made a girls heart do crazy things in her breast it was some smile yes her voice was more brusque than shed intended and she fought for something polite to say come in thank you i brought something for henry he lifted his hands and there was a soft golden teddy bear he smiled at the expression on tammys face and her confusion tripled howhow did you know thats what he needs im not totally insensitive he said gravely no matter what you think of me whatever shed thought of him had suddenly changed this was a surefire way to defuse anger its perfect she took the stuffed toy from marcs hands and eyed the bear with wonder there were teddies and teddies but this one he was small and built so he was deliberately sort of scraggy his stuffing was soft his arms and legs were a bit loose and skinnyjust perfect for a little one to hold on to he had a lopsided grin and already he had a much loved look about him for the first time since shed met marc tammy felt herself smiling where did you find him she asked on my twentysecond toy store he told her or maybe not that many but it sure felt like it did you know there are a whole heap of very unsatisfactory teddies in the world there are indeed she said unsteadily trying to swallow her emotion she carried the teddy across the room and placed it next to the sleeping henry hes just perfect oh marc but marc was distracted the room hed entered wasnt to his liking suites have separate bedrooms he said looking round in disapproval this room had a bed and a cot and a tiny table and chairs tucked into an alcove by the window as a dining room it was hardly satisfactory the phone call i madei thought i made it clear to the management that you needed a suite i changed the booking she said brusquely i want this one but im paying no she bit her lip her pleasure from the teddy fading as the conflict reemerged i told you im paying im not being any more beholden to you than i need to be he stared at her as if hed never met her like in his life she met his look head on unflinching and tilted her chin in an almost unconscious gesture of defiance and a glint of laughter flashed behind those deep grey eyes prince marc of broitenburg was amused the peasants were clearly revolting and royalty was pleased to indulge such idiosyncratic ways ummaybe we could get a hotel babysitter and go down to the dining room his laughter only had the effect of increasing her tensionmaking anger surge im not leaving henry she told him and watched his smile die it was all very well for the peasants to revolt it seemed as long as it didnt interfere with this mans plans the dining room would be more sensible he told her no miss dexter youre not taking him she whispered and they were no longer talking about where they intended eating dinner i dont care who you are and i dont care how many teddies you buy him hes staying with me its imperative for the country that he returns marcs laughter had disappeared entirely tammy hadnt been laughing in the first place and she wasnt laughing now its imperative for him that he stays with me she told him hes ten months old and he hardly knows what human contact is i can provide the very best in childcare you dont get it do you she snapped you cant buy someone to love a child i dont have your resources but but he wasnt listening his needs were urgent and he wasnt interested in the issues driving her he couldnt allow himself to be look if its a matter of money its not im extremely wealthy he told her as if he hadnt heard her if im prepared to guarantee his welfare to have child psychologists give him continuous assessment and to give you this he held out a slip of paper a cheque tammy looked down at itand stared how many zeroes this was more wealth than she believed possible what on earth was happening here this man might be so goodlooking he made her gasp and he might have a smile to melt ice but all she felt was fury she thought back to the letter shed just read and a cold hard knot of anger settled and stayed deep within money this had all been about money from the first henry himself was the result of a desire for money and prestige and power and here was this man offering more you could retire on what im offering he was saying you could stay in places like this all the time youd never have to work again she took a deep breath and breathed again then her eyes flickered from the cheque to his faceand he was smiling the man actually had the gall to be smiling he expected her to accept and at that the knot of pain and fury stretched and snapped she lifted the cheque he was holding out read it carefully as if she needed to memorise the crass insensitivity of his action and then ripped it into a thousand pieces she let them fall onto the luxurious carpet she stomped on them with her bare toes and then she stared up at him her face a mixture of hostility and defiance he still didnt get it he was staring back at her as if he didnt understand and her fury was still there the knot was coiling again and there was nothing else for it she lifted her hand and she slapped shed never slapped a man in her life shed never slapped anyone and now in the course of three hours shed thrown baby formula all over him and shed hit him she didnt care get out she whispered choking on her fury as she hauled open the door get out if we never see you again itll be too soon you and your damned family and your stupid money what he was holding his face as if he couldnt believe what shed done the peasants were indeed revolting with violence you killed my lara she was stammering with rage you took her life you she raised her hand again but he was before her seizing her hands and dragging them behind her back a middleaged couple were walking along the hall to their suite and they paused in concern is everything all right the man asked and marc swore through gritted teeth pushed tammy back into the room and slammed the door now see what youve done spoilt your reputation i cant believe youve never been hit by a woman she was verging on hysteria but she couldnt help herself believe it or not i havent until now what the hell are you saying about my family ive read the letter from my sister sent to me four months ago so she was sending henry to me he was still holding her hands behind her she was pulled in hard against him but whether or not it was to stop her striking him she didnt know she was past thinking of his intent her attention was fully on the contents of that dreadful letter lara was frightened she was in way over her head her husband was taking drugs they were running with a crowd she couldnt control he was always drunk i know that his words shocked her you know it jeanpaul was a mindless arrogant twit he said grimly hed been overindulged since birth he was an alcoholic by the time he was eighteen if youre thinking he changed after your sister married him then think again she knew exactly what she was getting into tammy flinched then why why did she marry him marcs lips compressed into a smile that held no humour at all he stared down at the ripped pieces of cheque littering the floor and shook his head lara would never have done that ripped your cheque ripped anyones cheque she and your mother i remember them at the wedding they thought theyd won the ultimate trophy and all theyd won was jeanpaul shed won the chance to be a princess it came at a cost she was staring up at him her breathing coming way too fast he was still holding her but absently he didnt know his own strength she thought he held her as if he could take on three of her he probably could let me go she breathed and he stared down her and his dark eyes glittered with something she didnt understand will you hit me again probably then maybe i shouldnt let you go you could just leave she managed through gritted teeth thatd solve all our problems it wouldnt solve anything he stared down at her for a long moment they were so close she could feel his breath on her hair she bit her lip and stared straight aheadat the fine linen of his shirt his top two buttons were unfastened and his throat was tanned there was a trace of wisping hair on his muscled chest the way her body was reacting was crazy she thought frantically she needed every ounce of concentration to focus on henry and yet this man had the ability to sidetrack herto make her think about his body henry she had to focus on henry what did your sister say he put her away from him then with a rough little gesture that made her stumble his hands caught her againas if he hadnt meant to be so rough he righted her as hed right a doll then stood back and watched her i dont have to tell you i cant answer your allegations until i know what they are he said bluntly i think its time for the truth dont you i but she got no further there was an urgent knock on the door cutting through her attempt at speech damn marc said tammy didnt move are you expecting someone he demanded but still she didnt move is everything all right in there it was a loud male voice raised in authority miss can you open the door weve had a report of violence great security exactly what she needed tammy gave marc a look that was almost triumphant and marched to the door she swung it open to find two burly security guards on the other side miss dexter yes they looked past her to marc standing behind her is this man bothering you yes she should say yes she should have them drag him out of here so she could slam the door behind him and that would be that they could speak to each other through their lawyers we need to talk he said urgently as she hesitated she looked back at him which was a mistake his eyes were urgent and compelling and sending her messages she didnt understand why she managed and the urgency in his voice increased because you and i are all the family henry has because regardless of what you think of me i care because i have responsibilities i need to face and because henry has a heritage neither of us can avoid henry stays with me she said flatly as the security guards looked on can we organise a babysitter and talk over dinner no do you want us to remove him one of the security guards said and still she hesitated there was so much she didnt know she glanced back and found marc still watching her with the expression she was coming to know watchful and nonjudgmental shed thought when she first met him that he had a good face kind maybe she was wrongher wrist was tingling now from the force with which hed held herbut still he watched and she needed to come to a decision she thought fast forcing her confused mind to focus this was a fivestar australian hotel henry was an australian citizen marc could hardly drag the baby from her arms and remove him if he was planning on removing henry from the country illegally hed hardly have gone to the effort of finding her in the first place no this man was a head of state hed have to do things above board he could try and persuade her all he wanted she could afford to listen well have dinner she told him ill organise no ill organise dinner well have room service here in my room where i can watch henry she glanced back at the security officers and managed a smile well be fine she told them his royal highness has a temper but hes trying his best to fit into civilised society if he promises to behave then he can stay you guys are on call if he steps out of line again arent you there was a sharp intake of breath behind her but she didnt care serves him right she thought rubbing her wrist serves him right were at the end of the phone miss one of the guards told her clearly in this hotel they were accustomed to all sorts and violent patrons were nothing new dial or scream either way well be here in seconds but they werent speaking to tammy they were speaking directly to marc and their body language said theyd like to haul him out of there right now chapter four great great do you know what youve just done for intercountry relations marc demanded as the door closed these people know who i am and now theyre thinking im somewhere between godzilla and attila the hun as if i care you might not but i do were there reporters out there with cameramen attached they were both past fury now and moving on to a level they didnt know sparks were flashing off them like two electric cables coming into contact you could practically smell the burning are the press in this country interested in the doings of some tinpot prince i dont think so broitenburg is a tiny country i think you have an exaggerated idea of your own importance your highness she ended her words on a note of bitter sarcasm tinpot prince shed called him a tinpot prince the words hung between them with anger still driving her she turned her back to check henry the child was obviously accustomed to sleeping through noise now he snoozed on tiny lashes fluttering closed over his dark eyes shed wrapped him snugly in a blanket and he was using a corner of it for comfort sucking it in his sleep henry was the important one here she thought trying desperately to get her thoughts in some sort of order henry not some crazy foreign prince with an overblown idea of his own importance will you tell me what was in the letter marc asked and tammy whirled to face him again she had so many emotions spinning in her head it was hard to know where to begin his voice had calmed but she was still a long way from anywhere approaching calm he saw it his hands came up in a gesture that said he wanted to placate not inflame the situation further you must be hungry he said softly i know i am he picked up the room service menu and flicked it open let me order dinner for both of us and well eat and talk at the same time here of course here youve made that plain he managed a smile if i object your very efficient security officers will come and eject me theyll create an international incident and that will be that so im in your hands miss dexter she backed off a pace and glared why dont i trust that smile you can trust me he said so softly that she hardly heard but she did hear she looked at him for a long moment their eyes locked and she found her colour mounting this time it wasnt from anger you can trust me did she what was it about this man fine she stammered order only not frogs legs or kangaroo steak he said gravely agreed agreed at last we have consensus they might have had a consensus on dinner but they sat at either side of tammys tiny table and eyed each other as if either could produce a loaded automatic at any minute marc poured wine and tammy eyed that too with distrust no miss dexter he told her the wine doesnt contain poison and im not trying to get you drunk i wouldnt put it past you marc closed his eyes when he opened them the humour had gone there was bleak acceptance of where she was coming from what was in the letter id imagine you know i know very little he told her i had little to do with my cousin our families were not close how can you be prince regent if your families were not close i never expected to inherit the crown jeanpaul had an older brother franz who was killed in a car racing accident five years ago after franzs death jeanpaul inherited the crown with two cousins before me id never imagined it could come to me and i dont want it she frowned you dont want it believe it or not no so why theres no one else he said heavily except henry tell me what was in the letter tammy bit her lip she took a sip of the wine which was gorgeousmarc certainly knew how to order wineand thought about it the letter was intensely personal but maybe the time for keeping secrets was past she focused on the food for a bit lobster and salad and fries it was a combination that was just what she felt like at some level she was very very hungry but overriding hunger was the sensation that maybe she needed to be honest with this man thered been enough secrets my sister seemeddesperate she told him her letter sounds like she was way out of her depth she apologised for not letting me know about her marriage and her pregnancy she said our mother engineered her meeting with jeanpaul and pushed them both into marriage i can believe that i can believe it too marc said softly i hate to say it but your sister seemedwell she seemed a wimp i only met her the once at her wedding she was a fairytale princess but a wimp just the same lara always did what my mother wanted tammy said sadly from the time isobelle took any notice of her lara was her puppet fights are all that was ever between my mother and me from as far back as i can remember but by the time lara was ten or eleven she was beautiful and she was biddable isobelle schooled her well in the art of making it in the world by using men so jeanpaul would have seemed desirable isobelle used to call lara a princess tammy said and the old bitterness was still in her voice she wanted it so much my father was titled and moneyed and for a while isobelle thought shed scored a title for herself that was why she got pregnant with me but even after she had me my father refused to marry her it was a waste of a pregnancy so far as isobelle was concerned and maybe it explains why she hates me so much she hates you but tammy wasnt about to be sidetracked onto things that didnt matter isobelle married four times she told him lara was another pregnancy to force some man to marry her and she succeeded the marriage lasted for a whole eighteen months lara was like her obedience was her way of getting affection we did what our mother wanted or there was no affection at all marcs eyes watched tammy he knew what she was saying there was a lifetime of bitterness behind the words but he didnt comment he waited for her to continue and in a while she did anywayanyway as lara got older my mother dragged lara with her in her stupid schemes lara was too weak to see the pitfalls of the men my mother found for her according to her letter jeanpaul scared her but she was too spineless to do anything about it she let isobelle push her into marriage then when henry was six months oldthey were in paris and isobelle had dropped in for a flying visitlara went shopping and returned to find one of jeanpauls crazy friends trying to feed henry drugs jeanpaul thought it was funny that was enough to get through laras thick skull she wasnt bad she was justspineless so she sent henry back to australia with your mother she sent him to me to you according to her letter she asked isobelle to bring the baby to me tammy shrugged im the one whos dragged lara out of trouble in the past even though we were separated lara knew i wouldnt have refused but isobelle didnt bring henry to you no tammy shook her head still thinking it through how could she have brought the baby to me she would have had to find me for a start then she would have had to explain what was going on and i might have yelled at her it was far easier to dump henry in a hotel with his nanny and tell lara she couldnt find me or that i wasnt interested or she might even have told lara that i was involved in caring for him heaven knows she bit her lip and her face hardened isobelle will tell me marc looked across the table at her his face thoughtful so theres no love lost between you and your mother none laras hardly blameless surely a mother would have checked on her baby by the sound of it tammy said her voice fading to a whisper by the style of the writing it seems as if lara was out of it too he thought about that and nodded i wouldnt be surprised if id had live with jeanpaul maybe that would have been the only way i could face him he was that bad he was that bad my mother must have known he didnt respond there was no response to give for a while there was total silence your fries are getting cold he said at last and tammy caught herself iyes theyre good they are arent they she said and managed a smile he smiled back at her there it was again that smile it was a knockout it brought sunshine where thered been only blackness it seemed as if where there was this smile her world couldnt be all that dreadful not if this man was in it now that was a crazy thing to think she thought savagely this man and his family were the cause of all thismess henry her eyes slid sideways to the cot and marc followed her gaze its not a total disaster he said softly and her eyes swung back to him in surprise as well as everything else did he have the capacity to read minds why do you want him to go home she corrected herself to go back to broitenburg he must you surely dont want a child no but charles called you the prince regent so that makes you the ruler of the country right yes but but what he sighed refilled his wine glass and settled back like a man prepared to lay his cards on the table the country is in a mess he told her honestly jeanpaul behaved like an absentee landlord for years and so did his brother before him the governments corrupt everyone whos anyone has made themselves positions of power charles for example why does a country as small as broitenburg need an australian embassy it doesnt yet heres charlesbeing paid a sickening stipend driving the car you saw us in living in an embassy that would house a dozen families broitenburg is wasa prosperous little country yet when franz and then jeanpaul came into power it was bled dry by corrupt officialdom the whole thing needs a dose of salts and youre just the man to give it to them tammy said thoughtfully and marc grinned actually yes why bother she asked curiously why do you care its a wonderful country marc said softly i was brought up there and i love it my cousins didnt give a toss about it but broitenburg under my grandfathers rule was magic it breaks me up seeing whats happening now so so what so why cant you thunder in and kick some butt tammy demanded instead of throwing obscene amounts of money at me so you can spend the next twenty years babysitting why not just go home and rule theres a problem which is the succession is henrys not mine the constitution makes me a caretaker monarch when he reaches twentyfive the job is his tammy thought that through a twentyfiveyear reign and then honourable retirement it didnt sound bad to her that gives you twentyfive years of playing king she said thoughtfully isnt that enough if thats what i havebut i dont not at the moment my regency only holds true if henrys in the country if henry isnt living in broitenburg then i have no power at all tammy thought about that for a bit more she was still confused and as well she found she wasnt sympathetic she glanced over at the sleeping baby and the thought of henry inheriting a crown seemed little short of ridiculous monarchies were all very well she decided but she was a modern girl an australian did a country really need a royal family you mean if henry doesnt return the country would revert to a democracy he shook his head his eyes bleak if it did thered be no problem but jeanpaul has left the place to be run by powerhungry despots i have no time to change things without a monarchy the country will selfdestruct and i cant let that happen help the more she thought about it the more she didnt like it not one bit so henry needs to go back henry needs to go back she glanced again across at the cot where the baby was still fast asleep he was so little he was soneedful youd put the countrys welfare above henrys i dont have a choice he said gently i swear hell be looked after he doesnt need looking after she blurted out he needs love illcare for him she stared up at him trying to read his face once again she read sincerity this was a man doing what he thought was best what was there in it for him the regency twentyfive years of playing ruler of the country she thought and the idea hardened her heart if henry didnt return this man would be nothing ive told youi dont want this he told her and she stared what youre thinking i want henrys return to ensure my own power base but its not true i never wanted power i dont want it now if leaving henry here meant broitenburg could move into a progressive democracy then id leave him you must believe that i but it wont happen he told her overriding her interruption as he tried to give her a sense of his own urgency the officials are ruining the country were a great little country but whole industries are moving away because of government corruption good peopleskilled peopleare leaving broitenburg because their skills go unrewarded he leaned towards her then his voice still urgent and his eyes not wavering from hers as prince regent i can change things he told her the crown has powertoo much powerbut in the short term that can be used for good i can curtail government corruption i can even rewrite the constitution so that the monarchy becomes more in line with the british traditionwhere the monarch exists to lead the people as an inspirational role not controlling day to day living tammy you must give me this chance i want my country to be the wonderful place it once was there was passion in his voice fire tammy looked across the table at marc and saw a man who believed absolutely in what he was doing this man wasnt corrupt she thought he was honest and he was strong and he cared there was a part of her that recognised something in him that was almost a part of her like twin souls for the first time she wondered about him really wondered what had he been doing before jeanpauls death where had he been was there a woman in his life where had that thought come from she gave herself a mental slap hauling her thoughts sharply into line this was hardly the time for wondering such things he was pleading for her to hand over her nephew she couldnt do it maybe when hes older tammy he needs to come home now his claim to the throne lapses forty days after his fathers death i have until friday using her name unnerved her still more once more she attempted to focus on what he was saying friday thats in four days yes but she shook her head bewildered why did you leave it this long to collect him i thought he was safe marcs hands clenched on the table before him at the funeral your mother told me he was being safely cared for in sydney she was so i know i know what my mother can be i assumed she was going back to him heaven knows whether she said it but that was the impression she gave she acted distraught at the thought of her grandchild being orphaned so i thoughti thought that hed be best staying with his grandmother i had to take urgent steps to ensure that i took control until henry came of age so i put henrys arrival down as something that could wait until the last minute i had no worries about himuntil i got the call from your countrys social services passion gave way to anger just like that isobelle had made herself an enemy of this man and the tone of his voice made tammy shudder what the hell was she thinking of he demanded the answer to that was easy herself marcs eyes flew to hers again you dont sound surprised isobelle suits herself she always has sitting around waiting for henry to grow up so she can be a loving grandmother to a twentyfiveyearold prince is hardly her style shell be off with her next millionaire now youre not in contact with her ill speak to her about this tammy glanced down at the letter and marcs anger was reflected in hers oh yes ill speak to her but meanwhile meanwhile you still need to take him he nodded anger fading to be replaced by determination im sorry but yes and im sorry but no i cant let you you must its a dilemma isnt it she told him broitenburg needs henry but henry doesnt need broitenburg you might be prepared to sacrifice one little boy for the greater good but i cant she bit her lip marc i dont need to be a psychologist to see that hes damaged already its so hard to make him react lara knew what was happening in her letter shes frightened not for herself but for henry she asks me to help she commits him to my care but but now im all hes got she said softly i cant give him a crown or a country and i cant save your political ideals all i can do is care for one little boy and thats what ill do her voice softened into compassion and she rose pushing her chair back from the table decision made im sorry marc id like to help you but i cant unless i know hell be loved i justcant he rose too he stood staring down at her for a long long moment reading the resolution in her face she wouldnt relent her face was grim and set implacable hed never met a woman like this he thought she stood barefoot and bereft of any makeup her shirt and jeans were worn and faded they were clean but that was all that could be said for them her stilldamp curls were trailing across her shoulders and he had the most impossible urge to reach out and touch one just one impossible the whole setup was impossible i think weve come to an impasse she was saying i thinkmaybe you have to leave theres one way out of this mess yes she raised her eyebrows in polite disbelief he thought about it for a long minute and the more he thought about it the more it seemed the only solution possible you could come to broitenburg with henry chapter five it was just as well shed finished her fries tammy might well have choked she stared at the man across the table as if he was out of his mind why would i want to come to broitenburg she said at last he smiled there it was again just as she had herself under controlalmostthat smile flashed out and it was enough to sidetrack her completely but she had to concentrate what he was saying was stupid why shouldnt you come to broitenburg because i dont want to have you ever been no how can i have been im not even sure where it is and there you are then its the most wonderful country mountains lakes castles its like the dordogne region of france only better fairytale country tourists love us youll love us she was still staring at him i wouldnt how do you know if you havent tried i live in australia she said carefully my career is in australia when i first met you he said thoughtfully you thought i was offering you a job i would never have taken it youd had other overseas job offers im a tree surgeon she told him not without a hint of pride im highly qualified despite leaving school at fifteen he was watching her across the table his eyes thoughtful i had a phone call this evening from the man i employed to find you hes come up with a lot more detail i know more about you now she flushed unnerved sso so youre probably the most knowledgeable tree surgeon in this country youve done university courses by correspondence so you have booklearning and practical experience youve even worked in europe i in the famous gardens of france and england you worked with the best man available lance hilliards reputation is second to none you talked him into taking you on for three years and at the end of it you could name your price as an international expert yet you came back here his calm eyes were probing questioning but why this was so none of his business i love it i can see that you do but why bury yourself im not a people person i can see that too he nodded taking her objection for granted but i can offer you as much isolation as you want and as much work if youre prepared to use your skills at the castle the castle the broitenburg palace sits in hundreds of acres of cultivated woodland he said softly its very beautiful the head groundsman would be delighted to have you work with him she shook her head in disbelief the situation was absurd it was as absurd as this man was unsettling this is ridiculous why is it ridiculous because im staying here she flashed a look at the sleeping baby and then glared back at marc im staying with henry you can hardly take henry back with you into the wilderness he said in a voice that was oh so reasonable oh so persuasive set him up in a tent at the foot of the tree youre working on i hardly think so ill take a break for a few months he agreed sure until your money runs out and then then she bit her lip i can get a city job in one of the botanic gardens i can put henry in a cr√®che ill fight you on that one the heir to the broitenburg throne will not be placed in a cr√®che anger flashed out at that how dared he its no different to being left with a nanny in broitenburg no but if he was left with you in broitenburg wouldnt that be much better for all of us i dont know what you mean think about it before she knew what he intended hed taken her hands tightly within his his hold was urgent his eyes met hers and held and the warmth and strength and urgency of his hold were compelling all by themselves tammy the royal palace of broitenburg is a wonderful place to live he told her all your living expenses would be covered we could find a really good woman to help look after henryyou could help me choose herand you could spend as much time with henry as you liked you could choose to be a lady of leisure no or not he said smoothly and if you wanted to work id be willing to pay you double your current hourly rate more she was staring at him as if hed lost his mind you mean id live in the castle yes thats crazy shed seen plenty of castles in her time in europe and shed been fascinated by them but they were something out of the pasta lifestyle she had nothing to do with she looked down at the hands marc was gripping and winced her hands were scratched and worn weathered by the elements and by sheer physical work marc followed her glance and his hold on her fingers lessened he released his grip but traced the veins on the back of her hand up to her wrist the feel of his finger moving with such delicacy over her roughened skin was somehow compelling as if she was moving into a dream cinderella beneath the fairy godmothers wand she was being drawn into fantasyland whether she willed it or no it would work he told her his voice growing more urgent you could even enjoy yourself for how long she was so stunned she could hardly speak for as long you want for ever if you wish it until henry turns twentyfive and im no longer in charge and if i change my mind once henrys in broitenburg id never get him out there was no disguising the bitterness in her voice she didnt trust himwhy should she there was a long silence while he thought about it he was still tracing the lines on her hand hed turned her hand over and was fingering the lifelineas though he could read the future written there as if he could read the decision hanging over them both ill make you a deal he told her at last what sort of deal her tone was still laced with suspicion she was trying to block out the sensation of his handthe sensation of his touch she was using suspicion to camouflage it but she wasnt sure if she was fooling anyone the way he made her feel but he seemed impervious to the ripples of warmth the ripples of in truth she didnt know what they were she hadnt experienced anything like thisever ill buy you both return tickets to australia he was saying first class if i dont make you happy then you can come home any time you want if he didnt make her happy what sort of promise was that over there youll have different laws she managed youll have henry where you want i can give you solid assurances how she was being rude but there was no option she was fighting for henrys future and she was the only person to do it despite the way this man made her feel he watched her for a moment longer and then he sighed you wont trust my word no that was blunt i guess in your circumstances neither would i he grinned and his grin was as unexpected as it was gorgeous okay then miss doubter he hauled out his wallet and produced a couple of cards i have legal contacts he told her so far theyve been useless for anything but telling me i wasnt able to take henry home without your permission but this card is for paule taromehes broitenburgs chief magistrateand this card is for angela jefferson an australian expert in international law ill get paule to fax me an agreement saying you have all necessary legal permissions to return henry to australia at any time you wish angela will witness it broitenburg is subject to international custody laws if youre assured that im legally bound to return henry to australia whenever you want will that persuade you to give broitenburg a trial for all our sakes for all their sakes the phrase hung and hung still he watched her his eyes compelling somehow she met that look she gazed steadily back at marc and tried to read his mind she still didnt trust him she couldnt she mustnt she told herself fiercely no matter what strange things the feeling of his hand on hers was doing to her insides this was henrys future broitenburg depends on your decision he said lifting her hand again and holding it in his his touch was feathersoft pressuring but not pressuring if you refuse then thousands of my people will end up in poverty we need you i need you and henry needs you good grief tammy stared at the man before her and he gazed back as if he had all the time in the world for her to come to her decision henry broitenburg this man her life was about to change in the most momentous of ways she had a child and henry had a heritage like it or not if she agreed if it didnt work then she could return and bring henry with her marc would allow her to trial it and see if it was workable should she agree her head was spinning she felt so far out of her depth she was in danger of drowning and the concern in this mans dark eyes was her only lifeline she took a deep breath and made her decision okay she said ill come he let his breath out in one long sigh of relief and there it was the decision was made you wont regret it ill be the judge of that you wont regret it he said again i promise he released her hand and hesitated already thinking of the consequences of her decision ill need to make a few phone calls strangely he sounded as if what he really regretted was being called away right now and tammy knew how he felt there was a part of her that wanted to stay exactly where she waswith her hand in this mans which was ridiculous already he was working through the host of things he had to do before they left but as he walked to the door and then turned and looked back once more tammy sensed real reluctance to go goodnight he said slowly and she noddedan absurdly formal nod goodnight itll be okay yes there was a long silence why didnt he go tammy thought why was he just standing there he was looking at her with such a strange expression in his dark eyes that she felt her colour begin to mount which was ridiculous she stared down at her bare toes peeking out from the frayed cuffs of her jeans the silence went on and on and on and then before she could guess what he intended he swore softly and crossed to her side in one swift movement he gripped her shoulders with his strong hands bent his head to hers and kissed her it was a kiss to seal a bargain rather than anything else that was what she told herself what she assumed or maybe she was so surprised she assumed nothing his mouth on hers was firm yet it demanded no response he was asking nothing butif it was meant to be an affirmation of the future and nothing more then why did it have the capacity to send a zillion electric shocks straight through her maybe it was because it lasted too long she thought through a haze of incredulity at what was happening to her it lasted much longer than the intention of such a kiss should allow it had been meant as a seal on a contract and nothing more but his hands were suddenly gripping harder he was deepening the kiss letting his body possess her for just these few short moments she was rigid in his hold though her body was screaming to respond but disaster lay down that road tammys world had been turned upside down this day and the last thing she needed was physical arousal the last thing she needed was to respond to this man yet her body was screaming to do just that sense or nonsense her lips were aching to open and deepen his kiss her arms wanted to hold him to draw comfort from him to seek security and warmth and a lessening of this awful confusion and loss in his nearness in his body he felt wonderful shed never felt anything like this his sizehis malenesshis tenderness and his strength she was so confused she was near collapse and when he finally put her away from him holding her still but staring down at her in concern he saw the depths of confusion and misery in her eyes and he swore i shouldnt have done that i youve learned of your sisters death today he said grimly though his hands still held her maybe if they hadnt she would have toppled right over youve learned of your nephews existence and youve learned that you need to leave this country ill take care of you tammy i promise the tenderness in his voice was so unexpected it took her breath away she stared up at him and to her horror felt a tear sliding down her cheek he saw it and raised a finger to trace its path damn youre exhausted i shouldnt have hectored you like this tonight no i its because i dont have time to take this slowly he said ruefully im so sorry take what slowly the kiss arrangements he meant arrangements to leave the country the kiss had nothing to do with it did it the touch of his fingers on her face unnerved her even more tenderness was an unknown quality to tammy dexter and for good reason she didnt let people close to her ever she blinked back her tears pushed herself away from this strange enigmatic man and gave her face an angry swipe theres no need to be sorry its not your fault no but i need to go to bed she was so confused she was past thinking she might not want to go to bed but she needed to be alone desperately otherwise she might sink into marcs arms and stay never to move again the temptation was almost irresistible and the temptation was crazy her sister had fallen for one of these menthese princesand where had that got her dead that was where the thought of that was enough to steady her to make her take another step backward and to fix her features into a semblance of resolution leave she said youll be okay yes just leave and marcyour highnesswhatever i call you marc he said and he smiledwhich sent her resolution into a tailspin heading for oblivion marc then justdont kiss me again his smile deepened why not because i dont want you to are you sure she glared at him arrogant creep where was the tenderness now he was a prince for heavens sake royalty and she was a tree surgeon with bare feet and faded jeans and the worries of the world pressing on her shoulders so finally she tilted her chin and did what had to be done yes she snapped then stalked to the door and threw it open yes i am now will you leave or am i going to have to call my friends the security guards his smile was still in place im leaving good goodnight he walked past her she was still holding the door wide and as he passed he paused and tilted her chin then very lightly before she could begin to prevent it he touched her face again tracking the path of one of those errant tears im sorry i had to be the one to break this to you he said softly so sorry he smiled a tender magnetic smile of such sympathy that she felt her heart falter within her breast sleep well tammy dexter he whispered tomorrow our future begins his finger reached her lips and pressed lightly downa kiss but not a kiss and then he left her what had he said tomorrow our future begins her future until today tammys future had been so carefully planned but now she was leaving australia to travel to a future filled with castles and princes andshe didnt know what like it or not prince marc of broitenburg had given her a future she had no control over she closed the door behind him and stood leaning against it for a long time as if by doing so she could lock out his presence the memory of him the taste of his kiss be careful she whispered into the night oh tammy be careful maybe she shouldnt go maybe she didnt have a choice and maybe she was glad of it the memory of his kiss had changed more than her future it had changed her confidence in her own control help the next two days were crazy luckily she had her passport and a visa was no problem i do have a man at the embassy marc told her charles has to be useful for something besides spending my countrys money tammys boss was notified and the sound of dougs dismay overwhelmed her youve got a job with me whenever you want it he told her ill even hold the baby myself if it means i can get you back working for me again it warmed her tammy had worked for doug for three years and his workforce wasnt a standard forestry team doug actively encouraged women to work with him figuring rightly that in this very male world the only women who reached tammys stage had to be good mia and lucy and tammy were an odd sisterhood but along with the men they were the only real family tammy had ever known tammy had held herself aloof but the thought that doug and the team would actually miss hersomeone would actually miss herwas inexplicably comforting no one else would miss her they wouldnt even realise shed gone there was one really unpleasant call to her mother well of course i didnt bother telling you of darling laras death isobelle told her and tammy could hear the sneer in her voice why would i its not as if you cared for your sister how little you know tammy thought but she managed to hold her tongue im taking henry back to broitenburg she said and there was silence at the other end of the line she could hear isobelles mind shifting from defence to speculation you meanwith that prince whos ruling the place now whats his name marc well well the sneer in isobelles voice grew even more marked and tammy wondered for what must have been the millionth time in her life just why was it that her mother hated her so much youll never get him i beg your pardon he might be a catch but you dont seriously think you can succeed i dont know what youre talking about but she did of course she did her mother had a onetrack mind men were a means to an end youre not pretty enough i dont and he has women ive heard all about your precious prince marc hes a womaniser hell eat you up and spit you out tammy thought about the metaphor and found it wanting he cant do both but isobelle wasnt listening to her pathetic attempts at humour the mans rich as croesus she snapped you seriously think someone like that would look at the likes of you okay shed had enough tammy thought bleakly shed let her mother know where her grandson was and that was the only thing she needed to do she thought of all the things shed intended to say and replaced the receiver on the handset without saying another word she had too much else to worry about there was the small issue of clothes she had jeans tshirts sweaters and a rain jacket it was hardly a wardrobe fit for living in a palace it was marc who raised the subject she hadnt even thought of it do you have a permanent residence somewhere he asked here in sydney can i send someone to pack for you maybe we could ship a container she stared what are you talking about a container of what your possessions if you intend to stay longterm you could ship my possessions in the bow of a very small rowboat she told him my permanent residence is a room in a boarding house and theres hardly anything there ill take a cab over this afternoon and close the place downgrab the few things i need but it is a few i figure i might buy a couple of new pairs of jeans when we get there that isif they have jeans in broitenburg yes but he was frowning but tammy was bouncing her nephew and didnt notice shed had henry chuckle twice this morning and she was working on a third but what we have formal dinners at the palace you have formal dinners at the palace she corrected him not me ive never been to a formal dinner in my life if i have a microwave in my room and theres a supermarket nearby then im happy his frown deepened i intend you to be part of the royal family not a servant im not intending to be a part of any royal family thank you very much henry will be brought up as heir she jiggled her nephew up and down and gave him a hug you know somehow i imagine henrys not really interested in formal dinner parties quite yet but marcs displeasure remained i want some things clear he told her youre coming over as a family member as such there will be formalities youll have to face she thought about it and was prepared to concede a point you mean i need to do something about my shoes she stared down at her bare toes and then glanced at the door where shed kicked off her boots okay she would have to replace those awful boots ill buy some trainers thats some concession she grinned why thank youyour highness his scowl deepened it wont work youre telling me i should go out and buy a tiara or two and the odd pair of stilettos before i get to broitenburg it might be best maybe not tiaras butsomething a little more formal than you have on now she shook her head nope she told him flatly theres no point broitenburgs had lara its had its fairy princess now its stuck with me he couldnt budge her and in the end charles drove them to the airport with a huge leather suitcase containing marcs belongings another containing henrys baby gearand a small battered backpack containing all that tammy possessed in the world chapter six it grew stranger for a start they sat in the pointy end of the aeroplane first class tammy had never sat in anything other than economy in her life marc had booked three seats there was a baby crib in front of them so henry could be put down when he needed to sleep there was room on the floor for henry to crawl and the stewards were on hand to cater for every whim but from the time tammy entered the aircraft she felt as if shed wandered onto the wrong movie set cant i go and sit in economy she asked i dont feel like im flying unless my knees are stuck into my chin stick your knees under your chin if you must marc growled but you stay here if you leave me with henry then ill go into a spasm she cast him a sideways look he was eyeing henry as if he might bite babies arent your thing huh they certainly arent not for the first time she wondered about him what was it her mother had said about him that he was a womaniser maybe but the description didnt quite fit here in the forced intimacy of the airliner facing a twentyfourhour flight there was all the time in the world to ask questions after all what could he do if he was offended kick her off the plane no way she decided he wouldnt even tolerate her going to economy so she could chance a few impertinent questions youre not married ive told you im not do you have a partner he raised his eyebrows at that a partner his dark eyes suddenly crinkled in amusement youre covering all eventualities here do i have a girlfriend a boyfriend or a dog okay she smiled back any of the above do you he thought about it for a minute and then nodded as though the question was a bit of an imposition but hed answer it anyway i have a girlfriend i see a girlfriend so what was he doing kissing her maybe her mother was right he was a womanizer she shouldnt mind she didnt did she what about you he asked his tone suddenly curious my detective says you have no one its hardly fair she complained i have to believe what you tell me you get me privately investigated thats what money is for he said equitably but as for me since ive succeeded to jeanpauls position you need hardly hire a private investigator any european womens magazine will tell you more than you ever wanted to know his brow creased you were in europe for three years i cant believe you wouldnt have heard about lara she was a real hit with the pressher wedding photos made the front of every major newspaper i would have been back in australia by the time she was married tammy said thinking her timeline through back up a gum tree your favourite place yes because because people hurt she said honestly getting attached hurts i tried with lara and look what happened yet youll try again with henry i have no choice you do have a choice i told you i was prepared to bring henry back to broitenburg by myself and your girlfriend what would she think of that ingrid is hardly a baby person and our relationship is hardly longterm but you know id take care of him yeah henry was on her knee sucking an ear of his newly acquired teddy with all the intensity of an athlete competing in a marathon henry and teddy had contracted a case of love at first sight and tammy suspected teds ear wasnt going to make singapore much less europe youd take care of him yes right she cast him a suspicious glance the man looked immeasurably sure of himself capable of anything capable of caring for babies then how about starting now she asked him and before he could demur she lifted henry across so that he was sitting on the knee of his highness prince regent of broitenburg his highness prince regent of broitenburg looked stunned to the socks ii cant you just said you could she closed her eyes with a determination she was far from feeling in fact she wanted to stay awake and watch but im going to sleep now your highnesses she told them both entertain yourselves to her surprise she did sleep and when she woke hours later the cabin lights were dimmed and the man beside her was asleep as well as was henry the little boy had fallen asleep on marcs knee the stewards had placed blankets over all of them from her cocoon of blankets tammy stared across in the dim light at man and baby sleeping together they looked warm and contented and very very much as if they belonged together they even looked alike henrys tiny lashes were fast shut in an exact replica of his princely cousins his head was tucked under marcs chin and outside the blankets marcs big hand had a tiny fist curled around one of his fingers the sight was suddenly almost too much for tammy she gazed at the pair of them and found a lump the size of a golf ball forming in the back of her throat damn what was it about this man that made her feel like weeping this man and this baby she knew nothing about him she thought desperately nothing except that he was prince regent of a small and lovely principality and he had a girlfriend called ingrid ingrid is hardly a baby person hed said was marc a baby person he hadnt seemed so yet sitting here looking at the way the little boy was snuggled into him it seemed there was a way into this royal heart he might seem ruthless and overbearing but henry was exposing a side she suspected had never been exposed before ingrid is hardly a baby person what sort of person was marcand what sort of household was tammy getting into it was a household so large that it took her breath away no she thought stunned it wasnt a house in any sense of the word the limousine swept them along the vast curved driveway and stopped beneath steps that could have graced the parliament of a great nation below the steps was a lake stretching away into the distance and above above their heads the castle soared skyward it was something straight out of a fairytale built of white stone three storeys high without its score of turrets and towers spiralling above it glistened with a beauty that made tammy catch her breath it wasnt ostentatiousor maybe it was but it was built with such grace and charm that ostentatious was the wrong adjective it could only be called beautiful nestled against a backdrop of magical mountains surrounded by exquisite gardens and woodland the scene made her want to jump from the car and explore right now she could scarcely take it all in in the foreground was the fairytale castle all spires and gargoyles and terraces away in the background there were traces of snow spiderwebbing down the grander of the mountain peaks the sun glistened down on the castles stonework making the ancient palace and its surroundings come alive with vibrant colour white swans were sailing across the lake in all their majesty the grounds swept on further than the eye could see this place had been neglected marc had told her but tammy could see no hint of neglect here magic her new home what do you think marc was asking and she turned to find him watching her with evident enjoyment she flushed i thinkits a ridiculous flaunting of wealth ouch pretentious really and she could no longer prevent herself from stating the truth she gazed around from the castle to the grounds to the lake and back to the castle again and its also very very beautiful she murmured and found marcs smile had faded it is he said slowly and for a moment as his gaze still rested on her face she wasnt sure exactly what he meant neither was marc but tammy couldnt dwell on marcs thoughts she had enough of her own to absorb she thought back to the shabby oneroom apartment that had been her base for the past ten years and had to pinch herself to believe she wasnt dreaming and when a uniformed butler made his stately way down the steps and held the car door wide for her she had to pinch herself all over again this isnt real she muttered and found that marc was watching her still his laughter had faded completely now and there was a strangely enigmatic expression in the back of his eyes its real welcome home the butler was saying with all the solemnity in the world and she closed her eyes and wondered what on earth she had got herself into welcome home indeed the staff were lined up to meet them it was like something out of a television show tammy thought dumbly walking along the line of uniformed staff to be introduced there must be twenty people assembled in the great hall marc knew each of them by name he greeted them with what seemed to tammy to be real friendliness i wont be able to remember anyone tammy stammered unhappily suddenly acutely conscious of her shabby clothes maybe marc had been right maybe one dress wouldnt have hurt or two we wont expect you to marc was smiling at her with the smile that had caused so much trouble was it that smile that had made her agree to this crazy journey but maybe youd better learn the most important this is dominic our butler and head steward and tammy this is mrs burchett an elderly lady was on the end of the receiving line she bobbed a curtsey to marc but her eyes were on the baby in marcs arms since the flight henry had moved back and forth between the two adults naturally and now he was cradled in marcs arms as if he belonged mrs burchett is our housekeeper marc was telling tammy as henry gurgled his own greeting and shes english anything you want to know ask madge itll be a pleasure madge burchett beamed her smile enough to lessen tammys feeling of intimidation all on its own oh hasnt the wee lad grown we havent seen him since just after his birth and youre his aunt her eyes raked tammy from head to foot and tammy could sense the comparison to her sister nothing was said though except youre very welcome thank you can i take you and the little one up to your rooms thats a good idea marc told her he tried to hand henry over to the housekeeper but the little boy clung marc disengaged his pudgy hands from around his neck and passed him to tammy madge if you can look after miss tamsin i surely can will you come this way please tammy cast an uncertain look at marc but he was already moving away from her hed have things to do she told herself a million things hed handed the baby over to the women hed played his part from now on his body language said he intended to lead a very separate life as if on cue there was a cry of pleasure from outside and a tall lithe woman about tammys age came striding into the hall shed obviously been out riding her outfit was pure dressagegorgeous her chestnut hair was twisted up into an elegant chignon her flawless skin was beautifully madeup and the smile she was directing at marc was truly something to behold she held a riding crop but she tossed it aside and ran straight into marcs arms marc darling how wonderful to finally have you home tammy bit her bottom lip and turned away to find mrs burchett surveying the pair with every appearance of disapproval well miss the elderly lady said dragging her eyes from them as if she was seeing something shed rather not you can meet miss ingrid later for now youll be tired of travelling and tired of meeting people lets get you and the wee one settled tell me what the setup is here it had taken tammy all of two minutes to know that in mrs burchett shed found a friend jeans and faded shirts might be inappropriate for this castle but it was obvious that mrs burchett had been afraid of tammy being another laraor another ingrid her relief was palpable what do you want to know everything they were settling henry into the vast nursery suite henry had been the easiest child to travel with tammy thought and the reason was obvious he expected nothing he didnt cry because tears didnt produce results hed passed between tammy and marc with no fuss at all and all he needed for occupation was the ear of his teddy he should make more fuss she thought savagely he should know people he should demand attention at ten months it was unnatural not to the more time she spent with him the more tammy wanted to shake her sisterher mothermarcanyone whod had anything to do with him the setup here is simple mrs burchett told her apart from you and prince marc and miss ingrid theres just staff until prince jeanpauls death we hardly saw any of the royal family jeanpaul and your sister spent most of their time in resorts that are a good deal more exotic than this place we were too far from the major cities for prince jeanpaul the last time i saw master henry was when he was two weeks old the family hasnt been back here since never never the housekeeper shook her head she gave tammy a searching look and then decided to be even more forthcoming we run a good household she told her but the last few years have been hard many of us werent being paid it was only the fact that many had nowhere else to go that made us stay like me i was an assistant cooki came twenty years ago to have a change of scene when my husband died normally id never have been promoted to housekeeper somewhere as grand as this but everyone more senior left its only since prince jeanpaul died that things have started to be put back in order by marc by his highness yes she couldnt call him his highness tammy thought ruefully maybe if he hadnt kissed her maybe but for whatever reason she simply didnt think of him as his highness she thought of him as marc and miss ingrid shes been here for three days mrs burchett told her and the disapproval was straight back again she arrived to wait for himso she said shes been acting like she owns the place since she arrived like princess laras moth she gasped as she realised what shed nearly said and bit back the words but tammy knew what shed intended to say like my mother i didnt mean madge burchett put a hand up to cover her eyes and when they reappeared tammy saw tears glistening on her lashes im so sorry im speaking out of turn its justi seldom see anyone here whos english and weve been hoping for so long that the little one would come back here it means everything to us that his highness has succeeded in bringing him home and its not just me whos affected its everyone in this country my tongues run away with me i had no business criticising miss ingrid or your mother my dear i never meant you neednt worry theres no love lost between my mother and me beg pardon miss the elderly lady gave an audible sniff but are you thinking youll stay i dont seem to have any choice tammy sat down on the vast and opulent bed in the room next to henrys and swung her legs her toes didnt touch the floor this was some bed it was some palace more and more she was starting to wonder what she was doing here she had no role aunt to henry here on a permanent basis shed be a fish out of water but at least there was kindness among the staff mrs burchett might think shed been out of line but her welcome couldnt have been warmer now she was beaming at her with a smile that would have warmed the coldest of hearts its so lovely to see the wee one with someone who cares we were that pleased when his highness rang and said youd refused to let henry come back without you its the first time weve had anyone even hinting that they care about the babys welfare poor little mite and now she gave herself a little shake as if shed said what she wanted to say and was now moving on ill let you unpack and sort yourself out is your luggage coming in another car this is my luggage the woman looked down at the grubby backpack in dismay but my dear its all i need but what will you wear to dinner this i intend to eat here i dont want to eat with his highness oror ingrid you cant eat up here the housekeeper sounded appalled then ill eat with you in the servant quarters that would never do the thought was clearly horrific damn tammy looked around her at the lushly furnished nursery suite it might be gorgeous but it needed a stove and a fridge and a few basic essentials and she just knew there wouldnt be a supermarket for miles cant i just have a sandwich up here maybe for tonight the housekeeper said doubtfully im not sure does his highness know what you intend his highness knows i intend to be independent and he approves it hardly matters tammy told her somehow managing a reassuring smile i make my own decisions ill send you up your sandwich dear mrs burchett told her if thats what you want but what the prince will say i darent think true to her word mrs burchett sent up sandwiches and a glass of milk for her dinner by that time tammy had been in the castle for a whole two hours she was hardly at home yet shed spent the two hours unpackingwell that had taken her ten minutes then shed explored her surroundings she seemed to have a vast wing to herself and it was so huge it took her an hour of prowling before she felt she knew the half of what was there she wasnt brave enough to leave her wing in case she never found her way back shed fed henry whose time clock was out of kilter hed eaten and fallen asleep almost straight away shed showered put on clean jeans and then tried to figure out how she could stop feeling strange it was impossible she thought and when the sandwiches and milk arrived on silver salvers complete with uniformed steward carrying them she felt really really ridiculous worse was to come shed had one bite of a sandwich and there was a knock on the door there was no wait for a response marc marched right in he was dressed for dinner royal dinner dark suit crisp white shirt royal blue tie he was certainly something he looked a real prince tammy thought and tried to stop her heart giving the absurd lurch she was almost growing accustomed to he stopped two feet inside the door and stared at her sandwich as if it was personally offensive what do you think youre doing what do you think she was perched on the side of her ridiculous bed and she waved her sandwich at him eating dinner dinners in the dining room now nope dinners here he marched across and picked up her sandwich inspecting it as if it was poison so mrs burchett was right youre eating ham sandwiches for dinner they didnt have vegemite he didnt even smile he took a step back and surveyed her as if shed arrived from another planet henrys asleep he told her slowly as if she might have trouble understanding the language mmm she smiled so why are you sitting up here alone i told you we keep our lives separate thats the way i want it so i might as well start now thats ridiculous mrs burchett has prepared a wonderful dinner i wont allow you to offend the staff mrs burchett sent me the sandwiches she understands she doesnt understand anything he stood back and raked his hair in a gesture that contained both weariness and frustration tammy its my job to get this place running as it should in my uncles time this was a family home the staff here nearly all worked under him and thats what they want to see normality most of them have remained loyal under the most outrageous circumstances theyre delighted that henrys here and that ive elected to stay tonight as well the least you can do is come down and enjoy the banquet theyve put on for us banquet banquet tammys heart sank she stared across to the far wall an entire bank of mirrors sent twenty reflections of her bedraggled self straight back im not a princess she told him i dont belong here neither do i yeah right youre henrys guardian and his aunt he said with an attempt at patience you have as much a place in this housein this familyas i have you cant seriously expect to sit up here and sulk in your bedroom for the next twentyfive years ill find a house shed already realized the impossibility of staying where she was this estate is enormous there must be somewhere henry and i can stay independently a gardeners cottage or something oh certainly he said with exaggerated scorn henry is the heir to the crown are you seriously saying hell live in a gardeners cottage until hes twentyfive im a gardener she flashed at him whats wrong with that nothing but henrys the heir to the throne if i hear that phrase one more time youll hear it lots of times he snapped because thats what this whole things about you think i wanted any of this i have a beautiful property of my own not ten miles south of here renouys is my home thats where i want to be i didnt want to be prince regent i didnt want to be responsible for henry but someone has to make the hard calls someone has to care im only in this country because i care then go the whole way i thought you had more to you than this skulking in your bedroom because youre scared of a formal dinner i am not she was standing now her face white with fury as if i dont know how to eat with the likes of you what other reason is there for you to refuse to come down to dinner she glowered i have jetlag yeah right and im the king of siam you slept like a top the last six hours in the plane i did not you slept he said harshly but a glimmer of laughter was returning to the back of his eyes i should know you slept on my shoulder while henrys dampness seeped into my shirt i have a crick in my neck and a stained shirt to prove it for six hours i couldnt moveand very uncomfortable it was too i did not sleep on your shoulder shall we ring the airline stewards and have them adjudicate this is ridiculous it is he said politely and looked at his watch ingrid and i are having predinner drinks dinner will be served in fifteen minutes i ask that you join us i dont want neither do i but i must and i think you should make up your mind that you must too ive only got jeans the hint of laughter deepened as he surveyed her shabby self whose fault is that she glowered even more youll come i you have no choice fine she threw at him fine ill come to dinner in my rags and ill disgrace myself before your entire staff and you can snigger at me all you want fine just get out of my room now i get out fifteen minutes help she could go as she was she should she thought grimly she should do just that butshe was henrys guardian she had a place in this household until henry no longer needed it she should give it a fair go the glimmer of laughter in marcs eyes came back to haunt her damn the man how dared he place her in such a situation he had tried to warn her she stared at her battered backpack as if it was a personal enemy what on earth was she to do she just knew that ingrid would be gorgeous and playing beggar maid to a handsome prince and princess was not her cup of tea at all but lara had lived here for a while she thought slowly lara who chose and discarded clothes on a whim if shed lived here even for a short time she bit her lip indecision playing over her face could she should she why not she was in a fairytale castle why not indeed call me if theres anything you want mrs burchett had told her the bell connects to the kitchens normally id have one of the girls answer it but tonight ill answer it myself she stared at the bell and then made her decision she was a long long way from the bush she was a long long way from home ingrid was growing impatient marcs steward caught him on the stairs and detained him for another few minutes and by the time he returned to the drawing room she could scarcely conceal her annoyance where have you been her tone was proprietorial enough to annoy him inviting henrys aunt down to join us he told her for dinner yes does she want to join us ingrid asked incredulously i would have thought you would have thought what he hadnt been expecting ingrid to be here waiting for him in truth hed been looking forward to a few days to work things out before he contacted her but she was here now and the fact that he didnt feel like speaking to anyone had to be overcome well her sort yes he stilled watching ingrid what do you meanher sort well shes clearly not used to moving in our circles ingrid smiled her gorgeous smile and her gentle laughter tinkled out musically in the beautiful salon what did you tell me youve dragged her here from the australian bush darling youll be lucky if she knows how to use a knife and fork shes laras sister marc snapped and ingrid nodded thoughtfully yes isnt it amazing that those two can be sisters lara was a beauty tammytamsin isnt exactly ugly no dear but those clothesand those freckles do you want to go in to dinner he asked shortly offering his arm you dont want to wait for our little mate from the bush no need said a dangerously controlled voice from the door your little mate from the bush is right here she took his breath away marc turned to face the door and it was all he could do not to gasp how had she done this in fifteen minutes she was transformed gone were her faded jeans and her old shirt gone was tammy dexter tree surgeon in her placetamsin the dress was deceptively simplea sliver of brilliantly cut black silk it had a scooped neckline and tiny capped sleeves it curved into a cinched waist and hugged her hips to a short short hemline her long tanned legs went on for ever to a pair of strappy black sandals that made her legs look even longer than they were and the rest her burnished curls were brushed to a shimmering glory swinging around her shoulders in a soft cloud shed found some makeupjust a littlejust enough to add a tiny touch of colour to her lovely mouth and accentuate those huge brown eyes she was stunning where the hell did you get the clothes he demanded and her eyes creased in amusement now here i was wondering whether my manners were up to scratch i beg your pardon he said stiffly catching himself she was right as a greeting it was hardly appropriate itammy this is ingrid my partner ingrid finished for him her dark eyes giving him a strange sideways glance im very pleased to meet youtammy she came forward and took tammys hand in her cool grasp gave it a lightly welcoming squeeze how are you my dear we were just saying you must be feeling very strange i wouldnt have wondered if youd wanted dinner in your room tonight her eyes perused tammy and her look of light amusement deepened youve been raiding your sisters clothes i see well done you i was going to wrap them up and send them to charity but if you can use them the implication was obvious and tammy flushed but she held her cool this woman reminded her of her mother and tammy had learned early that anger wasnt a useful tool other methods were more effective im pleased that you did no such thing she said coolly ive yet to see the terms of my sisters will but i doubt her private property would be yours to dispose of legal writs are so tiresome dont you think she took the flute of champagne marc had poured for her and smiled thank you thats just what i needed and dom p√©rignonmy favourite fifteen minutes ago shed been saying that what she needed was a vegemite sandwich marc blinkedbut then maybe he would have blinked anyway wow until now hed suspected tammy had chosen her isolated profession because of an inferiority complex lara and her mother isobelle were magnificent they were creatures whose every feature screamed perfection from the tip of their beautifully pedicured toes to their gleaming tresses if tammy had grown up comparing herself to such perfectionwell maybe anyone would have headed to the bush but tammy was just as beautiful as her sister or her mother he thought maybe even more so she wore very little makeup and no jewellery but in her sisters simple black dress she made ingrid appear overdressed and overmadeup and ingrid knew and ingrid didnt like it one bit well of course if they fit you she was smiling moving to the head of the table and gesturing to tammy to sit hostess to guest the gesture wasnt lost on marc who grimaced hell he had things to sort out here but tammy still seemed unfazed itd be a waste not to use them tammy agreed cheerfully by the look of the wardrobes i shant need to buy anything more until henry inherits you intend to stay that long henry needs a mother tammy said softly sitting down as though shed sat at such tables all her life the butler was behind herhe assisted her into the chair and placed a napkin on her knees and she gave him a friendly happy smile i guess im it but if marc and i will you have wine marc interrupted with a harried look and tammy gave him her very nicest smile yes please hell marc couldnt sleep finally at about two in the morning he rose and took himself out for a walk in the gardens it was a full moon the moonlight was reflecting off the lake and the night was gorgeous he walked the full perimeter of the lake his strides lengthened as he walked and so did his sense of unease what was he doing until jeanpaul had died his life had been uncomplicated orless complicated hed been able to keep himself right apart from this family and that was the way hed liked it hed been brought up close to here but miles apart in terms of lifestyle his father had been the crown princes brother the brothers had got ononcebut the children hadnt jeanpauls mother had been a snob of the first order whod preened herself on her success in marrying marcs uncle whereas marcs mother had been a warm funloving woman whod had little to do with royalty for good reason at the thought of his mother marc twisted his mouth into a grim line what theyd done to her this family it didnt matter it couldnt matter it was past hed learned that the only way to cope with these peoplewith anyone who had any connections to the crownwas to be businesslike and brusque because he loved this little country hed do what he had to do over the next few years hed wear the crown and hold the monarchy in good stead for his little cousin but that was as far as it went if tammytamsin he told himself harshly hed keep this formalif she could be persuaded to take a royal role then he could step back into the background which was what he wanted he wanted to go back to his lovely little estate and get right away from these people from tammy yes from tammy he told himself savagely she stirred him as he hadnt believed a woman could and he didnt understand why his sort of woman wasnt like that not like tamsin his sort of woman was one such as ingrid ingrid the thought of her behaviour at dinner made his teeth clench shed been a bitch he needed to get rid of her after dinner as shed clung and expected to be taken back to his bed hed rebuffed her with more bluntness than tact im jetlagged ingrid i need my own bed tonight i can just stay a while sweetheart sweetheart the term sounded almost obscene coming from her she was beautiful and shed been an elegant hostess for him in the past but their relationship hadnt lasted any more than a few short months none of his relationships did that was the way he liked it the women in his circle were all tarred with the same brush as his aunt and isobelle and lara he knew damned well what drove them to bring a woman in from outsideto expose her to the goldfish bowl of royaltywould be to expose her to the same sort of pain his mother had experienced he couldnt do it and tammy why did his thoughts swing back to tammy tammy gazing at him from that huge tree shed been working on tammy asleep on his shoulder in the plane tammy hugging her nephew making him smile swinging her bare feet while she sat on that huge crazy bed tammy in the tiny black dress beating ingrid at her own game yeah right get involved with tammy and hed be involved with this family for ever he hated it hated it and tammy was just such a one as his mother there was no way hed subject her to subject her what was he thinking of marrying the girl where had that thought come from ridiculous he was so out of his comfort zone in all this that he didnt know where he was damn you jeanpaul he told his dead cousin im not playing your games im not playing any games i do what i have to do and then i get out of here tammy dont be a fool he told himself as he rounded the last bend and trod up the steps back into the castle i should never have kissed her god knows why i did one things for certain its never going to happen again she doesnt want me just as much as i dont want her buthow much was that chapter seven marc woke to laughter he groaned and opened one eye to discover it was eight am thatd teach him to wander round the lake in the small hours his head was still in a time zone a thousand miles away maybe hed imagined the laughter he thought still hazy from sleep one thing this palace never encouraged was laughter but there it was again drifting up from under his windows definitely laughter tammys a knock and dominic was entering the butler set his tray on the bedside table and started to pull the curtains he smiled in sympathy as marc grimaced im sorry sir but you did organise a meeting with msieur lavac at nine at nine marc groaned again msieur lavac the accountant sir dominic told him in the reproving manner of a senior person to a child who has to be occasionally indulged yes right the palace accountant msieur lavac of course dominic was pulling aside vast brocade drapes and the light hurt his eyes who the hell is laughing surely it cant be t miss dexter did they wake you sir shall i tell them to stop them tell who to stop miss tammy and master henry dominic paused by the windows and gazed down at the south lawn a smile playing over his normally taciturn face ill admit id be reluctant to stop them it does my heart good to see them here we never thought wed see a child back at the palace and this aunt of the little prince she meets with your approval the temptation was too great jetlag or no jetlag marc rose to see for himself they were right beneath his windows a steep and grassy bank led down to the lake and tammy had climbed to the top with henry in her arms while marc watched she lay down on the grass set the little boy down before her so they were almost nose to nose held his hands tightand they rolled down the grassy verge together clearly theyd done it time and time again they ended up on the bank of the lake both bubbling with laughter the baby holding his hands out for more a cluster of ducklings and their mother watched from the waters edge seemingly almost as bemused as marc and for marc it was a strange feeling incredible he watched tammys laughing face and felt a surge of such desire it threatened to overwhelm him but this wasnt a desire he knew it was crazily mixed up he thought his feelings for tammy were merging with what she represented because in there too was a desire to do what she was doingto play with the baby hed already started to love love he didnt do love he told himself startled he was there in the background to safeguard henrys inheritance that was all he didnt do love the butler was watching him with a strange expression on his face and marc tried to catch himself to appear nonchalant he let the drapes drop back into place have the staff taken to miss tamsin he asked as casually as he could which wasnt as casual as hed have liked dominic didnt notice or at least he didnt appear to notice oh yes sir with those three short words there was no doubting that tammy had dominics entire approval and that of the staff miss tamsin was up at six this morning and she ate breakfast in the kitchen we were shocked but she wouldnt have it any other way she brought the little one down with her andwell by the end of breakfast mrs burchett says we couldnt have found anyone more different than he faltered at that and came to an embarrassed halt but marc knew what hed been about to say than her sister i dominic coughed and then met his eyes with honesty well yes princess lara wasnt universally liked you know that prince jeanpaul and princess lara never took it upon themselves to pay any attention to the staff when they took the baby away mrs burchett and nearly every other woman on the staff practically broke their hearts theyd been wanting a child in the palace for so long yes half of marc was listening but he was distracted his hand had involuntarily pulled the drape aside again it was as if he couldnt drag his eyes away they looked wonderful their laughter was infectious and he found himself smiling just to see their pleasure tammy was lying on her back now holding the little boy above her at arms length crowing up at him as if they were both children she was barefoot againit seemed to be her normal stateand dressed once more in her standard shabby jeans and tshirt in one sense she looked a pauper but in another she looked a million dollars begging your pardon sir but will you be taking them back to renouys sorry back to your own property will you be taking miss tamsin and master henry back to renouys to live oh marc was still distracted but he made himself think that one through why would you think id do that the inheritance clause youve told me about says the child needs only to stay in the country not here in the palace mmm so we thoughtthe staff have been saying that maybe youd be taking them back to renouys to live with you there no no no dominic was still probing that was the trouble with aged retainers marc thought grimly not enough respect dominic had known him when he was in short pants and the demarcation between master and servant was growing more blurred by the minute but youre not planning on staying here yourself he was shamelessly inquisitive and marc grimaced you know im only here until i get the mess that my cousin left sorted out miss tamsin will stay here theres no need for me to stay as well the place needs a master ill be on call if you need me i cant stay here indefinitely its not my home youre prince regent for twentyfive years dominic said softly for some thats a lifetime you could live here i dont wish to but dominic no he was still watching tammy but the laughter had gone the feeling of entrapment hed had ever since jeanpauls death was threatening to overwhelm him im sure miss ingrid miss ingrid has nothing to do with my decision on where im to live he flashed dominic a suspicious look the elderly butler could take liberties where no one else could but enough was enough stop fishing id neverfish the butler said offended and marc gave a reluctant grin im very sure you would what time did you say msieur lavac is coming nine then id better eat my breakfast and shower and change andis miss ingrid breakfasting yet no sir what a shame well i might have time for a quick walk before meeting msieur lavac yes sir and dominic turned away before marc could see the involuntary smile that flashed into his wise old eyes im sure that would be a very good idea the south lawn is lovely at this time of the morning the south lawn was lovely but marc hardly noticed it hed showered and dressed in record time donning what were for him very casual clothes jeans and an opennecked shirt and that was it hed been about to pull his shoes on but suddenly thought dammit why should i so he headed down the steps wearing bare feet he instantly regretted it there was gravel between the steps and the lawn his feet recoiled in instinctive reaction and tammy strolling up towards the entrance saw him and laughed youve forgotten your royal slippers your highness i often go barefoot he told her but her smile deepened yeah like i often wear a tiara or elegant little black dresses her smile was magnetic he thought gorgeous sometimes its necessary to wear what the natives wear she told him with dignity and it was his turn to grin i agree hence the bare feet she smiled still more and looked down at her own bare toes i dont think you should copy me im hardly a native here yet you think youll be happy staying here permanently hey give me a break how can i make decisions like that already ive only been here for one night but you like what you see im a bit worried about the standard of our accommodation she told him trying to keep laughter from her voice its not what im used to but henry and i have been discussing the matter we suppose we can slum it her eyes twinkled after all if you can then i guess we can too no antipodeans about to be surpassed in toughness by a broitenburgian she smiled once more a gorgeous allenveloping smile with lovely laughter lighting her eyes and it set marc back henry was snuggled into her shoulder he wasnt asleep but he was clearly a happy content and tired little boy the way the childs body curved into her breast did something to marcs insides that he hardly recognised marc stared at the picture woman and child made and thoughtit looked good they looked so at home in this setting it was as if the baby was meant to be here as if both were meant to be woman and child seemed made for each other and tammy was standing on the castle steps as if she belonged this could work hed been staring at her for too long and she broke the silence before hed finished with his train of thought ummarc about a house of my own he frowned thrown off track this certainly wasnt where his thoughts had been leading a house of your own okay not a gardeners cottage she conceded i see that such a place would be inappropriate for henry but for you to have me living here with you is also inappropriate last night you must see that it cant work he thought about it and disagreed i think it worked very well last night it didnt the humiliation shed felt the previous night surfaced again and with it anger if you think im going to play hostess to your mistress you have another think coming hey ingrids not my mistress no he flushed hell tammy my mother says youre a womaniser she said flatly her anger fading as she searched for a more temperate tone what she was saying was unpleasant enough without hurling it at him in fury but shed been thinking things through and they both had to face the truth whether thats true or not hardly matters but mrs burchett agrees that you go from one woman to another she says ingrids only been on the scene for a couple of months she also says that now ingrids getting possessive youll ditch her and therell be someone else it was so close to the bone that he almost gasped damn it how well did the servants know him and how dared this unknown woman throw his personal affairs in his face this is none of your business he was almost rigid with shock and fury but she didnt appear to notice its not she agreed with all the placidity in the world unless you try to kiss me againwhich if you know whats good for you you wont but if you intend to keep entertaining your women here will you leave my private life alone she had no intention of doing so she couldnt it puts me in an impossible situation she explained likewhat was my role here last night guest hostess or was ingrid hostess she did her best to put me down and made it clear that i was her absolute social inferior does that mean every time you change girlfriends im to be patronised by another woman she didnt patronise yes she did tammy said softly you forget i was raised with lara and isobelle i can spot patronising from a mile off and thats the lesser issue you having one woman after another will give henry the wrong moral values i dont believe im hearing this someone has to say it she said flatly if you want me to stay here then you need to find us alternative accommodation the palace is yours he told her goaded theres no need at all for these histrionics im leaving silence it was early morning still a gardener was heading over the far lawn with a wheelbarrow and a couple of sparrows were engaged in an argument over the remains of a squashed worm right by tammys feet otherwise the world seemed to hold its breath waiting youre leaving she said finallyalmost conversationallyand he nodded yes as soon as youre settled leaving me here alone not alone with the staff with the staff she was thinking fast and was clearly unhappy with what she was coming up with you mean youre intending to skive off and leave me with the responsibility for all of she gazed up at the castle and then turned to motion to the expansive grounds beyond all of this no one had ever talked to him like this no woman what had she saidskive im not leaving you with responsibility for anything he snapped so youre goingwhere i told you renouysmy own establishmentis ten miles south of here thats right she said thoughtfully id forgotten youre really a not important prince so youll go back to being no one in particular and operate your secondary role as prince regent on the side actually he told her through clenched teethhis anger threatening to overwhelm him im an aquatic engineer i design and advise on community water supplies and i need to get back to my work how fascinating she snapped you miss your engineering do you well can i remind you that im not just henrys aunt im a tree surgeon i need to get back to my work you can right here but you cant design whatever it is you design here as well theres no need theres every need i dont know the first thing about running castles nor do i intend to try you dont need to the palace will run itself yeah like its been running itself for the last ten years mrs burchetts been telling me what a disaster its been shes been telling you too damn much shes been telling me how miserable they all were she snapped how everythings been pushed to the side how jeanpaul and his elder brother before him refused to take on any responsibility for either the palace or the broader principality and here you are ruler for the next twentyfive years whether you like it or not taking yourself off from responsibility as fast as your legs can carry you landing me im still coping with the political necessities of the crown im not landing you with anything no not with henry hes your nephew hes your heir hes not my heir do you understand nothing about regencies i understand enough she said through gritted teeth henry had closed his eyes now slumping down on her shoulder with the expression of a baby at peace with his world i understand that your responsibility is this kingdomthis principalityfor twentyfive years i understand that this place needs a leader its desperate for a leader i hadnt been here for half an hour before i saw that and according to the staff in the kitchen this palace is just a sample of how much the rest of the countrys in need of leadership and off you go heading back to your castle to be an aquatic engineer i dont need this i never wanted what responsibility commitment mrs burchett told me how youve been running scared of it all your life she told me about your mother what the hell do you know about my mother he was almost speechless that your father had an affair with jeanpauls mother and broke your mothers heart that she committed suicide when you were twelve years old and your father drank himself to death soon after that you blamed jeanpauls familythe royal familyfor destroying your childhood i dont believe im hearing this how dared mrs burchett talk about him like this he should stalk into the castle and sack her on the spot butshed only reiterated what every womans magazine in the principality had been saying for years like it or not this was public knowledge tammy was backing away her anger fading as she realised that maybe shed gone too far i know she conceded a hint of apology in her voice youre right in that your past history is none of my business but i didnt have to be here long to see the staff are desperate they want you here so much they were trying to make me see make you see what that you have to stay they didnt tell me you intended to go back to your home but now that youve said iti guess it explains their attitude theyll have known you intended to leave me and henry here alone marc im sorry about your past i shouldnt have brought it up but but he was past listening to apologies he was almost past listeningperiod this has nothing to do with gossip he exploded it has nothing to do with the past im not a prince im an engineer but she couldnt let him off the hook she couldnt it was too important for so many people in a way itd be a relief if he left she thought the man unsettled her in a way she hadnt thought was possible but the alternativefor her to care for henry by herself in this amazing place it wouldnt work henry needed her but he needed marc even more for the little boy to be brought up as the future ruler of broitenburg he needed marc youre the countrys leader she told him and waited by default henrys the leader yeah right she shifted the sleeping little boy on her shoulder and gave him a wry look is there anything youd like him to sign right now any acts of parliament youd like him to draft i told you he said with exaggerated patience as if he was dealing with a fool ill be ten miles away ill be caring for the political necessities i can be over here in half an hour your place is here no your place is here so you brought me here very good well done but youre not skiving off i told you i have no intention of skiving marc they hadnt noticed her but ingrid was suddenly above them she was standing on the top step staring down in amazement at the warring couple below her perfectly groomed in country stylea pale cashmere cardigan over an elegantly cut little tweed skirtshe was beautifully made up without a hair out of place her eyes went to marcs feet in horror what on earth are you doing outside she demanded in bare feet he couldnt work out why she was so offendedwhether it was because he was outside without her and talking to another woman or because he was outside in bare feet despite the outrage of the last few moments he was forced to smile it was a very strained smile sorting gravel with my toes he admitted i wouldnt advise it tammy here must have feet of leather good morning ingrid there was no return smile good morning her tones were like ice her greeting was addressed to marc and only to marc obviously she was still smarting from tammys responses the night before i expected you in the breakfast room i thought you were breakfasting in bed i never breakfast in bed the servants know that he frowned over that one i never breakfast in bed how long have you been here three days hed assumed shed come yesterday why on earth have you been here this long you knew i wasnt due back until yesterday someone has to keep an eye on the place she said icily its your responsibility now marc you cant let the servants get away with murder thats just what i was saying tammy told her sticking in her two bits worth did you know his royal highness is hotfooting it back to his own property as soon as he can hotfooting ingrids perfect english failed her at that she stared at tammy as if she was something that had just crawled out of a piece of cabbage hotfooting going back there to live tammy told her hes planning on leaving me herejust to keep an eye on the place what by yourself her tone was incredulous thats right well just me and henry tammy smiled at the downy head of her nephew his highness says it makes sense see if you can dissuade him will you she turned back to marc meanwhile if you dont want me to start ringing up realtors looking for houses to rent maybe youd better address the problem yourself you must see this is impossible she gave marc her very brightest smile dismissing him to a nicety im sorry your big highness but i have to put his little highness to bed if youll excuse me and she swept past them both with every appearance of a grande damebare feet and all for all her confidence in the face of marc and his lady tammy was badly shaken this palace was beautiful this country was magnificent but she hadnt planned on being landed as mistress of the house was she supposed to take on the role of woman in charge of the destiny of the heir to the country she supposed she was she thought as she watched henry sleep and being fair it wasnt marcs fault that shed been landed with such a role it was her sister whod landed her in it by naming her as henrys guardian fine she could look after henry she decided but looking after the entire household and training henry to his future role was another matter entirely would you like to check the dinner menu mrs burchett asked her midmorning and tammy grimaced her dismay why on earth would you ask me i dont like bothering his highness what about ingrid tammy asked and the housekeeper gave a determined little shake of her head its you whos the mistress here now weve been discussing things in the servants quarters and it seems thats the way thatll suit everyone best now what do you think of quail as main course i think chickenll be better tammy faltered because thats what i feel like right now a chicken without any tail feathers lunch turned out to be a meal of solitary splendour tammy decided to avoid a replay of lasts nights argument and after dominic announced lunch will be served in fifteen minutes she arrived in time she even wore shoes she couldnt make up her mind to be relieved or dismayed when marc and ingrid were nowhere to be seen his highness and miss ingrid will be lunching elsewhere dominic told her in a voice that forbade further questions good she told herself firmly this was good this way she could get to know marcs butlera man shed sensed from the first could turn out to be a friend hed been silently watching her at breakfast but shed felt that she was being judged if she got this man on side he could be a powerful ally and it worked it took all of the first course for tammy to elicit a thaw in the elderly butler but by the time shed demolished the homegrown strawberries for dessert she was almost sure she could count him amongst her friends so where were marc and ingrid theyll have driven over to his highnesss property he told her renouys although the staff would much prefer him to remain here his royal highness doesnt enjoy this place do you think youll persuade him to stay tammy asked and the butler grimaced i hardly know he admitted but any persuasion you can add would be very much appreciated yeah right how was she going to do that she thought about it and she didnt have a clue what she did know was that if marc was off doing what he wanted she should do the same so after lunch she left a sleepy henry with a clucky mrs burchett and took herself off to meet the head gardener if marc was off planning his future as an aquatic engineer she told herself firmly then maybe shed better meet a few trees the head gardener was older even than dominic otto spoke scant english but he and tammy had a common love of gardens language aside here was an instant friend the old man had been discouraged from doing anything new with the garden for years but half an hour after theyd met they were poring over plansottos dreams laid out for the garden of the future the plans were wonderful language difficulties were forgotten and so was time as they strolled around the property checking sites for every one of ottos wonderful fantasies this is amazing tammy breathed as she stood on the site of a proposed avenue of manchurian pear marvellous if msieur marc permits msieur marc permits tammy said roundly of course hell permit what does msieur marc permit a voice asked behind them and tammy gave a start she whirled to find marc approaching through the trees he was dressed in a suit as though for business and that was how he seemed businesslike no nonsense but tammy refused to be intimidated after all shed seen him in his full royal regalia back in australia so how could a mere business suit throw her offstride the fact that the man himself threw her offstride had to be ignored have you seen these plans she demanded theyre wonderful what plans but otto was already rolling them up as if ashamed undeterred tammy took them from him and unrolled them refusing to listen to his protests otto has so many things he wants to do in this garden she told marc i cant understand why he hasnt been permitted to do this before look at this hill were standing on most of the trees came down in some huge storm ten years agoat least i think thats what ottos telling me but no ones given him permission to replant and erosions starting to be a problem we need to get onto this straight away itd be a crime if we lost any more topsoil a crime there was a strange look on marcs face but tammy ignored it and kept right on going yes and its not as if moneys a problem ottos has been propagating plants for years and has enough seedlings to plant a small forest all you have to do is say the word and we can start we tammy flushed but she couldnt deny her excitement this estate was huge there was so much to do ill help of course ill help and youll love helping yes she said tilting her chin in an unconsciously defiant reaction to the strangeness in marcs voice i can help all i want once my living quarters are sorted out youll stay in the castle she closed her eyes here it was again i wont stay in the castle youll stay in the castle this he said softlydangerouslyas otto looked on in confusion has the makings of a childrens argument i will no i will so stop being childish she snapped no ones accused me of being childish i cant imagine why not she declared her chin still tilted in the way he was starting to recognise thats just what you are offloading your responsibilities onto a mere girl now that he said carefully is nonsense has anyone ever called you a mere girl he surveyed her thoughtfully id imagine you wouldnt have been a mere girl even when you were three what do you think otto he turned to the old man and motioned to tammy fantastique oui the gardener said definitely grinning et belle tr√®s belle that too marc said thoughtfully surveying tammy with care he reached out and removed a grass seed from her hair very definitely if you two dont mind tammy said flushing and marc smiled mind why should we mind two men discussing a beautiful woman yeah with grass seeds in her hair a stained tshirt and the knees out of her jeans youre out of your minds i dont think we are marc told her his smile intensifying but he needed to move on plans asideand dont think i dont approvei dobut im here to inform you that mrs burchetts planning souffl√© as entr√©e so we mustnt be late for dinner his smile turned quizzical she also tells me she was planning on serving quail but the lady of the house changed the menu to chicken i didnt tammy said horrified and then thought about it i meani did but i didnt mean its fine marc said grandly planning gardens organising menus youll be at home before you know it and then ill be free to lead my own life oh great chapter eight ingrid wasnt there tammy walked into the dining room and stopped stunned there was only marc standing in his dinner suit before the enormous fireplace a curious smile curving the corners of his mouth what she said crossly before she caught herself and made a recovery i mean good evening your highness good evening your ladyship he gave her a formal bow which from someone else might be seen as a mockery but from him was as natural as taking a ladys hand and kissing it which wasnt exactly natural tammy thought seriously ruffled how many men had she ever met who kissed the back of a ladys hand approximately none and how many men could smile at her and make her insides do these really strange things wheres ingrid her tone was more curt than shed intended and his smile faded ingrid had urgent matters calling her home to your home to her home she thought about that part of herthe silly partwas very very pleased the other part had to be sensible she should accept this announcement for what it was worth so its as mrs burchett says youve moved on ive done nothing of the kind will she be coming back ingrid i mean i dont see that ingrids whereabouts need concern you its only this dress she said apologetically looking down at the little black number she was wearing if its just you here from now on then i can go back to jeans his lips twitched and laughter flashed into his dark eyes thank you very much he said merci du compliment think nothing of it i thought women dressed for men he said curiously and she raised her brows in a look of incredulity only if theyre trying to attract them she told him seriously taking the champagne he offered and trying to keep her composure as their fingers touched how he had the capacity to shake her just by touching she didnt know which im not was that true was she trying to attract him no she told herself flatly ornot very much anyway not any amount she was prepared to admit somehow she made herself continue the conversationwhich was really really hard women dressing when there are other women around is a very different ballgame she managed my mother and sister could dissect a womans wardrobe from a hundred paces and you hated it i did she agreed cordially can we go find this souffl√© and this chicken why did you knock back quail he asked curiously and she flinched but she made a recovery somehow i never liked quail and if i do if you put me in charge of menus then you eat what i like youre a hard woman i am she grinned suddenly enormously cheered by ingrids unexplained absence it didnt make any sense but then she was just about past making any sense to herself at all over anything it was a fabulous dinner the kitchen staff could cook chicken any night they pleased while she was here tammy thought dreamily the chicken casserole had been luscious as had the salmon souffl√© for entr√©e so was the flaky quince tart for dessert and the tiny meringues dominic was serving with coffee were meltinthemouth wonderful this was like no food shed ever eaten wow she ate another meringue and thought the belt on her little black dress would have to expand a notch or two if things stayed like this what marc asked and she looked across the table to find him watching her this was a crazy dining room for just the two of them it was truly splendid twentyfoot ceilings gilded walls crimson brocade drapes a vast open fireplace candles paintings of ancestors looking sternly down silverware crystal a vast silver epergne on the heavily ornate sideboard a woman might well be intimidated by all this tammy thought and then looked into marcs eyes and thought no this was what was more likely to intimidate her not the room the man specifically the way he smiled at her it made her catch her breath and more i was just wondering what happened to the poor quails we were supposed to have she lied and he smiled againwhich made her catch her breath all over again do we care i like quails she forced her face into a frown i dont like them to eat though i like them flying about i found one once when i was a little girl hed been wounded and lost a wing and he became my pet querky quail i loved him so youre not intending to eat querkys relatives theres nothing wrong with chicken instead of quail she told him severely if id had to decide before either had been killed then thered have been no choice but if the quail have already been killed then we shouldnt waste them so youll serve them up at breakfast ummaybe not but hed come to a decision then youll have to eat them by yourself for dinner tomorrow he told her or let the servants eat them he pushed his empty coffee cup away and rose to assist her to do likewise as she stood he pulled her chair back for her which unnerved her all over again good grief a man assuming that shea tree surgeonneeded help climbing from a chair what next but she couldnt exactly say she disliked the sensation in truth it was an amazing feeling for a start it brought him so close to her that her dress brushed the fine cloth of his suit his hand brushed her bare arm and she felt a rush of heat straight through her bodya rush of heat shed never felt before what was it with her she asked herself desperately she was acting like a teenager ill have to eat them myself damn why was her voice not working properly why was she finding it so hard to think past how close he was you wont be here im going home home back to his own independent life that changed things a cold hard knot of anger settled in the pit of her stomach and the heat faded to nothing why i told you i cant stay here but you live here no you live here now he told her you made that decision when you decided to come back with henry your home is here my home is ten miles away then you brought me here on false pretences she said angrily nothing was said about this when i decided to come you made it sound as if your home was here if you hadnt decided to accompany henry then my home would have had to be here then whats changed you of course he was looking down at her and his face was still expressionless he was showing no emotion at allin fact he was so carefully showing no emotion that she wondered just what was going on behind that carefully maintained fa√ßade you he repeated and me i dont know what you mean he was far too close for comfort and suddenly she was finding it hard to breathe youve said its impossible still that expression that said he was holding himself under rigid control so it is she managed damn she was still too close he was still too close i need my own space so do i surely this castle is big enough for both of us she felt suddenly desperate overwhelmed by the enormity of what he was suggesting that she be left alone if youll agree to me turning part of it into a selfcontained apartment i wont do that its not necessary i hate this place she eyed him with caution there was still no emotion on his face at all hate he said the word like a carefully rehearsed line in a play so you farm out your responsibility i do nothing of the kind its not my responsibility neither is it mine you chose to come here he told her i chose to care for henry not your whole damned castle not your whole damned kingdom principality he snapped and she gasped oh for heavens sake im trying to be serious and youre fiddling with semantics im not fiddling with anything im leaving you never said you were leaving so soon they were standing chest to breast anger emanating from each in waves i cant take on the castle its way too soon im hardly accustomed to henry yet it doesnt matter dominic and madge will help you through so why wont you stay longer i have to leave why she was practically yelling as she battled something she hardly understood why do you have to leave what do you meanyou and me why are you running is it this castle for heavens sake youd think there were ghosts here his face set hardened now youre being ridiculous im not afraid of ghosts then what are you scared of nothing he snapped i have responsibilities at my own ch√¢teau which cant be handled from here i dont believe you believe it or not its the way it is no she snapped she was breathing hard trying to work things out in her mind it wasnt making the tiniest bit of sense before we left australia there wasnt a hint that you werent staying here now you say youre leaving tomorrow there must be a reason why youre going so fast for heavens sake why why the word hung around them the whole world seemed to draw in its breath waiting for his response why he stared down at her goaded beyond belief why she was gazing up at him her brown eyes dark with anger her skin was flushed her breast was rising and falling in angry passion and her brilliant curls were tumbling onto her bare shoulders she looked she looked it was too much why he knew exactly why and he could bear it not one minute longer hed sworn not to the first time had been a damnable mistake he never should have done it shed been too sweet too vulnerable too too tammy but how could he not she was here in his hands gazing up at him and this thing between them he didnt understand it one bit but he knew what he had to do of course once again he kissed her afterwards he couldnt believe hed done it it was the last thing he wantedwasnt it of course it was hed kissed her back in australia and it had been a mistake then hed kissed her as an affirmation of a promise but thisthis was no affirmation this was the ageold attraction between man and woman quite simply he wanted her as hed never wanted a woman in his life sense had nothing to do with it logic had flown out through the vast french windows he was crushing her to him with a longing and a passion that had nothing to do with any sense or logic oror anything for now there was only his absolute need he needed her for this moment he needed her like life itself she was his home his heart his life his hands gripped her with the fierceness of possession and in joy he felt her melting into him her face was tilting up to his and it seemed she was as desperate as he wasdesperate to find his mouthdesperate to reach him she was responding her lips were beneath his her mouth was opening demanding searching for something that hed thought was only his to needbut it seemed the need was hers as well this woman was his life he thought incredulously he could feel it she was the other half of his whole when she smiled her smile reached his heart in a way it had never been reached ever she was wild and free and untrammelled bare of makeup no pretence about her fiercely independent yet when she held her little nephew there was such softness about her that she melted his bitter heart all through this dinner hed sat and hed wanted her worse all through this dayor had it started on the aeroplane or even before the sight of her bare toes on the grass this morning the thought of her smiling down at him from that damned tree when hed first seen her he was wild with the wanting of her she should push him away he thought fiercely she should fight him but her body was yielding to his with such infinite sweetness that he practically groaned aloud she set him on fire all he could feel was the wanting and a fierce heat was coursing through every part of his body his hands gripped her shoulders tighter and then slid downward as if compelled his fingers moved so that he could feel the soft swell of her breasts the perfect symmetry of her the perfection tammy had he said her name aloud he scarcely knew all he knew was that his body was dissolving in a surge of desire he scarcely recognised this wasnt like him he didnt feel like this about women he didnt oh lord her own hands were moving now he felt a tug and her fingers were sliding under his shirt feeling the strong contours of his back teasing him wanting him as he wanted her aching for him he could feel her need she wanted him as much as he wanted her he was powerless to stop hed been holding himself in a grip of iron all day hed been telling himself that he had to get away one more day hed told himself one more night and then hed leave and see her only on formal occasions but how could he leave he couldnt even put her away from him not when she clung to him with such passionsuch a fierce wantingas though she recognised that here was her mate here was his home it was a ridiculous thought a ridiculous feeling surfacing over and over but he was beyond reason his mouth was plundering hers and the feel of her was setting him on fire all he knew was the wanting and the heat of his need was throbbing through every vein of his body the iron control hed held himself under for all these years had slipped away at her touch one touch one woman his the knocking took a while to penetrate for a moment marc thought it was nothing but his own heartbeat but there was another sharp rapping at the door and then a wail somehow it registered somehow someone was knocking on the other side of the great doors marc pulled away but afterwards he never knew how it was a sheer physical wrench like losing part of himself and he stood back and looked at the girl before him saw his own confusion mirrored in her eyes i he was staring as if hed never seen her before hell tammy i know somehow she managed a whisper she put her hand up to her lips as if she couldnt believe what had just occurred youyou didnt mean to do that no i the knocking sounded again marc pulled himself togethera littleand turned to face the door yes when no one answered he forced himself to take a step away and haul it open out in the hall mrs burchett was carrying a wideawake henry as the doors swung wide she looked from tammy to marc obviously aching to know what shed interrupted obviously guessing im so sorry but henry had been cryingor maybe that was an understatement his little face was crumpled and sodden and as soon as he saw tammy he reached out as if he was desperate he woke and he wont stop crying mrs burchett told them nothing i do is right he slept all afternoon while you were out with your trees and nowhes wide awake and frantic give him to me despite her confusion despite the fact that her world had been tilted so far on its axis that she was in danger of falling off tammys heart turned over this was the first sign that henry even recognised her at ten months old a baby should be bonding with his people hed never bonded with anyone she cast marc a confused and desperate glance but she forced herself to focus on her little nephew come here sweetheart she whispered lifting him from mrs burchetts arms and hugging him close ii was just coming stay marc managed we need to talk i need to see to henry you can cuddle him here well talk in the morning ill be gone in the morning he told her and that stopped her in her tracks gone i told you im leaving but mrs burchett was looking from one to another her curiosity a tangible thing but it couldnt matter tammy was so confused she didnt care who heard the distress and confusion in her voice you havent told us that sir mrs burchett said and tammy was suddenly grateful grateful that she could bury her face in henrys hair and hide her surging colour while marc had to concentrate on someone other than her ive only just decided marc snapped like tammy he was thoroughly confused hell he needed to get away from here he was losing his mind hed overstepped some boundary he hadnt known was there and beyond the boundary was a chasm he was fearful of facing the chasm was so deep he might fall for ever maybe staying and talking to tammy was a bad idea maybe staying within fifty yards of tammy was a nightmare ill see you at breakfast he said a trifle unsteadily and made to pass by tammy and the child but henry was resting on tammys hip and as he passed he brushed the little boy henry leaned back and held out his arms to him marc stopped dead none of them could believe it tammy was holding henry close but the tiny boy was leaning back now his face brushing marcs dinner jacket and his teardrenched eyes gazing up at his big cousin hed bonded to the two of them tammy thought incredulously somehow over the long journey when marc had held him close and let him sleep in his arms the baby had decided that here was a person he could trust i need to marc was trying to leave but his feet wouldnt move his eyes were on henry and they mirrored tammys disbelief and tammy came to a decision faster than shed come to a decision in her life no she said and before marc knew what she was about shed handed over her nephew marcs arms came involuntarily out to grasp the babyto stop him fallingbut tammy was sure he wouldnt fall she knew that this big man would hold his baby cousin and care for him she knew no she said again and took a deep breath if youre leaving in the morning then tonights your turn you look after henry he wants you and i want my bed mrs burchett could i see you outside for a moment please she grasped the housekeepers hand and tugged her to the door goodnight your highnesses and without another word she slipped out of the room and fled towing the housekeeper behind her nobody was around at first bemused and then occupied by henrys need for reassurance marc took a few minutes before he left the dining room finally with henry snuggled against his chest and clearly contented he tugged the servants bell no one appeared lets find mrs burchett he told henry but madge was nowhere to be found the kitchen was empty coffee cups lay unwashed but everything else was cleared ready for breakfast next morning there were always servants around he thought puzzled marc pressed the nearest bell and waited nothing they cant all be in bed in the times hed stayed in this palace he wouldnt have noticed if there was one footman or a dozen but that there were now none was clearly unusual maybe they all go to bed at ten maybe i just havent noticed before henry was gurgling happily in his arms now enjoying this tour of the servants quarters with one of his two favourite people more and more bemused marc carried henry out into the hall on the table was a note formally addressed to his highness marc prince regent of broitenburg it was tammys handwriting of course dear marc im only just figuring it out but im starting to think henry needs you more than he needs meso its a shame for you to leave and have him forget you the answer is to share the parenting tonight you look after henry tomorrow night he can stay with me the night after that hes yours again i know its not perfect but its surely better than him losing you altogether good luck tammy and underneath was a postscript as you tell me that im in charge ive ordered the staff to bed marc stood and stared at the note for far longer than he needed finally henry grabbed it and started determinedly chewing caring for henry every second day what was she thinking of back in australia hed promised to care for him he thought dazed by where these arrangements were heading hed told her that if she allowed him to bring henry to broitenburg then hed be responsible for him but hed intended handing the little boy to mrs burchett and a hired nanny while he kept his distance madge would ensure henry had everything he needed excepttammy dammit henry needed tammy no he was holding henry in his arms and henry was at peace with his world he was munching the note into a soggy pulp his spare hand gripped his already battered teddy and he was being held by a man in whom he had implicit trust henry had everything he needed right here tammy was right somehow henry had elected two grownups to be his people and marc was one of them henry was happy but marc wasnt marc was feeling as if the world was closing in on him all hed tried to escape was right here contentedly mulching paper ties family responsibility love i can care for you until breakfast but not after that he said grimly and henry paused and thoughtfully tried to jam a piece of paper into marcs mouth no thanks kid ive had dinner undeterred henry went back to chewing you need to go to bed did he henry looked unconvinced i tell you what else you need there was a hint of sogginess under marcs arm and it didnt come from the paper i guess your diapers will be up in tammysi mean up in the nursery the rooms were adjoining marc remembered tammys bedroom was set up for a nanny there was no door between it and the nursery hed take henry up there he decided and if tammy was still awake surely she couldnt be asleep or if she happened to wake serve her right he decided who the heck does she think she is trying to run my life this is her job not mine she wasnt there marc carried henry into the nursery and just happened to glancestraight awayat the door to tammys bedroom hed expected a hump under the bedclothes shed pretend to be sleeping he decided and hadnt figured out whether to call her bluff and wake her or just leave henry in the crib and let him wake her himself but she wasnt there her bed was beautifully made up as it had been since it was made by the servants that morning it hadnt been slept in the clothes shed been wearing that night were lying on a bedside chair instinctively his eyes went to the wardrobe hell he couldnt help himself in seconds he had the wardrobe door open and when he saw her clothing still there he felt his breath escape in a sigh of relief she hadnt left the palace for good then why had he thought she would he hadnt he told himself he was justchecking so where was she tammy no answer frustrated he hit the servants bell and listened to it echoing away in the distance what had tammy written as you tell me that im in charge ive ordered the staff to bed where was she here he was held close by henry when all he wanted to do was haul open the door and stride out into the night to find tammy shed be hidden in the servants quarters he decided or in any of the thirty or so empty bedchambers around the palace or out in the garden and up a tree anywhere alone damn henry gave the beginning of a grumble of protest and the sogginess grew he was going to have to cope with this crisis alone he couldnt fetch tammy even if he wanted to damn where was she nowhere he was by himself this sort of thing isnt supposed to happen to royalty he told his cousin i should head down to the servants quarters and wake someonerescind tammys ordershave someone else change you and look after you wouldnt that be what shed expect him to do yes she was expecting him to walk away after all that was just what hed said he was going to do he closed his eyes and when he opened them he discovered henry was watching him with wideeyed wonderas if he knew his future hung on what happened right this minute i can change a diaper marc said grimly carrying henry through to the change table i can take care of a baby he could but as he laid henry down and tackled the first domestic duty it had ever fallen to him to undertakeas henry beamed up at him in delight at the removal of something that had clearly been starting to irk himmarc looked down into his little cousins eyes and thought there was more to this than domestic duty he wasnt just taking care of a baby he was falling in love the thought scared him so much that it took all the control he could muster not to walk out of the room right then all he wanted was to take henry down knock on the housekeepers bedroom door hand over his responsibilities and run his responsibility gurgled up at him and smiled a fine baby smile and the fine gossamer threads of responsibility tightened so firmly marc thought hed choke instead he somehow fastened a new diaperin a fashionlifted henry into his arms and took him back to his suite and settled down to wonder where in hell tammy was chapter nine it was a really long night marc would have had to search hard if hed tried to find tammy because instead of seeking out one of the scores of empty bedrooms in the palace and hoping marc wouldnt find her tammy had escaped to where she belonged hed forgotten the standard gear that she always carried a tent and a sleeping bag and the essentials to sleep under the stars while marc was struggling with diapers tammy was in her sleeping bag in her tent in the sheltered palace woodland but she wasnt asleep she lay with the tent wide open watching stars that were totally different from the galaxies she was used to in the southern hemisphere upside down and strange being upside down made sense she thought ruefully everything else was topsyturvy why shouldnt the heavens match why had she done this what was she possibly hoping for a fair system of parenting she told herself but she knew it was far more than that she wanted marc to love his little cousin she wanted marc tocommit she wanted him to commit to henry she told herself savagely and there was an aching void around her heart that she didnt understand she didnt have a clue what to do with it why had he kissed her shed asked whats changed you of course hed replied you and me it doesnt make sense she muttered forcing herself to remember her mothers words the mans a womaniser so he kissed me so what if you breathe and youre female then you get kissed by his royal highness im lucky it didnt go any further lucky yes lucky she was talking out loud shed erected the tent well out of sight of the palace here she could conduct her conversation with herself without fear of interruption which was just as well she had serious things to discuss but if hed wanted to take things further youre out of your mind tammy dexter hes just ditched ingridin fact you dont know for sure that he has ditched ingrid you want to fall into his arms between his little affairs with society bimbos i wouldnt mind tamsin dexter she was scolding herself even managing to sound shocked and she grinned into the night good grief what on earth was happening to her she was fantasising over one gorgeous specimen of manhood maybe shed been celibate for far too long that was all this was fantasy so how was her fantastic male going with henry its none of my business go to sleep i could just sneak back and have a listen yeah and get caught you know darned well that would be the way of disaster why because the servants will all be in bed therell just be henry wholl drift off to sleep pretty soon now which will leave me and his highness the prince regent not a good idea she told herself zipping her sleeping bag up to her nose in fact a very bad idea so why did she desperately want to do it where was she henrys time clock was still out of kilter and he wanted to play so marc took his nephew back to bed hauled open his laptop and started working on a design for a series of agricultural channels he wasnt working very seriously henrys attention span was about thirty seconds after which he demanded some new distraction hed come a long way from the baby who not a week before had known only that a window was the best distraction on offer now henry had found these wonderful new playthings called adults and he intended to exploit them to the full teddy looked pretty boring compared to a clicking keyboard and before long marcs canal system looked like nothing so much as the work of a very drunken spider so how are the farmers of southern broitenburg going to link up with this marc demanded of his nephew and henry chortled put his fist into the keyboard and sent a spiral of water channels veering northward oh great you realise youre sending water from a droughtaffected area to one where the rainfalls the highest in broitenburg henry clearly thought it was a great idea wheres your aunt henry didnt know and he didnt care unlike marc who found himself caring far too much she came over here to look after you thats her job no comment damn where is she he glanced at his watch twothirty shed better be here in the morning he didnt want her in the morning he thought savagely he wanted her now tammy woke at dawn there was something about sleeping under the stars that made waking at dawn almost compulsorywhich was just as well she didnt want to be found by the gardeners so two minutes after waking shed packed up and was returning to the palace she made herself slow the servants would still be asleep shed ordered them not to stir before seven maybe marc would like a cup of tea she thought dubiously pausing in the front entrance unsure what to do if hed been up all night with the baby if hed been up all night the last thing hed want now would be a cup of tea hed be fast asleep she let herself into the kitchen made herself tea and toast and kept on thinking about it whether hed like it or not the temptation was irresistible what man wouldnt want toast and tea at sunrise she asked herself and she grinned she knew the answer to that but hey he deserves it hes been working hard the temptation was too much she made him toast loaded it with marmalade and brewed fresh tea coming ready or not she said and took a deep breath what on earth was she doing she didnt have a clue he was dead to the world they both were tammys knock on the door to the main royal bedroom went unanswered she pushed the vast door wide and saw them at once one big prince and one little one deeply lost in sleep marc had been working when hed fallen asleep his laptop lay on the floor beside him still powered up fluorescent and flashing with something that looked like spiderwebs on the screen lines were scrawling everywhere hed fallen back on his pillows with the baby cradled to him naked from the waist up marcs only covering was henrys already battered teddy henry himself lay cradled under his big cousins arm sound asleep and looking for all the world as if this was his very favourite place in the whole world tammy stood rooted to the spot taking in the scene before her she had a plate of toast in one hand and a mug of tea in the other but she made no move to set them down she couldnt the sight was enough to form a lump in her throat so large she could hardly swallow she didnt know what on earth was happening to her but the sight of this big man and this baby she didnt want relationships she told herself fiercely she wasnt interested in men she should walk away fastback out of this room right now instead she stood as if her eyes were locked on the sight before her marc was solarge his chest was tanned and strongly muscled the tiny teddy sprawled over his breast accentuated the raw strength of the man man and baby they looked right together and the realisation slammed home they belonged she didnt it was she who was the outsider shed come half a world to protect her small nephew but thered been no need if this man would protect himlove him she felt her eyes blur with tears somehow she managed to back into the corridor but the door hadnt swung shut behind her when marcs eyes opened for a long moment he stared at her their eyes meeting across the room something passed between good grief she was so out of control her foot was holding the door open and she started shifting it still her eyes held his dont go i he was out of the bed so fast she hardly saw him cominglunging across the room to catch the door before it shut then he was steadying her catching the toast which was threatening to slide he was right beside her rightthere he was wearing only boxer shorts and nothing else he was too large he was too male he was too darned much of anything you liked to name and she was so close to tears breakfast he asked his dark eyes quizzing hers with easy laughter youve brought me breakfast i thought you thought you should do something to make up for abandoning me last night he said dryly how very kind im not being kind at all she managed trying to make her voice indifferent with no success at all i just came to check on henry henrys fine then his smile faded as he searched her face his finger came up and touched her cheeks it came away wet tears tammy no she gave her face an angry swipe why would i be crying i dont know im not still he searched what is it he asked gently and the tears threatened to fall all over again nothing she managed and hauled herself together somehow i told you i just wanted to check henry he gave her a long look knowing he wasnt getting the whole truth but powerless to take it further finally he turned to the bed henry was snuggled into the pillowsa baby at peace with his world seeing as hes only been asleep for a couple of hours i guess he might be fine a while longer hehe didnt go to sleep until late he didnt go to sleep until early marcs laughter was back behind his eyes dawn was threatening to break and so was i hell tam im no babysitter im sorry the use of the diminutive of her name unnerved her still more sneaking inside her defences so much she almost gave in right then but then she thought about it and she knew they belonged together more and more she knew it back in australia shed thought her relationship with henry was the only one possible now shed grown to realise that marc needed his small cousin as much as henry needed marc shed fallen for henry with every inch of her being but loving him meant doing what was best for him even if it meant her loss marc was waiting for her to keep speaking what had she said that she was sorry actually im not she corrected herself im not sorry sleepless nights go with the territory of babycare itll be my turn tonight take him now marcs smile was all embracingpleading hed be able to get anything he ever wanted in life just by smiling like that she thought bitterly he lifted the mug from her and placed the tea and toast on the bedside table then turned to smile that gorgeous smile at her from across the room he was practically naked she thought a little bit desperately did he have any idea of the effect the sight of his body was having on her apparently not hed moved on youve made your point he told her ive cared for him all night now take him back but she was shaking her head she had to stand her ground she must no what do you meanno i mean its a twentyfourhour thing she told him you take his care for twentyfour hours then its my turn i come on duty at dinner tonight but but what he sighed and ran his fingers through his thatch of dark hair i can always get mrs burchett to take care of him of course you can she said coldly thats a royal thing after all hand over your responsibility to the servants hes not my responsibility whose responsibility is he then that was easy yours no she shook her head im here to make sure henrys cared for and loved im not here to take on his fulltime care im not here waiting for you to palm off your responsibilities i am not palming yes you are somehow she managed a smile so there ive delivered your breakfast and my job here is done your job he glared you sound like superman whos just saved the world as we know it what do you mean your job here is done toast and marmalade she grinned again not quite saving the world but close she had to get out of there now im glad youre getting on so well she told him have a happy day leave henry with mrs burchett if you must tammy knew enough of mrs burchett to realise that henry would be very well cared for in that elderly ladys arms but you must realise that hes bonded to you tammy im off to care for some trees she told him and kept right on determinedly smiling thats my career she motioned to the laptop on the floor like yours by the way that looks like a really interesting irrigation system i may not be too good at geography but that water seems to be running up the mountains well done you what an engineer and before he could say another word she turned and fled leaving him staring after her as stunned as hed ever been in his life marc ate his toast and drank his tea and watched tammys slim figure through the window as she made her way back down the south lawn to the woodland beyond she was carrying what looked from here to be a chainsaw it was too big for such a slight girl he thought and then he thought of ingrid carrying a chainsaw he found himself wincing the image was too ridiculous tammy looked free and happy and intent on the task at hand she didnt look like someone whod dumped a baby on him for effect she truly looked as if she wasnt going to spare a thought for him all day he wasnt accustomed to women treating him like this he decided women with chainsaws women who dumped babies on him women who made him smile he wasnt accustomed to women like tammy maybe there were no women like tammy she disappeared behind a beech grove and he felt her departure like a physical wrench maybe he could wander down there some time today and see what she was doing no he was going home today he was leaving or was he beside him henry slept on blissfully unaware of the tension in the adult world and why not henry was being cared for and played with and loved for the first time in his small life marc put a hand down to touch his tiny fingers and involuntarily henrys small hand curled around his there was a clenching in his chest that was so sudden and so savage it was as if someone had kicked him he was supposed to be leaving today he could hand henry over to mrs burchett he thought desperately madge would love him to bits henry would be fine with madge but henry hadnt bonded to madge hed bonded to him to marc he did not want this what did he want tammy hell and that was the way of madness he should go back to sleep he thought hed only had two hours sleep there was no reason to get up but tammy was somewhere down in the woods playing with a chainsaw he wasnt going near tammy he was going home yeah right he glanced down again at the linking of his large hand with the tiny one of his little cousin and he knew he was doing no such thing hed stay here today he wouldnt go near tammy though hell a man had some pride and if she thought she thought nothing she wanted nothing from him she didnt dress to attract hed seen her dressed to kill but that had only been to stop ingrid treating her as a poor relation when marc was around she didnt care what she wore had she even noticed that he was a man of course she had when hed kissed her shed kissed him right back the memory of those kisses was enough to make him groan and shove a pillow over his head hell he didnt respond like that to women he didnt hed care for henry today and at dinner tonight hed have it out with tammy they had to sort out some sort of sensible arrangement she must agree to take on henrys permanent care he had to get out of here before he went nuts the day seemed endless more than once marc looked longingly at the housekeeping bell but something held him back maybe it was the way henry clung to him maybe it was the way the baby chortled when he tried to make him laugh or maybe it was the thought of tammys scorn if she returned to the house and found henry handed over to the servants it wasnt just tammy he conceded as the day wore on it was the thought of henrys distress the baby had somehow crept around his heart and he didnt have a clue what to do with how he was feeling hed care for henry today but tonight hed hand him over to tammy and escape he thought immediately the way he figured it if this was how he felt then tammy must feel the same hed call her bluff if he found it hard to dump henry with the servants then tammy would find it impossible all it needed was his departure sohed stick around until dinnertime tonight and then hed go it was a really long day tammy didnt return to the house for lunch shed taken a packed lunch mrs burchett told him and the compulsion to carry henry down through the beech grove to see what she was doing became almost overwhelming he did take henry outdoors the baby loved the garden and to his own astonishment marc found himself wandering round talking to the little boy as if he could really understand this is what youll inherit one day henry your responsibility and your pleasure and there was pleasure he discovered hed always found this place oppressive but today it was somehow different the lakes and formal gardens and beyond them the acres and acres of woodland looked different he found he was looking at it with tammys eyes and finding it wonderful tammy would do wonders with this place his steps turned involuntarily towards the beech grove your aunty tammy is just through here but he stopped himselfsomehow theyd lead different lives tammy had decreed and he could only agree with her he must so instead of taking henry to see his aunty wielding a chainsaw he forced his steps back to the house a couple of storybooks later and a good dinner and henry was asleep finally maybe he could leave now it was five oclock henry was deeply asleep tammy had agreed to take over his care from seven oclock and itd be a miracle if henry woke before then mrs burchett could easily and safely keep an eye on him he could just walk out the door right now and drive away and that would be that but his laptop was still set up with his work on it and it was sort of easier just to sit next to his big bed where henry lay sleeping and make plans for a proper irrigation systemone where the pipes didnt go up the mountainand keep an eye on henry as well after all if he woke or he could just watch him and think about tammy and then it was too late dinners in ten minutes dominic told him miss tammys in the front salon ive lit the fire it sounded really good to him and walking away now would be boorish wouldnt it tammy was in jeans marc had dressed as he normally dressed for dinner in any of the royal residencesin a dark suit and tieand her appearance by the fire set him aback maybe hed grown accustomed to her in her sisters gorgeous dresses the jeans she was wearing were clean and fresh but still they jarred im not a princess she said jutting her chin as he paused in the doorway and he thought how the hell did she know what i was thinking i beg your pardon you were thinking i should have dressed appropriately i have i dont know what youre talking about i think you do she was eyeing him cautiously noting the dark shadows under his eyes you didnt go back to sleep huh he was thrown completely off balance after you left you need to sleep when you can with babies she advised him kindly you can catch up tomorrow but after that you might like to readjust your schedule look tammy shall we eat no it was almost an expletive he crossed the three steps between them and gripped her shoulders forcing her to meet his eyes he had to make her see this plan of yours is crazy why is it crazy maybe hed intended her to be thrown off balance by his nearnessby his gripping her like thisbut the gaze that met his was direct and clear its the only possible plan in the circumstances you came here to care for your nephew i told you exactly why i came she retorted i came to see that hes loved and well looked after you love him you can look after him i dont love him dont you she smiled then her eyes crinkling at the edges in a way he was starting to really really like maybe you dont she agreed cordially yet but ive seen his response to you and ive seen that you cant bear for him to suffer i might not have been near the palace today but i have my spies what the hell ive had progress reports all day it was as if he was across the room from her she seemed completely unaware that he was still gripping her the staff told me about every move you made you couldnt bear to let him be even when he was asleep i dont you dont do love she said thoughtfully so you say so everyone says youre a womaniser who goes from one relationship to another but henrys not like that henrys not a woman you can walk away from marc youve never let yourself love anyone since your mother died and heres henry about to cure you in a way that you never imagined possible her reply left him speechless almost for gods sake he told her when will you get it into your thick head that i dont want to be cured you dont want to be loved no and you dont think that maybe youve fallen head over heels in love with your little cousin no liar they were inches apart now her colour was heightened but still she met his gaze unflinching im not going to let you walk away from this you know she told him not now i reared my sister practically singlehanded and she broke my heart at the end of it if you leave me in sole charge of henry the same thing could happen again but im not going to let it i need help and youre it youre afraid he said it with a note of discovery in his voice and saw her flinch but still she met his eyes yes she agreed with only a hint of a tremor in her voice yes i am but at least i acknowledge it and im doing something about it by coercing me no ones coercing you but your own heart you could have walked away from henry today and left him with mrs burchett what held you back you he said explosively and saw that damned smile peep out again what me you are the most infuriating womanthe rudest pushiest mostly badly dressed hey what im not badly dressed im dressed just fine for where i belong which isnt here you belong here no you do he told her goaded beyond endurance you think just because you speak in that damned australian accent and swing from trees and carry chainsaws that i cant be royalty then id be right youd be wrong if you want a princess bring back ingrid shes aching damn ingrid why on earth she said slowlythoughtfully evenwould i want to damn ingrid silence the tension in the room was almost unbearable it was way past serving time but dominic was standing on the other side of the oak doors and he wasnt entering for worlds it was far below his dignified standing as royal butler to put his ear against the door but he did have to wait for a pause in the conversation after alland if his ear happened to be perilously close there was nothing to hear any more tammy was gazing up at marc her eyes bright with tension and the traces of anger clearly written on her face and marc was staring down at her goaded beyond bearing why would she want to damn ingrid for no reason at all he thought savagely ingrid didnt come into the equation her eyes were still watching him bright with enquiry his hands still gripped her shoulders and held and she didnt pull away why should she why should she indeed and the fine line beyond forbearance and fury was broken he was only human after all he was a man once more he pulled her into his arms and kissed her chapter ten the line between hate and love was a fine one if marc had been asked that morning whether he did either he would have laughed but now he was so out of control he hardly knew what he was doing and when he hauled her close when his mouth bent and took hers it was furious blind irrational rage that was pushing him it was rage of course it was rage he wanted to punish her he wanted to make her see how impossible she was how impossible her being here was how crazy was the way he was feelingthat he wanted herthat he ached for herthat his body was screaming in a way he didnt recognise when she smiled at him his gut twisted in a savage searing pain the scent of her her nearness she was like a lovely creature just out of his reach she was so desirable why didnt she fight him he wondered in that tiny part of his brain that was capable of such thought she should kick him and run maybe she should leave she had no place here she belonged half a world away her nephew belonged here with the servants and he belonged in his own ch√¢teau no nothing was what it seemed nothing was happening as it should his world had tipped and was refusing to right itself all he knew was the way she felt in his handsthe way her breasts moulded to his chestthe way he wanted her he wanted her her lips were opening under his a rose unfurling from bud and it was no longer anger he was feeling the fury was surging out of him to be replaced by an emotion that was even stronger he mustnt dear god this woman she was so sweet she was so lovely her mouth was yielding to his and her hands were clinging to him how could she respond how could she possibly feel what he felt this yearning tearing pull all his life hed avoided this and here under his hands was the thing hed tried so desperately to escape she was his woman his half of his whole hed never known he was incomplete and yet she fitted to him as though hed been torn in half at birth and not known until now when she melted with such searing sweetness he couldnt move he could only hold her and kiss her and feel the surge of change rip his whole being tammy and tammy like marc she was powerless to stop even if shed wanted to which she didnt how could she stop shed never thought anything could be so sweetso right oh marc was all wrong for her in the sane part of her mind she knew it but for this moment she knew nothing there was a whole gamut of emotions surging and she had nothing to compare them with she felt as if she was surging into another life though the medium of this mans body what had shakespeare said a consummation devoutly to be wished a consummation that was what this was she thought dazedly a consummation whether they took it further than this or not made no difference she was merging into him right nowchanginglearning that there was a whole sweet world that had been locked to her until now he was a womaniser that was what her mother called him mrs burchett agreed and shed seen nothing to dispel the idea tomorrow hed move on tomorrow he would no longer hold her like thisnot kiss her as he was kissing her tomorrow hed make no claim on her nor she on him she knew that tomorrowtomorrow was for the whole barren future but for now there was only him the feel of him the wonder the aching need so her lips welcomed him her hands clung and she felt her body light with fire he was her man for this sweet timefor this minute maybe if that was all there washe was her home marc marc somehow she whispered his name somehow he drew back to take a breath and devour her with his eyes before bending his mouth again to hers marc it made him pause the way she whispered it was a caress in itself and its sweetness threatened to overwhelm him her sweetnessher tenderness this wasnt a woman playing on his terms he thought dazedly women like ingridthey understood the rules they used men and were used by them in turn he needed a society hostess and a partner and they wanted status when they became too pushy he moved on but there were no broken hearts he partnered experienced women who played the game as he expected but there was no game here he gazed down into tammys eyes and saw something hed never seen she was gazing up at him with all the tenderness in the world she was giving and he knew if he lifted her triumphantly now and carried her up the wide staircase to his bedchamber shed give herself with all the joy in her heart shed give herself to him dear god for a long time he gazed down into her eyes she was looking back at him a halfsmile on her lips and her eyes wide and questioning teasing almost waiting waiting for commitment no waiting for whatever he was prepared to give because the commitment was already there he could read it in her eyes they were shining up at him her lips were still slightly parted with an invitation that was almost irresistible she was waiting all he had to do was gather her to him and she was hisfor however long he wanted her he did want her he thought with a desperate savagery he wanted her more than hed wanted anything in his life but how could he take her and then put her away from him he couldnt if he took her now if he took her now he took her for ever and he couldnt do it he didnt love or maybe he did she was watching him still with that faint questioning smile as if she sensed that he was battling with himself maybe he knew that here was a woman whod love him whod give herself to him as shed given herself to her little nephew shed dropped everything and come to the other side of the world for love he had no right to accept a love like that he was flawed hell his whole damned family was flawed this placeroyaltywas a goldfish bowl to bring a woman into ita woman of such innocenceto bind her so that she could never leave that was what was being offered here he thought she was offering herself she was offering the devotion his mother had given his father a devotion that destroyed i cant it was a groan and the smile on tammys face wavered and died you cant i cant do this tammy he told her im not i dont what was he saying her brow furrowed two tiny lines creasing between her eyes marc im not asking youre not asking anything he said savagely you dont you give and you give and you give well damn im not taking im not destroying this i dont know what you mean youre beautiful he told her somehow he broke away and took two blind steps backward youre the most beautiful woman ive ever met youre wonderful to the core and im damned if im hauling you into this mess she tilted her head to one side and the creases between her eyes stayed im sorry royalty i think i already am embroiled in this mess she said candidly up to my eyebrows and if i take you if you and i it wouldnt just be you doing the taking she said softly im a big girl your highness and i know what i want the smile came back againthe teasing mischief that made his heart wrench within him i want you how was he supposed to answer that one way his body screamed at him one way lunge back and take her in his arms and carry her up no he was so far out of control he didnt know what he was doing he didnt hell where was he supposed to take this he was doing harm he was in danger of causing this bright innocence to be destroyed he had to get away ii need to leave he managed and her smile died again tomorrow no he closed his eyes and when he opened them the way was clear to him im sorry tammy i need to leave right now forgive me but im sorry he said again and wrenched away to open the door so suddenly that dominic standing not so innocently on the other side nearly fell over marc didnt even notice give miss dexter her dinner he told the butler im not eating here tonight look after tammy for me will you dominic and without another word he took the stairs two at a time and disappeared how was a girl supposed to eat after that tammy made a dreary figure sitting in solitary state at the splendid dining table dominic served her in silence all the time watching out of the corners of his wise old eyes but not saying a word she was whitefaced and silent herself and he knew without being told that she didnt require dessert or coffee as he helped her to rise they heard the unmistakeable sound of marcs car disappearing down the long long driveway if anything tammys face grew even whiter and dominic placed his hand on her arm in an unconscious gesture of support thank you her voice was bleak imim sorry ive made a bad fist of dinner it was delicious will you tell the kitchen staff that it was despite their cookingnot because of itthat you couldnt eat he said gently yes miss we understand will he come back do you think she asked and he turned to look at the disappearing lights of marcs car not without your encouragement he told her and she blinked i dont know what you mean you dont know how to encourage him no miss he looked at her for a long minute and then sighed unconsciously bracing he needed to talk to this chit of a girl it wasnt his place but maybe the future of the principality depended on it you understand hes running scared she stared i dont understand there was a long hesitation as if dominic was having second thoughtswhich indeed he wasand then he shrugged he liked this wanfaced girl all the servants did shed been here only a couple of days yet already the place was starting to feel like homeas it hadnt for years what do you think would happen if master henry wasnt here he asked and tammy frowned marc told me he said the country would lose its royal family dominic shook his head thats not quite true the crown would pass to prince marc tammy frowned butmarc said if henry didnt inherit then the monarchy would die only because prince marc would refuse to accept the crown he feels he has no choice he hates this family and everything it represents the butler shrugged again clearly deciding to go the whole way this was no way for a butler to behave but dominic was much more than a butler in tammy he glimpsed salvation for his country and if that involved indiscretion on his part then so be it marcs father had an affair with his uncles wife with disastrous consequences he said softly his mother committed suicide because of it then there was a girl marc was involved with it was some years ago now but marc thought he was in love being third in line to the throne he needed his uncles consent in order to marry so he brought her here franz the older of his two cousins took one look and decided hed have her for himself the prospect of the crown was so enticing that marc was summarily dumped oh no indeed miss the butler said dourly and im afraid it grew worse franz used her for his own ends but he had no intention of marrying her she ended up pregnant and alone she died of drug abuse and we still have no clear answer whether it was suicide or accident isee tammy did see and she was appalled the vision of a much younger marc betrayed scorned and then having to live with such a consequence was dreadful oh marc but there was more dominic needed to tell her i wonder whether you do see miss he said softly his eyes on her face every contact marc ever had with this place turned to poison when franz died and jeanpaul was killedboth incidents that cemented marcs disgust of the placehe was landed with the prospect of inheriting what was for him a tainted crown the only way to escape it was to bring henry back fast enough to inherit so he lied to me tammy said frowning he said i believe he said if henry didnt inherit then no one could the butler told her its what he believes himself because he knows he couldnt bear to inherit he can hardly bear to step into this palace much less inherit the crown but if i took henry home back to australia the butler was watching her and tammy didnt know what he was thinking how could he see what was in her heart he certainly seemed to if you did that then youd be forcing marc to inherit he told her hes said he couldnt but if it came to the crunch i believe he would take up his responsibility he loves his country he loves his people its this palace he hates its not this palace tammy said strongly this palace is beautiful its the people in his past who are dreadful people who are dead yes miss but how can we teach him that they stared at each otherelderly retainer and young womanand tammy saw a reflection of her own fear in the old mans face you love him she said on a note of discovery and dominic nodded yes miss he said simply ive always worked for his family master marci mean his royal highnessbrought me here after jeanpaul died to try to clear up the mess that this place was in i cared for him when he was a tiny boy i put him on his first pony and ive watched him grow i helped bury his mother and it was me who gave him the news that his exfianc√©e had died it makes me feel ill to see him suffer again now suffer i believe he loves you dominic said gently thats why im talking to you like this its not my business but i can see whats happening he loves me she was staring at the butler as if hed lost his mind but dominics voice was sure yes miss he hardly knows me he knows you dominic smiled a smile of infinite sadness so do we all but she flinched trying to take this on board she couldnt marc love her the thing was impossible he had so many women why do you think hes left now dominic asked her and tammy tried to make her confused mind focus but all she could see was one clear pathright back to australia i cant stay here she said on a note of finality i cant i you love him too no yes i dont know she turned to stare out of the vast french windows as if she could still see marcs disappearing car this is impossible if i took henry back to australia then marc would inherit like it or not hed be forced to take on his responsibilities but hed never learn to love dominic told her and she turned back to him her eyes bright with unshed tears what on earth am i meant to do about that there was no answer they both knew it nothing what was there to be done hell it was a whisper of fear oh dominic yes miss dominic said simply he opened the door and stood aside while she passed out into the corridor his confidences were clearly at an end it is hell i dont know what to do about it and neither does anyone here were hoping for a miracle and only you can provide it she didnt get much sleep that night after waking and playing until midnight henry decided to revert to european time and snooze like an angel until morning not so his aunt she paced the bedroom tried unsuccessfully to sleep and then paced some more what could she do leave take henry back to australia to a lifetime of childcare and single parenthood would he hate her for robbing him of the throne maybe he would and marc would be left herealone could she stay here share henrys care with marc see him every other day hope dominic was right dominic couldnt be right how could such a man as marc love her there was no sleep at all the following day she did some haphazard work in the gardens during henrys afternoon nap but for the rest of the time she played with him talked with him and tried to keep her mind off what was happening to his big cousin her love she loved him the knowledge was now seared into her heart with a clarity that was blinding shed fallen in love with her little nephew and then shed fallen even more deeply in love with his big cousin the whole situation was impossible absurd she didnt belong marc himself should be living here he was either prince regent or crown prince depending on what she did she could take henry back to australia and marc would be crown prince like it or not a lonely crown prince a man alone with his shadows or she could stay here with henry and watch marc be prince regent independent and aloof and shed go quietly nuts as the day wore on she hugged her little nephew over and over again until she was sure hed object but he simply cooed at her and tried to pull her hair and her heart twisted and twisted until she thought it would tear apart because there was one more choice and as the day wore on she saw that it was the only choice she could make but it was the hardest decision shed made in her life how could she do it how could she not it was seven at night marc was at his desk in the huge front room hed used as his study ever since hed inherited renouys it was a magnificent room furnished more for comfort than for style and it was here that he considered himself home not in that other place he thought bitterly as he stared unseeing at the work in front of him not in the royal palace his own home was grand enough but it wasnt a whisker on the broitenburg royal residence the broitenburg palace was henrys home he told himself and tammys it was no place for him hed done his duty for his country hed brought his tiny cousin home if tammy no if henry needed him then he was available for the short time his assistance was required but this was where he belonged so why did it seem so bleak why did this place that had always seemed such a sanctuary suddenly seem so empty he should contact his friends he thought not ingrid hed moved on from ingrid other friends he had a brilliant social circle all he had to do was lift the phone and hed have people down here or he could drive up to the citycatch up with friends at their home base see a few shows try out the new restaurant everyone was talking about it held no appeal at all he had work to do he clicked his computer mouse and a design sprang to life it was the design henry had helped him with two nights before water still flowing uphill hmm maybe it needed a little more work but instead of starting to correct things he found himself staring down at the screen and smiling hell hed enjoyed playing with henry so much hed still see him he shook himself realising where his thoughts were taking him right back to tammy sure hed see henry but from now on hed see him on his terms he thought savagely not on the crazy terms tammy had set every second day ridiculous he glanced at his watch seven ha on tammys terms hed be taking over henrys care right now well hed sorted that out shed be back at the palace and shed settle down to care for henry and her precious trees alone which was what he wantedwasnt it of course it was tammy had nothing to do with him so he had no right to be feeling as he was feeling right now as if shed just drive up the driveway and open the door and come into his arms crazy it was a crazy way to think and he had to move on he and tammy no and no and no he had to do some work he turned back to his laptop but was distracted by the sound of a car approaching he half rose and then settled itd be nothing he told himself annoyed that his gut had given a stupid hopeful lurch itd be a tradesman a delivery van this was a working farm after all and he had a farm manager whod see to things he needed to do some work but there were voices muted in the distance and he found himself pausing so that he could listen without the distraction of a clicking keyboard there was a soft murmur and a mans voice responding andr√© his farm manager over there miss straight through the front door and first turn to the left he froze tammy she had to do this she had to say what she needed to say and get out of here she had to keep her face in ordernot crynot hold onto henry a moment longer than she needed to how she was breaking her heart she couldnt believe she was doing this that shed come to this dreadful decision she didnt know but somehow she had to do it she didnt belong here henry belonged here and so did marc let the two of them get on with it tammy marc had risen and was out of the study and into the hall before shed entered the room at the sight of her he stopped dead marc her tone was cool and careful she was wearing her customary jeans tshirt and battered sneakers and he thought how the hell had he ever thought someone like ingrid could be beautiful could clothes and grooming make someone beautiful the thought was a farce she was justlovely but tammy was carrying henry and she wasnt thinking of her appearance her eyes were frozen there was pain behind her gaze he thought why tammys voice when she spoke again was rigidly formal its time she said blankly and before he knew what she was about shed walked forward and placed henry into his arms the little boy was delighted to see him he chuckled and tried to grab a fistful of marcs dark hair marc let him pull his eyes were on only tammy what are you doing shed set a bag containing baby things down on the floor now she was eyeing him from six feet away and the pain behind her eyes was unmistakeable was that a glimmer of tears i told you this is not my job she said in a voice that wasnt quite steady my role is to see that henry is cared for and loved with you i know that he will be but i didnt come here to be henrys fulltime carer he loves you as well as me but i dont love him you do you know her face was totally expressionless now as if she was holding herself rigidly under control youre capable of all the love in the world but you wont let yourself see it youre afraid well thats okay with mei can wear itbut henry cant henry needs you and you need him you need each other whether you intend to be prince regent or crown prince either way take your pick he felt as if hed been punched hard how do you know im not blind she said shortly youre running scared marc well i have been too but somethings happened whats between you and meits made me see that the worlds what we make it im afraid ive fallen in love with you marc then as he made an involuntary protest she shook her head no i shouldnt have said that its not fair to lay my weakness on you im not expecting you to do anything with it why would i ive lived a long time without any sort of loving and i know i can keep on that way so can you i guess but henrys the one whos important hes a very special little boy he needs a daddy he needs you marc and i wont let you walk away from that need so youre leaving him here marc said blankly he wasnt too sure what was happening here what she was saying was leaving him stunned and it didnt explain the look of blank misery on her face or did it youre leaving him here until tomorrow night im leaving him here until he needs me she said bluntly and turned on her heel and ran down the steps before he could say a word before he could see the tears streaming down her face tears of goodbye what had she said im afraid ive fallen in love with you he stood staring out at her retreating back and thought he must have been hearing things how the hell could she decide she loved him shed known him for so short a time didnt she know he could destroy her his familythe royal connectionit contaminated all it touched did he love tammy no he didnt love anyone he didnt do love but henry was in his arms gurgling up at him making him rethink everything hed believed in for so long making him rethink love it was impossible he decided fiercely put it away think about the arrangements tammy was trying to force on him twentyfour hours of turnabout childcare how could this work it was farcical marc decided but he gave the little boy his supper and tried desperately not to think about the stricken look on tammys face or the reason behind it how could they juggle the baby back and forth between two households a day herea day there maybe tammy was right maybe he should go back to live in the palace with tammy and henry on a permanent basis no it was impossible it made a mockery of all hed spent his life achieving independence sanity and the love thing no he didnt want to go there hed kissed her once too often hed been a fool to do it and somehow hed have to undo the damage your aunt hasnt got the sense to see how impossible this is marc told henry and henry gurgled and grinned and demanded another toast finger shell have to take you full time maybe i can take you at weekends sometimes but even that was too much the longer he spent with henry the more the little boy wormed his way into his heart hed leave him with the servants no he couldnt do it and tammy knew he couldnt this was emotional blackmail he thought furiously and then thought what had he tried to use with her hed tried to offload his responsibilities onto her slender shoulders and maybe it wasnt fair ill take you home tomorrow night and make her see reason he told henry and had a toast finger land on his nose in response gee thanks maybe your aunt can teach you table manners but sheloved him he hadnt imagined what shed said her words kept ringing over and over in his brain but he shoved them away with all the force he could muster they didnt make sense she hadnt meant them or if she had well then she just had to get over it he didnt do love then henry dropped his toast and the ancient collie who always slept by the stove leapt to his feet like a pup of six months and devoured it in a gulp henrys roar of indignation almost raised the roof and he sobbed inconsolably into marcs shoulder he didnt do relationships well make some more toast he told henry then wiped the little boys eyes and gave him a shamefaced grin okay i know im hooked im hooked on you but its only for today after thatsomehow ill get my distance back and thats the way ill keep it he wanted distance unbeknownst to marc that was exactly what he was getting half an hour after henry had demolished his last toast fingerwhile marc racked his brains for a bedtime story to encourage his little cousin to sleephalf an hour after that tammy was boarding a plane headed for australia what do you mean shes gone she left for australia last night dominic glanced at his watch i imagine shes nearly in sydney by now she cant have it was seven pm time for handover marc had driven henry back to the palace thinking this was the end hed make it clear to tammy that from now on henry was hers but now he was standing at the castle entrance with a sleepy henry in his arms while he stared at the elderly butler in bewilderment he and henry had had a truly excellent day aware that this was the last day hed agree to have him marc had shelved work and given himself up to amuse his tiny cousin now almost asleep henry twined his little arms around marcs neck and snuggled into marcs shoulder the butler gave the baby a curious glance as he responded to marcs demand im sorry sir but thats just what she has done she had her things in the car when she dropped master henry off to you last night and went straight on to the airport you knew she was leaving yes sir marc was staring at him as if hed lost his mind you didnt tell me you didnt contact me miss tammy asked us not to and we couldnt see the need you couldnt see the need no sir but he shook his head tammy on a plane tammy returning to australia without him the thought made him feel ill but dominic was watching him with a strange expression on his face and somehow he forced himself back to practicalities to things that mattered tammy leaving henry think of henry shes supposed to be looking after henry yes sir so whos supposed to be looking after him now i believe miss tammy assumed you would sir dominic said woodenly and marc cast him a sudden suspicious look youre in on this i afraid i dont know what you mean sir the butlers face was impassivewhich meant that marc was even more certain its a plot the butlers mouth twitched are you going to drag me out at dawn and have me shot i should marc eyed him with frustrated bewilderment damn i should what the hells going on dom dominics face relaxed a little his old eyes creasing in sympathy i believe miss tammy meant this for the best he said simply would you like to read her note she left a note yes sir marc took a deep breath then he carefully set henry on the polished wood floor gave him his shoelace to untie and braced himself give it to me yes sir the note was simple and to the point marc stood immobile and read it while dominic looked on dear marc i never should have come when you told me my sister was dead all i could think of was henry i assumed hed need me and to be honest i needed him as well loneliness is like that it gets you and i didnt see how you could care for him i listened to your words not your heart but ive known you longer now long enough to understand that youll care for henry so well i need never worry sure itd be better if he had both of us but a split childhood isnt going to work not if that split means you dont commit to him marc i know this isnt any of my business but it seems to me that youve been running scared ever since your mother died youve been terrified of getting involved of loving but youve fallen for henry i came here because i thought henry would be alone but by the time the plane landed in broitenburg i knew youd look after him and love him and these last few days ive learned that you need him as much as he needs you you need to let down the barriers and caring for henry will do just that maybe im na√Øve marc but you kissing meit changes things it means that i cant bear to be close to you loving you is stupid im stupid i hate it but this is the only solution im going home chapter eleven it was the longest month of his life for the first week marc stayed at renouys he hired a nanny who lasted for two whole daysjust long enough for marc to realise he couldnt bear for henry to be awake and in the care of a stranger he tried desperately to stay in his study and work but over and over hed hear henry sob in frustration and he didnt have a choice but to investigate then henrys little face dull and indifferent in the care of the impeccably referenced and very nice nanny would crease into laughter at the sight of him hed hold out his arms to marc and marc would be hooked so the nanny left smiling her appreciation at a parent who really cared after that henry settled into a predictable schedule he woke at dawn played for a couple of hours slept midmorning played again napped in the afternoon and slept solidly from about seven at night so for marc it was easy almost it was just a matter of fitting his work around henrys schedule it didnt include a social life but curiously he didnt seem to want one the thought of the high life his friends were leading without him left him cold but staying in his wonderful ch√¢teau for the rest of his life while he cared for henry wasnt so appealing either so what was it that he wanted tammy he wanted her to come back he thought over and over again as the time shed been away grew longer he wanted her to return and take over henry so he could get his life back again buthe didnt want his life hed just told himself he no longer missed the social hubbub hed existed in before ingrid made a few interested phone callstesting the water but the water was icecold so he worked he played with henry and he bonded to his small cousin as hed never imagined he could bond in his life and he thought about tammy she had to come back she wouldnt he knew that about her now shed made her decision and shed stick to it maybe if he mistreated his little cousin shed return and whisk him back to australia mistreating henry wasnt an option but that was the only way hed get her back so what will we do he asked henry and henry gazed back at him and chortled as if extremely amused by the whole situation great there were no answers he could only take one step at a timesettle back at renouys and wait and even that wasnt easy the pressure was on for him to return to the palace you should be here dominic told him when he phoned to see how the staff were getting on you know the whole of broitenburg wants the royal family to live in residence youre the state figurehead you should be here henrys the state figurehead marc growled and hes too young to live in that damned pile by himself youre the prince regent dominic reminded him like it or not youre the person everyone wants to see here the people want you settled with a family in the palace where you belong im settled with henry right here thats not what i meant you know damned well that i have no intention of getting married or living in that royal rabbit warren whatever you say sir dominic said gentlyand he set down the phone before marc could say a word he was going crazy another week went past and then another the press were screaming for a photoshoot in the grounds of the palacehenry back where he belonged marc delayed it for as long as he could but finally had to concede so they stood in the broitenburg palace gardens while henry beamed at every photographer as if he was a personal friend he chortled and chuckled he offered his teddy for photographers to inspect and generally behaved as if he was born to stand in the front of the camera can we pop him down on the grass and let him crawl one of the photographers asked and marc obliged but henry was intent on practising his new skill which was hauling himself to his feet and standing upright unsteadily by marcs side he could just balance he could so easily be your son one of the photographers said wondering at the look on marcs face you look like you love him hes a great kid marc told them unable to keep the pride from his face and the photographers snapped on entranced we hear youre making the association official im hoping to eventually adopt him yes all we need here is a mother one of the journalists said softly and marcs lips tightened and then he felt the pressure ease from his leg he looked down expecting to see henry plump down onto his bottom but henry did no such thing hed released marcs trouser leg and was intent on the next step but first he had to check he had an audience this was a baby with style he gazed up into his cousins facehe gave him a huge grinand took the very first tottering step of his life he stepped he balanced for an interminable moment while the broitenburg press corps held its collective breath then he took one more step for effect before he sat down bump on the grass deeply satisfied with what hed achieved it was such a moment journalists and photographers were cheering and laughing and marc was staring down at his tiny charge in stupefaction such magic she should have been here to share it he thought savagely the knowledge of what she was missing hitting him like a thunderbolt and the knowledge of what shed given him shed given him this tammy knew the joy such a moment would bring and shed walked away shed given it to him the sensation was almost overwhelming he hadnt seen it until now hed been a blind stupid fool she hadnt wanted to go of course she hadnt shed brought up lara almost by herself she knew the hurt such loving could bring but shed also known the joy shed known that in time hed feel like thisso proud he could burst it was a gift that was so precious it took his breath away up until now hed sworn not to love but he hadnt known what he was doing he hadnt known what love was tammy had knownand what deeper love to have her walk awaygifting love to him tammy tammy mother tammy had been back in australia for more than a month an interminable time broitenburg was half a world away she was back sleeping under the stars as she worked again in the wilderness and the call on her cellphone late at night made her feel more confused than ever i need to speak to you her mothers voice was harsh and angry and tammy came instantly awake is something wrong its henry she thought there hadnt been a minute since shed left that she hadnt thought about henryor his big dark cousin shed heard nothing the temptation to contact dominic or mrs burchett had been almost irresistible but she meant to continue as shed started shed trust henry with marc she must so why was her mother ringing do you know the trouble i had to get your phone number her mother was demanding and tammy thought about it that question at least was easy no tammy said bleakly i dont i gave this number to you years ago and youve never rung until now even when lara died you didnt use it so i lost it her mother snapped but now now a cold dread was creeping round her heart had something happened if something happened to henry theyd probably contact her mother marc would contact her mother of course he would why should he contact her have you seen the papers the dread deepened what papers tammy flicked on her torch and checked her watch eleven pm not so late thenfor her mother it was only to the likes of tammy who rose at dawn that eleven oclock seemed late hes planning on adopting henry who that prince marc her mothers voice was practically vitriolic hes wants to adopt henry without even a by your leave im the childs grandmother its plastered all over the news of the worldeligible playboy planning to adopt heir to throne theres even a picture of him looking for all the world as if he cares and does he a rush of pure pleasure surged through tammys body and she felt herself grinning like a fool looking for all the world as if he cares who the hell knows if he cares or not thats not the point ive had journalists here trying to get a comment a comment from me i tell you tammy i want more than a damned comment i rang a lawyer here and he says theres nothing i can do but there has to be something i mean if he wants the kid so much there should be a payment of some sort anyway the lawyer says youre his legal guardian if he wants to adopt hell have to send you papers to sign so you can i can what demand your rights tammy thought about it trying to see where her mother was coming from and she knew of course she knew you mean money of course i mean money there are other rights besides money she said slowly switching off her torch and settling back into the dark while she let her mothers words sink in yes i have rights to henry but i gave them to marc willingly i donti dont want them back there was an indrawn breath and then a long silence communication between mother and daughter had always been thus tammy knew exactly what her mother wanted and by now isobelle knew exactly what her daughters reply would be youre a fool isobelle said at last and tammy nodded into the dark maybe its what youve always called me if youd played your cards right i could have stayed at the palace in broitenburg and done nothing at all for the rest of my life while i loved marc hopelessly from the sidelines she added silently to herself there was no way her mother would hear that it was a comment for tammys heart alone this is a waste of time you deserve to die a spinster with your blasted trees her mother hissed and tammy ended the conversation without saying another word but she couldnt go back to sleep after a while she rose and climbed into her little truck and drove the halfhour into town to the allnight service station there on the magazine rack was what she was searching forthe latest edition of the news of the world she bought herself a coffee and took herself out to the cab of her truck to read it it was after midnight now apart from the gangly youth holding up the counter in the service station no one was awake but her the coffee was warm between her hands but she found herself shivering as she turned the pages and there they were splashed across page three it was a lovely lovely photograph of marc holding a laughing henry the pair looked supremely happy with each other they lookedat peace ive done the right thing by both of them i have but she found she was crying tears slipping helplessly down her face while she stared sightlessly at the photograph and thought of what shed thrown away but she hadnt thrown it away what she so desperately wanted had never been offered what had been offered was a series of oneday access to henry followed by one day of isolation it would have been a disrupted upbringing for henryand marc didnt come into the equation at all or complete isolation sole guardianship of henry with marc not coming close at least this way henrys safe and marches softened hell love him to bits her coffee was growing cold but she stared on thinking of the lonely little tent waiting for her back in the clearing shed made her choice it was the right choicebut shed never felt so lonely in all her life marc tammy was up a tree when royalty arrived it wasnt the same tree as the last time marc had arrived but it might have been she was thirty feet up a magnificent eucalypt and she might as well have been alone in the world there was tammy and her tree and no one else or that was what she thought in reality doug the team foreman was straight underneath her pointing upward and beside him were marc and henry hey tam youve got visitors doug called and then grinned and took his departure he suspected he might be losing his very favourite worker but tammy hadnt been the same since shed returned from her overseas jaunt she usually sang as she worked but shed returned from broitenburg palefaced and silent doug had employed enough young men and women in his time to know there was probably a love affair behind this and by the look on this particular mans face as hed asked for directions he might just be the cause so he had directed marc to the clearing and then pointed upward and left them to it hi marc said as tammy stared stupidly down she was swinging in her harness but her world was spinning far far faster hhi she said at last and her voice cracked a little what are you doing here looking for you youve found me so i have marc said carefully and then he set henry carefully on his feet the clearing was covered with soft moss and undergrowth it was a glorious place for a little boy to explore and henry had been buckled into his baby seat for far too long i need to speak to your aunt marc told the little boy so if youll excuse me for a minute and he leapt up to catch a lower limb and started to climb which left tammy breathless with shock you havent got a harness she managed and marc grinned neither i have tammys voice had been a squeak of alarm but marcs was rocksteady youll fall ive fallen i dont she was breathing way way too fast it was such a shockseeing him this was a very different marc from the one shed seen first he was wearing casual jeans and a faded sweatergear more suitable for climbing trees than for being prince regent of broitenburgbut he was still marc for all that he was still capable of taking her breath away i dont know what you mean she said at last he was twenty feet up and climbing as surely as if hed spent his life in trees youve fallen where ive fallen for you that was another breathtaker she had some serious thinking to do here but her thinking mechanisms seemed all upside down below them henry was watching in wideeyed wonder his cousin climbing trees was something new you should be in broitenburg tammy managed arent you risking henrys ascendancy or something bringing him here henrys ascendancy no longer matters i dont know what you mean she repeated she succeeded in sounding cross this time and his grin widened despite the problems he was having in the climbing department she really was too far up for comfort he was making this climbing business look easy but he really should have a harness and he had to take care he hadnt come this far to break his neck at least not before he kissed her at least not before he claimed her im officially adopting henry he told her as he tried to focus on staying in the tree if you agree i have the papers in the car that means henry gets to inherit regardless if he stays out of the country for longer than specified then he loses out on being first in line to the throne but if hes officially my son then he gets to be second in line after i inherit which means he inherits if you fall on your head she managed marc be careful you need a harness to be safe i dont need anything of the sort hed reached her now hauling himself up onto the wide branch shed tied herself to she was swinging beside him in her slingseat and he caught her and pulled her into him the motion made him wobble and she had to put out her hands to catch him and steady him and hold hey he held her right back and it was just as well she was wearing a harness as it meant that at least one of them was anchored to the tree and if one of them was anchored then both of them were because neither was letting go tammy his face was two inches from hers and he was smiling into her eyes with such a look she stopped breathing altogether at that after all why should she breathe there were much more interesting things to do in life than breathe have you missed me he asked and she just gazed at him with a look that meant it was his turn to stop breathing stupid question her look said yeah it was definitely a stupid question he hadnt realised she was this beautiful he decided hed imagined her all the time she was away and his imagination had said she was the most gorgeous woman in the world his imagination had underestimated it her eyes were melting into him she was small and waiflike but warm and rounded and tanned and lovely now her wide eyes were filled with confusion but filled with something else as well his tammy idid you come to get the adoption papers signed no then why because i didnt see he murmured and her hands held him in tighter she was just stopping him from falling she was just stopping herself from falling they were stopping each other from fallingbut they were both falling so fast the world was whizzing past them the world didnt matter you didnt seewhat she whispered and he held her tighter how much you were giving i dont understand neither did i he was holding her strongly now regardless of the fact that they were sitting on a branch thirty feet in the air he was holding her as if he was holding the woman he loved rather than the woman who would keep them both safe through her harness maybe it was the same thing maybe this was the woman who would keep him safe for ever i fell in love with henry he told her she was so confused she didnt have a clue what was happening but her heart was beginning to sing joy oh joyof course you did but i hadnt realised marc said seriously he put her away from him thenjust a littleso he could gaze into those wonderful eyes and make her see you fell for henry the first time you met him because you knew what love was yes but but you let him go he said you let him go so hed love me so that id know what love was so id lose this crazy shield id built up you didnt run away from responsibility you gave away the most precious thing in the world you gave me love i it was a gift without price he said and the smile behind his eyes was such that she stopped breathing all over again i hadnt seen it and then henry took his first steps henrys walking he sure is they both looked down to where henry was taking teetering steps on the mossy forest floor i was there to see it so was half the press corps of broitenburg but you werent youd left youd given me love and then youd left and you should have been there you should be there marc i ccant she stammered and he put his finger on her lips and shook his head you cant do what i asked you no i wont accept taking henry every second day and you cant take full responsibility for him because that way id be the loser only i didnt see it until now so im not here to relinquish responsibility tammy for anything i dont she couldnt go on she was so confused she was speechless but marc knew what he had to say and he said it im taking responsibility for my country he told her seriouslybecause this had to be said it had to be cleared between them she had to know what she was getting into if shed take the next step when jeanpaul died i was appalled i wasnt stepping into his shoes because i couldnt accept the role of royalty i thought royalty was a goldfish bowl and there was nothing in it for me but ive learned to see sure its a goldfish bowl sure its a huge load of responsibility but it means i can take control of my countrys future i can care for my people i can care for you he pressed his fingers on her wondering lips and he smiledsuch a smile when i first met you i was desperate to offload that responsibility he told her i wanted henry to have it regardless id have put henry into the care of nannies id have done what i had to to keep him materially cared for and id have kept my distance but nowthanks to you i havent done anything oh but you have the tenderness in his eyes was allenveloping you look at me just as youre looking at me now you trust me as you trusted me when you walked away and left me with henry you love i cant you cant love me the smile died a little and his brow furrowed tammy you must you must you see i love you so much if ive killed it tell me i havent killed it tell me i cant have been that stupid his hands held hers urgently pleading i want you tammy i want you to be my wife i want you and me to return to broitenburg in all honourhusband and wife with our son between us ready to accept the crown and all it entails ready to take on the joys and the sorrows of our country ready to take on the joys and sorrows of our family but mostly his voice softened and there was a look of such uncertainty in his eyes that tammy felt her heart twist within her mostly joy tammy if youll marry meif youll love me for ever i cant imagine any greater joy than that will you marry me my heart will you be crown princess of broitenburg mother to henrywife to me will you be my lovenow and for ever and what was a girl to say to that tammy dexter tree surgeon extraordinaireclad in overalls with her hair braided down her back with a smut on the end of her nose and with tears in her eyestammy dexter looked long and deeply into the eyes of the man she loved with all her heart crown prince of broitenburg no he was her marc of course ill marry you she whispered oh my love how can you doubt it of course ill marry you you will he hadnt been sure she could see it in his eyesin the exultant joy that flashed across his face and in the way he fumbled uncertainly in the pocket of his jeans he hadnt thought she would he was smiling and smilingtheir eyes locked as he fumbled for the blasted boxand then he swore as the tiny crimson box came too fast out of its hiding place the lid came up tammy saw a flash of diamonds and then watched as a tiny sparkling ring tumbled downward to the leaf litter below henry saw it fall he watched as this bright sparkling thing landed at his feet and he gave it his very serious attention slowly he bent and lifted it to inspect it from all angles wed better go down tammy saidvery very unsteadily how could her voice be anything but unsteady through tears if my nephews holding what i think hes holding hes holding our future marc told her his hands caught her to him and he kissed hera kiss of love and wonder and promise of joy to come hes holding our future in his hands then wed better go down fast tammy said between laughter and tears and pure bright joy wed better descend right now before the heir apparent to the throne of broitenburg decides he might eat it its a letter from tammy it was teabreak for doug and the team the billy was steaming on the campfire and tammys old foreman had ripped open the letter with the royal insignia and was planning to read it to the three team members clustered around will you listen to this he read dear doug lucy danny and mia thank you so much for your letter this is such a wonderful place that i hardly have time to be homesick but i do miss you weve been so busy marc has taken on the role of crown prince with all the responsibility that entails weve officially adopted our beloved henry so one day hell inherit the throneas he shouldbut this way responsibility comes as it would if his father had survived we figure this way hes going to have a much more carefree childhood with the attention taken from him its the right decision henrys happy as a piglet in mud as are we all the reason im writing now is to ask for your help the woodland here needs serious work otto our head gardener and i have been trying to treat the trees but the woodland was planted three hundred years ago we need manpower and marc and i were wondering whether the four of you would like to take a couple of months break from australian natives and help us out theres a lot i can do myself but marc is being funny about me abseiling right now i guess hell be like that for the next few months can you imagine why i admit my bump will get in the way a bit but were so excited its worth it marc cant keep the grin from his face he walks around the palace smiling and smilingalmost as much as i am well enough of bumps and babies and soppy romance with happy endings wed like you to do the work so you have first offer can we send you plane fares will you come doug set down the letter and picked up the magazine lucy was holding out to him lucy was a damned fine tree surgeon but she wasnt a patch on tammy could he take the team to this odd place called broitenburg its too darned foreign i bet they dont have meat pies and tomato sauce he said doubtfully theyd probably try and make us eat truffles ive always wanted to try truffles lucy said andit looks great yeah yeah lucy had the magazine opened to the centrefold and she pointed look doug looked down at the photograph it had been taken six months ago on tammys wedding day there they were marc and tammy bride and groom he was in his full royal regalia sword by his side stunningly handsome she was all in whitea fairy princess but amazing as the wonderful clothes were the focus was their faces the love in their eyes shone out for the whole world to see here was a true prince with his princess marc with his tammy there was an elderly gentleman standing beside themdominic head steward of the household the blurb said he was holding a little boy with all the pride of a grandpa behind them were the castle staff and there was joy on every single face in the background was the castle glistening in its glory it looks a happy place to be lucy said and her voice sounded wistful magic danny agreed danny was almost seventy years old and had never been out of australia in his life all them turrets and things and look at tammy in that glittery white dress with the veil and all she looks like a real princess she is a princess mia said and they all laughed but there were serious issues at stake here tammy wants us to come doug said as their laughter faded and they all thought about it theres nothing to say then is there danny said at last into the stillness shes the princess what royalty commands royalty gets lets go fix her trees marion lennox
