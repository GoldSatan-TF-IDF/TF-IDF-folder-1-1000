harry turtledove homeward bound colonization fleetlord atvar pressed his fingerclaw into the opening for a control there is a last time for everything he thought with dignity as a holographic image sprang into being above his desk hed studied the image of that armed and armored big ugly a great many times indeed in the sixty yearsthirty of this planets slow revolutions around its starsince coming to tosev the tosevite rode a beast with a mane and a long flowing tail he wore chainmail that needed a good scouring to get rid of the rust his chief weapon was an irontipped spear the spearhead also showed tiny flecks of rust and some not so tiny to protect himself against similarly armed enemies the tosevite carried a shield with a red cross painted on it another poke of the fingerclaw made the hologram disappear atvars mouth fell open in an ironic laugh the race had expected to face that kind of opposition when it sent its conquest fleet from home to tosev why not it had all seemed so reasonable the probe had shown no high technology anywhere on the planet and the conquest fleet was only sixteen hundred years behindeight hundred years here how much could technology change in eight hundred years back on home not much here here when the conquest fleet arrived the big uglies had been fighting an immense war among themselves fighting not with spears and beasts and chainmail but with machine guns with cannoncarrying landcruisers with killercraft that spat death from the air with radio and telephones theyd been working on guided missiles and on nuclear weapons and so despite battles bigger and fiercer than anyone back on home could have imagined the conquest fleet hadnt quite conquered more than half the land area of tosev had come under its control but several notempiresa notion of government that still seemed strange to atvarfull of big uglies and not coincidentally full of nuclear weapons remained independent atvar couldnt afford to wreck the planet to beat the tosevites into submission not with the colonization fleet on the way and only twenty local years behind the fleet he commanded the colonists had to have somewhere to settle hed never expected to need to learn to be a diplomat being diplomatic with the obstreperous big uglies wasnt easy being diplomatic with the males and females of the conquest fleet had often proved even harder theyd expected everything to be waiting for them and in good order when they arrived theyd expected a conquered planet full of submissive primitives theyd been loudly and unhappily surprised when they didnt get one here ten local years after their arrival a lot of them still were atvars unhappy musingsand had he had any other kind since coming to tosev cut off when his adjutant walked into the room pshings body paint like that of any adjutant was highly distinctive on one side it showed his own not particularly high rank on the other it matched the body paint of his principaland atvars pattern as befit his rank was the most ornate and elaborate on tosev pshing bent into the posture of respect even his tailstump twitched to one side i greet you exalted fleetlord he said in the hissing popping language of the race and i greet you atvar replied straightening pshing said they are waiting for you of course they are atvar said bitterly eaters of carrion always gather to feast at a juicy corpse his tailstump quivered in anger i am sorry exalted fleetlord pshing had the courtesy to sound as if he meant it but when the recall order came from home what could you do i could obey or i could rebel atvar answered his adjutant hissed in horror at the very idea among the race even saying such things was shocking there had been mutinies and rebellions here on tosev perhaps more than anything else that told what sort of place this was atvar held up a placating hand i obey i will go into cold sleep i will return to home maybe by the time i get there those who will sit in judgment on me will have learned more our signals after all travel twice as fast as our starships truth exalted fleetlord pshing said meanwhile though as i told you those who wish to say farewell await you i know they do atvar waggled his lower jaw back and forth as he laughed to show he was not altogether amused some few perhaps will be glad to see me the rest will be glad to see mego he got to his feet and sardonically made as if to assume the posture of respect before pshing lead on i follow why not it is a pleasant day the fleetlord even meant that few places on tosev fully suited the race most of this world was cold and damp compared to home but the city called cairo was perfectly temperate especially in summertime pshing held the door open for atvar only the great size of that door like the height of the ceiling reminded atvar that big uglies had built the place once called shepheards hotel as the heart of the races rule on tosev it had been extensively modified year after year it would not have made a firstclass establishment back on home perhaps but it would have been a decent enough secondclass place when atvar strode into the meeting hall the males and females gathered there all assumed the posture of respectall save fleetlord reffet the commander of the colonization fleet the only male in the room whose body paint matched atvars in complexity reffet confined himself to a civil nod civility was as much as atvar had ever got from him hed usually had worse for reffet had never stopped blaming him for not presenting tosev to the colonists neatly wrapped up and decorated to atvars surprise a handful of tall erect tosevites towered over the males and females of the race because they did not slope forward from the hips and because they had no tailstumps their version of the posture of respect was a clumsy makeshift their pale soft skins and the cloth wrappings they wore stood out against the clean simplicity of greenbrown scales and body paint did we have to have big uglies here atvar asked if it were not for the trouble the big uglies caused us i would not be going home now i would be atvar the conqueror remembered in history forever i will be remembered in history all right but not the way i had in mind before i set out with the conquest fleet when some of them asked to attend exalted fleetlord it was difficult to say no pshing replied that one there for instancethe one with the khaki wrappings and the white fur on his headis sam yeager ah atvar used the affirmative hand gesture well you are right if he wanted to be here you could not very well have excluded him despite his looks he might as well be a member of the race himself he has done more for us than most of the males and females in this room without him we probably would have fought the war that annihilated the planet he strode through the crowd toward the big ugly ignoring his own kind no doubt they would talk about his bad manners later since this was his last appearance on tosev he didnt care he would do as he pleased not as convention dictated i greet you sam yeager he said and i greet you exalted fleetlord yeager replied in the language of the race his accent was mushy as a big uglys had to be but the rhythms of his speech could almost have come from home more than any other tosevite he thought like a male of the race i wish you good fortune in your return and i also want you to know how jealous i am of you of me by the emperor why when atvar spoke of his sovereign he swung his eye turrets so he looked down to the ground as a token of respect and reverence he hardly even knew he did it such habits had been ingrained in him since hatchlinghood why because you are going home and i wish i could see your world atvar laughed believe me sam yeager some things are better wished for than actually obtained would he have said that to one of his own species probably not it somehow seemed less a betrayal and more a simple truth when told to a tosevite yeager made the affirmative gesture though it was not one big uglies used among themselves that is often true i am jealous even so he said exalted fleetlord may i present to you my hatchling jonathan yeager and his mate karen yeager i am pleased to meet you atvar said politely both of the other big uglies assumed the posture of respect we greet you exalted fleetlord they said together in the races language the females voice was higher and shriller than the males her head fur was a coppery color jonathan yeager cut off all the fur on his head except for the two strips above his small immobile eyes big uglies used those as signaling devices many younger tosevites removed their head fur in an effort to seem more like members of the race little by little assimilation progressed on tosev though assimilation was a twoway street in colder parts of the planet males and females of the race wore tosevitestyle cloth wrappings to protect themselves from the ghastly weather and thanks to the unfortunate effects of the herb called ginger the races patterns of sexuality here had to some degree begun to resemble the big uglies constant and revolting randiness atvar sighed without ginger his life would have been simpler without tosev my life would have been simpler he thought glumly please excuse me he told the yeagers and went off to greet another tosevite the foreign ministerforeign commissar was the term the notempire preferredof the sssr the male called gromyko had features almost as immobile as if he belonged to the race he spoke in his own language a tosevite interpreter said he wishes you good fortune on your return to your native world i thank you atvar said directly to the tosevite diplomat gromyko understood the language of the race even if he seldom chose to use it his head bobbed up and down his equivalent of the affirmative gesture shiplord kirel came up to atvar kirel had commanded the th emperor hetto the bannership of the conquest fleet i am glad you are able to go home exalted fleetlord he said but this recall is undeserved you have done everything in your power to bring this world into the empire we both know that atvar replied back on home what do they know signals take eleven local years to get there and another eleven to get back and yet they think they can manage events here from there absurd they do it on the other two conquered planets kirel said of course they do atvar scornfully wiggled an eye turret with the rabotevs and the hallessi nothing ever happens seeing that ttomalss the races leading expert on big uglies was at the reception atvar went over to him i greet you exalted fleetlord the senior psychologist said it is a pleasure to find sam yeager at your reception he is your corresponding fingerclaw on the other hand is he not atvar said and ttomalss made the affirmative gesture the fleetlord asked and how is kassquit these days she is well thank you for inquiring ttomalss answered she still presents a fascinating study on the interaction of genetic and cultural inheritances indeed atvar said i wonder what she would make of home a pity no one has yet developed coldsleep techniques for the tosevite metabolism as for me i almost welcome the oblivion cold sleep will bring the only pity is that i will have to awaken to face the uncomprehending fools i am bound to meet on my return sam yeager looked at the doctor across the desk from him jerry kleinfeldt who couldnt have been above half his age looked back with the cocksure certainty medical men all seemed to wear these days it wasnt like that when i was a kid yeager thought it wasnt just that hed almost died as an elevenyearold in the influenza epidemic of back then you could die of any number of things that were casually treatable now doctors had known it too and shown a little humility humility though had gone out of style with the shingle bob and the charleston kleinfeldt condescended to glance down at the papers on his desk well colonel yeager i have to tell you youre in damn good shape for a man of seventy your blood pressures no higher than mine no sign of malignancy nothing that would obviously keep you from trying this if youre bound and determined to do it oh i am all right sam yeager said being who you are being what you are youll understand why too wont you who me when dr kleinfeldt grinned it made him look even more like a kid than he did alreadywhich to yeagers jaundiced eye was quite a bit the fluorescent lights overhead gleamed off his shaven scalp given what he specialized in was it surprising hed ape the lizards as much as a mere human being could but suddenly sam had no patience for joking questions or grins cut the crap he said his voice harsh we both know that if the government gave a good goddamn about me they wouldnt let me be a guinea pig but theyre glad to let me give it a try and they halfway hope it doesnt work more than halfway or i miss my guess kleinfeldt steepled his fingers now he looked steadily back at sam the older man realized that despite his youth despite the foolishness he affected the doctor was highly capable he wouldnt have been involved with this project if he werent picking his words with care he said you exaggerate do i yeager said how much some kleinfeldt answered judiciously youre the man who knows as much about the race as any human living and youre the man who can think like a lizard which isnt the same thing at all having you along when this mission eventually gets off the groundand eventually is the operative word herewould be an asset and there are a lot of people in high places who think having me dead would be an asset too sam said not to the point of doing anything drasticor thats my reading of it anyhow dr kleinfeldt said besides even if everything works just the way its supposed to youd be ah effectively dead you might say on ice id call it yeager said and dr kleinfeldt nodded with a wry chuckle sam added four or five years ago at fleetlord atvars farewell reception i told him i was jealous that he was going back to home and i couldnt i didnt realize wed come as far as we have on cold sleep if you see him there maybe you can tell him so kleinfeldt looked down at the papers on his desk again then back to sam you mean we own a secret or two you havent managed to dig up fuck you doc sam said evenly kleinfeldt blinked how many years had it been since somebody came right out and said that to him too many by all the signs yeager went on see this is the kind of stuff i get from just about everybody after another pause for thought dr kleinfeldt said im going to level with you colonel a lot of people think youve earned it sam nodded he knew that he couldnt help knowing it because of what hed done indianapolis had gone up in radioactive fire and a president of the united states had killed himself the hardest part was he couldnt make himself feel guilty about it bad yes guilty no there was a difference he wondered if he could make kleinfeldt understand worth a try maybe what we did to the colonization fleet was as bad as what the japs did to us at pearl harbor worse id say because we blew up innocent civilians not soldiers and sailors if id found out the nazis or the reds did it and told the lizards that id be a goddamn hero instead i might as well be typhoid mary all things considered you cant expect it would have turned out any different the doctor said as far as most people are concerned the lizards arent quitepeople i mean and its only natural we think of america first and everybody else afterwards truthit is only natural sam said in the language of the race he wasnt surprised kleinfeldt understood anyone who worked on cold sleep for humans would have to know about what the lizards did so they could fly between the stars without getting old on the way he went on it is only natural yes but is it right that is an argument for another time kleinfeldt answered also in the lizards tongue he returned to english right or wrong though its the attitude people have i dont know what you can do about it not much im afraid yeager knew that too well he also knew the main reason he remained alive after what hed done was that the race had bluntly warned the united states nothing had better happen to himor else he asked what are the odds of something going wrong with this procedure well we think theyre pretty slim or we wouldnt be trying it on people the doctor said ill tell you something else though if you ever want to have even a chance of seeing home colonel this is your only way to get it yeah sam said tightly i already figured that out for myself thanks one of these days peoplewith luck people from the usawould have a spaceship that could fly from the sun to tau ceti homes star by the time people did though one sam yeager exminorleague ballplayer and sciencefiction reader current expert on the race would be pushing up a lily unless he went in for cold sleep pretty damn quick all right doc im gameand the powers that be wont worry about me so much if im either on ice or lightyears from earth call me rip van winkle dr kleinfeldt wrote a note on the chart this is what i thought youd decide when do you want to undergo the procedure let me have a couple of weeks yeager answered hed been thinking about the same thing ive got to finish putting my affairs in order its like dying after all its just like dying except with a little luck it isnt permanent yes with a little luck kleinfeldt said he might almost have been montresor in the cask of amontillado intoning yes for the love of god he looked at the calendar then ill see you here on the twentyseventh at eight in the morning nothing by mouth for twelve hours before that ill prescribe a purgative to clean out your intestinal tract too it wont be much fun but its necessary any questions just one sam tapped his top front teeth ive got full upper and lower platesive had em since my teeth rotted out after the spanish flu what shall i do about those if this does work i dont want to go to home without my choppers that wouldnt do me or the country much good take them out before the procedure dr kleinfeldt told him well put them in your storage receptacle you wont go anywhere they dont okay yeager nodded fair enough i wanted to make sure he did his best not to dwell on what kleinfeldt called a storage receptacle if that wasnt a fancy name for a coffin hed never heard one his wife had always insisted on looking for the meaning behind what people said he muttered to himself as he got up to leave he and barbara had had more than thirty good years together if he hadnt lost her he wondered if he would have been willing to face cold sleep he doubted it he doubted it like anything as a matter of fact after reclaiming his car from the parking lot he drove south on the freeway from downtown los angeles to his home in gardena one of the endless suburbs ringing the city on all sides but the sea the sky was clearer and the air cleaner than he remembered them being when he first moved to southern california most cars on the road these days like his used cleanburning hydrogen a technology borrowedwell stolenfrom the lizards only a few gasolineburners still spewed hydrocarbons into the air he would have rattled around his house if hed lived there alone but mickey and donald were plenty to keep him hopping instead of rattling hed raised the two lizards from eggs obtained god only knew how raised them to be as human as they could they werent humans of course but they came closer to it than any other lizards on this or any other world the race had done the same thing with a human baby and had had a twentyyear start on the project hed met kassquit the result of their experiment she was very bright and very strange he was sure the lizards would have said exactly the same thing about mickey and donald hey pop donald shouted when sam came in the door hed always been the more boisterous of the pair he spoke english as well as his mouth could shape it why not it was as much his native tongue as sams whats up well you know how i told you i might be going away for a while yeager said both lizards nodded they were physically full grown which meant their heads came up to past the pit of sams stomach but they werent grownups or anything close to it he went on looks like thats going to happen youll be living with jonathan and karen when it does mickey and donald got excited enough to skitter around the front room their tailstumps quivering they didnt realize they wouldnt be seeing him again he didnt intend to explain either his son and daughterinlaw could do that a little bit at a time the lizards had taken barbaras death harder than he had for all practical purposes shed been their mother among their own kind lizards didnt have families the way people did that didnt mean they couldnt get attached to those near and dear to them though these two had proved as much one of these days before too long the race would find out what the united states and the yeagers had done with the hatchlings or to them sam thought they were as unnatural as kassquit but since theyd meddled in her clay how could they complain if humanity returned the compliment they couldnt or not too loudly so samso everybodyhoped anyhow he did put his affairs in order that had a certain grim finality to it at least i get to do it and not jonathan he thought he took the lizards over to jonathan and karens house he said his goodbyes everybody kissed him even if donald and mickey didnt have proper lips i may be the only guy ever kissed by a lizard was what went through his mind as he walked out to the car next morning bright and earlywhy didnt doctors keep more civilized hours he went back to dr kleinfeldts nothing by mouth the past twelve hours kleinfeldt asked sam shook his head you used the purgative the doctor inquired oh yeah after i got home yesterday sam grimaced that hadnt been any fun all right take off your clothes and lie down here sam obeyed kleinfeldt hooked him up to an iv and started giving him shots he wondered if he would simply blank out the way he had during a herniarepair operation it didnt work out like that he felt himself slowing down dr kleinfeldt seemed to talk faster and faster though his speech rhythm probably wasnt changing sams thoughts stretched out and out and out the last thing that occurred to him before he stopped thinking altogether was funny i dont feel cold kassquit bent herself into the posture of respect before ttomalss in his office in a starship orbiting tosev since she didnt have a tailstump it wasnt quite perfect but she did it as well as anyone of tosevite blood could why not shed learned the ways of the race of the empire since the days of her hatchlinghood she knew them much better than she did those of what was biologically her own kind i greet you superior sir she said and i greet you researcher ttomalss replied an odd formality in his voice he was the male whod raised her he was also the male whod tried for the most part unintentionally to keep her dependent on him even after she grew to adulthood that hed failed that shed carved out her own place for herself went a long way towards accounting for his constraint by now superior sir you will i am sure have read my message kassquit said she couldnt resist tacking on an interrogative cough at the end of the sentence even if she claimed to be sure ttomalss noticed that as shed intended the way he waggled his eye turrets said he wasnt too happy about it either but he held his voice steady as he answered yes i have read it how did you learn that the big uglies are experimenting with the technology of cold sleep that is not the question superior sir kassquit said the question is why was i not informed of this as soon as we discovered it am i not correct in believing the wild big uglies have been developing their techniques for more than ten local years now well yes the male whod raised her admitted uncomfortably and is it not also true that the tosevite male named sam yeager availed himself of these techniques five local years ago and in fact did not die as was publicly reported and as i was led to believe ttomalss sounded even more uncomfortable i believe that to be the case but i am not altogether sure of it he replied the american big uglies are a great deal less forthcoming about their experiments this for reasons that should be obvious to you what we think we know is pieced together from intelligence sources and penetrations of their computer networks they are unfortunately a good deal better at detecting preventing and confusing such penetrations than they were even a few years ago and why did you prevent me from gaining access to this importantindeed vitalinformation kassquit demanded that should also be obvious to you ttomalss said what is obvious to me superior sir is that these techniques offer me something i never had before a chance of visiting home of seeing the world that is the source of my my being kassquit said that wasnt biologically true of course biologically she was and would always be a big ugly after years of shaving her entire body to try to look more like a female of the raceforlorn hope shed acknowledged that and let her hair grow if some reactionary scholars here didnt care for the way she looked too bad culturally she was as much a part of the empire as they were even ttomalss sometimes had trouble remembering that kassquit continued now that i have this opportunity i will not be deprived of it after a long sigh ttomalss said i feared this would be your attitude but do you not see how likely it is that you do not in fact have the opportunity at all that it is in fact a snare and a delusion no kassquit used the negative gesture i do not see that at all superior sir if the technique is effective why should i not use it if the technique were proved effective i would not mind if you did use it ttomalss replied but the big uglies are not like us they do not experiment and test for year after year decade after decade perfecting their methods before putting them into general use they rashly forge ahead trying out ideas still only half hatched if they are mad enough to risk their lives on such foolishness that is one thing for you to risk yours is something else for us to let you risk yours is a third thing altogether we kept these data from you as long as we could precisely because we feared you would importune us in this fashion superior sir my research indicates that i have probably already lived more than half my span kassquit said must i live out all my days in exile if i wait for certain perfection of these methods i will wait until all my days are done for a species waiting and testing may be wisdom for an individual how can they be anything but disaster tears stung her eyes she hated them they were a tosevite instinctive response over which she had imperfect control if the big uglies methods fail you could give up your entire remaining span of days ttomalss pointed out have you considered that now kassquit used the affirmative gesture i have indeed she answered first the risk is in my opinion worth it second even if i should die what better way to do so than completely unconscious and unaware from all i gather dying is no more pleasant for tosevites than for members of the race truth at any rate i believe it to be truth ttomalss said but you have not considered one other possibility suppose you are revived but find yourself diminished upon awakening this too can happen he was right kassquit hadnt thought about that she prided herself on her fierce prickly intelligence how would she how could she cope with the new world of home if she did not have every bit of that i am willing to take the chance she declared whether we are willing for you to take it may be another question ttomalss said oh yes i know kassquit did not bother to hide her bitterness by the way ttomalss eye turrets twitched uncomfortably he understood what she felt she went on even so i am going to try and you are going to do everything you can to support me she used an emphatic cough to stress her words the male whod raised her jerked in surprise i am why do you say that why because you owe it to me kassquit answered fiercely you have made me into something neither scale nor bone you treated me as an experimental animalan interesting experimental animal but an experimental animal even sofor all the first half of my life thanks to you i think of myself at least as much as a female of the race as i do of myself as a tosevite you are a citizen of the empire ttomalss said does that not please you by the emperor it does kassquit said and used another emphatic cough ttomalss automatically cast his eye turrets down toward the metal floor at the mention of the sovereign kassquit had to move her whole head to make the ritual gesture of respect she did it shed been trained to do it as she usually wasnt she was consciously aware shed been trained to do it she continued it pleases me so much i want to see the real empire of which i am supposed to be a part and there is one other thing you do not seem to have considered what is that ttomalss asked cautiouslyor perhaps fearfully was the better word if the big uglies are working on cold sleep what are they likely to do with it kassquit asked her facial features stayed immobile she had never learned the expressions most big uglies used to show emotion those cues required echoes during early hatchlinghood echoes ttomalss had been unable to give her if she could have though she would have smiled a nasty smile what else but try to fly from star to star if they reach home would it not be well to have someone there with at least some understanding and firsthand experience of them she waited ttomalss made small unhappy hissing noises i had not considered that he admitted at last i do not believe anyone on tosev has considered itnot in that context at any rate you may well be right if the big uglies do reach home we would be better off having individuals there who are familiar with them from something other than data transmissions across lightyears of space the males and females back on home at present plainly do not qualify then you agree to support my petition to travel to home kassquit asked eagerness in her voice if not on her face ifi repeat if the big uglies techniques for cold sleep prove both effective and safe then perhaps this may be a justifiable risk ttomalss did not sound as if he wanted to commit himself to anything kassquit knew she had to pin him down if she possibly could you will support my petition she asked again more sharply this time please come straight out and tell me what you will do superior sir that was plainly the last thing ttomalss wanted to do at last with obvious reluctance he made the affirmative gesture very well i will do this but you must see that i do it much more for the sake of the race and for home than for your personal pettyi might even say selfishreasons of course superior sir kassquit didnt care why ttomalss was doing as she wanted she only cared that he was doing it whatever your reasons i thank you make your petition it will have my full endorsement ttomalss said is there anything else no superior sir kassquit knew a dismissal when she heard one she hurried out of ttomalss office inside her liver was singing the big uglies spoke of the heart as the center of emotion but she was too much under the influence of the races languagethe only one she spoketo worry about that foolish conceit even after she submitted her petition wheels turned slowly more than a year of the race went by before it was finally approved she watched tosev from orbit she had never visited the planet on which shed been hatched she did not think she ever would because shed been exposed to so few tosevite illnesses when young her body had inadequate defenses against them what would have been a trivial illness or no illness at all for the average wild big ugly might have killed her another snag developed when the american big uglies proved reluctant to send a physician up to her starship to give her the treatment she needed at last though they were persuaded kassquit didnt know what went into the process of persuasion but it finally worked so you will be going to home will you the tosevite asked even in the warmth of the starshipthe race naturally heated the interior to their standards of comfort which were hotter than most tosevites cared forhe wore white cloth wrappings he also wore a cloth mask to keep from infecting her with microorganisms he spoke the language of the race reasonably well these days most educated tosevites did i hope so yes she answered all right he bobbed his head up and down the big uglies equivalent of the affirmative gesture our treatment is based on the one the race uses i will leave detailed instructions with the race on how to care for you what injections to give you when you are revived the proper temperature at which to store you and so on and i will wish you luck i hope this works we are still learning you know yes i understand that kassquit said to see home i would take almost any risk i am not afraid do what you need to do she lay down on the sleeping mat the race gave injections with a highpressure spray that painlessly penetrated scaly hides big uglies used hollow needles they stung kassquit started to tell the physician as much but the world around her slowed down and it no longer seemed important the fluorescent lights overhead blurred and then went dark glen johnson and mickey flynn floated in the lewis and clark s control room the glass in the broad view windows had been treated to kill reflections leaving them with a splendid view of the local asteroidsquite a few of which now sported american installations or at least motors adequate to swing them out of orbitand of far more stars than they would have seen from beneath earths thick mantle of air the sky was blacknot just blueblack but sable absolute weve spent a hell of a lot of time out here johnson remarked apropos of nothing in particular he was a lean man of not quite sixty because hed spent the past twenty years weightless his skin hadnt wrinkled and sagged the way it would have in a gravity field of course everything came at a price if he had to endure much in the way of gravity now it would kill him in short order we volunteered flynn replied hed been round under gravity he was rounder now but he also did not sag so much with dignity he corrected himself i volunteered anyhow you stowed away i was shanghaied johnson had been saying that ever since he boarded the lewis and clark the ship had still been in earth orbit then and hed faked a malfunction in his orbital patrol craft to give himself a plausible excuse for finding out what was going on with it the only trouble was the commandant had thought he was a spy had kept him aboard to make sure he couldnt possibly report to anyone and hadnt trusted him from that day to this flynn sent him a bland buddhalike stareexcept the buddha had surely had a lot less original sin dancing in his eyes than mickey flynn did and what would you have done if you hadnt been he inquired something honest perhaps give me leave to doubt before johnson could muster the high dudgeon such a remark demanded the intercom in the ceiling blared out colonel johnson report to the commandants office immediately colonel glen johnson report to the commandants office immediately there you see flynn said hes finally caught you with your hand in the cookie jar out the air lock you go without benefit of spacesuit or scooter its been nice knowing you can i have that pint of bourbon youve got stashed away ha dont i wish johnson exclaimed ships from earth were few and far between he couldnt remember the last time hed tasted whiskey every so often someone did cook up some unofficial alcoholhighly against regulationsaboard the lewis and clark it was good but it wasnt the same colonel johnson report to lieutenant general healeys office immediately the intercom wasnt going to let up colonel glen johnson report to lieutenant general healeys office immediately well im off johnson said resignedly i knew that flynn replied imperturbable as usual with a snort johnson glided out of the control room and toward the commandants lair near the heart of the ship the corridors had handholds to let crewfolk brachiate along them the lewis and clark had never carried bananas which struck johnson as a shame mirrors where corridors intersected helped stop collisions a good thingyou could swing along at quite a clip fast enough to make running into somebody else also going at top speed no joke at all colonel johnson report to the intercom kept right on bellowing till johnson zoomed into the commandants office hed slowed down by then enough so that he didnt sprain his wrists when he stopped by grabbing the far edge of lieutenant general healeys desk he saluted the commandant remained a stickler for military courtesy out here in space where it didnt matter a dimes worth to anybody else reporting as ordered sir johnson said sweetly yes lieutenant general charles healey returned the salute johnson hadnt liked him at first sight and familiarity hadnt made the commandant any more lovable healey had a face only a snapping turtle could love round pugnacious and wattled he had a snapping turtles attitude too he bit often he bit hard and he didnt like to let go glaring at johnson he demanded when an american starship flies how would you like to be one of the pilots aboard her johnson stared back healey wasnt joking he never joked as far as johnson could tell hed had his sense of humor surgically removed at birth and the operation had been a smashing success logically that meant he wasnt joking now considering all the trouble he and johnson had had the pilot still had trouble believing his ears my god sir he blurted who do i have to kill to get the job yourself healey answered still in the hard flat takeitorleaveit voice he usually used by all the signs he wasnt kidding about that either sir that was as much of a question as johnson was going to ask no matter how badly he wanted to know more yourselfmaybe healey sounded as if he didnt want to unbend even that much more grudgingly still he explained cold sleep if youre not going to be too old by the time the ship finally flies youd better go under now its still a new techniquenobodys quite sure youll wake up by the time you get to where youre needed he spoke with a certain somber relish why me sir johnson asked why not flynn or stone theyre both senior to me nobody had intended the lewis and clark to have three pilots if he hadnt involuntarily joined the crew the ship wouldnt have this would be in addition to them not instead of healey said two reasons for having you along at all first one is youre the best at fine maneuvering weve got all that time in orbital missions and trundling back and forth on the scooter means you have to be do you say otherwise he scowled a challenge no sir johnson didnt point out that piloting a starship was different from anything hed done before piloting a starship was different from anything anybody had done before healey went on second reason is youll be on ice and out of everybodys hair from the time you go under till you wake up againif you wake up again and then youll be a good many lightyears from hometoo many for even you to get yourself into much trouble the scowl got deeper i hope sir the only place ive ever made trouble is inside your mind johnson had been insisting on that ever since he came aboard the lewis and clark while it wasnt strictly true it was his ticket to keep on breathing by the way lieutenant general healey eyed him he wondered how much that ticket was worth you are a lying son of a bitch healey said crisply do you think i believe your capsule had a genuine electrical failure do you think i dont know you were talking with sam yeager before you poked your snoot into our business here ice that had nothing to do with cold sleep walked up johnsons back why shouldnt i have talked with him he asked since denying it was plainly pointless hes only the best expert on the lizards weve got when i was doing orbital patrol i needed that kind of information he was such an expert on the goddamn lizards he turned judas for them healey said savagely for all i know you would have done the same indianapolis blood is on his hands how much of the lizards blood is on our hands johnson wondered to himself we pulled a jap on them attacked without warningand we attacked colonists in cold sleep not a naval base he started to point that out to healey then saved his breath what point the commandant wouldnt listen to him healey never listened to anybody after a deep angry breath the threestar general went on and ill tell you something else johnson your precious yeager is on ice these days too on ice as in cold sleep glen johnson knew the question was foolish as soon as the words were out of his mouth yes as in cold sleep healey nodded if he hadnt decided to do that he might have ended up on ice some other way his eyes were cold as ice themselvesor maybe a little colder he didnt say anything more than that he just waited whats he waiting for johnson wondered he didnt have to wonder long hes waiting to make sure i know exactly what hes talking about figuring that out didnt take long either slowly johnson asked sir are you saying im liable to end up on ice some other way if i dont go into cold sleep i didnt say that healey answered i wouldnt say that you said that but now that you have said it youd better think about it youd better not think about it very long either lots of ways to have an unfortunate accident back on earth even more ways to have one out here in space would people on the crew be willing to help me have an unfortunate accident johnson didnt even need to wonder about that lieutenant general healey had plenty of people aboard who would obey orders just because they were orders johnson was damn good at what he did and he had some friends but he couldnt stay awake twentyfour hours a day seven days a week he couldnt keep an eye on all the equipment he might have to use all the time if healey wanted him dead dead he would be and in short order which meant you talked me into it he said youre persuasive as hell sir you know that so glad youre pleased healey said with a nasty grin and just think of all the interesting things youll see eleven lightyears from here im thinking of all the things ill never see again johnson answered healey smirked an expression particularly revolting on his hard suspicious face johnson went on the one ill be gladdest never to see again i think is you sir he pushed off and glided out of the commandants office if they were going to hang him tomorrow anyway what difference did what he said today make it turned out not to be tomorrow a doctor came out from earth to do the dirty work calculating the cost of that johnson realized just how badly they wanted him on ice and on his way to tau ceti all that sprang to mind was if it werent for the honor of the thing id rather walk are you ready asked the doctor an attractive woman named blanchard if i say no will you turn around and go back johnson asked she shook her head not me ill just hold you down and give you the treatment anyhow she could do it too all the work in the ships gymnasium and on the exercise bike couldnt make up for johnsons being out of a gravity field the past twenty years dr blanchard was undoubtedly stronger than he was he rolled up a sleeve and bared his arm do your worst she did he felt hot first then nauseated then dizzy his heart slowed in his chest his thoughts slowed in his head this must be what dying is like he realized had something gone wrongor right he stopped thinking altogether before he could finish shaping the question jonathan yeager had started shaving his head when he was a teenager it made him look more like a lizard and hed wanted nothing so much as to be as much like a male of the race as he could he still shaved his head here in though he wasnt a teenager any more hed had his fiftieth birthday the december before the race still fascinated him too hed built a good career out of that fascination his father had gone into cold sleep seventeen years earlier most people thought sam yeager was dead even now cold sleep wasnt much talked about back in it had been one notch higher than top secret of the few aware of it nowadays fewer still knew it had existed that long as jonathan checked the incoming electronic messages on his computer he muttered under his breath the mutter wasnt particularly happy to this day people seldom thought of him as jonathan yeager expert on the race they thought of him as sam yeagers kid even to males and females of the race for whom family was much more tenuous than it was for humans he was sam yeagers hatchling as often as not not fair he said quietly he was as good with lizards as anybody breathing no one had ever complained about his ability the trouble was his father had had something more than ability his father had had precisely the right instincts to think like a male of the race instincts that amounted to genius of a highly specialized sort even the lizards admitted as much for whatever reasons of background and character and temperament jonathan didnt quite have those same instincts he was an expert he was damned good at what he did it wasnt the same it left him stuck being sam yeagers kid hed be sam yeagers kid till the day he died whats not fair karen said from behind him he spun in his chair oh hi hon he said to his wife nothing really just woolgathering i didnt know you were around karen yeager shook her head her coppery hair flipped back and forth she was almost his own age these days she had help keeping her hair red dont talk nonsense she said briskly weve known each other since high school weve been married almost thirty years do you think i cant tell when somethings eating you she ended the sentence with an interrogative cough tacked on almost automatically she was as much an expert on the lizards as he was jonathan sighed well youre not wrong he didnt say anything more he didnt have to karen pounced youre letting your dad get you down again arent you more than a little shamefaced he nodded yeah i guess i am dumb she didnt hesitate about giving her verdict dumb dumb dumb with a capital d this time she added an emphatic cough youre here hes not he was good so are you another emphatic cough followed that he was better than good and you know it jonathan waited to see if shed have the nerve to tell him he was wrong she didnt he wished she would have she said youre as good as anyone in the business nowadays im not lying to you jonathan if anybody ought to know its me she was probably right about that it made jonathan feel very little better im not a spring chicken any more he said im not a spring chicken and im still in my fathers shadow i dont know that ill ever get out of it either im in his shadow too karen said anybody who has anything to do with the race nowadays is in his shadow i dont see what we can do about that jonathan hadnt looked at it that way hed always imagined sam yeagers shadow over himself alone what son of an illustrious fatherespecially a son in the same line of workdoesnt grudgingly he said maybe maybe nothing its truth karen put the last word in the lizards language and added another emphatic cough she went on and mickey and donald think youre pretty hot stuff he couldnt deny that because it was obviously true the two lizards raised as human beings took him as seriously as theyd ever taken his father that they were adults now astonished jonathan as much as having one son in graduate school at stanford and the other a junior at ucla the boys were both studying the race that passion had passed on to the third generation will they ever think of me the way i think of my old man jonathan wondered he didnt try to answer the question just posing it was hard enough to keep from having to think about it he said mickey and donald didnt turn out too bad of course we couldnt isolate them from other lizards as much as the race isolated the human they raised lizardstyle right karen said tightly jonathan knew hed goofed by referring to kassquit even if he hadnt named her thirty years earlier hed been her introduction to humanity and to a lot of the things humans did that had almost cost him karen though he still didnt think it was all his fault he hadnt planned to go up and visit kassquit just at the time when war broke out between the race and the reich that had kept him up there with her a lot longer than hed expected and had let things between kassquit and him get more complicated and more intimate than hed thought they would karen looked as if she was about to say something more too she hadnt let him completely off the hook for kassquit not after all this time that kassquit herself had been in cold sleep for years and was probably on her way back to home by now had nothing to do with anything not as far as karen was concerned before the squabble could really flare up the telephone on jonathans desk rang saved by the bell he thought and almost said it aloud instead though he just picked up the phone jonathan yeager speaking hello yeager the voice on the other end of the line didnt identify itself it carried so much authority it didnt really need to are you by any chance familiar with the admiral peary ice and fire chased themselves through jonathan not a whole lot of people knew about the admiral peary officially he wasnt one of them unofficially unofficially everybody in the first rank of american experts on the race had been salivating ever since that name leaked out yes sir jonathan said i have heard of it he didnt say how or when or where or what the admiral peary might be no telling how secure the telephone line was the authoritative voice on the other end of the line said what hed most wanted to hear ever since that name began being bandied about how would you like to be aboard then and jonathan said what hed long since made up his mind he would say you are inviting karen and me both right for close to half a minute he got no answer then the voice suddenly sounding not quite so authoritative said ill get back to you on that click the line went dead what was that all about karen asked inviting us where aboard the admiral peary jonathan answered and her eyes got big then he said something he wished he didnt have to so far the call is just for me oh he watched her deflate hating what he saw she said thats why you asked whether it was for both of us yeah he nodded then took a deep breath theyd never talked about this probably because it cut too close to the bone it had been in jonathans mind a lot the past few years it had to have been in karens too he said if they say its just me im not going i dont need to see home bad enough to get a divorce to do it and you deserve the trip as much as i do they dont think so karen said bitterly she gave him a kiss then asked are you sure about this if you say no now youll never get another chance im sure he said and so he wasalmost some things arent worth the price you know what i mean i know youre sweet is what i know karen said what did the man say when you told him that he said ill get back to you and then he hung up on me that doesnt tell us much does it doesnt tell us a damn thing jonathan answered if he calls back with good news he does and if he calls back with bad news or he doesnt call backwell close but no cigar this is the way i want it to be hon i like being married to you you must karen said and then looked out the window and across the street so she wouldnt have to say anything more for a moment jonathan didnt understand that at all then he did and didnt know whether to laugh or get mad yes kassquit probably was homeward bound right now karen meant he was throwing over a chance to see her along with a chance to see the races world he wanted to remind her it had been thirty years since anything beyond electronic messages lay between kassquit and him ten years since kassquit herself had gone into cold sleep he wanted to but after no more than a moment he decided hed be better off if he didnt even now the less he said about kassquit the better did this man say how long it would be before he got back to you karen asked nope jonathan shook his head nothing to do but wait any which way therell be karen broke off just in time to rouse jonathans curiosity be what he asked she didnt answer when she still didnt answer he used an interrogative cough all by himself the lizards thought that was a barbarism but people did it all the time these days whether using the races language english orso jonathan had heardrussian but karen just kept standing there jonathan clucked reproachfully a human noise come on out with it reluctantly she said any which way therell be a yeager on the admiral peary oh yeah right that had occurred to jonathan before but not for a long time his laugh wasnt altogether comfortable dads been on ice for a while now were a lot closer in age than we used to be i wonder how that will play out i dont know whether its a reason to want to go or a reason to stay right where i am you wont say no if they give you what you want karen said youd better not because i want to go too we have to wait and see thats all jonathan said again mr authoritative didnt call back for the next three days jonathan jumped every time the phone rang whenever it turned out to be a salesman or a friend or even one of his sons he felt cheated each time he answered it he felt tempted to say jonathan yeager will you for gods sake drop the other shoe then he started believing the other shoe wouldnt drop maybe mr authoritative couldnt be bothered with him any more plenty of other people wouldnt have set any conditions plenty of other people would have killedin the most literal sense of the wordto get a call like that jonathan had almost abandoned hope when the man with the authoritative voice did call back all right yeager youve got a dealboth of you he hung up again were in jonathan shouted karen whooped were in karen yeager hadnt dreamt two little words could lead to so many complications but they did going into cold sleep was a lot like dying from a good many perspectives it was exactly like dying she had to wind up her affairs and her husbands as if they werent coming back she knew they might one day if they did though the world to which they returned would be as different from the one they knew as todays world was from that lost and vanished time before the lizards came the yeagers sons took the news with a strange blend of mourning and jealousy well never see you again said bruce their older boy whod come down from palo alto when he got word of what was going on never say never karen answered though she feared very much that he was right you cant tell whatll happen i wish i were going too said richard their younger son the admiral peary wow he looked up at the ceiling as if he could see stars right through it bruce nodded his face was full of stars too one of these days you may find a reason to go into cold sleep karen told them if you do it had better be a good one if you go under when youre young you stay young while youre going you do whatever you do when you get there you go back into cold sleepand everybody who was young with you when you left will be old by the time youre back everybody but you and if youre not young richard asked incautiously karen had been thinking about that too if youre not young when you start out she said you can still do what you need to do and come back again but most of what you left behind will be gone when you do she sometimesoftenwished she hadnt done such figuring the race had been flying between the stars for thousands of years the admiral peary would be a first try for mankind it wasnt as fast as the lizards starships a round trip to home and back would swallow at least sixtyfive years of real time she looked at her sons bruce was a redhead like her richards hair was dark blond like jonathans hardly anybody in their generation shaved his head to them that was something old people did but if she and jonathan came back to earth after sixtyfive years the two of them wouldnt have aged much despite all their travel and their boys would be old old men if they stayed alive at all karen hugged them fiercely each in turn oh mom richard said itll be all right everything will be all right he was at an age where he could still believe thatnot only believe it but take it for granted i wish i could karen thought she not only had to break the news to the children of her flesh she also had to tell donald and mickey shed been there when the two lizards hatched from their eggs even though jonathans dad hadnt really approved of that shed helped jonathan take care of them when they were tiny and she and jonathan had raised them ever since sam yeager went into cold sleep they were almost as dear to her as bruce and richard they were older in calendar years than her human sons she wasnt a hundred percent sure how much that meant lizards grew very rapidly as hatchlings but after that they aged more slowly than people did some of the important males whod come with the conquest fleet were still prominent today more than fifty years later that wasnt true of any human leader whod been around in even vyacheslav molotov whod seemed ready to go on forever was eight years dead now hed hoped for a hundred but had got to only ninetysix the two lizards raised as people listened without a word as she explained what would happen when shed finished they turned their eye turrets towards each other as if wondering which of them should say something as usual donald was the one who did are we going to go out there and live on our own then not right away karen answered maybe later youll have to wait and see for now there will be other people to take you in she didnt like not telling them the whole truth but she didnt have the heart for it the whole truth was that somebody would keep an eye on them for the rest of their lives however long those turned out to be the race knew about them by now by the very nature of things some secrets couldnt last forever the lizards protests had been muted considering kassquit their protests couldnt very well have been anything but muted karen didnt care to consider kassquit to keep from thinking about the lizardraised chinese woman she gave her attention back to the two americanraised lizards what do you guys think are you ready to try living on your own hell yes to her surprise that wasnt donald it was mickey the smaller and most of the time the more diffident of the pair he went on we can do it as long as we have money we can work if we have to donald said we arent stupid or lazy were good americans nobody ever said you were stupid or lazy nobody ever thought so karen answered some lizards were stupid others didnt do any more than they had to and sometimes not all of that but her scaly foster children had always been plenty sharp and plenty active what about being good americans mickeys mouth gave his english a slightly hissing flavor other than that it was pure california we are arent we he sounded anxious sure you are karen said and meant it thats part of the reason why somebody will help take care of youbecause youve been so good mickey seemed reassured donald didnt arent americans supposed to take care of themselves he asked thats what we learned when you and grandpa sam taught us well yes karen couldnt very well deny that but youre not just americans you know youre uh special why donald asked because were short he laughed out loud which showed how completely american he was the race didnt do that when it was amused karen laughed too the question had come from out of the blue and hit her right in the funny bone she had to answer him though no not because youre short because youre you it might be interesting to see home mickey said maybe we could go there too one of these days did he sound wistful karen thought so she didnt suppose she could blame him kassquit had sometimes shown a longing to come down to earth and see what it was like karen wasnt sorry kassquit hadnt got to indulge that longing worry about diseases for which she had no immunity had kept her up on an orbiting starship till she went into cold sleep those same worries might well apply in reverse to mickey and donald no sooner had that thought crossed karens mind than donald said i bet the lizards could immunize us if we ever wanted to go maybe they could karen said amused he called the race that instead of its proper name she doubted the us government would ever let him and mickey leave even if they wanted to that wasnt fair but it likely was how things worked she went on for now though till everything gets sorted out do you think you can stay here with bruce and richard stanford had promised her older son graduate credit for at least a years worth of lizardsitting where could he get better experience dealing with the race than this sure mickey said and donald nodded mickey added itll be the hottest bachelor pad in town that set karen helplessly giggling again until mickey met a female of the race in heat and giving off pheromones his interest in the opposite sex was purely theoretical but because hed been raised as a human he didnt think it ought to be and bruce and richard would love a hot bachelor pad their interest in females of their species was anything but theoretical doubt tore at karen was this worth it going off as if dying and perhaps dying in truthneither cold sleep nor the admiral peary could be called perfected even by human standards let alone the sterner ones the race used and leaving all the people who mattered to her in which she included both humans and lizards to fend for themselves was it the doubt didnt last long if she hadnt wanted hadnt hungered to learn as much about the race as she could would she have started studying it all those years ago she shook her head she knew she wouldnt have any more than jonathan would no she wanted to go aboard the admiral peary more than anything else she wished she could go and come back in a matter of weeks not in a stretch of time that ran closer to the length of a mans life she wished that yes but she also understood she couldnt have what she wished being unable to have it made her sad made her wish things were different but wouldnt stop her the day finally came when all the arrangements were made when nothing was left to do richard drove karen and jonathan from their home in torrance up to the heart of los angeles bruce rode along too richard would of course drive the buick back why not he could use it even if everything went perfectly and karen did come back to earth and southern california one day the buick would be long long gone richard and bruce might be gone too karen didnt care to think about that it made her start to puddle up and she didnt want to do that in front of her sons she squeezed them and kissed them so did jonathan who was usually more standoffish but this was a last day her husband knew that as well as she did not death not quitethey had to hope not anyhowbut close enough for government work karen laughed it was government work after last farewells her sons left if they were going to puddle up they probably didnt want jonathan and her to see it she reached for her husbands hand he was reaching for hers at the same time his fingers felt chilly not from the onset of cold sleep but from nerves she was sure hers did too her heart pounded a mile a minute a man wearing a white coat over khaki uniform trousers came out from behind a closed door last chance to change your mind folks he said karen and jonathan looked at each other the temptation was there but she said no her husband shook his head okay the army doctor said first thing you need to do then is sign about a million forms once youre done with those we can get down to the real business he exaggerated there couldnt have been more than half a million forms karen and jonathan signed and signed and signed after a while the signatures hardly looked like theirs the way they would have at the end of a big stack of travelers checks now what karen asked after the doctor took away the last piece of paper with a horizontal line on it now i get to poke holes in you he said and he did karen hung on to jonathans hand while they both felt the drugs take hold i love you jonathan muttered drowsily karen tried to answer him she was never quite sure if she succeeded a big ugly walked into the office at the races headquarters in cairo that ttomalss was using i greet you senior physician the psychologist said it was good of you to come here to talk to me and i greet you senior researcher dr reuven russie spoke the races language about as well as a tosevite could the hair had receded from the top of his head as often happened with aging male big uglies and what he had left was gray pleasetake a seat ttomalss waved to the tosevitestyle chair hed had brought into the office i thank you russie sat you are i gather interested in the american tosevites progress on cold sleep ttomalss used the affirmative gesture that is correct you will i trust understand why the issue is of considerable concern to us oh yes reuven russies head went up and down the way he nodded was a subtle compliment to ttomalss an ignorant big ugly would have used his own gesture because he did not know what the race did a tosevite who knew more would have imitated the races gesture russie who knew more still knew ttomalss was an expert on big uglies and so of course would understand a nod even where some other member of the race might not the physician went on i think they know enough to fly between the stars that is what concerns you is it not truth ttomalss tailstump twitched in agitation but how can this be so it is only a little more than fifty local years since we came to tosev before then neither the americans nor any other tosevites would have had the least interest in cold sleep and they have had to adapt our techniques to their biochemistry which is far from identical to ours every word you say is true reuven russie replied i do not know the details of their techniques they keep them secret but i can infer what they know by what they do not talk about lately they do not talk about a great many things enough so the silence is likely to cover all they need to know of this art i had arrived at a similar conclusion ttomalss said unhappily i was hoping you would tell me i was wrong when trying to figure out what tosevites are capable of the worst conclusion a male of the race can draw is usually not bad enough i do not know what to do about that the big ugly said but i can tell you where some of the differences arise how long has the race known cold sleep more than thirtytwo thousand of our yearshalf as many of yours ttomalss answered we developed it when we knew we would send out our first conquest fleet the one that brought rabotev into the empire that was twentyeight thousand years ago you started working on it four thousand of your years before you needed it russie let out a soft shrill whistle ttomalss had heard that sound before it meant bemusement gathering himself the big ugly said that is even longer than i had thought and now of course you take it completely for granted yes of course ttomalss said wondering where russie was going with this why should we not we had it largely perfected for the first conquest fleet and have made small improvements in the process from time to time ever since we want things to work as well as they possibly can and there is the difference between you and the americans reuven russie said all they care about is that things work well enough also they reach out with both handswith every fingerclaw you would sayin a way the race never seems to have done add those things together with their strong motivation to learn to fly from one star to another and i am not so very surprised they have learned enough to attempt this will theycan theysucceed ttomalss said this you understand is only a matter of my opinion the big ugly replied i would not however care to bet against them ttomalss did not care to bet against the big uglies either however much he wished he could but suppose they visit home suppose they fill their ship up with ginger russies shrug was uncannily like one a male of the race would have used suppose they do he said what can you do about it destroying their ship would surely start a war here are you certain the race would win it thirty local years earlier at the time of the last great crisis between the race and big uglies the answer to that would undoubtedly have been yes the victory might have left tosev largely uninhabitable but it would have been a victory since then though the americansand the russkis and the nipponese and even the deutsche whom the race had defeatedhad learned a great deal who would beat whom today was anyones guess ttomalss miserable hiss said he knew as much not wanting to dwell on that the male changed the subject i hope your sire is well he said such matters being part of polite conversation among tosevites i thank you for asking he is as well as he can be considering that he is nearly eighty years old reuven russie replied even doubling the number to make the years match those of home left ttomalss unimpressed his own folk wore out more slowly than big uglies he wondered whether the frenetic pace with which one generation replaced another on tosev had something to do with the equally frenetic pace of progress here he knew he was not the races first researcher to have that thought i am glad to hear it he said perhaps a heartbeat more slowly than he might have he swung one eye turret to the computer screen for a moment you have also a kinsmale who now lives in the notempire of the united states is that not a truth david goldfarb lives in canada russie answered the two notempires are similar to each other in many ways he is also well enough he is younger than my sire but not by much i thank you for the correction ttomalss said the record stated goldfarb was living in north america the local name for the northern part of the lesser continental mass hed assumed that meant the united states the notempire of canada often got lost in the shadow cast by its more populous more powerful neighbor he wondered what the canadians thought of that is there anything else senior researcher russie asked i have told you what i know and what i have guessed you will be aware that i am not formally affiliated with the moishe russie medical college nor have i been for many years if you need technical details someone who completed the full course there or one of your own experts could do a better job of furnishing them i was not seeking technical details i wanted a feel for the data ttomalss said you have given me that and i thank you for it you are welcome the tosevite physician rose towering over ttomalss once more and demonstrating why the rooms in the races headquarters were the size they were they had originally been built for big uglies reuven russie nodded stiffly and walked out of the interview chamber ttomalss began drafting his report he suspected no one would pay much attention to it it would not be optimistic not from the races point of view the powers that be favored optimism they pointed to the successful colonies on tosev and to the way animals and plants from home were spreading across the warmer regions of this planet they did not like turning an eye turret toward the tosevites continued technical progress any more than they cared to remember the rebellions that still simmered in china and elsewhere but colonists here were trained as soldiers this world had what bid fair to become a permanent soldiers time something unprecedented in the empire the authorities did to some degree recognize reality even if they wished they didnt have to tosev imposed haste even on the race ttomalss finished and submitted his report at what would have been a breakneck pace back on home but he was astonished when three days later his computer screen lit up to show the features of fleetlord reffet who was in charge of the colonists i greet you exalted fleetlord the psychologist said assuming the seated version of the posture of respect and i greet you senior researcher reffet replied to what do i owe the honor of this call ttomalss asked the american big uglies have launched what can only be a starship reffet said bluntly its course is in the general direction of home though not precisely aimed toward our sun oh ttomalss said well we did think this day would eventually come yes but not so soon reffet said you understand that this means the folk of home folk with no experience of big uglies will now have to learn to deal with them and try to understand them they will have a lively time of it then as did we of the conquest fleetand as did you of the colonization fleet ttomalss said it may even be good for them they have not begun to understand us when we talk of what things are like on tosev now they will gain the experience they need to form a more accurate opinion he did not say serves them right but the thought was prominent in his mind but reffet said that attitude will not do senior researcher we have to assume that ship is heavily armed for the first time since the empire was unified home may be in danger they need to have someone there with some real knowledge of tosevites fleetlord atvar is there ttomalss said reffet hissed angrily fleetlord atvar is a disaster waiting to happen he proved that often enough here on tosev we need someone there with real expertise not just widemouthed bombast we need someone like you there senior researcher me ttomalss hissed too in horrified dismay but my research program here is progressing so well nevertheless i am ordering you back to home reffet said which counts for more the individual or the race as a whole have you yourself been infected by the rampant egotism of the big uglies you study at first ttomalss reckoned the question horribly unfair the more he turned his eye turrets towards it though the more reasonable it seemed in any case reffet had the authority to do as he said he would ttomalss assumed the posture of respect again you may command me exalted fleetlord yes i may reffet said complacently i may and i shall settle your affairs as quickly as you can i want you in cold sleep on the next homewardbound ship i do not know when the tosevite starship will get there i hope you will arrive first i believe you will the big uglies acceleration was relatively low rememberyou may directly serve the emperor himself he cast down his eye turrets so did ttomalss he would have reckoned the honor greater before years of studying tosevite superstitions none of which took seriously the cult of spirits of emperors past or the reverence given the living emperor the big uglies ignorance had sown the seeds of doubt in him but excitement soon cast out doubt and hesitation after so long dealing with this barbarous world he was going home again at last and if he did gain the privilege of seeing the emperorwell so much the better for a long time after atvar woke up on home once more hed thought the sun looked strange in the sky hed got used to the star tosev which was hotter and bluer only tosev s much greater distance from its primary left it with such a chilly climate now though the sun seemed normal to him once more life on home had also seemed strange to him when he came out of cold sleep that dislocation had lasted longer in fact it hadnt disappeared to this day he had changed changed irrevocably during his tenure on tosev the change wasnt just one of holding a prominent command either he would have been glad enough to lay that aside but he had lived with danger and intrigue and the unexpected for year after year on home such things scarcely existed they had been obsolete here for so very long most people forgot they had ever existed atvar had long since given up trying to explain them he knew it was hopeless he might as well have tried explaining the effects of ginger to a female who had never tasted it his mouth fell open in a sardonic laugh as hed known they would smugglers had brought ginger back to home the herb was fabulously expensive here which only seemed to make males and females want it more it had already produced its first scandals more no doubt would come even the look of things had changed here that had truly rocked him back on his tailstump for it was almost unprecedented on home but young males and females seemed to enjoy acting and looking as much like big uglies as they could they wore false hair often in colors no tosevite could have grown naturally and some of them even wore cloth wrappings over their body paint which seemed a ploy deliberately designed to cause confusion atvar had expected the big uglies to imitate the race that was how things were supposed to work for the process to go into reverse struck him as altogether unnatural the fleetlord had never been found guilty of anything males and females here had endlessly questioned his judgment but no one came close to showing criminal intent that struck many other members of the race as altogether unnatural atvar lived in half disgrace the first fleetlord of a conquest fleet who wasnt a conqueror hed published his memoirs they hadnt made him rich along with his pensionwhich thanks to the emperors generosity no underling had cut offwhat theyd earned did keep him comfortable he hadnt won any new friends in the government with their titlehed called them i told you so males and females here needed telling as far as those who didnt pretend to be big uglies were concerned tosev was just a world a long way off lightyears and lightyears they knew the conquest hadnt gone the way it should but they didnt know why or what that meant despite atvars memoirs most of them seemed inclined to blame him these days one needed special skill with computers to coax his telephone code out of the dataretrieval system too many males and females had that expertise he got a lot of crank calls because he got so many he didnt rush to the phone when it hissed for attention instead he went at more of a resigned amble this is atvar i greet you he said while his fingerclaw was poised to end the conversation on the instant the male on the other end of the line said and i greet you exalted fleetlord this is senior planner facaros in the ministry of transportation facaros body paint confirmed his title what can i do for you senior planner atvar asked intrigued in spite of himself home did not have a soldiers time now there was no ministry of conquest the ministry of transportation which oversaw ordinary spaceflight came as close as any other body to taking charge of matters military we have just received word from tosev facaros said the big uglies from the notempire known as the united stateshe did not pronounce the tosevite words very wellhave launched a starship its apparent destination is home have they atvars hiss was phlegmatic not astonished well it was only a matter of time though this was a bit sooner than i expected it of them he paused to think the radio message from tosev had had to cross interstellar space of course while it was crossing the lightyears so was the big uglies ship at some respectable fraction of the speed of light how long do we have until they get here he asked about forty years or a bit more facaros replied we fly at about half of light speed so tell me something i do not know atvar snapped i have done it have you well no exalted fleetlord facaros admitted as for what you do not know the tosevite ship seems to average about one third of light speed its total travel time between tosev and home will be over sixty years more than forty years from now atvar said musingly i may be here to see it but i probably will not i have lived a long time already forty more years would be beating the odds that is one of the reasons i have called you today facaros said i wondered if you would consider going into cold sleep once more so that you could be revived when the big uglies arrival is imminent you are one of the races experts on them and you admit this now do you atvar broke in do my critics in the governmentwhich means just about everyone but the emperoradmit it as well formally no facaros said informally this request would not have been made in the absence of a consensus about your value to the race that atvar knew was bound to be true even so he said i am not a bowl of leftovers you know to go from the freezer to the microwave again and again and again certainly not and we will richly reward you for the service you perform facaros said never doubt it atvar had lived among big uglies too long whenever someone told him not to doubt something he doubted it all the more he said i care very little for money i do care for my reputation if you promise your principals will leave off all attacks on me while i am not conscious to defend myself i will do this if not they can take their chances with the big uglies why should they worry they already know everything do they not facaros hissed reproachfully this is not the proper attitude for a male to take i do not care atvar replied in my opinion the attitude a good many in the government have shown is improper if they do not wish to change it i do not wish to cooperate with them would a personal request from the emperor himself change your mind asked the male from the transportation ministry it can be arranged i am honored atvar murmured and cast down his eye turrets i am honored indeed but he made the negative gesture however honored i am though the answer remains no i have my terms i have stated them for you if your principals care to meet them well and good if they do not if they do not senior planner i must conclude they are not serious about wanting my assistance they are facaros declared then let them show it atvar had every intention of being as stubborn and unreasonable as he could why not those who had mocked himthose who now decided they needed himhad been anything but reasonable themselves facaros let out a long unhappy sigh but he made the affirmative gesture let it be as you say exalted fleetlord let everything be exactly as you say my principals shall offer no opinions on you while you are in cold sleep they are convinced the race needs you i am not convinced the race needs them atvar said facaros sighed again one of them in fact predicted you would say something along those lines your reputation for cynicism precedes you is that how you care to be remembered atvar shrugged i expect that i will be remembered i also expect that most of the emperors ministers will be forgotten facaros stirred in annoyance you are unfair and exasperating now now atvar wagged a fingerclaw at him no insults mind you you are not in cold sleep yet except possibly from the neck up facaros said instead of getting angrier atvar let his mouth drop open in a wide laugh not bad he said not bad at all and yes senior planner i am unfair and exasperating if i were not we would not have enjoyedif that is the word i wanteven such success on tosev as we did until you have dealt with big uglies you do not know what unfair and exasperating are i am only a hatchling in these matters facaros said i am sure you can instruct me he intended that for sarcasm deliberately ignoring his tone atvar made the affirmative gesture i am sure i can too and if i do not senior planner the tosevites will when they get here you may rely on that that is what concerns my principals facaros said for the sake of the race exalted fleetlord i am glad we have reached this agreement he said nothing about being glad for any reason besides the sake of the race that also amused atvar more than it annoyed him he was laughing again as he broke the connection with facaros here unlike on tosev he could take his time about preparing for cold sleep one of the preparations he made was for a software search on his name during the time when he would lie unconscious he intended to check that after he was revived if the results werent to his satisfaction he was perfectly willing to let the government deal with the big uglies without him he sent facaros an electronic message letting the other maleand those behind himknow what hed done this does not surprise me facaros wrote back why should you trust those of your own kind those who are on your side i do trust atvar wrote but trust must be verified this too is a lesson of tosev he got no reply to that he hadnt really expected one when he went into a hospital for the coldsleep treatment the physician there asked him have you undergone this procedure before twice he answered oh the physician said you will have traveled between the stars then not at all atvar told her i did not care for what was being televised and so i thought i would store myself away hoping for an improvement some years down the line no luck the first time so i tried a second i am sure this third time will prove a success the physician gave him a severe look i do not believe you are being serious she said and used an emphatic cough to let him know how much she did not believe it believe what you please atvar told her she did not seem to have the slightest idea who he was in a way that was annoying in another way it was a relief in spite of everything televisors and pundits could do he managed to escape into anonymity every now and again even his fancy body paint meant less here than it had on tosev give me your arm please the physician said atvar obeyed in all his time on tosev he hadnt had to obey anyone not till he got the summons to return to home hed given orders he hadnt taken them now he did he hissed as the jet of air blasted drugs under his scales the physician sighed at his squeamishness you cannot tell me that really hurt oh why not he said his reward was another injection and another presently the physician said you are tolerating the procedure very well good atvars mouth fell open not in a laugh but in an enormous yawn whatever else the physician did to him he never knew it when glen johnson woke he needed some little while to realize he was awake and to remember hed gone into cold sleep something here was emphatically different from the way things had been on the lewis and clark though he had weight he didnt have muchonly a couple of pounds worthbut it was the first time hed had any since the lewis and clark got out to the asteroid belt the admiral peary stayed under acceleration all the time here a woman said drink this dr blanchard he thought as his wits slowly trickled back into his head her name is dr blanchard she handed him a plastic squeeze bulb the liquid in the bulb had weight too but not enough to keep it from madly sloshing around in there it tasted like chicken souphot and salty and fatty and restorative and he needed restoring he had trouble finishing the bulb even though it wasnt very big sucking and swallowing all but drained him of strength thanks he said that was good what was it chicken broth she answered and he would have laughed if hed had the energy little by little he noticed he was hooked up to a lot of electronic monitors dr blanchard checked the readouts sleep if you want to she told him that seems normal enough seems he said around a yawn he did want to sleep why not the habit of a lot of years was hard to break well she answered we havent thawed out a whole lot of people yet were still learning he yawned again why am i one of your guinea pigs he asked if she answered he didnt hear her sleep reclaimed him when he woke again he felt stronger dr blanchard gave him more chicken soup even if she primly insisted on calling it chicken broth he found out her first name was melanie right out of gone with the wind she disconnected him from the monitors he looked at his hands his nails seemed no longer than they had when he went under he felt his chin his face was still smooth this beats the heck out of rip van winkle he said i thought so too there was a familiar voice then i found out what id have for company well well look what the cat drug in johnson yawned again talking still took an effort getting his mind to work straight took a bigger one i was thinking the same thing about you mickey flynn replied with dignity i have better reason too i daresay i wouldnt be surprised johnson said another yawn came out he wondered if he would ever feel awake again he looked around the chamber where theyd revived him wasnt big enough to swing the cat he and flynn had been talking about where the devil are we anyway the middle of nowhere flynn replied and i mean that more literally than anyone has in all the history of humanity were more than five lightyears from the sun and were more than five lightyears from tau ceti too even in johnsons decrepit state that sent awe prickling through him but then he asked why wake me up for this i dont know anything about flying the admiral peary out here im the insystem pilot two reasons flynn said one is i wanted to see if you were still alive present results appear ambiguous and the horse you rode in on johnson said sweetly the fog was beginning to lifta little thank you so much the other pilot replied as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted i wanted to see if you were alive if by some mischance you werent that would make me insystem pilot and change the revival schedule so i needed to know you went into cold sleep earlier than i did the techniques have been improved since thats cause youre the teachers pet johnson said healey couldnt wait to put me on ice the son of a bitch he didnt much care what he said that was probably an effect of coming out from under the drugs too i could call that a slander on the whole of the hibernian race flynn said on the other hand seeing that its healey i could just nod my head wisely and say youre right all things considered i have to go with the second approach however irish the man may be a son of a bitch he is and that without a doubt back on the lewis and clark he never would have admitted such a thing of course back on the lewis and clark he had to deal with lieutenant general healey now he must have been sure the badtempered officer was as far behind them as the rest of the solar system more than five lightyears you said there was more than one reason to wake me up now johnson observed he remembered he was proud of himself for remembering that said something about how fuzzy his wits had been before mickey flynn nodded thats true i did whats the other one johnson asked in my ignorance i thought you might be interested in seeing what the sky looks like out here as we turn the ship flynn said no matter how good we get at flying between the stars this isnt something a whole lot of people will ever get to do i should say not johnson exclaimed eagerness blazing through him no matter how weak and woozy he felt most of the passengers will stay frozen from start to finish he turned to dr blanchard can i go up i dont know she answered can you well find out he tried to lever himself off the table where he lay only to discover he was strapped on melanie blanchard made no move to set him free its a test he realized if i cant undo the straps i dont deserve to do anything else his fingers were clumsy and stupid they took longer than they should have to figure out how the latches worked but they did it he sat up torn between triumph and worry my brains will come back he asked her theyre supposed to she said which struck him as imperfectly reassuring the admiral peary s acceleration produced barely enough weight to keep him on the table when he slid off he glided ever so slowly to the metal floor he would have had to go off a cliff like wile e coyote to do himself any serious damage he bounced from the floor toward flynn lead on macduff thats lay on macduff flynn looked pained dont tamper with the bard at this late date and this distance i doubt hell complain johnson said oh so do i the other pilot said thats why im doing it for him helpful johnson observed and flynn nodded blandly johnson went on well anyway show me show me around too this is the first time ive been consciousas conscious as i amon the admiral peary would be nice to know what im flying you dont ask for much do you flynn brachiated up the hatchway the starships tiny acceleration wasnt enough to worry about not as far as motion was concerned feeling like a chimpanzee himselfan elderly arthritic downright spavined chimpanzeejohnson followed the lewis and clark had had observation windows fronted by antireflectioncoated glass the admiral peary had an observation dome also made from glass that might as well not have been there coming up into it was like getting a look at space itself johnson stared out slowly his jaw dropped jesus he whispered mickey flynn nodded again this time in perfect understanding youve noticed have you it does hit home yeah johnson said and said nothing else for the next several minutes there was no sun in the sky that hit home sure as hell like a left to the jaw johnson understood exactly what it meant it wasnt that the sun was hiding as it hid behind the earth during the night when it did that you knew where it was even if you couldnt see it not here not now there was nothing but blackness with stars scattered through it and the closest of those stars was lightyears away and i thought the asteroid belt was a long way from home johnson murmured at last i hadnt even gone into the next room does make you wonder why we thought we were the lords of creation doesnt it flynn said johnson hadnt thought of it that way but he couldnt help nodding flynn continued look a little longer tell me what else you see besides the big nothing okay johnson said and he did he knew how the stars were supposed to look from space not many humansprobably not many lizards eitherknew better as flynn had said he would he needed a while to see anything else by the absence of a sun but he did and his jaw fell again the outlines of the constellations were wrong oh not all of them orion looked the same as it always had so did the southern cross he knew why too their main stars were a long long way from the sun too far for a mere five or six lightyears to change their apparent position but both the dogs that accompanied orion through the skies of earth had lost their principal stars sirius and procyon were bright because they lay close to the sun going halfway to tau ceti rudely shoved them across the sky johnson spotted them at last because they were conspicuous and didnt belong where they were he also spotted another bright star that didnt belong where it was and couldnt for the life of him figure out from where it had been displaced he finally gave up and pointed towards it whats that one there not far from arcturus flynn didnt need to ask which one he meant and smiled a most peculiar smile interesting you should wonder i had to ask walter stone about that one myself well what is it johnson said a little irritably mickey flynns smile got wider johnsons annoyance grew with it then all at once that annoyance collapsed he took another look at that unfamiliar yellow star the hair stood up on his arms and the back of his neck in a very small voice he said oh thats right flynn said thats the sun lord johnson sounded more reverent than hed thought he could thats quite something isnt it you might say so the other pilot answered yes you just might say so tau ceti of course remained in the same place in the sky as it had before it was brighter now but still seemed nothing special it was an intrinsically dimmer star than the sun before the lizards came no one had ever paid any attention to it or to epsilon eridani or to epsilon indi the three stars whose inhabited planets the race had ruled since men were still hunters and gatherers now everyone knew the first two epsilon indi deep in the southern sky and faintest of the three remained obscure when we wake up again johnson said when we wake up again well be there oh yes flynn nodded pity we wont be able to go down to home well yeah too much time with no gravity johnson said and mickey flynn nodded again johnson pointed back toward the sun but we saw this at the moment it seemed a fair trade kassquit swam up toward consciousness from the black depths of a sleep that might as well have been death when she looked around she thought at first that her eyes werent working the way they should shed lived her whole life aboard starships metal walls and floors and ceilings seemed normal to her she knew stone and wood and plaster could be used for the same purposes but the knowledge was purely theoretical focusing on thetechnician tending her was easier i greet you kassquit said faintly her voice didnt want to obey her will even her faint croak was enough to make the female of the race jerk in surprise oh you do speak our language the technician said they told me you did but i was not sure whether to believe them of course i do i am a citizen of the empire kassquit hoped she sounded indignant and not just terribly terribly tired what do i look like to her it was a rhetorical question to the technician it was anything but one of those horrible big uglies from that faroff star she said how can you be a citizen of the empire if you look like them i must be on home kassquit realized males and females on tosev know who and what i am never mind how i can be i am that is all she said she looked around again the whitepainted chamber was probably part of a hospital it looked more like a ships infirmary than anything else home she thought again and awe filled her i made it she whispered so you did the technician seemed none too pleased about admitting it how do you feel worn kassquit answered honestly am i supposed to be this weary i do not know i have no experience with big uglies the female of the race never stopped to wonder if that name might bother kassquit she went on males and females of the race often show such symptoms upon revival though that is some relief kassquit said here the technician gave her a beaker filled with a warm yellowish liquid i was told you were to drink this when you were awake enough to do so it shall be done kassquit said obediently the stuff was salty and a little greasy and tasted very good i thank you she returned the empty beaker very nice what was it shed succeeded in surprising the female again do you not know it must have been something from your world it has nothing to do with ours wait she looked inside what had to be kassquits medical chart it is something called chicknzup is that a word in the big ugly language i do not know kassquit answered i speak only the language of the race how very peculiar the technician said well instructions are that you are to rest will you rest i will try kassquit said the sleeping mat on which she lay was identical to the one shed had in the starship why not a sleeping mat was a sleeping mat she closed her eyes and wiggled and fell asleep when she woke it was dark she lay quietly the small sounds of this place were different from the ones shed known all her life along with the noises of the starships ventilation and plumbing there had been lots of tapes of random sounds of home but she knew all the noises on those by now here her ears were hearing things theyd never met before something buzzed at the window when she looked that way she saw a small black shape silhouetted against the lighter sky it moved and the buzzing noise moved with it she realized it was alive awe washed through her again except for males and females of the race and a few big uglies it was the first living thing shed ever seen in person she got to her feet slowly carefully she walked toward the window her legs were uncertain beneath her but held her up she peered at the creature it sensed she was near and stopped buzzing it clung quietly to the window glass as she peered at it she realized she knew what it was some kind of ffissach they had eight legs many of themthis one obviously includedhad wings like most of them it was smaller than the last joint of her middle finger home had millions of different species of them they ate plants and one another bigger lifeforms devoured them by the billions every day without them the ecosystem would collapse kassquit knew all about that from her reading she hadnt expected to find any ffissachi inside buildings she especially hadnt expected to find one inside a hospital didnt the race value hygiene and cleanliness she knew it did her experience on the starships orbiting tosev had taught her as much so what was this one doing here as she stood there watching it it began to fly and buzz again its wings beat against the window glass she didnt suppose it understood about glass everything in front of it looked clear why couldnt it just fly through it kept trying and trying and trying kassquit was so fascinated she thought she could have watched the little creature all night she thought so anyhow till her legs wobbled so badly she almost sat down hard on the floor she also found herself yawning again whatever went into cold sleep it hadnt all worn off yet she made her way back to the sleeping mat and lay down again for a little while the ffissachs buzzing kept her from going back to sleep but only for a little while when she woke again it was light sunlight streamed in through the window the ffissach was still there but silent and motionless now before kassquit could look at it in the better light the technician came in i greet you she said how do you feel this morning i thank youi am better kassquit pointed to the window what is that ffissach doing there the technician walked over squashed it against the palm of her hand and then cleaned herself with a moist wipe they are nuisances she said they do get in every once in a while though you killed it kassquit felt a pang of dismay at the little death not least because it took her by surprise well what did you expect me to do take it outside and let it go the technician sounded altogether indifferent to the ffissachs fate there was a stain on the inside of the window i do not know what your custom is kassquit answered unhappily do you know whether you want breakfast the technician asked plainly doubting whether kassquit could make up her mind about anything yes please she answered all right some of your foods came with you on the starship and i also have a list of foods from home you have proved you can safely eat which would you prefer foods from home are fine kassquit said i am on home after all all right wait here do not go anywhere yes the technician was convinced kassquit had no brains at all i will bring you food do not go away with a last warning hiss the technician left she soon returned carrying a tray like the ones in the starship refectory it held the same sorts of food kassquit had been eating there too she used her eating tongs as automatically and as well as a female of the race would have when she finished the technician took away the tray what do i do now kassquit called after the female wait was the only answer she got wait she did she went to the window and looked out at the landscape spread out before her she had never seen such a thing in person before but the vista seemed familiar to her thanks to countless videos those were buildings and streets there streets with cars and buses in them the irregular projections off in the distance were mountains and yes the sky was supposed to be that odd shade of dusty greenish blue not black kassquit also looked down at herself her body paint was in sad disarrayhardly surprising after so many years of cold sleep as shed thought she would she found a little case of paints in the room and began touching herself up shed almost finished when a male spoke from the doorway i greet you ah researcher reading his body paint at a glance she assumed the posture of respect and i greet you senior researcher what can i do for you superior sir i am called stinoff the male said you must understand you are the first tosevite i have met in person though i have been studying your species through data relayed from tosev fascinating astonishing his eye turrets traveled her from head to feet what do you wish of me superior sir kassquit asked again you must also understand it is later than you think senior researcher stinoff said when you came to home you were kept in cold sleep until it became evident the starship full of wild tosevites would soon arrive we did not wish to expend undue amounts of your lifespan without good reason that starship is now nearly here which accounts for your revival at this time i see kassquit said slowly i thought that as a citizen of the empire i might have had some say in the timing of my awakening i made it clear i wished to become familiar with home as soon as possible under normal circumstances you would have stinoff said in your case however how can circumstances be normal and i thought that as a citizen of the empire you would recognize that the needs of society take precedence over those of any one individual he had a point and a good one aggressive individualism was a trait more common and more esteemed among the barbarous big uglies than in the race kassquit used the affirmative gesture that is a truth superior sir i cannot deny it how may i be of the greatest use to the empire you have direct experience with tosevites stinoff was kind enough or clever enough to keep from reminding her again that she was a tosevite he went on negotiations with these foreignersan archaic word in the language of the racewill not be easy or simple you will work on our side along with fleetlord atvar and senior researcher ttomalss oh kassquit said ttomalss is here then yes stinoff said he was recalled while you were on the journey between tosev and home he has spent the time since his revival preparing for the coming of the tosevite starship ttomalss had more time to spend than kassquit that hadnt seemed to matter when she was younger her own time had stretched out before her in what seemed an endless orbit but it was not endless it was spiraling down toward decay burnout and extinguishmentand it spiraled more quickly than that of a male or female of the race nothing to be done about it i was told this would be a starship from the notempire of the united states kassquit said stinoff made the affirmative gesture kassquit asked do we know the identities of the tosevites on the ship no not yet the male from home replied they will still be in cold sleep the ship is not yet in our solar system though it is close i see kassquit said well it may be interesting to find out when sam yeager returned to consciousness his first clear thought was that he was dreaming he knew just what kind of dream it was too a dream out of some sciencefiction story or other hed read them and enjoyed them since the first sciencefiction pulps came out when he was a young man the elasticity that reading science fiction gave his mind was no small part of how hed got involved in dealing with the lizards to begin with this dream certainly had a sciencefictional quality to it he didnt weigh anything at all he was he discovered strapped down on a table if he hadnt been he could have floated away that was interesting less enjoyably his stomach was doing its best to crawl up his throat hand over hand he gulped trying to hold it down im on my way to the moon he thought hed been to the moon once before and hed been weightless all the way so maybe this wasnt a dream after all he opened his eyes it wasnt easy he felt as if each one had a millstone on it when he succeeded he wondered why hed bothered the room in which he found himself told him very little it was bare mattefinished metal with fluorescent tubes on the ceiling giving off light someonea womanin a white smock hung over him yes he was weightless and so was she do you hear me colonel yeager she asked do you understand me by the way she said it she was repeating herself sam nodded that was even harder than opening his eyes had been he paused gathered strength and tried to talk where am i the traditional question he wondered if the woman heard him his throat felt full of glue and cotton balls but her nod told him shed got it youre in orbit around home in the tau ceti system she answered do you understand he nodded again and croaked ill be a son of a bitch he wouldnt usually have said that in front of a woman especially one he didnt know he still had drugs scrambling his brains he could tell how slow and dopey he was had he offended her noshe was laughing bit by bit things got clearer so the cold sleep worked it sure did she said and handed him a plastic drinking bulb here have some of this clumsily sam reached out and took it it was warm which made him realize how cold his hands were how cold all of him was he drank it tasted like chicken brothand tasting it made him realize the inside of his mouth had tasted like a slit trench before he couldnt empty the bulb but he drank more than half when he tried to speak again it came easier what year is this its colonel yeager the woman answered christ sam said violently his shiver had nothing to do with the chill the broth had started to dispel he was years old older than moses by god he thought true he remembered only seventy of those years but he had without a doubt been born in the starship took off in in colonel its called the admiral peary christ sam said once more this time in a calmer tone hed been two years old when admiral peary made it to the north poleor as some people claimed later didnt make it but said he did he wondered what the old geezer would have thought of this trip hed have been jealous as hell was what occurred to him more slowly than it should have another thought crossed his mind hed gone into cold sleep in theyd kept him on ice for eighteen years before they took him aboard the starship it wasnt just because he was an expert on the race either he knew better than that theyd wanted to make sure he stayed out of the way too and theyd got what they wanted he was more than ten lightyears out of the way if he ever saw earth again it would be at least twothirds of the way through the twentyfirst century to heck with moses look out methuselah im dr melanie blanchard by the way the woman said uhpleased to meet you sam held out a hand she gave it a brisk pump and then said you wont know this of course but your son and daughterinlaw are aboard this ship they havent been revived yet but everything on the instrument panels looks good thats good thats wonderful in fact sam still wasnt thinking as fast as he should he needed close to half a minute to find the next question he needed to ask when did they go under not long before the ship left biologically your son is fifty dr blanchard talked about jonathans age with a womans discretion she didnt mention karens fifty lord sam said his son had been a young man when he went into cold sleep himself jonathan wasnt young any moreand neither was karen dammit sam realized he had to catch up with a third of their lives he also realized something else how mushily he was talking dr blanchard had been too discreet to mention that too he asked could i have my choppers please you sure can she gave them to him he popped them into his mouth he hadnt worn them in more than fifty years or since yesterday depending on how you looked at things thats better he said and so it was i can hardly talk like a human being without em let alone like a lizard i understood you before she said and there were other things to worry about like what he wondered answers werent hard to find like making sure he was alive like making sure he still had two working brain cells to rub against each other if theyd hauled him more than ten lightyears and ended up with nothing but a rutabaga some of them wouldnt have been too disappointed before he could get too bitter about that a mans voice called from a hatchway leading out of the room anybody home without waiting for an answer the man came gliding down into the chamber he was about sixty very lean with a long face and graying sandy hair cropped close to his head he wore a tshirt and shorts the shirt had a colonels eagles pinned to the shoulders youre yeager eh last time i lookedbut that was a while ago sam replied the other man grinned sam added youre one up on me sorry about that im glen johnson are you im damned glad to meet you in person colonel as he had for dr blanchard yeager stuck out his hand the other man took it he didnt have much of a grip even at seventy even coming out of cold sleep sam could have squashed his hand without half trying maybe his surprise showed on his face for johnson said i spent more than twenty years weightless out in the asteroid belt before they decided to refrigerate me oh you were on the lewis and clark yeager asked and johnson nodded sam went on i wondered why i never heard from you again after we talked when you were flying orbital patrol now i understand better he paused for more thought so they put you away in his wits were clearer but still slow thats right johnson nodded again how about you me it was they looked at each other neither said anything neither needed to say anything theyd both gone into cold sleepbeen urged almost forced to go into cold sleepyears before the admiral peary was ready to fly the reasons behind that seemed altogether too obvious isnt it great to be politically reliable sam murmured who me glen johnson said deadpan they both laughed johnson went on actually depending on how you look at things its not that bad they were so eager to send us far far away they gave us the chance to see home he said the name in english and then in the lizards language well thats true sam said they can get some use out of us here and were too far away to get into a whole lot of trouble thats how i figure it too johnson agreed and speaking of seeing home how would you like to see home can i sam forgot about the straps and tried to zoom off the table that didnt work he looked at dr blanchard may i if youve got enough coordination to undo those straps youve got enough to go up to the control room she told him he fumbled at them glen johnson laughednot mockingly but sympathetically he said ive done that twice now twice sam tried to make his fingers obey him there a buckle loosened yeah twice johnson said they woke me halfway through so i could help in the turnship maneuver everybody here will get a good look at home pretty soon i saw the sky with no sun anywhere a certain somber prideand more than a little awefilled his voice yeager tried to imagine how empty that sky would seemtried and felt himself failing but his hands seemed smarter when he wasnt telling them what to do two more latches came loose he flipped back the belts that held him to the table that was when he realized he was naked melanie blanchard took it in stride so did johnson sam decided he would too she tossed him underpants and shorts and a tshirt like the pilots here she said put these on if you want to he did he thought the underpants were the ones hed been wearing when he went downtown to go into cold sleep the shirt like johnsons had eagles pinned to the shoulders come on johnson said and went up the hatchway slowly creakily sam followed johnson was smooth in weightlessness he would be of course yeager was anything but a splash of sunlight brightened the top of the corridor he paused there to rest for a moment before going up into the control room oh he said softly here he was resting like a cat in the sunlight of another star tau ceti was a little cooler a little redder than the sun sam stared at the light was there a difference maybe a little the lizards whod evolved here saw a bit further into the infrared than people could but violet was ultraviolet to them come on glen johnson said again im coming sam thrust himself up into the control room then he said oh once more for there was home filling the sky below him with it there below suddenly had a meaning again he had to remind himself he wouldnt he couldnt fall hed seen earth from orbit naturally the cloudbanded blue mingled here and there with green and brown and gold would stay in his memory forever his first thought of home was theres a lot less blue on earth land was islands in a great alltouching sea here seas dotted what was primarily a landscape the first lizards whod gone around their world had done it on foot and the greens he saw were subtly different from those of earth he couldnt have said how but they were something down in his bones knew what looked like desert stretched for untold miles between the seas he knew it wasnt so barren as it seemed life had spent as long adapting to the conditions here as it had back on earth im jealous of you johnson said of me how come youll be able to go down there and take a good close look at things the pilot answered im stuck here in the ship after so long aboard the lewis and clark gravity would kill me pretty damn quick oh sam felt foolish i should have thought of that im sorry you must feel like moses looking at the promised land a little bitbut there is one difference johnson paused sam waved for him to go on he did all moses could do was look me i can blow this place to hell and gone the admiral peary came loaded for bear ttomalss looked up into the night sky of home some of the bright stars there moved the race had had orbital vehicles for as long as theyd been a unified speciesa hundred thousand years more or less but one of these moving stars the first one ever didnt belong to the race it was full of wild big uglies which one ttomalss couldnt pick it out not at a glance for all he knew it could have been on the other side of the world that hardly mattered it was there noit was here the tosevites were forcefully reminding the race they werent quiet subjects werent quiet colleagues like the rabotevs or hallessi it wasnt as if he hadnt know this day was coming he wouldnt have been recalled to home if it hadnt been but hed been revived for years now and nobody seemed to have any better idea of what to do about the big uglies than males and females had had before he went into cold sleep that not only worried him it also annoyed him quite a few things about home annoyed him these days from the ridiculous appearance of the young to the way males and females here seemed unable to make up their minds nobody decided anything in a hurry it often looked as if nobody decided anything at all his time on tosev had changed him more than hed imagined while he was there the psychologists mouth fell open in a laugh though it really wasnt funny if you couldnt make up your mind on tosev youd end up deadeither that or hornswoggled by the big uglies depending you had to be able to decide you had to be able to act here this place felt like the back side of a sand dune the wind blew past overhead but nothing here really changed ttomalss laughed again strange how living among barbarians could be so much more vivid so much more urgent than living among his own kind the race didnt hurry till he went to tosev hed thought of that as a virtue now perversely it seemed a vice and a dangerous one his telephone hissed he took it off his belt senior researcher ttomalss speaking he said i greet you and i greet you superior sir kassquit replied here on home her mushy tosevite accent was unique unmistakable activity aboard the tosevite starship appears to be increasing ah ttomalss said even here the big uglies on the starship were enterprising is that so it is superior sir his former ward replied reconnaissance video now shows tosevites coming up into the ships observation dome and our speculations back on tosev appear to have been correct her voice rose in excitement ah ttomalss said again to which speculations do you refer i have viewed magnified images from the video footage superior sir and one of the wild big uglies appears to be sam yeager really are you certain ttomalss asked i am to show how certain she was kassquit used an emphatic cough well well ttomalss had to believe her like any male or female of the race he had a hard time telling big uglies apart especially when facial features were all he had to go on he hadnt evolved to detect subtle difference between one of those alien faces and another kassquit had she did it without thinking and she was usually right it worked both ways of course shed once told him she recognized members of the race more by their body paint than by differences in the way they looked and wild big uglies even had trouble telling males and females apart from one another to ttomalss differences in scale patterns eyeturret size snout shape and so on were glaringly obvious he and his kind had evolved to notice those not whatever different cues big uglies used kassquit said i wonder whether sam yeagers hatchling is also aboard the tosevite starship time will tell ttomalss answered so it will kassquit sounded eager hopeful enthusiastic years before jonathan yeager had introduced her to tosevite mating practices ttomalss was aware he understood those and the emotional drives that went with them only intellectually kassquit sounded not the least bit intellectual perhaps i should remind you that as of the time when i went into cold sleep jonathan yeager remained in an exclusive mating contract with a tosevite female ttomalss said in fact they both appear to have entered cold sleep not long before i did though i do not know for what purpose this being so if he is aboard the starship his mate is likely to be aboard as well truth now kassquit might have hated him ttomalss silently sighed he had once more underestimated the power of mating urges to shape tosevite behavior those and the bonds existing between parents and hatchlings were the strongest forces that drove big uglies even kassquit with the finest civilized upbringing possible on tosev was not immune to them the other thing ttomalss had to remember was that if he underestimated those forces despite his extensive experience other alleged experts on the big uglies experts who had never been within lightyears of tosev would do far worse it was no doubt fortunate that hed been recalled to home however important it was that he continue his work on tosev this took priority may i ask you something superior sir kassquit spoke with cold formality you may always ask ttomalss replied if the answer is one that i possess you shall have it very well was it at your instruction that i was left in cold sleep for so long after reaching home i do not appreciate being used as nothing more than a tool against the big uglies i have the same rights and privileges as any other citizen of the empire of course you do ttomalss said soothingly but how could i have done such a thing you left tosev for home years before i did silence followedbut not for long angrily kassquit said how could you have done such a thing superior sir nothing simpler as soon as i went into cold sleep you could have arranged to have the order sent by radio from tosev to here radio waves travel twice as fast as our ships the order not to revive me at once could easily have been waiting when i arrived the question i am asking is did you send such an order in many ways she was indeed a citizen of the empire she could figure out the implications of interstellar travel and communication as readily as any member of the race somehow in spite of everything ttomalss had not expected that when he did not answer right away kassquit said i might have known and yet i am supposed to work with you by the spirits of emperors past superior sir why should i for that ttomalss did have an answer ready for the sake of the race for the sake of the empire what about my sake kassquit demanded despite her upbringing parts of her were tosevite through and through by the standards of the race she was a pronounced individualist putting her own needs above those of the community in the larger scheme of things which carries the greater weight ttomalss asked if the larger scheme of things is built on lies what difference does it make kassquit retorted that charge had fangsor it would have had it held truth i never told you i would not send such a request to home ttomalss said while you may put your own interests first i am obliged to give precedence to the race as a whole so are the males and females here who concurred in my judgment now kassquit was the one who needed some time to think about how she would reply at last she said had you asked if i would accept the delay in revival i probably would have said yes i recognize the needs of the empire too superior sir regardless of what you may think but it was presumptuous of you to believe you could decide this matter for me without consulting me that is what gets under my scales she had no scales of course but that was the races idiom she did have a point of sorts remembering that he would have to try to work with her ttomalss yielded to the degree he could i apologize for my presumption i should have asked you as you say i will not make such an error again i will also try to keep any other member of the race from doing so another pause from kassquit at the end of it she said thank you superior sir that is better than nothing it is also better than anything i expected to hear you say ttomalss sighed you are not fully happy among us that is a truth superior sir kassquit used another emphatic cough do you believe you would be happier among the wild big uglies he asked that can in large measure be arranged if you so desire now that they have come to home but kassquit said no with yet another emphatic cough i am betwixt and between one thing biologically something very different culturally this is your doing there have been times when i was grateful to you there have been times when i loathed you beyond all measure there have been times when i felt both those things at once which was very confusing i believe you ttomalss said what do you feel now are you still working on your research superior sir kassquit gibed of course i am i always will be till my dying day the male answered he said nothing about kassquits dying day which was liable to occur first but i also want to know for my own sakeand for yours your welfare matters to me it matters very much now he let out an emphatic cough of his own maybe his sentiment helped disarm kassquit maybe that emphatic cough convinced her he was sincere slowly she said these days what i feel is that what i feel does not matter so much you did what you did neither of us can change it these days far too much time has passed for that to be possible i have to make the best of things as they are that strikes me as a sensible attitude ttomalss said it strikes me as a sensible attitude too kassquit said that is why i strive to hold on to it but holding on to it is not always easy just before he asked why not ttomalss checked himself males and females of the race were full of irrational behavior the big uglies from all hed seen were even fuller their hormonal drives operated all the time not only during mating season he sighed again at bottom the race and the big uglies were both evolved animals that they behaved like animals was no wonder that they sometimes didnt behave like animals might have been and now the big uglies were here ttomalss looked up into the night sky again no he couldnt tell which moving star was in fact their spaceship which it was didnt matter anyhow that they were here at all meant one thing and one thing only trouble and when had dealing with tosevites ever meant anything else hey son do you hear me jonathan yeager heard the words sure enough the words and the familiar voice at first in the confusion of returning consciousness the voice mattered for more a slow smile stretched across his face though his eyes hadnt opened yet dad he whispered hi dad you made it jonathan his father said we made it were in orbit around home when you wake up a little more you can look out and see the lizards planet with an effort jonathan opened his eyes there was his father floating at an improbable angle a woman in a white smock floated nearby at an even more improbable one made it jonathan echoed then as his wits slowly and creakily began to work he smiled again havent seen you in a hell of a long time dad only seems like a little while to me his father answered you drove me downtown and i woke up here yeah jonathan said his voice still dreamy but i had to drive the goddamn car back too he looked around his neck worked anyhow wheres karen the woman spoke up shes next on the revival schedule mr yeager all the signs on the diagnostic monitors look optimal good jonathan discovered he could nod as well as crane his neck thats good tears stung his eyes he nodded again here have some of this the woman held a drinking bulb to his mouth he sucked like a baby it wasnt milk though it was before he could find what that taste was she told him chicken broth goes down easy it didnt go down that easily swallowing took effort everything took effort of course hed been on ice for how long he didnt need to ask where am i theyd told him that but what year is this seemed a perfectly reasonable question and so he asked it its his father answered if you look at it one way youre going to be eightyeight toward the end of the year of course if you look at it that way im older than the hills so id rather not his father had seemed pretty old to jonathan when he went into cold sleep from thirtythree which jonathan had been then seventy would do that from fifty where jonathan was now seventy still seemed a good age but it wasnt as one with the pyramids of egypt ive done a lot of catching up with him he realized thats pretty strange can i get up and have that look around he asked if you can you may the woman in the white smock answered as precise with her grammar as jonathans mother had always been its a test his father added if youre coordinated enough to get off the table youre coordinated enough to move around it proved harder than jonathan thought it would what was that line from the bible if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning that was it both his right hand and his left seemed to have forgotten their cunning hell they seemed to have forgotten what they were for finally he did manage to escape whew he said he hadnt imagined a few buckles and straps could be so tough the woman in white gave him shorts and a tshirt to match what his father had on he hadnt noticed he was naked till then come on sam yeager said control room is up through that hatchway he pushed off toward the hatchway with the accuracy of someone whod been in space before come to that jonathan had too his own push wasnt so good but he could blame that on muscles that still didnt want to do what they were supposed to he not only could he did jonathan pulled himself up the handholds and into the control room along with his father two officers were already in there the leaner one eyed jonathan turned to the rounder one and said looks like his old man doesnt he poor devil the rounder man agreed these refugees from a bad comedy show are glen johnson and mickey flynn sam yeager said pointing to show who was who theyre the glorified bus drivers who got us here two of the glorified bus drivers flynn corrected our most glorified driver is presently asleep he does that every once in a while whether he needs to or not stoned be happier if he didnt johnson said hed be happier if nobody did he and flynn did sound like a team jonathan yeager would have been more inclined to sass them about it if he hadnt started staring at home hed seen it in videos from the race of course but the difference between a video on a screen and a real world out there seeming close enough to touch was about the same as the difference between a picture of a kiss and the kiss itself wow jonathan said softly you took the words out of my mouth son his father said were really here jonathan whispered hearing about it in the room where hed revived was one thing seeing a living planet that wasnt earth seeing it in person and up close wow he said again yes were really here flynn said and so the lizards have laid out the red carpet for us because theyre so thrilled to see us at their front door excuse me johnson said and looked down at his wrist as if at a watch i think my irony detector just went off cant imagine why flynn cocked a hand behind one ear dont you hear the brass band im just glad the race never thought of cheerleaders how long had the two of them been sniping at each other they might almost have been married a light went on in jonathans head you two are off the lewis and clark arent you who us flynn said i resemble that remark johnson said its the stench of healey thats what it is it clings to us wherever we go healey jonathan wondered how hard his leg was being pulled our commandant mickey flynn replied renowned throughout the solar systemand now here toofor the sweetness of his song and the beauty of his plumage plumage my ass johnson muttered we thought wed gone lightyears to get away from himworth it too but turns out he came along in cold sleep so now hes running this ship dammit healeys a martinetone of those people who give military discipline a bad name there are more of them than there ought to be im afraid sam yeager said johnson looked as if he wanted to say even more than he had but held back that struck jonathan as sensible if this healey was as nasty as all that he made little lists and checked them a lot more than twice i wonder whos president these days he remarked as of last radio signal it was a woman named joyce peterman johnson replied with a shrug that meant the news surprised him too of course last radio signal left more than two terms ago so its somebody else by nowor if its not things have really gone to hell back there as long as the radio signals keep coming im happy jonathans father said they could elect mortimer snerd and i wouldnt care jonathan whod grown up as television ousted radio barely knew who mortimer snerd was he understood what his father was talking about just the same radio signals from earth to tau ceti meant the lizards and the americansor the russians or the japanese or since the last nazilizard war was almost seventy years past by now even the germanshadnt thrown enough missiles at one another to blast the home planet back to the stone age my kids are as old as i am now jonathan thought and then he shook his head that was wrong if it was his kids were older than he was in any sane universe that should have been impossible but then nobody had ever shown this was a sane universe he looked upor was it down at home the universe might not be sane but it was beautiful radio signals are useful things flynn said we let the lizards know we were coming so they could bake us a cake and we let them know that if the signals from the admiral peary stopped coming while she was in the tau ceti system wed bake them a planet he paused for a precisely timed beat and then finished i love subtle hints subtle right but jonathan knew the lizards would be pitching a fit down there this had been their imperial center for tens of thousands of years the place from which theyd set out on their conquests now they had uninvited guests no wonder they were jumpy weve got one ship here glen johnson said one ship against everything the race has in space they came at us with their goddamn conquest fleet when we were flying prop jobs i dont waste a lot of grief on them they didnt even expect us to have those jonathans father said they were looking for knights in shining armor hell if youve ever seen that photo their probe took they were looking for knights in rusty armor if theyd found them they might not have lost a male the race always took a long time to get ready before doing anything that had saved mankind once jonathan dared hope it would work for the admiral peary too but the lizards back home had seen they couldnt sit around and dawdle when dealing with big uglies did the ones here also realize that well find out he thought something else occurred to him as casually as he could he asked his father have we heard from kassquit did she make it through cold sleep all right well yes as a matter of fact sam yeager answered with a rather sheepish grin difference is you know she went into cold sleep i didnt because she went in after me i got a jolt when i heard what had to be a human speaking the lizards language and asking for regeya jonathan laughed the two american pilots looked blank regeya flynn said plaintively while johnson asked just who is this kassquit person anyway a traitor you never did exactly explain that sam regeyas the name i used on the lizards electronic network back home jonathans father said and no kassquits not a traitor not the way you mean shes got a right to be loyal to the other side she was raised by the lizards ever since she was a tiny baby youve met her glen johnson asked jonathan and his father both nodded raised by lizards was she flynn said the yeagers nodded again the pilot asked and how crazy is she sam yeager looked to jonathan who knew her better some jonathan said maybe more than some but less than youd expect shes very smart i think that helped we did the same thing to mickey and donald too he thought they at least had each other kassquit didnt have anybody his father was still looking at him he knew all the reasons jonathan had asked about kassquit oh yes he knew and so would karen consciousness came back to karen yeager very slowly she couldnt tell when dreams stopped and mundane reality returned shed been dreaming about jonathan and his father next thing she knew she saw them she would have accepted that as part of the dream for they were both floating in space in front of her and dreams were the only place where you could fly but then she realized they werent flying or not exactly and that she was weightless too we made it she whispered her tongue felt like a bolt of flannel it didnt want to shape the words we sure did honey jonathan had no trouble talking for a moment karen resented that then on hands and knees a thought crawled through her head oh hes been awake for a while how are you mrs yeager that brisk female voice hadnt been part of her dream the woman in a white smock also floated above her head answer i have to answer sleepy karen managed well im not surprised all your vital signs are good though the woman said once the drugs wear off and you get used to being normal body temperature again youll do fine im dr blanchard by the way thats nice karen said vaguely she turned toward sam yeager hello its been a while she laughed she felt more than a little drunk and more than a little confused too how long has it been anyway everybody asks that once the fog starts to clear dr blanchard said its she gave karen a moment to digest that it was going to take more than a moment im almost ninety years old karen thought but she didnt feel any different from the way she had when she went into cold sleep she looked at her fatherinlaw again how old is sam she had trouble with the subtraction the woman in the smock gave her chicken soup swallowing proved at least as hard as talking but she managed she felt better with the warm broth inside it seemed to help anchor her to the here and now can i get up she asked jonathan and his father both started to laugh we both had to figure out how and now you do too jonathan said after some fumblingher hands still didnt feel as if they belonged to herkaren managed to undo the fasteners that held her to the revival bed only a towel covered her dr blanchard chased the male yeagers out of the revival room and gave her shorts and a shirt like the ones they had on then they were suffered to return she pushed off toward them when she came up to jonathan he gave her a quick kiss then he let her go hed known her a long time had he tried for anything more than a quick kiss just then she would have done her feeble best to disembowel him she saw her fatherinlaw watching her in a peculiar way sam yeager had always noticed her as a woman hed never once been obnoxious about it but he had now for no reason at all she found herself blushing then she shook her head realizing it wasnt for no reason at all ive just aged seventeen years right before your eyes havent i she said not a bit he said youve aged maybe five of them karen laughed did they bring the blarney stone along so you could kiss it while i was asleep she was a childa greatgrandchild actuallyof the old sod even if her maiden name culpepper was english then jonathan said dads right hon she tried to poke her husband in the ribs you of all people really ought to know better its very sweet and everything but you ought to nope he could be stubbornnow maybe endearingly stubborn here on the admiral peary he really is right were weightless nothing sags the way it would under gravity he patted his own stomach by way of illustration hmm karen thought that over she didnt have a mirrorwhich right after cold sleep was bound to be a mercybut she could look at jonathan and sam maybe that was as much as she was going to admit jonathan pointed to the passageway where he and his father had gone while she dressed homes out there waiting if you want to have a look sam yeager added its out there waiting even if you dont want to have a look jonathan grunted youve been listening to that mickey flynn too much dad whos mickey flynn karen asked one of the pilots her husband answered darkly hes a bad influence her fatherinlaw added hes a professional bad influence you might say hes proud of it he has a dry wit any drier and itd make home look like the amazon jungle jonathan said okay karen said now im intrigued would i rather meet him or the lizards planet she pushed off toward the passageway but mickey flynn wasnt in the control room the pilot who was a soberlooking fellow named walter stone said pleased to meet you maam when jonathan introduced her to him then went back to studying his radar screen karen saw how many blips were on it that still left her slightly miffed stone seemed to care more for machines than he did for people then karen stopped worrying about the pilot because the sight of home made her forget him and everything else she knew the map of tau ceti as well as she knew the map of earth knowing and seeing were two different things someone softly said ohh after a moment she realized that was her own voice thats what i said too hon jonathan said stone looked over his shoulder well deal with whatever they throw at us he said and if they start throwing things at us well make em sorry they tried karen believed the last part the admiral peary was armed a ship that went to strange places had to be if the lizards attacked it it could hurt them deal with whatever they threw at it maybe brigadier general stone was an optimist maybe he thought he was reassuring her she didnt feel reassured that was what she got for knowing too much she stared down at the golds and greens and bluesmore golds fewer greens and blues than earthspread out below her theyre the only ones whove ever flown into or out of this system till now she said we hadnt even started farming when they conquered the rabotevs and they were in space inside this system for god only knows how many thousand years before that sam yeager said theyve got reasons to be antsy about strangers weve got reasons for coming here karen said they gave us most of them dont i know it her fatherinlaw said i was on a train from madison down to decatur when they came to earth they shot it up only dumb luck they didnt blow my head off im glad they didnt jonathan said if they had i wouldnt be here and i sure wouldnt be here he pointed out toward home would i be here karen wondered the race had fascinated her ever since she was little even if shed never met jonathan she probably would have done something involving them would it have been enough to get her aboard the admiral peary how could she know she couldnt an enormous yawn tried to split her face in two that happened to me after id been awake for a little while jonathan said theyve given us a cabin for two if you want to sleep for a bit that sounds wonderful karen said its right next to mine her fatherinlaw added if you leave the tv on too loud ill bang my shoe against the wall brigadier general stone looked pained its not a wall its a bulkhead he and sam yeager wrangled about it not quite seriously as jonathan led karen out of the control room and back to the fluorescentlit painted metal that was the starships interior the cabin didnt seem big enough for one person let alone two when karen saw the sleeping arrangements she started to giggle bunk beds dont let stone hear you say that jonathan warned hell probably tell you theyre supposed to be bulkbunks or something i dont care karen was still giggling when i was a little kid my best friend had a sister who was only a year younger than she was and they had bunk beds i was so jealous you cant believe how jealous i was theyve got the same sort of straps on them that the revival bed did jonathan said we wont go floating all over the cabin i wish theyd spin the ship and give us some gravity karen said but it would kill the guys from the lewis and clark wouldnt it like that her husband snapped his fingers it would screw up fire control too were stuck with being weightless till the lizards let us go down to home karen grimaced at the thought of fire control a euphemism for this is how we shoot things up the grimace turned into yet another yawn dibs on the top bunk she said and got into it as she fastened herself in a question bubbled up to the top of her mind have we lost anybody a couple of people jonathan answered it was a little riskier than they said it would be i suppose that figures im damn glad youre here sweetie and im glad dad is they really didnt know what they were doing when they put him under im glad youre here too karen said the chill that ran through her had nothing to do with cold sleep how sorry would certain people back on earth have been if sam yeager hadnt revived not very she suspected she also suspected she was falling asleep no matter what she could do about it moments later that suspicion was confirmed when she woke up she felt better she realized how groggy shed been before the buckles on the bunk were just like the ones on the revival bed those had almost baffled her she opened these without even thinking about it when she pushed out of the bunk toward a handhold on the farnot very farwall she saw jonathan reading in the bottom bunk he looked up from the papers and said hi there hi there yourself karen said how long was i out just a couple of hours he waved papers at her this is stuff youll need to seereports on whats been going on back on earth since we went under weve got to be as uptodate as the lizards are anyhow ill look at it karen laughed it still feels like too much work okay i know what you mean jonathan said im a day and a little bit ahead of you and im still not a hundred percent eithernot even close still one of these days before we go down to home it might be fun to try it weightless what do you think if jonathan was chipper enough to contemplate sex he was further ahead of karen than he knew what she said was not tonight josephine what she thought was maybe not for the next six months or at least not till all the drugs wear off she also almost reminded him that hed already fooled around in space at the last minute she didnt it wasnt so much that he would point out he hadnt been weightless then the lizards ship had spun to give it artificial gravity but she didnt want him thinking about kassquit and about the days when hed been young and horny all the time any more than he had to yes keeping quiet seemed a very good idea sam yeager spent as much time as he could in the admiral peary s control room part of that was because he couldnt get enough of looking at home part of it was because the control room wasnt far from the revival room he got the chance to say hello to some people he hadnt seen for more than fifty years that was what the calendar insisted anyway to him it seemed like days or weeks it was a matter of years to them but not anything like fifty and he enjoyed the company of glen johnson and mickey flynnand to a lesser degree that of walter stone stone was too much the regulation officer for sam to feel completely comfortable around him such men were often necessary yeager knew as much but he wasnt one of them himself and as far as he was concerned they were also often annoying he gave no hint of that opinion any place where stone could overhear him johnson now johnson was as much of a troublemaker as sam was himself the authorities had known as much too yeager asked him did you get the subtle hints that it would be a good idea for you to go into cold sleep if you wanted to have a chance to keep breathing subtle hints the pilot considered well that depends on what you mean healey didnt quite say you have been ordered to volunteer for this procedure he didnt quite say it but he sure meant it you too eh oh yes sam nodded they looked at me and they thought indianapolis im not sorry im a long way away ive been in indianapolis flynn said they should have given you a medal sam scowled and shook his head johnson said not funny mickey they were people there everybody back in the states thought i forgot about that or didnt care sam said what they wouldnt see was that the lizards we blew up were people too thats it johnson agreed i was up there on patrol when we did that i figured it was the reds or the nazis but it wasnt the lizards would have got their own back against them they had to against us too we spent so much time and so much blood making the race believe we were people and deserved to be treated like people yeager said then we didnt believe it about them if thats not a twoway street it doesnt work at all before either of the pilots could say anything alarms blared they both forgot about sam and swung back to the instrument panels equipment failure lizard attack no and no the urgent voice on the intercom said what it was code blue code blue dr kaplan to the revival room dr garvey to the revival room dr kaplan dr garvey code blue code blue damn glen johnson said softly yeah yeager nodded when the lizards went into cold sleep they were all but guaranteed to come out again when revival time rolled around as often happened when humans adopted and adapted the races techniques they made them work but less efficiently sam often wondered how very lucky he was to have awakened here in orbit around tau ceti whos getting revived now the pilot asked i havent looked at the schedule for today sam answered do you have a copy handy i ought to somewhere johnson flipped through papers clipped together and held on a console by large rubber bands so they wouldnt float all over the place he found the one he wanted and went down it with his finger suddenly he stopped oh shit he muttered who for gods sake sam asked its the doctor johnson said christ sam exclaimed people had been calling the diplomat the doctor for years he was a lucky jew his parents had got him out of nazi germany in when he was fifteen hed been at harvard when the lizards came and spent a hitch in the army afterwards when the fighting ended hed gone back to school and earned his doctorate in nineteenthcentury international relations hed moved back and forth between universities and the government from that time on ever since henry cabot lodge retired in the early s hed been the us ambassador to the race with his formidably intelligent face and his slow ponderous germanic way of speaking he was one of the most recognizable men on earth he would have been a natural to head up the first american mission to home sam wondered when the doctor had gone into cold sleep probably not till just before the admiral peary took off the two of them had met several times before sam went under and the doctor had consulted him about the race by telephone fairly regularly sam had looked forward to working with the diplomat here ever since spotting his name on the list he had yes now hoping against hope he asked have they ever managed to revive anybody theyve called a code blue on glen johnson shook his head not that i remember i didnt think so i was hoping youd tell me i was wrong he wondered if he ought to pull himself down the hatchway and see what was going on in the revival room regretfully he decided that wasnt a good idea everybody in there would be desperately trying to resuscitate the doctor as soon as anyone noticed him rubbernecking theyd all scream at him to get the hell out of there if the doctor doesnt make it johnson said slowly who the hell dickers with the lizards i havent studied the whole passenger list sam said besides who knows how many people got important between the time when i went under and when the admiral peary took off yeah same goes for me the pilot said they put me in cold sleep after you but before that i was as far away from everything that was happening on earth as you could be if you werent on a starship the only humanwell sort of humanon a starship before us was kassquit sam thought he hadnt been surprised to find out she was here it made sense for the race to have their best experts on big uglies help deal with the wild ones and who knew more about humans than somebody who biologically was one dr blanchard came floating up into the control room one look at her face told sam all he needed to know back when he was a minorleague baseball player hed worn that same expression after grounding into a gameending double play with the tying run at third im sorry he said quietly we did everything we knew how to do dr blanchard might have been trying to convince herself as well as yeager we did everything we knew how to do but his heart just wouldnt get going hard to revive a man if you cant give him a heartbeat cool him down again then sam asked maybe theyll have better techniques when we get back to earth if we ever get back to earth kaplan and garvey are doing that blanchard said i wouldnt bet the farm on it though if we cant revive him hes probably been deaddead in slow motion but deadfor a long time dead in slow motion theres a hell of a phrase glen johnson said reminds me of my exwife by the way dr blanchard laughed she might have had an exhusband to be reminded of but then johnsons face clouded shes dead for real now everybody i knew back on earth is probably dead now ive got two grandsons sam said they were little boys when i went under theyre middleaged nowhell if youre not talking about clock time theyre older than their dad and mom i wonder if they remember me at all maybe a little most of the people here dont have a lot of ties back home blanchard said ive got cousins and nieces and nephews there but nobody i was real close to some of them are bound to be around now but when we get back again she spread her hands and shook her head cold sleeps a funny business the lizards have a whole little subsociety i guess youd call it of males and females who spend a lot of time in cold sleep sam said they keep one another company because theyre the only ones who know what its like being cut off that way from the time they were hatched in and they live longer than we do and theyve got faster starships and their culture doesnt change as fast as ours so you think well do the same johnson asked you bet i do sam said you ever see joe dimaggio play sure the pilot nodded in cleveland i may even have seen you once or twice i used to go to bushleague games now and then thanks a lot yeager said without rancor forget about me remember dimaggio suppose we come back in something and you start going on about joltin joe whos going to know what youre talking about or if youre talking through your hat nobody except a guy whos spent a lot of years on ice i never saw dimaggio play said melanie blanchard who looked to be in her midforties he retired about the time i was born you at least know about him though sam said by the time we get home hell be ancient history they went on talking about it none of them getting too excited it hurt less than talking about losing the doctor would have the next three revivals went well which helped make people feel better about things then sam got summoned to the commandants quarters he hadnt had much to do with lieutenant general healey and hadnt wanted much to do with him either healey was army through and through even more so than stone sam wasnt and doubted very much whether the commandant approved of him approve or not general healey was polite enough waving sam to a chair and waiting till hed buckled himself in he owned a round bulldog face and eyebrows that seemed to have a life of their own they twitched now twitched unhappily if sam was any judge the commandant said we have communicated our unfortunate failure to revive the doctor to the race yes sir sam nodded unfortunate is right but you had to do it their response was unexpected healey looked unhappier yet yes sir sam repeated that was always safe do you need my advice about whatever it was they said in a manner of speaking but only in a manner of speaking healey replied they were disturbed to learn they would not be negotiating with the doctor everything they had heard about him from earth was favorable i can see how it would have been sam said there is one other person aboard this ship about whom they said the same thing healey went on each word seeming to taste worse than the one before in the doctors absence they insist that we negotiate through you colonel me sam yelped im no stripedpants diplomat im a behindthescenes kind of guy not any more youre not lieutenant general healey said grimly they dont want anything to do with anybody else were in no position to make demands here unfortunately they are as of now colonel the fate of mankind may well ride on your shoulders congratulations if thats the word i want jesus christ sam said and that wasnt half of what theyd say back in the usa more than ten years from now when speedoflight radio told them what had happened the fate of mankind on my shoulders he wished hed never heard of science fiction in his life is this the tosevite ship admiral peary do you read me admiral peary the shuttlecraft pilot on the other end of the line made a mess of the us starships name glen johnson didnt suppose he could have expected anything different that is correct shuttlecraft pilot he answered in the language of the race i have you on radar your trajectory matches the course reported to me you may proceed to docking our docking collar is produced to match those manufactured by the race of course it is mickey flynn interjected in english we stole the design from them hush johnson said also in english its useful to have parts that fit together no matter who made em thats why most railroads have the same gauge i am proceeding the shuttlecraft pilot sounded dubious i hope you have the same high standards as the race humanity didnt johnson knew it he was damned if hed admit as much here he said we crossed the space between the star tosev and your sun we have arrived safely that must say something about our capabilities something yes the shuttlecraft pilot replied it may well also say something about your foolhardiness so there johnson thought had he been crazy to come aboard the admiral peary maybe not but it sure hadnt hurt he watched the shuttlecrafts approach first on the radar screen and then with the mark one eyeball after a little while he keyed the radio again you can fly that thing i will say i have flown inatmosphere aircraft and craft not too different from that one i know what i am talking about i thank you for the compliment the shuttlecraft pilot replied if i were not capable would they have chosen me for this mission i dont know you never can tell johnson said but in english and without transmitting the words flynn let out what sounded suspiciously like a snort the pilot docked with the shuttlecraft to johnsons relief the docking collar worked exactly the way it was supposed to he went down to the corridor outside the air lock to say goodbye to the yeagers and the others who were going down to the surface of home im jealous he told sam yeager once more if i could take one gees worth of gravity after going without for so long a likely story yeager said no girls to chase down there and the weathers always hot youd do better staying here lights on the wall showed that the outer airlock door was opening and the shuttlecraft pilot was moving his ship into the lock the race had wanted to inspect peoples baggage before they went down to the surface of home sam yeager had said no the lizards didnt seem worried about weapons at least not in the usual sense of the word they were worried about ginger just how worried they were johnson discovered when karen yeager who was looking through the window set into the inner airlock door squeaked in surprise its not a lizard she exclaimed its a rabotev that set everybody pushing off toward the window trying to get a first look at one of the other two races in the empire johnsons weightlessnessweakened muscles were at a disadvantage there but he eventually got a turn the rabotevwhat amazing news looked like the pictures the lizards had brought to earth it was a little taller a little skinnier a little straighter than a lizard its scales were bigger and looked thicker than a lizards they were a gray close to black not a greenish brown on its chest the rabotev wore a shuttlecraft pilots body paint its hands were strange they had four digits each the outer two were both set at an angle from the middle two and could both work as thumbs two digits on its feet pointed forward two to the rear the rabotevs head was a little more erect on its neck than a lizards less so than a mans it had its eyes mounted atop short muscular stalks not in eye turrets they moved all the time sometimes it seemed independently of each other johnson wondered if the shuttlecraft pilot had a snail somewhere way up hisher family tree the rabotevs snout was shorter than a lizards when the alien opened itsthat did seem the safest pronoun in the absence of visible evidence one way or the othermouth it displayed a lot of sharp yelloworange teeth sam yeager said what johnson had already thought they probably dont have to worry about getting this one high on ginger odds are it doesnt do anything for him would you let him in colonel johnson karen yeager asked this is a first contact in a way okay johnson said and opened the inner airlock door i greet you he called to the rabotev in the language of the race i am the pilot with whom you were speaking on the radio he gave his name i am raatiil the rabotev said pronouncing each vowel separately and i greet you he sounded like a lizard try as johnson would he couldnt detect any distinctive accent the way he could when a human spoke the lizards language you are the first tosevites i have ever seen his eyestalks wiggled they werent long enough to tie in knots which was probably a good thing you are the first rabotev any tosevite has ever seen in person sam yeager said we recognize you of course from pictures but none of your kind has come to tosev some are on the way now i believe in cold sleep raatiil said johnson wondered if the race hadnt used rabotevs and hallessi in the conquest fleet because it feared they might be unreliable he doubted he would get a straight answer if he asked the question that way instead he inquired what do you think of the race they took us out of barbarism the shuttlecraft pilot said simply they gave us the freedom of the stars they cured diseases on our home planet we are never hungry any more the way we used to be and the spirits of emperors past watch over those of our folk the same as they watch over those of the race the rabotevs eyestalks set its large green eyes staring at its own feet for a moment raatiil sounded altogether sincere if it was there went any chance of even thinking about raising rebellions in the subject species johnson had always figured that chance was pretty slim the lizards had held the empire together for a long time jonathan yeager asked what did your people used to reverence before the race came to your planet raatiil opened and closed both hands that must have been the rabotevs equivalent of a shrug for the alien answered these days only scholars know what difference does it make those other things could not have been as strong as the spirits of emperors past or we would have learned to fly between the stars and brought the race into our empire instead of the other way round was that what the lizards had been teaching ever since they conquered what humans called epsilon eridani or had the rabotevs come up with it themselves to explain why theyd lost and the lizards had won after all these thousands of years did anyone still remember how the story had got started may i ask a question without causing offense sam yeager said as i told you i am ignorant of your kind raatiil made the affirmative gesture with the rabotevs twothumbed hand it looked odd but it was understandable ask the shuttlecraft pilot said i thank you yeager replied are you male or female they predicted you would ask me this raatiil said as it happens i am a male the sand in which my egg was incubated was warm but except during mating season it matters not at all to us i am told it is different with you tosevites and i see this is so in english johnson said theyve been studying up on us well good jonathan yeager replied in the same language i hope that means they take us seriously oh they take us seriously all right sam yeager said were here so they have to take us seriously whether we can get anywhere when we talk to themwell thats liable to be a different story the rabotevs eyestalks kept swinging toward whoever was talking does he understand english johnson wondered or is he just surprised to hear any language that isnt the races the race was nothing if not thoroughgoing signals from earth had been coming home for almost eighty years now could the lizards have taught some of the folk of the empire the human tongue no doubt about it easiest way to find out might be to grab the bull by the horns do you speak english shuttlecraft pilot johnson asked in that language raatiil froze for a moment surprise evidently for after that freeze he made the affirmative gesture again i have learned it he answered also in english do you understand when i speak yes you speak well johnson said that raatiil could be understood at all meant he spoke well but johnson had known plenty of lizards who were worse still in an experimental mood he told that to the rabotev he got back another shrugequivalent some males and females are better than others at learning strange things raatiil said so much for that johnson thought hed been curious to see whether raatiil enjoyed getting praise for doing something better than members of the race if he did he didnt show it maybe that meant there really wasnt any friction among the different species in the empire maybe it only meant raatiil was too well trained to show much sam yeager caught johnsons eye and nodded slightly johnson nodded back sure as hell sam had known what he was up to no flies on him no indeed everybody on the ship had been gloomy because the doctor didnt make it johnson was sorry they couldnt revive the doctor too he didnt think the diplomacy would suffer on that account though it might even go better the doctor was clever but hed always liked to show off just how clever he was sam yeager was more likely to do what needed doing and not make any kind of fuss about it raatiil said those tosevites going down to the surface of home please accompany me to the shuttlecraft it has been fitted with pads that will accommodate your physiques one by one the humans boarded the shuttlecraft sam yeager was the last wish us luck he told johnson break a leg johnson said solemnly yeager grinned and pushed himself into the air lock johnson closed the inner door yeager went through the outer door and into the shuttlecraft johnson pressed the button that closed the outer door he waited by the air lock to make sure the shuttlecrafts docking collar disengaged as smoothly as it had caught it did he headed back to the control room from now on most of the action would be down on the planet deceleration pressed jonathan yeager into the foam pad that did duty for a seat on the lizards shuttlecraft rationally he knew it wasnt that bad but it felt as if he were at the bottom of a pileup on a football field he looked over his shoulder at his father who was older and had been weightless longer how you doing dad he asked ill be fine as soon as they take the locomotive off my chest sam yeager answered landing soon raatiil saidin english hed never seen a human before in his life but he spoke fairly well would he have admitted it if the pilot hadnt asked there was an interesting question the shuttlecraft touched down the landing jets fell silent it was already hot inside the craft the lizards liked it that way they were comfortable at temperatures like those of a hot summer day in los angeles they found arabia and the sahara delightful they also found them temperate an alarming thought jonathan asked what season of the year is it here spring raatiil answered but do not worry it will be warmer soon that spoke volumes about the kind of weather rabotevs preferred it also drew several involuntary groans from the humans on the shuttlecraft karen yeager said our world is cooler than home i hope you will arrange to cool our quarters i do not know anything about this raatiil said now that you remind me i remember in my briefing that tosevites prefer weather we would find unpleasantly cold but i have no control over your quarters its not my job that was what he meant all right some things didnt change across species lines jonathan had seen that back on earth with the lizards it obviously applied here too then raatiil opened the hatchway and jonathan forgot about everything but that hed momentarily be stepping out onto the ground of a planet that spun round another sun you tosevites may go down raatiil said the descent ladder is deployed go with some caution if you please the ladder is not made for your species many of us have flown in the races shuttlecraft on tosev jonathan said we know these ladders the air inside the shuttlecraft had had the same sterile feel to it as it did aboard human spacecraft it had smelled very faintly of lubricants and other less decipherable things now jonathan got a whiff of dust and spicy scents that could only have come from plants of some sort that was a world out there waiting for him not the inside of a spacecraft for a moment none of the half dozen humans moved raatiils eyestalks swung from one to the other he plainly wondered why they held back then karen reached out and touched jonathans father on the shoulder go ahead she told him youve got the right youve been dealing with the race longer than anybody the other three humansanother husbandandwife team tom and linda de la rosa and a military man major frank coffeywere all younger than jonathan and karen nobody aboard except sam yeager and maybe raatiil who could say how long rabotevs lived had been around when the race came to earth yes go ahead colonel yeager linda de la rosa said she was blond and a little plump her husband had a beak of a nose and a fierce black mustache he nodded so did major coffey who was the color of coffee with not too much cream thank you all jonathans father said you dont know what this means to me his voice was husky he hadnt sounded like that since jonathans mother died he awkwardly climbed over frank coffey who lay closest to the hatch and started down then he paused and started to laugh i only get half credit for this he observed kassquits been here before me you do get that though because shes only half human karen said she was right if anything kassquit might have been less than half human but jonathan wished his wife wouldnt have had that edge in her voice out went jonathans father the others followed jonathan went after major coffey hed just stuck his head out of the hatch when his father stepped down onto the flamescarred concrete of the shuttlecraft field in english sam yeager said this is for everyone who saw it coming before it happened how long would people remember that jonathan liked it better than something on the order of i claim this land in the names of the king and queen of spain and it included not only all the scientists and engineers whod built the admiral peary but also his fathers sciencefiction writers whod imagined travel between the stars before the lizards came if it werent for them i wouldnt be here jonathan thought here wasnt just home as his father had said if he hadnt got involved with lizard pows he never would have met his mom jonathan shied away from that thought he didnt like contemplating the strings of chance that held everyday life together somebody swatted him on the fanny dont stay there gawking karen said from behind him the rest of us want to come out too sorry jonathan said he hadnt been gawking only woolgathering he didnt think his wife would care about the difference the descent ladder was narrow the rungs too close together and oddly sloped for human feet he went down slowly then descended next to his father and coffey looks like an airport back home the major remarked all this wide open space in the middle of a city id want plenty of wide open space around me too in case one of those shuttlecraft came down where it didnt belong sam yeager said that doesnt happen to the lizards very often jonathan said they engineer better than we do of course just once would ruin your whole day off in the distance beyond the concrete buildings rose most of them were utilitarian boxes jonathan wondered how many different styles of architecture this city held how old were the oldest buildings older than the pyramids he wouldnt have been surprised across the concrete came a flat open vehicle crowded with lizards it stopped about twenty feet away from the humans two of the lizards descended from it and strode toward the shuttlecraft which of you tosevites is sam yeager asked the one with the more ornate body paint jonathans eyes widened as he recognized a fleetlords markings was that his father stepped forward i am i greet you fleetlord you are atvar is it not so you are to call him exalted fleetlord raatiil said yes i am atvar the male who had commanded the conquest fleet sent the negative hand gesture toward the rabotev shuttlecraft pilot the tosevite is correct to address me as he does as an ambassador he outranks a fleetlord he turned back to jonathans father in the name of the emperor superior tosevite i greet you he and the male with him bent into the posture of respect after moving down at the mention of the emperors name raatiils eyestalks swung toward sam yeager jonathan had first met the rabotev only a little while before but he knew astonishment when he saw it he was all but reading raatiils mind theyre making this much fuss over a big ugly atvar went on my associate here is senior researcher ttomalss some of you tosevites will have made his acquaintance on your planet oh yes jonathans father said he introduced jonathan and karen frank coffey and the de la rosas one of you tosevites at least will be easy to discriminate from the others atvar remarked his eye turrets on the black man truth coffey said no one on tosev ever had any trouble with that he owned a dangerously good deadpan jonathan had all he could do not to laugh out loud beside him karen let out a strangled snort indeed i believe i have met all of you tosevites at one time or another ttomalss said and you yeagers performed an experiment that is an outrage to the race you would be in a better position to complain about it if you had not performed the same experiment with a tosevite hatchling jonathan answered and how is kassquit these days she is well she is still as stubbornly opinionated as ever the lizard psychologist answered you will see her shortly since you have come to home we thought this first greeting would appropriately come from the race alone jonathan wondered how kassquit had taken that not well if he had to guess shed never quite learned how to be a human and shed never quite been accepted by the race either neither fish nor fowl jonathan thought all things considered it was a miracle she wasnt crazier than she was his father said would it be possible for us to get in out of the sun that plainly surprised the lizards for them the weather was no doubt springlike for jonathan the only place that had springtime like this was hell ttomalss said something in a low voice to atvar the fleetlord made the affirmative gesture saying as we were always cold on tosev so you may find yourselves warm here i should warn you though that you will not find it any cooler within we understand that sam yeager said at least we will be out of this bright sunlight though i hope so karen murmured in english otherwise theyll see a red human along with a black one with her fair redheads skin she burned with the greatest of ease she did on earth anyhow tau cetis redder than the sun jonathan reminded her it puts out less ultraviolet the lizards cant even see violetit looks black to them i know i know his wife answered but any ultraviolet at all is enough to do me in right now i forgot to put on sunscreen before we came down atvar gestured toward the vehicle join us then and we will take you to the terminal where we will inspect your baggage i have already had this discussion with the race sam yeager said the answer is still no you confuse me atvar said first you want to go in and then you do not going in is fine jonathans father said inspecting baggage is not we are a diplomatic party we have the same rights as if we were back in our own notempire you must know this fleetlord and if i do atvar said if i do not like it you can expel us sam yeager said you can send us back to the admiral peary i think that would be foolish but you can do it how do i know your cases of possessions are not full of the herb that causes so much trouble for us atvar demanded you do not know that but you do know your own folk must smuggle more of the herb than a few big uglies could and i tell you that we have none of it with us here will you trust me or will you not you i will trust atvar said heavily i would not trust any other tosevite who made this assertion not even the doctor come then and we shall see what we have to say to one another kassquit waited inside the terminal at the shuttlecraft port along with a small swarm of middleranking functionaries from the race when she looked out the window she could see the shuttlecraft that had descended from the tosevite starship she could even see the wild big uglies who had come down from it as wild big uglies were in the habit of doing these wore cloth wrappings and foot coverings the wrappings were minimal leaving arms and legs mostly bare but she wondered why the tosevites wore anything in this climate she looked down at her own body nude except for her body paint and the foot coverings she too used her soles were softer than those of the race and often needed protection which tosevite out there was jonathan yeager she saw only one who shaved his hair but that didnt necessarily prove anything he might have stopped shaving as she had done and some other tosevite might follow the practice at this distance it was hard to be sure and which wild big ugly was jonathan yeagers permanent mate there kassquit had no trouble finding an answer that female had coppercolored hair and only one of the tosevites fit the bill kassquits nearly motionless face would have scowled if only it could she knew her resentment was irrational but that made it no less real the big uglies outside boarded the passengermover that normally ferried elderly and disabled males and females around the shuttleport it had been adapted to tosevite needs with special seats kassquit had been the model on which those were formed what fit her back and fundament so different from those of the race should also accommodate other big uglies the passengermover came back to the terminal building a door opened a male with a cart went out to take charge of the big uglies baggage the cases he brought back were larger than those members of the race would have used of course members of the race didnt take extra sets of wrappings with them wherever they went in came the baggage handler in came ttomalss and fleetlord atvar and in came the wild big uglies as soon as they got inside the building someone aimed televisor lights at them half a dozen reporters thrust microphones at them and shouted questions some of the questions were idiotic the rest were a great deal stupider than that how do you like home a female yelled over and over fine so far a little warm said the big ugly with the shaved head that was jonathan yeager kassquit recognized his voice he caught her eye and nodded a very tosevite style of greeting do you understand me another reporter shouted as if doubting that a big ugly could speak the races language no of course not the whitehaired tosevite replied if i understood you i would answer your question and i am obviously not doing that kassquit recognized not only sam yeagers voice but also his offbeat slant on things the reporter by contrast seemed to have no idea what to make of the answer back to you in the studio the female said looking for help wherever she could find it another reporter asked will it be peace or war had someone asked that of sam yeager in private he would have said something like probably but while it was a foolish question it wasnt one where a joke was fitting in public he said we always hope for peace we have lived in peace with the race on tosev for most of the time since you first came there now that we too can fly between the stars that seems to me to be one more reason for each side to treat the other as an equal you sound so so civilized the reporter said i thank you so do you sam yeager said that reporter went off in confusion kassquits mouth fell open in the silent laugh the race used one of the noisier kind tosevites favored almost escaped her if sam yeager kept this up he would clear the terminal building of fools in short order and if his methods could be more widely applied that might have a salutary effect on the race or at least on how it did business none of the reporters or cameramales and females wore false hair and wrappings those had jolted kassquit when she first saw them they seemed as strange to her as the first shavenheaded big uglies with body paint must have seemed to the race back on tosev ttomalss beckoned and called out something in the noisy chaos inside the terminal kassquit couldnt make out what he said but she thought he was beckoning to her she pointed to herself he made the affirmative gesture she pushed forward through the crowd males and females grumbled as she went by them then got out of the way in a hurry when they saw who and what she was that even applied to a female in the body paint of a police officer who was holding back the crowd as she stepped inside the female asked why are you not already with them because i am a citizen of the empire not a wild big ugly kassquit answered proudly she went on up to ttomalss i greet you superior sir to atvar she added and i greet you exalted fleetlord i greet you the two males said together ttomalss went on to present her to the wild big uglies i greet you sam yeager said it is good to see you again we have both spent a lot of time on ice truth kassquit said after a moments pause to figure out the idiom which did not belong naturally to the races language yes indeed truth she glanced toward ttomalss the race had kept her on ice till it needed her here and i greet you the male named frank coffey said i have heard much about you it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance i thank you the pleasure is mine kassquit said she studied him with interest she had never met a member of the black race of big uglies in person till now coffey spoke the races language well enough if less fluently than sam yeager back in the days when the conquest fleet was still trying to bring all of tosev into the empire the race had tried to use black big uglies in the notempire of the united states against the pinkish big uglies who often oppressed them the strategy had failed for too many of the dark tosevites had feigned loyalty to the race only to betray it coffey would not have been hatched at that time but he was plainly loyal to the regime of the united states were he not he never would have been chosen for this mission thinking about him helped keep kassquit from thinking about jonathan yeager who was standing beside him i greet you jonathan said i hope you have been well and i hope you have been happy i have been well kassquit said happy she didnt want to think about that she doubted she could be happy caught as she was between her biology and her culture she did not know how to be a tosevite and she could never be the female of the race she wished she were jonathan yeager said i present to you my mate karen yeager i greet you kassquit said as politely as she could she was as jealous of the copperhaired big ugly as she was of females of the race karen yeager could live a life normal for her species that was something kassquit would never know and i greet you karen yeager said forgive me but it is customary for tosevites to wear some form of wrapping this is home kassquit said sharply here the customs of the race prevail if you want to wrap yourself that is your business if you expect me to do so you ask too much several of the wild big uglies spoke to karen yeager in their own language kassquit had learned to read tosevite facial expressions even if she did not form them herself jonathan yeagers mate did not look happy jonathan yeager himself did not take part in the discussion in english in a low voice ttomalss said remember being without wrappings is often a sexual cue among the wild big uglies the other female thinks you are making a mating display in front of her nominally exclusive mate ah kassquit bent into the posture of respect which was itself derived from the races mating posture i believe you are right superior sir greetings from the de la rosas followed the female of that mated pair made no comments about what kassquit was or wasnt wearing kassquit thought that wise on her part ttomalss said and is the female named karen yeager correct in having such concerns kassquit didnt answer right away she had to look inside herself for the truth perhaps from her point of view she admitted unhappily we do not want to provoke the tosevites ttomalss said any matings or attempts at matings leading to such provocation are discouraged in the strongest possible terms do you understand that yes superior sir i understand it very well kassquit said she did her best to keep her voice impassive but her best wasnt good enough ttomalss after all had known her since she was a hatchling he asked do you not only understand but agree to it yes superior sir she said again she knew she sounded sulky but she couldnt help it this is important kassquit ttomalss used a soft emphatic cough i said i understood and agreed kassquit answered if you do not believe me remove me from the diplomatic team challenged ttomalss retreated i do not wish to do that nor does fleetlord atvar your insights will be invaluableprovided you do not let emotional involvement color them i would have thought my insights would be valuable precisely because i am capable of emotional as well as intellectual involvement with big uglies kassquit said ttomalss waved that away which could only mean he had no good answer for it fleetlord atvar was saying we will convey you tosevites to a residence that has been set aside for you we have made efforts to ensure that it is as comfortable as possible for your species i thank you sam yeager replied will our rooms have air coolers it must be around forty hundredths here and we prefer a temperature closer to twentyfive i am not familiar with all the details atvar said believe me thoughi know tosev is a cooler world than home yes fleetlord i am sure you do the whitehaired american big ugly said but does the same also hold true for the males and females here who have never visited our world kassquit was sure that was a good question the race had been traveling between the stars for thousands upon thousands of years in some ways though it was more parochial than big uglies were theyd had to deal with differences much more than it had she sighed she was a difference and the race had trouble dealing with her back when the race first came to earth people would have had trouble making a lizard happy in a hilton karen yeager supposed she shouldnt be too critical of the rooms the race had arranged for people here in the town of sitneff on the other hand she had a hard time being delighted with them either in people hadnt known anything about lizards theyd had no idea the race even existed shed heard her fatherinlaw and her own parents go on and on about how astonished everyone was when the conquest fleet went into action her folks had thought the lizards were martians when the conquest fleet arrived the idea that the race could have come from beyond the solar system hadnt crossed anyones mind the lizards here by contrast had been getting data back from earth ever since the early s for some considerable while they hadnt wanted to believe what they were getting but finally they hadnt had any choice so why couldnt they have done a better job adapting rooms to fit human tastes they had remembered air conditioners those cooled the air only to the mideighties but even that was better than nothing sleeping mats were less comfortable than mattresses but karen knew she could tolerate them the odd lumps of foam rubber that were intended for chairs were harder to put up with so were low ceilings and doorways and when it came to plumbing arrangements the lizards showed they were indeed alien water came out of the tap at one temperature a little warmer than lukewarm she didnt think much of that the showerhead was set into the wall at a level between her chest and her navel it had only one setting abrasively strong she didnt have scales and felt half flayed every time she came out of the stall but the sanitary fixtures were the worst lizards excreted only solid wastes their plumbing was not adapted for any other sort cleaning up the mess that resulted from those differences was not something that endeared the race to her fine thing for an alleged diplomat to do she grumbled using a towel for a purpose it hadnt been intended to serve all right leave it for the chambermaids then or whatever the lizards call them jonathan answered karen made a horrible face thats worse and who says theyd clean it up they might think we do it all the time or we like it this way theres a cheery idea her husband said we can always piss down the shower then it would be good for something anyhow thats disgusting too karen said finally the job was done she washed her hands what the lizards used for soap was also industrial strength it would probably wear raw places in her skin before too long she laughed though it wasnt particularly funny the soap didnt seem to have done kassquit any harm and shed put every square inch of skin she had on display karen didnt think kassquit had deliberately appeared naked to titillate kassquit did follow the races customs and not mankinds but what shed intended and what she got were liable to be two different things kassquit looked to be somewhere around forty karen knew the races counterpart to mickey and donald had gone into cold sleep years before she herself and jonathan had the lizards starships were a good deal faster than the admiral peary too which meant what that the lizards had kept kassquit on ice for a long time after she got to home why would they do that only one answer occurred to karen so their pet human could deal with the americans when they arrived and still probably stay in good health in a coldblooded way it made sense if something went wrong karen wouldnt have wanted to entrust herself to a lizard doctor whod never seen a human being in his life it would be like going to a vet only worse dogs and catseven turtles and goldfishwere related to people lizards werent nothing on home was karen almost mentioned her conclusions to her husbandalmost but not quite she wanted him thinking of kassquit as little as possible shed noticed him looking at her not quite enough out of the corner of his eye of course shed also noticed all the other men in the landing party even her fatherinlaw who should have been too old for such things doing the same but unlike the rest of them jonathan had memories memories and a naked woman were a bad combination karen was convinced of that jonathan was fiddling with electronics a light on the display went from green to yellowred ha he said and nodded to himself they are bugging this room are you surprised karen asked surprised no he answered but its something we can give them a hard time about later on if we have to youre not supposed to do that to an embassy those are our rules karen said the russians and the germans break them all the time and i wouldnt be surprised if we do too so why shouldnt the lizards when they dont play by our rules to begin with when it comes to diplomacy they pretty much do play by our rulesat least on earth they do jonathan said theyve been unified so long theyve almost forgotten the rules they used to have how theyll act here is anybodys guess except for the ones whove come back from earth the lizards well be dealing with here havent had anything to do with people up till now yes and you know what that means karen said it means well have to waste a lot of time convincing them they really need to talk to us well were here and we got here under our own power jonathan said that puts us ahead of the rabotevs and the hallessi wonder spread over his face weve finally met a rabotev we sure have karen echoed amazement in her voice as well well probably meet hallessi too jonathan said that will be something pretty special as he had a way of doing he went back to what hed been talking about before the lizards didnt need to remember much about diplomacy when they brought the rabotevs and hallessi into the empire they just walked over them and that was that and if theyd come right after they sent their probes to earth they would have done the same thing to us karens shiver had nothing to do with the air in the room which wouldnt cool down till doomsday jonathan nodded thats true but they waited and they paid for it he looked down at the bug spotter again some of these are pretty easy to find most in fact do you think youre missing any karen asked well i dont know for sure obviously he answered judging from the ones im finding though id be surprised the technology on these just isnt that good we wouldnt have said that when we were kids karen remarked her husband nodded when the lizards came to earth theyd had a considerable lead in technology on people humanity had been playing catchup ever since the races technology was highly sophisticated highly effectiveand highly static if it had changed at all since the lizards bumped into humanity no one merely human had been able to notice those changes human technology on the other hand human technology had been in ferment even before the lizards came when karens fatherinlaw was a little boy the wright brothers had just got off the ground and radio was telegraphy without wires nobody had ever heard of computers or jets or missiles or fission or fusion it was only a little better than even money whether going to a doctor would make you better the arrival of the race only threw gasoline on the fire people had had to adapt had to learn or go under and learn they had both pushing their own technology forward and begging borrowing and stealing everything they could from the lizards the result was a crazy hodgepodge of techniques that had originated at home and on home but some of it made the lizards on earth swing their eye turrets towards it in surprise jonathan said when the lizards get something to the point where it does what they want it to they standardize it and then they forget about it we arent like that we keep tinkeringand we manage to do things the race never thought of he patted the bug sniffer theyll be listening to us karen said theyll know well know theyre listening to us for a while jonathan said and said no more about that before long the lizards would be hearing either nothing or what people wanted them to hear they would know human electronics had caught up with and even surpassed theirs in fact they would know more about human technology than karen and jonathan did theyd been getting continuous reports that were more than twentyfive years more recent than anything the newly revived humans knew first hand theyre starting to borrow from us by now karen said they sure are did you see the green wig on that one lizard on the way here from the shuttlecraft port scary jonathan said but you meant gadgets well when they borrow from us theyll check things out before they use them right have to make sure everything works the way its supposed toand have to make sure whatever they introduce doesnt destabilize what theyve already got he spoke with the odd mixture of scorn amusement and admiration people often used when they talked about the way the race used technology if people had had the same attitude the admiral peary wouldnt have flown for another hundred years or maybe another five hundred when it did leave the solar system though everything would have worked perfectly as things were the starship orbited tau ceti now not some unknown number of generations in the future that was the good news the bad news was that the doctor and some other people whod started the journey werent here to appreciate its success people took chances sometimes they paid for it sometimes it paid off most often as had proved true here both happened at once karen went to the window and looked out sitneff reminded her of an overgrown version of the towns the race had planted in the deserts of arabia and north africa and australia the streets were laid out in a sensible grid with some diagonals to make traffic flow more smoothly most of the buildings were businesslike boxes the tall ones housed lizards males and females had offices in the mediumsized ones the low spreadout ones were where they made things cars and trucks glided along the streets from up high they didnt look much different from their earthly counterparts they burned hydrogen their exhaust was water vapor these daysor at least back in the smost humanmade motor vehicles did the same karen wondered if any gasolineburners were left in shed grown up with los angeles smog even if gardena her suburb did get sea breezes she didnt miss air pollution a bit plants halfway between trees and bushes lined some of the boulevards they had several skinny trunks sprouting from a thicker lump of woody stuff that didnt come very far out of the ground their leaves were thin and greenish gray and put her in mind of nothing so much as the leaves of olive trees something with batlike wings a long nose and a tail with a leafshaped flap of flesh on the end glided past the window close enough to give karen a good look at its turreted lizardlike eyes my god she said a pterodactyl just flew by i wouldnt be surprised jonathan said they dont have birds here you knew that well yes but knowing it and seeing one are two different things karen said if they werent why would we have come here in the first place jonathan had no answer for that ttomalss sat across a park table and bench from sam yeager the psychologist would sooner have done business inside a building this setting struck him as unfortunately informal for the third time he asked would you not be more comfortable indoors for the third time the big uglys thick fleshy fingers shaped the negative gesture i am just fine right where i am sam yeager said he had an accentno big ugly who used the races language could help having onebut his speech was almost perfectly idiomatic how can you say that ttomalss inquired it must be too warm for your comfort and this furniture is surely too small for your fundament the weather is not bad the tosevite replied it is early morning so it has not got too hot to be unpleasant for me and we are in the shade of that kesserem treeit is a kesserem tree is it not i have only seen photos up till now yes it is ttomalss said that is well done to recognize it from photos alone i thank you sam yeager made as if to assume the posture of respect then checked the motion the instant it became recognizable a male of the race would have done exactly the same thing yeager stretched out his long long legs and continued anyway as i was saying the shade keeps the hot glare of your sun off my head he laughed a noisy tosevite laugh no doubt on purpose how strange for me to say your sun and not the sun to me this is not the sun so it is not when i first came to your solar system i had the same thought about the star tosev ttomalss said before long though it faded a star is a star and tosev is not a star much different from the sun his mouth dropped open in the laughter of his kind from your sun you would say i would now maybe not in a little while though sam yeager shrugged and this bench is all right since i am not trying to get my legs under it you would still find it more congenial in an office ttomalss said but the big ugly used the negative gesture again that is not a truth senior researcher i know what the races offices are like i have seen plenty of them back on tosev i have never seen one of your parks i spent lots of years in cold sleep to see new things and that is what i want to do you tosevites are incurably addicted to novelty ttomalss said no doubt you are right sam yeager said placidly but we have fun a stray beffel that was ambling along suddenly stopped in its tracks when the big uglys unfamiliar odor reached its scent receptors it stared at him every line of its lowslung body said nothing that smelled like that had any business existing it let out an indignant beep and scurried away its short legs twinkling over the sandy ground those creatures were becoming firstclass nuisances back on tosev long before i went into cold sleep sam yeager said they were and so were a good many other plants and animals of yours ttomalss shrugged this continued after you went into cold sleep too but you cannot expect us to settle and not bring bits of our own ecosystem with us we want to make tosev a world where we can truly live not just dwell when your animals and plants displace the ones that were living there you cannot expect us to be very happy about it the big ugly said with another shrug ttomalss said these things happen past that i do not know what to tell you had you come to home you would have brought your creatures and your food crops with you do you doubt it he waited how would sam yeager respond to that he laughed another noisy tosevite laugh no i do not doubt it senior researcher i think it is a truth we have spread our own beasts when we colonized new land massesincluding the one where i was hatched and there are some that could easily make themselves at home here but you will understand that we like it less when it is done to us was that irony in his voice or was he simply stating a fact with a male of the race ttomalss would have had no trouble telling the difference with the tosevite he wasnt quite sure he decided to take it as seriously meant no doubt he said but you will understand that any group looks to its own advantage first and to the situation of others only later i wish i could say we needed the race to teach us that sam yeager answered i cannot however and i will not attempt it we have quite thoroughly taught ourselves that lesson he was ttomalss judged fundamentally honest was that an advantage in diplomacy or the reverse the psychologist had trouble being sure had the big uglies chief negotiator been the male known as the doctor ttomalss would have known what to expect that male was notorious for doing and saying anything to advance the cause of his notempire sam yeager probably would not go to the same extremeswhich did not mean he was incompetent only that his methods were different a female out walking a tsiongi suddenly noticed yeager both her eye turrets swiveled toward him as if she could not believe what she was seeing spirits of emperors past she exclaimed it is one of those horrible big ugly things yes i am a big ugly sam yeager agreed on my planet we have nicknames for the race too how are you this morning his interrogative cough was a small masterpiece of understatement it talks the female said perhaps to ttomalss perhapsmore probablyto the tsiongi no matter what they said on the news i did not really believe those things could talk sam yeager turned to ttomalss the psychologist wanted to sink down into the ground are you certain there is intelligent life on this planet the tosevite asked what does it mean the female squawked is it being rude and crude come on you with the fancy body paint speak up this is the ambassador from the notempire of the united states to the empire ttomalss told her he is i will note behaving in a much more civilized fashion than you are well the female said with a noisy sniff some males think they are high and mighty if you would rather take the side of a nasty thing from who knows where than a hardworking taxpaying citizen i hope you come down with the purple itch come along swifty she twitched the leash and led the tsiongi away i apologize on behalf of my entire species ttomalss said to his astonishment sam yeager was laughing again do not let it worry you senior researcher we have plenty of males and females like that ourselves it is interesting to learn that you have them too i wish we did not ttomalss said they contribute nothing the big ugly used the negative gesture once more you cannot even say that for all you know she may be an excellent worker i doubt it ttomalss was not inclined to feel charitable toward the female who showed the race at its worst she is bound to be incompetent at everything she does do not worry sam yeager said again we were talking about ecosystems you will know we do not seek to damage yours when we bring rats down from the admiral peary the name of the animals necessarily was in english i know of rats from your planet ttomalss answered cautiously i know they are pests there why did you bring them here if not with the intent of taking a sort of vengeance on us because this is your planet and not ours and because some of the things on it are different from those on tosev the big ugly said we will use the rats to test foods here so that we do not make ourselves ill by accident there are few differences between tosevites biochemistry and the races ttomalss said we did not have many problems with food and drink on your world what about ginger sam yeager returned we do not want to get that kind of surprise either ginger had been a surprise all right and a singularly nasty one ttomalss made the negative gesture to himself ginger had been a plurally nasty surprise it had complicated the lives of the males of the conquest fleet but it had complicated the lives of both males and females from the colonization fleet especially those of the females when they tasted ginger they not only got the pleasure the males did they also went into their mating season regardless of whether it was the right time of year and the pheromones females released sent males into a breeding frenzy of their own big uglies had evolved to deal with continuous sexuality the race hadnt repercussions on tosev were still sorting themselves out some of the males and females there had even gone so far as to seek big uglystyle permanent mating alliances the first ones had been expelled for perversion from the areas of the planet the race controlled to live out their days in exile in the notempire of the united states there no one seemed to care what anyone else did so long as it didnt involve mayhem or murder but from what ttomalss had gathered since his awakening on home the colonists had begun to relent theyd had to too many males and females had sought such alliances losing them all to the big uglies would have been a disaster especially since tosevite technology was already advancing so alarmingly fast well sam yeager scuffed his feet in the sand was he trying to get comfortable or just fooling around members of the race liked to feel sand between their toes but the big uglies covered their soft feet how much enjoyment could you get out of playing in sand with covered feet yeager went on you do understand why we need the animals ttomalss sighed yes i suppose so very well have your way there i will inform my superiors of the circumstances i thank you sam yeager said you are welcome ttomalss realized he had better clarify that for now you are welcome if these rats escape from captivity you will be blamed you will be severely blamed we have no furry little animals here on home if they suddenly start appearing we will know where they have come from and we will take appropriate steps against you do i make myself clear enough you do indeed the big uglys mobile lips drew back from his teeth one corner of his mouth turned up the other didnt ttomalss who had made a particular study of tosevite facial cues thought that one showed wry amusement he was pleased to be proved right for sam yeager went on you do see the irony in your words i hope you will blame us for doing on a small scale what you are doing on a large scale on tosev irony i suppose you could call it that ttomalss said what i see is power we are strong enough to ensure that what we desire is what occurs had it been otherwise you would have discovered us not the other way around you are frank sam yeager said i want no misunderstanding ttomalss replied misunderstandingsespecially nowcan prove expensive to both sides especially now yes the big ugly agreed before you could reach us and we could not reach you but things are different these days how many starships are they building back on tosev ttomalss hadnt liked thinking about one starship full of wild tosevites several of them several of them were several orders of magnitude worse atvar was a frustrated male that was nothing new for him hed spent much of his time on tosev frustrated but hed dared hope such conditions would get better when he returned to home there hed proved optimistic the race had known for years that a tosevite starship was on its way it had adapted spacecraft for use in combat should that become necessary the first time since home was unified that military spacecraft operated within this solar system rather than going out to conquer others but no one seemed in charge of the spacecraft the emperor had not declared a new soldiers time there was no formal military authority for defending home no one had ever imagined such a thing would be necessary along with the ministry of transportation those of police trade and even science claimed jurisdiction over the armed spaceships where everybody was in charge nobody was in charge when atvar tried to point that out no one wanted to listen to him that didnt astonish him it did irk him though hed come back to home under a cloud because he hadnt completely conquered tosev then theyd called him out of retirement on the grounds that he was an expert on the big uglies and on matters militarythe greatest expert on matters military on home in fact having praised him to the skies when they decided they needed him they then decided they didnt need him badly enough to take his advice hed petitioned for an audience with the emperor to try to get a rescript to make the various ministers pay attention to him when he submitted the request written by hand as tradition required the subassistant junior steward who took it from him warned while many petitions are offered only a handful are selected for imperial action do not be disappointed if yours is not heard i understand atvar replied i am of the opinion however that my petition is more important than most as who is not the subassistant junior steward sniffed atvar wanted to claw him the only thing restraining the fleetlord was the certainty that that would get his petition rejected instead he said the emperor will know my name the subassistant junior steward plainly didnt he no doubt had been hatched long after the conquest fleet left for tosev and after the fighting stopped there as well to him the fleetlord was ancient history see that your superiors read my words atvar told him they with luck would have some notion of what he was talking about he got on better with sam yeager than he did with most of the males and females allegedly on his side he and the big ugly had more common experience than he did with the comfortable bureaucrats whod never gone beyond the atmosphere of home even though yeager had been in cold sleep for many years he still understood the uneasy balance of the relationship between the race and the tosevites back on tosev and yeager had done the race the enormous service of pointing out who had attacked the colonization fleet just after it reached his home planet he had not surprisingly got into trouble for that with his own authorities atvar asked him things being as they are why did the notempire of the united states send you on such an important mission the two of them sat alone at a refectory table in the hotel the wild big uglies were using as an embassy the other tosevites who had come to home were on a tour of the more distant regions of home this was not a formal negotiating session only a talk yeager used a set of tosevite eating utensils to cut up smoked zisuili meat hed eaten that on tosev and knew it was safe for his kind after chewing and swallowing a bite he answered maybe my superiors thought i would not wake up again maybe they thought that as a junior member of the expedition i would not be in a position to decide anything important and maybemost likely i thinkthey just wanted me as far from the united states as i could go and yet plainly you remain loyal to your notempire if atvar sounded wistful that was only because he was i do sam yeager used an emphatic cough i am what do you expect these talks to yield atvar asked fleetlord the race has never yet treated us as equals the big ugly answered adding another emphatic cough you have dealt with us we showed you you had to but you keep on looking down your snouts at us and that is on tosev where you have got to know us here on home things are a lot worse i have already seen as much will you tell me it is not a truth no i would not insult your intelligence atvar said sam yeager made as if to go into the posture of respect checking himself at just the right moment i thank you but it is time that the united states got its due we have also traveled between the stars now do i understand correctly that the soviet union is also going to launch a starship so i have been told it will be called the molotov after the longtime ruler of that notempire having met molotov the tosevite i hope the ship proves less unpleasant atvar vividly recalled his first dreadful encounter with the big ugly who at that time did not yet rule the sssr molotov had explainedhad been proud to explainhow his political faction came to power by murdering the emperor who formerly ruled their land back then the mere idea that an emperor even a big ugly could be murdered was enough to shake atvars mental world hed had no idea how many more unpleasant lessons the tosevites would teach him and the nipponese and the deutsche are also working on them sam yeager persisted reluctantly atvar made the affirmative gesture i believe this to be the case yes he let out an angry hiss how it could be however i confess i do not completely understand we defeated the deutsche we smashed the deutsche we put strict limits on what they could do how they could return to space even around tosev let alone contemplate an interstellar spacecraft we called the war we were fighting when the race arrived the second world war sam yeager said until you came we did not know what a world war really was but we thought we did a generation earlier we had fought the first world war the deutsche were on the losing side there too the winners disarmed them and tried to make sure they stayed weak it did not work you are tosevites you are slipshod you forget things you might as well be hatchlings atvar said we are the race so you are sam yeager replied and evidently you were slipshod you forgot things this puts you in a poor position to mock us i was not mocking you atvar checked himself well yes perhaps i was but i was mocking fleetlord reffet and shiplord kirel much more for you are correct of course they let the advantage we held over the deutsche slip away they should not have done so that they did so is mortifying if it makes you feel any better fleetlord the deutsche have more experience getting around such restrictions than the race has imposing them this may make me feel microscopically better atvar replied on the other hand it may not his tailstump quivered with anger for remember ambassador i was recalled for incompetence those who came after me were going to do a far better job they were sure of it and look what they accomplished it does show your people that you were not to blame sam yeager said i already knew as much atvar said acidly that others also do is a matter of some gratification but not much i know i could have done better i doubt i could have kept your notempire from launching a starship but the deutsche by the spirits of emperors past would not be a problem now if i still headed administration on tosev he cast down his eye turrets any citizen of the empire whether belonging to the race the rabotevs or the hallessi would have looked down at the ground at the mention of emperors past or present sam yeager did not however well he behaved however well he understood the race he was an alien and would always remain one yeager said what we wanted with this mission fleetlord was respect well you have that i do not know precisely what you will do with it but you have it atvar said along with it you also have hatched a considerable amount of fear is that what you had in mind to his surprise sam yeager made the affirmative gesture as a matter of fact yes he replied we have feared the race now for ninety yearsninety of ours twice as many of yours mutual fear is not the worst thing in the world it may keep both sides from doing anything irrevocably stupid atvars mouth fell open in a laugh i see you look on the bright side of things my guess would be that nothing is sure to keep both sides from doing anything irrevocably stupid my guess would be that you are right the big ugly replied i am still allowed to hope though there i cannot disagree atvar said if we did not hope one side or the other would have destroyed tosev by now truth yeager said now you of the race have to remember that all the time as we have had to do since the year we call and you have to remember it can apply to your planets not just to the one we live on that no doubt was part of what he meant by respect to atvar it seemed perilously close to arrogance that the race had the same feeling never entered his mind his mental horizon had expanded a great deal since he first came to tosev but he remained a part of his culture for the race to pressure other species seemed natural to him for others to do the same to his kind did not he had the sense to see a change of subject might be a good idea why did you not go sightseeing with the other tosevites he asked please do not misunderstand me the big ugly replied i will be pleased to see as much of your planet as i can if the doctor were in charge now i would be out with the others but i have more responsibility than i thought i would i need to talk with youwith your governmentabout how we can all get along now that things have changed and you really need to recognize our fundamental equality atvar laughed again you assume what you wish to prove something i have seen a great many tosevites do we have sent fleets to tosev you have sent one ship here and a slow one at that this to me does not argue in favor of fundamental equality the balance has changed there is a new weight on your side of the scale but the two sides do not match maybe not the corners of sam yeagers mouth turned up that could be a gesture of amiability or of something else masquerading as amiability when we do fly a fleet here are you sure you will want to meet us you will know i mean no disrespect when i tell you our technology changes much faster than yours that said what sort of gesture the upturned mouth corners were all right you have been stealing from us since we first came to tosev you mean atvar said truth sam yeager said again surprising atvar but he also made the negative hand gesture but what we know for ourselves and what we have discovered has also grown and we have already started doing things with what we have learned from you that you never thought of he told another truth there the fleetlord wished he hadnt reports that came in at light speed kept talking about tosevite advances in electronics in biochemistry and in many other areas it was indeed worrisome why could you not have gone sightseeing the fleetlord thought resentfully karen yeager found herself enjoying a winter day near the south pole of home it felt like an april day in los angeles a little chilly for the tshirt and shorts she had on but not bad the guide a female named trir seemed more interested in the tosevites she had charge of than in the scenery around her her eye turrets kept going every which way staring at the big uglies in a distracted voice trir said conditions here today are relatively mild on rare occasions water has been known to freeze and fall to the ground in strange crystals that are known as snow what is that appalling noise they are laughing kassquit told her that is the noise they make to show amusement why the female of the race asked do they not believe me we believe you we do not laugh to offend you karen said we laugh because our planet is cooler than home snow is common on many parts of it we are more familiar with it than members of the race she said that even though shed been a little girl the last time it snowed all over los angeles though of course she didnt know what had happened while she was in cold sleep i see trir said coldly the female acted as if she were in the company of a group of tigers that walked on their hind legs and wore business suits maybe the big uglies wouldnt shoot her or devour her but she wasnt convinced of it they speak the truth kassquit said i see trir said again no more warmth in her tone as far as she was concerned kassquit must have been about as barbarous as a wild big ugly even if she wore body paint instead of clothes it was definitely chilly to be walking around in nothing but body paint and a pair of sandals karen yeager had a hard time feeling much sympathy for the races pet human trying to be a diplomat frank coffey said shall we go on i thank you yes that is an excellent idea trir said please follow me she walked along a welldefined trail every couple of hundred yards signs at the height of lizard eye turrets urged members of the race to stay on the trail and not go wandering away into the wilderness karen had to smile when she saw them they reminded her of those in some of the busier national parks back in the united states what happens to the local plants and animals when it snows jonathan yeager asked some plants go dormant some animals hibernate the guide answered most survive as best they can or simply perish under those harsh conditions in broad outline the south polar region of home reminded karen of the country around palm springs and indio or perhaps more of the great basin desert of nevada and utah plants were scattered randomly across the landscape with bare ground between most of them and with occasional clumps growing wherever the soil was especially rich or where there was more water than usual the plants looked like desert vegetation too their leaves were small and shiny and they didnt get very big a lot of them were armed with spikes and barbs to make life difficult for herbivores something skittered from one clump of plants to another karen didnt get the best look at it but it reminded her of a smalll lizard of course since all the land creatures on home seemed to be scaly they would remind her of lizardsunless they reminded her of dinosaurs instead she and the rest of the humans walked along in trirs wake admiring the scenery it was beautiful in a bleak way a few of the plants showed homes equivalent of flowers which had black disks at their heart that attracted pollinators karen went up to one and sniffed at it it didnt smell like anything in particular why do you do that trir asked i wanted to find out if it had an odor she answered why would it the guide didnt sound as if she believed the explanation because many plants on tosev use odors to attract flying animals that spread their sex cells karen replied realizing she had no idea how to say pollinators in the language of the race how very peculiar trir said and added an emphatic cough to show she thought it was very peculiar indeed something rose from a bush and flapped away one of the batwinged little pterodacytloids that did duty for birds here it was the same greenish gray as the leaves from which it had emerged protective coloration was alive and well on home then when the flying beast landed in another bush it became for all practical purposes invisible bigger fliers glided overhead karens shadow stretched long off to one side tau cetimore and more karen was just thinking of it as the sun shone not very high in the north she wondered what happened during the long dark winter nights when the sun didnt rise at all when she asked though trir stared at her with as little comprehension as if shed used english what do you mean the lizard asked there is a time when the sun does not rise above the horizon yes but there is always light here that left karen as confused as trir had been buthow she asked frank coffey explained it for both of them speaking in the races language he said tosev has the ecliptic inclined to the equator at twentysix parts per hundred the lizards didnt use degrees they reckoned a right angle as having a hundred divisions not ninety here on home the inclination is only about ten parts per hundred on our world the far north and the far south can be altogether dark for a long time there must always be at least twilight here during the day because the sun does not get so far below the horizon that at least is a truth trir said you tosevites must come from a very peculiar world indeed karen hid her amusement the guide had almost said big uglies but had remembered her manners just in time the sky wouldnt have fallen if shed slipped but she didnt know that just as well she didnt probably the more polite the race and humanity were to each other the better things were likely to go and that was all to the good since each side could reach the other now she did say to us home seems the peculiar world oh no certainly not trir used the negative gesture and an emphatic cough home is a normal world home is the world against which all others are measured rabotev and halless come fairly close but tosev must be much more alien only because you come from home is this world normal to you karen said to us tosev is the standard home is the standard for everyone in the empire trir insisted except for kassquit here we are not citizens of the empire karen said we come from the united states an independent notempire trir must have been briefed about that but it plainly meant nothing to her she could not imagine intelligent beings who did not acknowledge the emperor as their sovereign and she would not admit that the choice of home as a standard for how worlds should be was as arbitrary as that of earth even kassquit weighed into the argument on karens side she couldnt convince trir either and the guide did seem to find her just as alien as she found the americans in english jonathan said if this is the races attitude were going to have a devil of a time making them see reason the higherups the males and females well be dealing with have better sense tom de la rosa said also in english i hope so jonathan said but down deep theyre still going to feel the same way theyre the center of the universe and everything revolves around them if they think thats how it ought to be were going to have a hard time persuading them theyre wrong atvar will help there karen said after all the time he spent on earth he knows whats what what are these preposterous grunts and groans trir demanded our own language karen answered we know yours and on our planet many males and females of the race have learned ours how extremely peculiar the lizard used another emphatic cough i assumed all intelligent beings would naturally speak our language that is so throughout the empire but we do not belong to the empire karen said i already told you that when the empire tried to conquer our notempire we fought it to a standstill and forced it to withdraw from the territory we rule as time goes on you will be made into contented subjects of the empire as so many tosevites already have been trir replied she sounded perfectly confident that was the attitude the race had taken back on earth too were the lizards right they thought they had time on their side they were very patient far more patient than humans they routinely thought and planned in terms of thousands of years hadnt that hurt them more than it helped though theyd first examined earth in the twelfth century if theyd sent the conquest fleet then humanity wouldnt have been able to do a thing about it people really would be contented citizens of the empire now but the lizards had waited theyd got all their ducks in a row theyd made sure nothing could go wrong meanwhile earth had had the industrial revolution by the time the race arrived people werent pushovers any more and why because the lizards had planned too well too thoroughly he who hesitates is lost if that wasnt a proverb the race should have taken to heart while dealing with humanity karen couldnt think of one that was kassquit said in my opinion senior tour guide the issue you raise is as yet undetermined well what do you know trir retorted you are just another one of these big ugly things yourself she could lose her temper after all karen had never expected to sympathize with kassquit but she did here trir might as well have called kassquit a nigger in essence she had kassquit said senior tour guide i am a citizen of the empire if that does not happen to please you you are welcome to stick your head even farther up your cloaca than it is already she did not bother with an emphatic cough the words carried plenty of emphasis by themselves had trir been a human she would have turned red as things were her tailstump quivered with fury how dare you speak to me that way she snarled i dare because i am right now kassquit did use an emphatic cough truth karen said she used another one judge males and females for what they are not for what they look like i thank you kassquit said you are welcome karen answered they both sounded surprised at finding themselves on the same side atvar had just finished applying fresh body paint when the telephone hissed for attention he laughed as he went to answer it jokes as old as the unification of home insisted that it always hissed right when you were in the middle of the job he felt as if he had beaten the odds this is atvar i greet you he said i greet you exalted fleetlord i am protocol master herrep said the male on the other end of the line you recently petitioned for an imperial audience yes atvar made the affirmative gesture your petition has been granted you are ordered to appear at the imperial court tomorrow at noon so that you may be properly prepared for the ceremony herrep broke the connection he did not ask if atvar had any questions or problems he assumed there would be none and he was right when the emperor commanded his subjectseven subjects with rank as high as atvarsobeyed preffilo the imperial capital lay halfway around the planet that did not matter an imperial summons took precedence over everything else atvar called the wild big uglies and canceled the session he had scheduled for the next day then he arranged a shuttlecraft flight to preffilo when he announced he was traveling to an audience with the emperor the usual fee was waived after the shuttlecraft firm checked with the imperial court every so often someone tried to steal a free flight to preffilo court officials awaited atvar at the shuttlecraft port have you enjoyed the privilege of an imperial audience before exalted fleetlord one of them asked i should hope i have atvar answered proudly it was with his majestys predecessor more than two hundred years ago now not long before i took the conquest fleet to tosev i see the courtiers tone was absolutely neutral not the faintest quiver of tailstump or motion of eye turrets showed what he was thinking and yet somehow he managed to convey reproach atvar should have returned to home as atvar the conqueror who had added a new world to the empire instead he might have been called atvar the ambiguous who had added just over half a world to the empire and who had left the other half full of independent dangerous wild big uglies atvar remained convinced hed done the best he could under the circumstances conditions on tosev were nothing like the ones the conquest fleet had been led to expect anyone with half a brain should have been able to see that his recall and the scorn heaped on him since hed come back only proved a lot of males and females had less than half a brain so he believed anyhowand if this courtier didnt too bad come with us the courtier said we will refresh you on the rituals as we go i thank you atvar replied every youngster learned the rituals of an imperial audience in school on the off chance they might prove useful unlike the vast majority of males and females atvar actually had used what hed learned but even discounting a round trip in cold sleep that had been a long time ago he welcomed a chance to review embarrassing yourself before the emperor was as near unforgivable as made no difference most of the buildings in preffilo were the usual utilitarian boxes some had a little more in the way of ornament than others none was especially out of the ordinary the imperial palace was different ordinary buildings came and went the palace went on forever it had stood in the same spot for more than a hundred thousand years it wasnt quite the oldest building on home but it was the oldest continuously inhabited one it looked like a fortress in the early days before home was unified it had been a fortress it had bastions and outwalls and guard towers all in severe gray stone with only tiny narrow windows here on peaceful home most of the travelers who came to see the palace thought of it only as ancient not as military no one on home thought of matters military on first seeing any building atvar had had to worry about military architecture both that of the race and tosevite on tosev he could appreciate what the builders here had done and he could appreciate the gardens in which the palace was set almost as many males and females came to see them as came to see the palace with multicolored sand carefully placed rocks of different sizes colors and textures and an artistic mixture of plants they were famous on three planets to most big uglies atvar thought they would have been nothing special the tosevites had an embarrassment of water on their native world they appreciated great swaths of greenery much more than the race did this spare elegance would not have appealed to them but there were exceptions to everything while fleetlord he had learned that photographs of the gardens around the imperial palace were wildly popular in the tosevite empireand it really was an empireof nippon the nipponese big uglies practiced a somewhat similar gardening art of their own although atvar doubted whether the gardeners or courtiers here would have appreciated the comparison as soon as he entered the palace he assumed the posture of respect he held it till one of the courtiers gave him leave to straighten then he went on to the cleansing chamber where a female known as the imperial laver removed the body paint hed applied only the day before he felt as bereft as an unwrapped wild big ugly but only for a moment another court figure the imperial limner painted on the special pattern worn only by petitioners coming before the emperor i am not worthy atvar said as ritual required that is a truth you are not the imperial limner agreed an emphatic cough showed how unworthy atvar was she continued you are granted an audience not because of your worth but by grace of the emperor rejoice that you have been privileged to receive that grace i do atvar used an emphatic cough of his own advance then and enter the throne room the imperial limner said i thank you like his majesty you are more gracious more generous than i deserve atvar assumed the posture of respect again the imperial limner did not return the courtesy she represented the sovereign and so outranked any official not connected with the court the throne room held banners seen nowhere else on home after a hundred thousand years it held reproductions of the original banners that had once hung between the tall thin windows awe made atvar suck a deep breath into his lung he knew what those banners stood for they were the emblems of the empires the empire had defeated in unifying the planet and the race everywhere else on home they were forgotten here where conquest had begun the emperor and those who served him remembered there were also newer insignia from rabotev and halless and some newer still from tosev but other banners atvar knew well from the big uglies world were conspicuously absent all the throne room was designed to make a male or female advancing to an audience feel completely insignificant colonnades led the eye up to the tall distant shadowy ceiling the path up to the throne lay in shadow too while the throne itself was gorgeous with gold and brilliantly illuminated the spotlights glowed also from the gilding that ornamented the emperors chest and belly the th emperor risson did not need ornate patterns of body paint to display his rank he simply glowed in ancient days atvar had heard the emperor had been thought to represent the sun on home he didnt know whether it was true or simply an explanation of why the emperor wore solid gold body paint it sounded as if it ought to be true which was good enough two large males in gray paint as simple as the emperors suddenly stepped into the aisle blocking atvars progress he gestured with his left hand i too serve his majesty he declared that sent them away they slunk back into the shadows from which they had sprung they represented what had once been a more rigorous test of loyalty at last atvar dropped into the posture of respect before the throne he cast his eye turrets down to the ground the stone floor here was highly polished how many males and females had petitioned how many emperors in this very spot the numbers were large that was as far as atvar was willing to go arise fleetlord atvar the th emperor risson said from somewhere up above atvar i thank your majesty for his kindness and generosity in summoning me into his presence when i am unworthy of the honor atvar stuck to the words of the ritual how many times had how many emperors heard them arise i say again risson returned atvar obeyed the emperor went on nowenough of that nonsense for a little while what are we going to do about these miserable big uglies anyway atvar stared the previous emperor had not said anything like that when the fleetlord saw him before going into cold sleep your majesty atvar said unsure whether to believe his hearing diaphragms what are we going to do about the big uglies risson repeated they are here on home we have never had a problem like this before if we do not make the right choices the empire will have itself a lot of trouble i have been saying that for a long time atvar said dazedly i did not think anyone was listening i have been the emperor said some of the males and females who serve me are used to doing things as they have been done since the empire was unified for the situation we now have i do not think this is adequate but if you speak your majesty atvar began i will have a reign of a hundred years or soa little more if i am lucky risson said the bureaucracy has been here for more than a hundred thousand it will be here at least as much longer and knows it emperors give orders we even have them obeyed it often matters much less than you would think a great many things go on the same old way when you cannot keep both eye turrets on themand you cannot not all the time or was your experience as fleetlord on tosev different no your majesty atvar said but i am only a subject while you are the emperor my spirit is nothing special yours will help determine if your subjects have a happy afterlife do not the males and females who serve you remember this some of them may the emperor said but a lot of them have worked with me and with my predecessor and some even with his predecessor much more than ordinary males and females they take their sovereigns for granted atvar had heard more startling things in this brief audience than in all the time since awakening again on home hed heard plenty of startling things on tosev but everything startling seemed to hatch there i would not think anyone could take your majesty for granted he said well that is a fine compliment and i thank you for it but it does not have much to do with what is truth risson said and i tell you fleetlord i want you to do everything you can to make peace with the big uglies if you do not we will have a disaster the likes of which we have never imagined or do you believe i am wrong i wish i did your majesty atvar replied with all my liver i wish i did kassquit had an odd feeling when she came back to sitneff after the excursion to the park near the south pole whenever she was alone with members of the race she always stressed that she was a citizen of the empire and no different from any other citizen of the empire she made members of the race believe it too not least because she believed it herself but when she found herself in the company of other tosevites she also found herself taking their side in arguments with males and females of the race part of that there had hatched from trirs outrageous rudeness kassquit understood as much the rest though she looked like a wild big ugly her biology was that of a wild big ugly in evolutionary terms the races body paint was only skin deep beneath it she remained a tosevite herself this concerns me superior sir she told ttomalss in his chamber in the hotel where the american big uglies also dwelt i wonder if my advice to the race is adequate i wonder if it is accurate i have the odd feeling of being torn in two your words do not surprise me her mentor said kassquit was relieved to hear it he understood her better than any other member of the race sometimes though that was not saying much he went on since your cultural and biological backgrounds are so different is it much of a surprise that they often conflict i would think not what is your view i believe you speak the truth here kassquit said relieved to have the discussion persist and not founder on some rock of incomprehension perhaps this accounts for some of my intense curiosity whenever i find myself around wild big uglies perhaps it does ttomalss agreed well no harm indulging your curiosity you are not likely to betray the race by doing so nor are you likely to go back into cold sleep and return to tosev or do you think i am mistaken no superior sir i do not and i thank you for your patience and understanding kassquit said i hope you will forgive me for saying that i still find this world strange in many ways living on the starship orbiting tosev prepared me for some of it but only for some the males and females here are different from those i knew back there those were picked malesand later females ttomalss said the ones you meet here are not they are apt to be less intelligent and less sophisticated than the males and females chosen to travel to the tosevite solar system would you judge all big uglies on the basis of the ones the notempire of the united states chose to send to home i suppose not kassquit admitted still that is a far smaller sample than the one the race sent in the conquest and colonization fleets indeed it is ttomalss replied the reason being that we can send two large fleets to tosev while the wild big uglies have just managed to send a single starship to home yes superior sir kassquit said dutifully but she could not resist adding of course when the race first came to tosev the wild big uglies could not fly beyond their own atmosphere or very far up into it in what short period has the race shown comparable growth for some reason that seemed to upset ttomalss who broke off the conversation kassquit wondered whyso much for his patience and understanding only the next day did she figure out what had gone wrong he had compared tosevites to the race in a way that slighted her biological relatives and what had she done in response she had compared her species and the raceto the advantage of the wild big uglies things were as shed warned him altogether without intending to shed proved as much she was more like the race than wild big ugliesand she was more like wild big uglies than the race males and females of the race stared at her whenever she ventured out in public some of them asked her if she was a wild big ugly that was a reasonable question she always denied it politely the males and females who kept talking with her after that were often curious how a tosevite could be a citizen of the empire that was reasonable too but then there were the males and females who had no idea what she was video had been coming back from tosev for of homes years but a good many members of the race did not seem to know what a big ugly looked like she got asked if she was a hallessi and even if she was a rabotev one of the ones who did that was wearing false hair to pretend to be a big ugly himself kassquit hadnt imagined such ignorance was possible and males and females who did recognize her for a tosevite kept sidling up to her and asking her if she could sell them any ginger they got angry when she said no too but you are from there they would say you must have some of the herb you must some of them were trembling in the early stages of ginger withdrawal at first she tried to reason with them why would i have any ginger she would ask it does nothing for my metabolism for me it is a spice not a drug and i have never tasted it it was forbidden on the starship where i lived reasoning with members of the race who craved ginger quickly proved impractical it wasnt kassquits fault she was willing even eager to go on reasoning the males and females who were desperate for the herb werent i will do anything anything a female said her emphatic cough was the most unnecessary one kassquit had ever heard just let me have some of the herb she would not believe kassquit had none after a meeting with the wild big uglies kassquit asked them do the males and females of home cause you difficulties they looked from one to another without answering right away at last the darkskinned male the one named frank coffey said it is only to be expected that they are curious about us except for you they have never seen a real live big ugly before you do not seem upset at the races name for your folk kassquit said coffey shook his head then remembered to use the negative hand gesture i am not he said we have our own name for the race you know which is no more flattering to them than big uglies is to us and besides i have been called worse things than a big ugly in my time have you kassquit said this time coffey remembered right away to use the races affirmative gesture she asked him do you mean as an individual why would anyone single you out as an individual you do not seem much different from any other wild tosevite i have met in some ways i am typical in other ways i am not the big ugly tapped his bare left forearm with the first two fingers of his right hand i was not so much singled out as an individual i was singled out because of this because of what your arm kassquit was confused and did not try to hide it frank coffey laughed in the loud uproarious tosevite style so did the other american big uglies coffey was so uproarious he almost fell off the foamrubber chair on which he was sitting shaped chunks of foam made a tolerable substitute for the sort of furniture big uglies used the races stools and chairs were not only too small but also made for fundaments of fundamentally different shape no not on account of my arm coffey said when at last he stopped gasping and wheezing because of the color of the skin on it he was a darker brown than the other wild big uglies on home who had a good deal more pale tan and pink in their complexions kassquit was darker than they were too though not to the same degree as frank coffey she said ah i have heard about that yes but i must say it puzzles me why would anyone do such an irrational thing how much time do you have coffey asked i could tell you stories that would make your hair as curly as mine the rest of the wild big uglies took their leave one by one maybe they had heard his stories before or maybe they didnt need to kassquits hair was straight she had never thought about it much one way or the other the dark brown big uglys hair by contrast grew in tight ringlets on his head she had noticed that before but again hadnt attached any importance to it now she wondered if she should why would a story make my hair curl she asked then a possible answer occurred to her did you translate one of your idioms literally into this language coffey made the affirmative gesture i did and i apologize stories that would appall you i should have said but why kassquit asked then she held up a hand in a gesture both the race and the big uglies used wait during the fighting the race tried to recruit darkskinned big uglies in your notempire i know that truth coffey said kassquit was not expert at reading tone among big uglies but she thought he sounded grim his next words pleased her for they showed she hadnt been wrong they were able to do that because tosevites of that racethat subspecies you might sayhad been so badly treated by the dominant lighter group but the experiment failed did it not kassquit said most of the dark tosevites preferred to stay loyal to their own notempire oh yes they decided being tosevite counted most of all or the large majority of them did and they deserted the race when combat began frank coffey said but that they joined the race at all says a lot about how desperate they were and although we in the united states do not like to remember it some of them did stay on the races side and they fought against my notempire harder than the soldiers from your species did was he praising or condemning them kassquit couldnt tell she asked why did they do that coffeys expression wasquizzical that would have been kassquits guess again from limited experience he said you have never heard the word nigger have you nigger kassquit pronounced the unfamiliar word as well as she could she made the negative gesture no i never have it must be from your language what does it mean it means a darkskinned tosevite coffey answered it is an insult a strong insult next to it something like big ugly seems a compliment by comparison why is there a special insulting term for a darkskinned tosevite kassquit asked there are special insulting terms for many different kinds of tosevites frank coffey said there are terms for those with different beliefs about the spirit and there are terms based on what language we speak and those based on how we look the one for darkskinned tosevites one way to subject a group is to convince yourselfand maybe that group toothat they are not fully intelligent creatures that they do not deserve to share what you have that is what nigger does i see kassquit wondered if she did she pointed to him yet you are here in spite of those insults so i am the wild tosevite said we have made some progressnot enough but some and i am very glad to be here too i am also glad you are here kassquit said politely though sam yeager had not gone to the south pole there were times when he wanted to see more of home than the race felt like showing him because the lizards had insisted on him as ambassador when the doctor didnt wake up they had a hard time refusing him outright they did do their best to make matters difficult guards accompanied him wherever he went there are many males and females here who lost young friends on tosev one of the guards told him that they should seek revenge is not impossible he wished he could afford to laugh at the guard but the female had a point friendship ties were stronger among the race than in mankind family ties far weaker save in the imperial family kinship was not closely noted in a species with a mating season that was perhaps unsurprising going into a department store was not the same when you had a guard with an assault rifle on either side of you of course sam would have stood out any which way he was the alien who was almost tall enough to bump the ceiling but that might have made members of the race curious had he been alone as things were he frightened most of them their department stores frightened himor perhaps awed would have been the better word everything a lizard could want to buy was on display under one roof the store near the hotel where the americans were quartered was bigger than any hed ever seen in the usa this even though lizards were smaller than people and even though there was no clothing section since the raceexcept for the trend setters and weirdos who imitated big ugliesdidnt bother with clothes if the lizards wanted a ball for a game of long toss a fishing net what they caught werent quite fish but the creatures did swim in water a new mirror for an old car something to read something to listen to something to eat something to feed their befflem or tsiongyu a television a stove a pot to put on the stove a toy for a halfgrown hatchling an ointment to cure the purple itch a sympathy card for someone else who had the purple itch a plant with yellow almostflowers potting soil to transplant it body paint or anything else under tau ceti they could get what they needed at the department store the proud boast outsidewith our mart you could build a wall around the worldseemed perfectly true the clerks wore special yellow body paint and were trained to be relentlessly cheerful and courteous i greet you superior sir they would say over and over or else superior female then they would add how may i serve you even in the face of a wild big ugly flanked by guards with weapons rarely seen on home their training did not quite desert them more than one did ask are you a male or a female superior tosevite and a couple of them thought sam was a hallessi not a human that left him both amused and bemused i am a male and the ambassador from the notempire of the united states he would answer that often created more confusion than it cleared up the clerks did not recognize the archaic word what is an ambassador they would ask and what is a notempire explaining an ambassadors job wasnt too hard once sam got across the idea of a nation that didnt belong to the empire explaining what a notempire was proved harder you make your choices by counting snouts a clerk asked him what if the side with the most is wrong then we try to fix it later sam answered what do you do if the emperor makes a mistake he horrified not only the clerk but also his guards with that how could the emperor make a mistake the clerk demanded twisting his eye turrets down to the ground as he mentioned his sovereign he is the emperor he looked down again we think he made a mistake when he tried conquering tosev sam said this caused many many deaths both among the race and among us tosevites and the empire has gained very little because of it it must have been for the best or the spirits of emperors past would not have allowed it the clerk insisted again the guards showed they agreed sam only shrugged and said well i am a stranger here maybe you are right the lizards seemed pleased they thought he had admitted the clerk was right he knew hed done no such thing but more than a hundred years before while he was growing up on a nebraska farm his father had always loudly insisted there was no point to arguing about religion because nobody could prove a damned thing the race had believed what it believed for a lot longer than mankind had clung to any of its faithswhich again proved exactly nothing when he and the guards left the department store one of them asked where would you like to go now superior tosevite back to your hotel he sounded quite humanly hopeful sam made the negative hand gesture he stood out in the middle of the vast parking lot surrounding the department store lizards driving in to shop would almost have accidents because they were turning their eye turrets to gape at him instead of watching where they were going the weather wassurprise hot and dry about like an august day in los angeles he didnt mind the heat or not too much it felt good on his old bones and made him feel more limber than he really was well superior tosevite if you do not want to go back to the hotel where would you like to go the guard asked with exaggerated patience plainly the lizard thought sam would have no good answer but he did if you would be so kind would you take me to a place that sells old books and periodicals his guards put their heads together then one of them pulled out a little gadget that reminded sam of a dick tracy twoway wrist radio but that they insisted on calling a telephone it did more than any telephone yeager had ever imagined they could even use it to consult the races homespanning electronic network here the lizard simply used it as a phone then put it away very well superior tosevite it shall be done she said come with us his official vehicle had beensomewhatadapted to his presence it had almost enough leg room for him and its seat didnt make his posterior too uncomfortable still he wasnt sorry whenever he got out of it the guards had taken him to an older part of sitneff how old did that make the buildings here as old as the declaration of independence the discovery of america the norman conquest there were towns in europe with buildings that old but had these been around for the time of christ the erection of stonehenge of the pyramids lord had they been around since the domestication of the dog since the last ice age if the guards had said so sam would have been in no position to contradict them he saw old old sidewalks and weathered brick fronts on the buildings how long would the brickwork have taken to get to look like that he had not the faintest idea the sign above the door said sstravos used books of all periods that certainly sounded promising sam had to duck to get through the doorway but he was just about used to that an electronic hiss did duty for the bell that would have chimed at a shop in the united states an old lizard fiddled around behind the counter on earth sam hadnt seen really old lizards the males of the conquest fleet and males and females of the colonization fleet had almost all been young or in their prime even their highest officers hadnt been elderly though atvar and some others had long since left youth behind but this male creaked his back was bent he moved stiffly his scales were dull while his hide hung loose on his bones i greet you he said to sam yeager as if yeager were an ordinary customer what can i show you today you are sstravo sam asked i am the old male replied and you are a big ugly you must be able to read our language or you would not be here so what can i show you would you like to see a copy of the report our probe sent back from your planet i have one that report went back almost nine hundred years now was it a recent reprint or did the races paper outlast most of its earthly equivalents despite some curiosity sam made the negative gesture no thank you i have seen most of that report in electronic form on tosev can you show me some older books that are unlikely to have made the journey from your world to mine they can be history or fiction i am looking for things to help me understand the race better we often do not understand ourselves how a big ugly can hope to do so is beyond me sstravo said but you are bravethough perhaps foolishto make the effort let me see what i can find for you he doddered over to a shelf full of books with spines and titles so faded sam could not make them out and pulled one volume off it here you might try this what is it called sam asked gone with the wind sstravo answered sam burst out laughing sstravo stared at him that loud raucous sound had surely never been heard in this shop before i apologize sam said but that is also the title of a famous piece of fiction in my world ours dates from seventythree thousand years ago sstravo said how old is yours even dividing by two to turn the number into terrestrial years that was a hell of an old book ours is less than two hundred of your years old sam admitted modern art is it i have never been partial to modern art but ours may interest you sstravo said so it may sam said but since i only know your language as it is used now will i be able to understand this you will find some strange words a few odd turns of phrase the bookseller said most of it though you will follow without much trouble our language does not change quickly nothing about us changes quickly but our speech has mostly stayed the same since sound and video recording carved the preferred forms in stone all right then sam said what is the story about friends who separate over time sstravo answered one of the guards made the affirmative gesture so maybe shed read the book sam kept thinking of clark gable sstravo went on what else would one find to write about what else is there to write about we tosevites feel that way about the attraction between male and female sam said sstravo and the guards laughed sam might have knownhe had knownthey would think that was funny he held up the copy of gone with the wind that owed nothing to margaret mitchell cromagnons hadnt finished replacing neanderthals when this was written i will take this how do i make arrangements to pay you i will do it one guard said i shall be reimbursed i thank you sam said the guard gave sstravo a credit card the bookseller rang up the purchase on a register that might have been as old as the novel it worked though gone with the wind sam murmured he started laughing all over again jonathan yeager hadnt seen his father for seventeen years for all practical purposes his father might as well have been dead now he was back and he hadnt changed a bit in all that time jonathan meanwhile had gone from a young man into middle age cold sleep had a way of complicating relationships just this side of adultery at least his father also recognized the difficulty youve changed while i wasnt looking he said to jonathan one evening as they sat in the elder yeagers inadequately airconditioned room thats what you get for going to sleep while i stayed awake jonathan answered he sipped at a drink the lizards had given them pure ethyl alcohol cut with water it did duty for vodka the race didnt use ice cubes though and seemed horrified at the idea his old man had a drink on the low round metal table beside him too after a nip from it he nodded well i was encouraged to do that they didnt come right out and say so but i got the notion it was good for my life expectancy he shook his head in wonder since im heading toward a hundred and twentyfive now i guess it must have beenassuming i ever woke up again of course yeah assuming jonathan said hed got used to not having his father around to standing on the front line in the war against father time now he had some cover again if his father was still around he couldnt be too far over the hill himself could he of course his father had stood still for a while even as hed kept going over that hill himself they wanted to get rid of me and they did his dad said they might have made sure i had an accident instead if they could have sneaked it past the race if i hadnt taken cold sleep they probably would have tried that but after gordon tried to blow my head off and didnt quite make it the warning they got from the lizards must have made them leery of doing it if they didnt have to so here you are and youre in charge of things jonathan said that ought to make them start tearing their hair out when they hear about it tenplus years from now i thought so too when i woke up and the doctor didnt his father replied but now i doubt it i doubt it like hell as a matter of fact theyll be into the s by the time word of that gets back to earth by then it will have been more than sixty years since i went into cold sleep and more than seventyfive since i made a real nuisance of myself hardly anybody will remember who i am if i do a decent job of dealing with the lizards thats all thatll matter time heals all wounds jonathan thought it over then slowly nodded well maybe youre right i sure hope so but i still remember what happened in the s even if nobody back there will what they did to you wasnt right it was a long time agofor everybody except me his father said even for me it wasnt yesterday he finished his drink then got up and fixed himself another see youve got a lush for an old man youre no lush jonathan said well not like that sam yeager admitted when i was playing ball sweet jesus christ some of those guys could put the sauce away some of em drank so much it screwed them out of a chance to make the big leagues and some of em knew they werent ever going to make the big leagues because they just werent good enough and they drank even harder so they wouldnt have to think about that you werent going to jonathan said incautiously and i drank some his father answered i might have made it to the top if i hadnt torn up my ankle that cost me most of a season and most of my speed hell i might have made it if the lizards hadnt come i could still swing the bat some and i was f as could bethey wouldnt draft me with full upper and lower plates but even if it was the bush leagues i liked what i was doing the only other thing i knew how to do then was farm and playing ball beat the crap out of that jonathan took another pull at his glass it didnt taste like much but it was plenty strong he said you like what youre doing now you bet i do his father dropped an emphatic cough into english there hasnt been a really big war with the lizards since the first round ended the year after you were born the germans were damn fools to take em on alone in the s but then the nazis were damn fools if theres another fight it wont just take out earth home will get it too and the other worlds in the empire jonathan said we wouldnt leave them out his father nodded no i dont suppose we would they could hit back if we did thats a lot of people and lizards and rabotevs and hallessi dead and for what for what goddammit every once in a while he still cussed like the ballplayer he had been for nothing but pride and fear far as i can see if i can do something to stop that youd better believe i will what do you think the odds are jonathan asked instead of answering straight out his father said if anything happens to me here the lizards are liable to ask for you to take over as our ambassador are you ready for that just in case im not qualified if thats what you mean jonathan answered im not telling you any big secrets you know it as well as i do the only reason they might think of me is that im your kid not the only reason id say his father drank another slug of ersatz vodka ive been studying ever since they revived me trying to catch up on all the stuff that happened after i went into cold sleep from everything ive been able to find out you were doing a hell of a job as lizard contact man they wouldnt have asked you to come on the admiral peary if you and karen werent good oh we are the hooch had left jonathan with very little modesty false or otherwise were damn good and all those years of dealing with mickey and donald gave us a feel for the race i dont think anybody could get any other way but neither one of us is as good as you are that wasnt modesty that was simple truth and jonathan knew it even if he didnt like it he and karen and most human experts on the race learned more and more over years about how lizards thought and behaved no doubt his old man had done that too but his father somehow wasnt just an expert on the race though he was that sam yeager had the uncanny ability to think like a lizard to become a lizard in all ways except looks and accent people noticed it so did members of the race so had kassquit who was at the same time both and neither he had the ability jonathan didnt neither did karen they were both outstanding at what they did that only illustrated the difference between being outstanding and being a genius with a wry chuckle the geniusat thinking like a lizard anyhowwho was jonathans father said thats what i get for reading too much science fiction nothing like it to kill time on a train ride or a bus between one bushleague town and the next hed said that many times before he claimed the stuff had loosened up his mind and helped him think like a lizard but jonathan shook his head i used to believe that was what did it for you too but i read the stuff i started younger than you cause we had it in the house and i knew ever since i was little what i wanted to do i liked it too it was fun and i got to study the race in college where you had to learn everything from scratch youre still better at it than i ambetter than anybody else too when i was a kid i wanted to be babe ruth his father said the only times i ever got into a bigleague ballpark i had to pay my own way youre playing in the majors son and youre a star thats not bad yeah i know jonathan had his own fair share of the gray middleaged knowledge that told him hed fallen somewhat short of the place hed aimed at when he was younger that was somewhat mitigated because he hadnt fallen as far short as a lot of people did but that his father held the place hed aimed for and couldnt quite reach i do wonder how babe ruths kid would have turned out if hed tried to be a ballplayer even if he were a good one would it have been enough i think ruth had girls his father said jonathan sent him an angry look how could he misunderstand what i was saying like that he wondered and then catching the gleam behind his old mans bifocals jonathan realized he hadnt misunderstood at all hed just chosen to be difficult damn you dad he said his father laughed ive got to keep you on your toes somehow dont i and if babe ruths son turned out to be joe dimaggio he wouldnt have one goddamn thing to be ashamed of do you hear me i suppose so jonathan said in a way being very good at what hed always wanted to do was not only enough but an embarrassment of riches hed been good enoughand so had karento get chosen to come to home as his fatherd said but that wasnt all of what hed wanted hed wanted to be the best and there was his father sitting in this cramped little lizardsized room with him slightly pieeyed from all that almostvodka hed poured down and he was the best no doubt about it theyd broken the mold once they made sam yeager how many human ballplayers had sons who couldnt measure up to what theyd done a good many most of them you never even heard about because their kids couldnt make the majors at all how many had had sons who were better than they were few damn few his father said when it comes to this stuff i cant help being what i am any more than you can help being what you are we both put in a lot of hard work i know what all you did while i was awake to see it i dont know everything you did while i was in cold sleep but you couldnt have been asleep at the switch youre here for heavens sake yeah jonathan said in what he hoped wasnt too hollow a voice im here he was an expert on the race he had busted his hump in the seventeen years after dad went into cold sleep and if expertise didnt quite make up for genius he couldnt help it his father was right about that im going to ask you one thing before i throw you out and flop sam yeager said finishing his drink and standing up on legs that didnt seem to want to hold him if you want to blame fate or god or the luck of the draw for the way things are thats fine what i want to ask you is dont blame me please okay he really sounded anxious maybe that was the booze talking through him or maybe he understood just what jonathan was thinking after all hed had to deal with failure a lot larger than jonathans what would he have done if the lizards hadnt come for all his brave talk odds were he wouldnt have made the big leagues then what played bushleague ball as long as he could probably and after that if he was lucky he might have hooked on as a coach somewhere or a minorleague manager more likely he would have had to look for ordinary work wherever he happened to be when he couldnt get around on a fastball any more and the world never would have found out the one great talent he had in him he would have gone through lifewell not quite ordinary because not everybody could play ball even at his level but unfulfilled in a certain ultimate sense jonathan couldnt say that about himself and he knew it he nodded he smiled too and it didnt take too much extra effort okay dad he said sure although ttomalss had gone into cold sleep after all the big uglies whod come to home hed been awake longer than they had his starship had traveled from tosev to home faster than their less advanced craft he called up an image of their ramshackle ship on his computer monitor it looked as if it would fall apart if anyone breathed on it hard that wasnt so of course it had got here it might even get back to tosevs solar system the psychologist made the image go away looking at it only wasted his time what really mattered wasnt the ship that had brought the tosevites here what mattered was that they were hereand everything that had happened back on tosev since they left he still didnt know everything of coursedidnt and wouldnt radio took all those years to travel between tosevs system and this one but in the communications both fleetlord reffet who led the colonization fleet and shiplord kirel who headed what was left of the conquest fleet after atvars recall sent back to home ttomalss found a rising note of alarm it had been obvious even to ttomalss back during his time on tosev that the big uglies were catching up with the race in both technology and knowledge hed assumed the tosevites progress would plateau as time went on and they finally did pull close to even with the race hed assumed in other words that the race knew everything or almost everything there was to know that was turning out not to be true reports from both reffet and kirel talked about tosevite scientific advances that had the psychologist wondering whether he fully understood the news coming from tosev he also began to wonder whether reffet and kirel and the males and females working under them fully understood what was happening on tosev when he said as much to atvar the former fleetlord of the conquest fleet responded with the scorn ttomalss had expected from him reffet never has understood anything he never will understand anything and he never can understand anything he has not got the brains of a retarded azwaca turd and kirel ttomalss asked kirel is capable enough but kirel is stodgy atvar said kirel has brains enough what kirel lacks is imagination i have seen kamamadia nuts with more he rolled out one striking phrase after another that morning what would you do were you still in command on tosev ttomalss asked atvar swung both eye turrets toward him they were sitting in one of the small conference rooms in the hotel where the big uglies were staying how many other conference rooms all across home were just like this one with its soundabsorbing ceiling tiles its greenish brown wallswalls not far from the color of skin for the race a soothing colorits writing board and screen and connection to the planetwide computer network its stout tables and not quite comfortable chairs only the fact that some of the chairs now accommodated tosevite posteriorsnot quite comfortably from what the big uglies saidhinted at anything out of the ordinary after a pause atvar said why do you not come for a walk with me it is a nice enough day a walk ttomalss responded as if hed never heard the words before atvar made the affirmative gesture with a shrug the researcher said well why not out they went it was a nice enough day atvar let out what sounded like a sigh of relief we were certain to be recorded in there he said now that i am no longer in charge on tosev i do not wish to be quoted on what to do about it by anyone who could substantiate the record i see ttomalss said well since i am not in a position to do that what is your opinion on what to do in aid of tosev that reffet and kirel are cowards atvars voice went harsh and hard the big uglies are gaining an advantage on us you know this is true so do i so does everyone else with eyes in his eye turrets but the males allegedly leading on tosev have not the courage to draw the proper conclusion which is you were there you already know my view we cannot afford to let the big uglies get ahead of us they are already here with one ship that is bad enough but tolerable all this ship can do is hurt us if they send fleets to all our solar systems though they can destroy us they can and they might we attacked them without warning if they have the chance why should they not return the favor and so as i proposed many years ago our best course is to destroy them first that would also mean destroying our own colony ttomalss said better a part than the whole atvar used an emphatic cough far better i gather reffet and kirel do not agree they certainly do not atvar spoke with fine contempt they fail to see the difference between the purple itch for which a soothing salve is all the treatment needed and a malignancy that requires the knife you are outspoken ttomalss observed by the spirits of emperors past senior researcher i feel here what straha must have felt back on tosev before he tried to oust me atvar exclaimed ttomalss hissed in astonishment shiplord straha had been so disgusted over the way the conquest fleet was being run that after his attempt to supplant atvar failed hed defected to the american big uglies hed later returned to the race with news from sam yeager that the americans had been the ones to attack the colonization fleet nothing less than news like that could have restored him to the fleetlords good graces or even to a semblance of them atvar made the affirmative gesture by the spirits of emperors past it is a truth during the fighting straha saw how genuinely dangerous the big uglies were and wanted to use radical measures against them i in my infinite wisdom decided this was inappropriateand so we did not completely defeat them now i am the one who sees the danger and no one here on home or on tosev appears willing to turn an eye turret in its direction exalted fleetlord you are not the only one who sees it ttomalss said looking at the reports coming from tosev what strikes me is their ever more frightened tone another truth atvar said all the more reason for us to eliminate the menace would you not agree i have had an audience with the emperor even he realizes we have to find some way to deal with the big uglies some years ago i think annihilating the big uglies might well have been the appropriate thing to do ttomalss replied atvar hissed angrily he liked hearing disagreement no better than he ever had ttomalss said listen to me if you please go on atvar did not sound like a male who was going to listen patiently and give a reasoned judgment on what he heard he sounded much more as if he intended to tear ttomalss limb from limb all the same the psychologist continued unless i am altogether mistaken in my reading of the reports from tosev i think one reason reffet and kirel hesitate to apply your strategy is that they fear it will not work and it will provoke the independent tosevites what do you mean it will not work atvar demanded if we smash the notempires they will stay smashed the empire will no longer have to worry about themand a good thing too it might well be a good thing if we could be sure of doing it ttomalss said by the latest reports from tosev though the big uglies are now ahead of us technologically in many areas ahead of us to the point where reffet and kirel are close to despair we are not innovators not in the same way the tosevites are and we have only a small scientific community on tosev in any case it is a colonial world the center of the empire is still home at the moment unless i am badly mistaken the big uglies could beat back any attack we might try whether we could do the same if they attacked us is a different question and likely one with a different answer has it come to that so soon atvar said i would have believed we had more time i am not certain but i think it has ttomalss said i am also not certain the big uglies fully realize their superiority if they were to defeat an attack from the race they would become sure of something they now only suspect is that what you are saying ttomalss paused till a female wearing blue false hair between her eye turrets got too far away to hear then unhappily he used the affirmative gesture and said exalted fleetlord i am afraid it is if not then i am misreading the reports beamed here from tosev i have been reading those same reports atvar said i did not have that impression and yet he paused then strode out ahead of ttomalss his tailstump twitching in agitation the psychologist hurried to catch up with him atvar swung one eye turret back toward ttomalss with obvious reluctance the fleetlord slowed when ttomalss came up beside him once more he asked have you also been reading translations of the reports the american big uglies have sent this way for the benefit of their starship and its crew i have seen some of those translations ttomalss said cautiously i do not know how reliable they are well that is always a concern the fleetlord admitted we have sent back an enormous amount of data on tosev including video and audio but none of the socalled experts here has ever seen a real live big ugly before now except possibly kassquit the irony being that she speaks only the language of the race kassquit is what she is i often marvel that she has as much stability as she does ttomalss said hoping for more would no doubt be excessive but i am sorry you were saying i was saying that having read the translations i was struck by how confident the american big uglies seem atvar said they appear to respect the races power on tosev as who not utterly addled would not but they do not appear to be in the least afraid of it his tailstump trembled some more this may support your view are any officials who have never been to tosev aware of these concerns ttomalss asked the ones pertaining to conditions on the planet i mean not those involving the american big uglies here atvars mouth fell open in a laugh he waggled his lower jaw back and forth which meant the laugh was sardonic officials here who have never been to tosev are not aware of anything senior researcher he said anything do you hear me why do you suppose they have you and me and even kassquit negotiating with the wild big uglies they are not competent at least they know that much ttomalss said as reassurances went that one fell remarkably flat colonel glen johnson floated in the admiral peary s control room watching home go round below him that was an illusion of course the starship revolved around the planet not the reverse but his habits and his way of thinking were shaped by a language that had reached maturity hundreds of years before anyone who spoke it knew about or even imagined spaceflight he shared the control room with mickey flynn exciting isnt it flynn remarked he yawned to show just how exciting it was now that you mention it no johnson peered out through the coated glass there might have been nothing between him and the surface of home the lizards world had less in the way of cloud cover than earth too so he could see much more of the surface grasslands mountains forests seas and lots and lots of what looked like desert to a merely human eye rolled past on the night side of the planet the races cities shone like patches of phosphorescence he said i used to love the view from up high when i was in a plane or a ship in earth orbit hell i still do but he yawned too i never thought i would know how moses felt flynn said moses johnson contemplated his fellow pilot instead of the everchanging landscape down below i hate to tell you this but you dont look one goddamn bit jewish no eh im shocked and aggrieved to hear it but i wasnt thinking of looks flynn pointed down to tau ceti weve brought our people to the promised land but we cant go into it ourselves oh johnson thought that over then slowly nodded yeah ive had that same thought myself as a matter of fact even though its been a hell of a long time since i went to sunday school it was a pretty fair comparison no matter who made it he wondered how long hed last under full gravity not longhe was sure of that and he wouldnt have much fun till the end finally came either mickey flynn said i wonder if god reaches this far or if the spirits of emperors past have a monopoly here the lizards are sure their spirits reach to earth so god better be paying attention here just to even things out johnson said when he was a kid even when he was a young man hed really believed in the things the preacher talked about in sunday sermons he wondered where that belief had gone he didnt quite know all he knew was he didnt have it any more part of him missed it the rest the rest didnt much care he supposed that had he cared more he wouldnt have lost his belief in the first place his gaze went from the everunrolling surface of home to the radar screen as always the lizards had a lot of traffic in orbit around their homeworld the radar also tracked several suborbital shuttlecraft flights those looked a lot like missile launches so he noticed them whenever they went off as long as the alarm that said something was aimed at the admiral peary didnt go off though he didnt get too excited actually by comparison with the orbital traffic around earth home was pretty tidy the lizards were neat and well organized they didnt let satellites that had worn out and gone dead stay in orbit they cleaned up spent rocket stages too and they didnt have any missilelaunching satellites cunningly disguised as spent rocket stages either home wasnt nearly so well defended as earth the lizards hadnt seen the need why should they have seen it they were unified and peaceful no other species had ever paid them a call in its own starships till now in the circus of life do you know what we are flynn said out of the blue the clowns johnson suggested you would look charming in a big red rubber nose the other pilot said examining him as if to decide just how charming he would look flynn seemed dissatisfiedperhaps not charming enough after that onceover he went on with his own train of thought no we are the freaks of the midway step right up ladies and gentlemen and see the amazing astonishing and altogether unique floating men they glide they slide they sometimes collide and after one touchone slight touchof gravity they will have died one thin dime one tenth part of a dollar to see these marvels of science perform for you he pointed straight at johnson if i had a dime id give it to you johnson said i remember the carnival barkers back before the war sweet jesus christ thats more than ninety years ago now but you sound just like em mickey flynn looked pained talkers the word is talkers he said with what seemed exaggerated patience only the marks call them barkers how do you know that johnson asked after so long living in each others pockets on the lewis and clark he thought hed heard all the other pilots stories maybe he was wrong he hoped he was good stories were worth their weight in gold me flynn said simple enough until i was three years old i was a pickled punk living in a bottle of formaldehyde on a sideshow shelf it gave me a unique perspectiveand very bad breath he spoke with the same straightfaced seriousness he would have used to report the course of a lizard shuttlecraft he had no other tone of voice it left glen johnson very little to take hold of anyone ever tell you you were out of your tree he asked at last oh yes but theyre all mad save me and theeand i have my doubts about thee flynn said ive had my doubts about youtheea lot longer than the other way round ill bet johnson said not likely the other pilot replied when you came aboard the lewis and clark i doubted you would live long enough to doubt me or anything else ever again i thought healey would throw you right out the air lockand keep your spacesuit since johnson had wondered about the same thing he couldnt very well argue with mickey flynn he did say nobody believes i had electrical problems at just the wrong time healey believed youor he wasnt quite sure you were lying anyhow flynn said if you hadnt done such a good job of faking your troubles he would have spaced you and you can take that to the bank he eyed johnson once more it made his expression look odd since they floated more or less at right angles to each other dont you think you can fess up now it was more than ten lightyears and almost seventy years ago johnson might have confessed to mickey flynn flynn was right what hed done in earth orbit hardly mattered here in orbit around home but brigadier general walter stone chose that moment to come into the control room johnson was damned if he would admit anything to the dour senior pilot he had the feeling that stone wouldnt have minded spacing him either and so he said i told youi had wiring troubles at the worst possible time thats all there is such a thing as coincidence you know stone had no trouble figuring out what the other two pilots were talking about with a snort he said there is such a thing as bullshit too and youve got it all over your shoes thank you very muchsir if johnson was going to keep up the charade of innocent curiosity he had to act offended now if you will excuse me he reached for a handhold found it and pulled himself from one to another and out of the control room internally the ship was laid out like a smaller version of the lewis and clark corridors had plenty of handholds by which people could pull themselves along intersecting corridors had convex mirrors that covered all approaches johnson used them too hed seen some nasty collisionsmickey flynn hadnt been kidding about thatand he didnt want to be a part of one you could get going at quite a clip if you didnt happen to notice that somebody else was barreling along too his cabin was a little larger than the cramped cubicle that had gone by the name in the lewis and clark his bunk was nothing more than a foam mattress with straps to keep him from drifting away in weightlessness what more did anyone need a few people had nightmares of falling endlessly but most did just fine johnson was glad he was for once part of the majority he didnt feel like sleeping just now though he put a skelkwank disk into a player and started listening to music skelkwank lighta coherent beam of uniform frequencywas something humanity hadnt imagined before the lizards came english had borrowed the word from the language of the race all sorts of humans had borrowedstolenthe technology johnson remembered records he wondered if back on earth even one phonograph survived maybe a few stubborn antiquarians would still have them and museums ordinary people he didnt think so so much of the admiral peary used pilfered technology humanity had had radar before the lizards came people were beginning to work on atomic energy but even there the races technology was evolved perfected stealing had let humans evade any number of mistakes they would have made on their own where would we be if the race hadnt come johnson knew where he would be in this year of our lord he would be dead but where would people be would the nazis still be around or would the usa and the russians and england have smashed them he was pretty sure the germans would have gone down the drain they were after all taking on the rest of the world without much help but even beaten they were a formidable people in the real world theyd pulled themselves together after the races invasion and again after the fight theyd stupidly picked with the lizards over poland in the s that had been a disastrous defeat and had cost them much of their european empire but theyd been recovering even when johnson went into cold sleep and reports from earth showed they were working hard to reestablish themselves as a power to be reckoned with the lizards worked hard to keep the reich from violating the terms of the armistice theyd forced upon it they had kept germany from returning to space for a long time but the reich had quietly rearmed to the point where pulling its teeth now would only touch off another war the lizards didnt want that the last one had hurt them even though they won it the germans by acting as if they werent afraid to take the chance of another scrapand maybe given nazi fanaticism they werenthad won themselves quite a bit of freedom of action bastards johnson thought but tough bastards for the time being though the germans would trouble the race only back on earth things were different for the americans they were here just a few minutes before johnson had watched home through the glass of the control room and more american ships would be coming the pilot was as sure of that as he was of his own name the usa wasnt a country that did things by halves what would the lizards do when almost as many american shipsand russian ships and maybe japanese ships tooas those of the race flew back and forth between the sun and tau ceti for that matter what would humanity do when that came true ttomalss blamed his talk with fleetlord atvar for the worried interest with which he approached evidence of the big uglies growing scientific progress in the reports reaching home from tosev and the more he looked the more evidence he found that didnt surprise him but didnt leave him happy either some of the most recent reports alarmed him in a new way when hed stayed on tosev the worry had been that the big uglies were catching up with the race in this that or the other field that wasnt what the scientists in the colonization fleet were saying now instead they were writing things like the big uglies are doing this that or the other thing and we dont know how more and more often the race was falling behind everything his own people did was refined and perfected and studied from every possible angle before it went into largescale use their technology hardly ever malfunctioned it did what it was supposed to do and did it well if something didnt do what it was supposed to do and do it all the time they didnt use it they went into the unknown one fingerclaws width at a time the big uglies by contrast charged into the unknown with great headlong leaps if something worked at all theyd try it if it was liable to fail and kill large numbers of the individuals who used it they seemed to take that as part of the price of doing business they scoffed at danger even obviously preventable danger when the race came to tosev the big uglies had been making motor vehicles for a fair number of years theyd made them but they hadnt bothered including safety belts how many lives had that cost them how many injuries whatever the number the tosevites hadnt included them their cold sleep followed the same pattern it worked most of the time if the tosevite called the doctor died on the way to home well that was unfortunate but the big uglies hadnt wanted to wait till the process got better if they had waited they wouldnt have launched their starship in the first place whenever ttomalss found evidence of tosevite advances beyond anything the race could match he passed it on to males and females in the imperial office of scientific management and those males and females as far as he could tell promptly forgot all about it whenever he asked for followup they acted as if they had no idea what he was talking about they didnt quite laugh at him to his face he would have bet they laughed at him behind his back he had spent a lot of years on tosev maybe hed picked up some small streak of perverse independence from the big uglies hed studied for so long whatever the reason he decided to forget about the males and females in the imperial office of scientific management he used the computer network to find the name and number of a physicist who taught at the local university pesskrag didnt answer the phone ttomalss left a message on her machine and waited to see if she would call him back if she didnt he vowed to call another working scientist and if necessary another and another till he found somebody who would listen to him to his relief the physicist did return his call the next day when he saw her on the monitor her youth astonished him i greet you senior researcher she said at least she wore no wig do you really mean to tell me these big ugly things have made discoveries we have not excuse me but i find that very hard to believe if you are interested i would be pleased to send you the data to evaluate for yourself ttomalss answered please believe me when i tell you that you will not wring my liver if you persuade me i am worrying over nothing send the data by all means pesskrag said i was amazed that these creatures could fly a starship even a slow one but that after all is something they learned from us i will be even more surprised if they do prove to have learned anything we do not know i will send the data i presently have more comes in all the time decide for yourself ttomalss said one way or the other i look forward to your evaluation he transmitted the recent reports from tosev technically he probably wasnt supposed to do that the imperial office of scientific management had irked him enough that he didnt care so much whether he was supposed to he wanted answers not proper bureaucratic procedures yes the big uglies have corrupted me he thought this time pesskrag did not call back for several days ttomalss wondered if he ought to try to get hold of the physicist again that he convinced himself would show big uglystyle impatience he made himself wait he told himself hed waited for years in cold sleep what could a few days matter now but when hed lain in cold sleep he hadnt known he was waiting now he did it made a difference he had just come back to his room from a negotiating session with the wild tosevites when the telephone hissed for attention senior researcher ttomalss i greet you he said and i greet you this is physics professor pesskrag excitement tingled under ttomalss scales one way or the other he would find out i am glad to hear from you he said and barely suppressed an emphatic cough your thoughts are my thoughts are confused my thoughts are very nearly addled as a matter of fact pesskrag said i had expected you to send me a pile of sand to be honest with you i am not a physicist myself i have no sure way of evaluating it ttomalss said that is why i sent it to you all i can say is males and females with some expertise were concerned about it on tosev did they have reason to be yes pesskrag used an emphatic cough the big uglies are making experiments that never would have occurred to us some of these are large and elaborate and will not be easy to duplicate here do you have more data than you provided me by any chance i am sorry but i do not ttomalss said too bad the physicist told him most of what you have given me is descriptive only and not mathematical it appears to be taken from the public press not from professional journals even so i would dearly love to see the results from some of these trials is that a truth the psychologist asked that is a truth pesskrag used another emphatic cough in that case maybe you should see if you can duplicate these experiments here ttomalss said maybe you should pass this information on to other physicists you know if you do not have the facilities to duplicate what the big uglies are doing maybe a colleague will do i have your permission to do that mine you certainly do ttomalss did not tell the physicist his might not be the only permission required he did say if they decide to attempt this research i would appreciate it if they got word of their results back to me yes i can see how you might ah pesskrag hesitated you do realize these experiments will not be attempted tomorrow or even within the next quarter of a year colleagues will have to obtain materials and equipment to say nothing of funding and permissions these wings will spread slowly i see ttomalss did tooall too well please bear in mind though and please have your fellow physicists also bear in mind that these are liable to be the most important experiments they ever try please also bear in mind that the big uglies tried them years ago the news is just now reaching us because of light speed and because of whatever delay there was between the experiments themselves and when the race learned of them what you will be doing has been done on tosev do we want to fall behind the big uglies do we dare fall behind them until i looked at this i would have said falling behind those preposterous creatures was impossible pesskrag said now i must admit this may have been an error on my part who would have believed that amused and amazed the physicist broke the connection ttomalss was neither amused nor amazed he knew the big uglies too well he was alarmed the natives of tosev had been bad enough when they knew less than the race theyd used everything they did know and theyd had an overabundant supply of trickery not least because being disunited theyd spent the last centuries of their history cheating one another whenever they saw the chance theyd pulled even a while ago their current presence on home proved that if they ever got ahead if they ever get ahead how will we catch up ttomalss wondered the big uglies had started far behind but they ran faster theyd caught up could the race hope to pick up its pace if the tosevites ever got ahead that was part of what ttomalss was trying to find out what he did find out failed to encourage him a few days after he sent the data to pesskrag he got an angry telephone call from a male called kssott kssott worked in the imperial office of scientific management you have been distributing information that should have stayed confidential he said in accusing tones why should it stay confidential ttomalss demanded do you think that if you bury it in the sand it will never hatch i can tell you that you are wrong among the big uglies it has hatched already that is the information we most need to grasp with our fingerclaws and hold tight kssott said why it is a truth whether you admit it or not ttomalss said angrily and if you do admit it maybe youwecan do something about it if not the tosevites will keep on going forward while we stay in the same place is that what you want we do not want to introduce unexamined changes into our own society kssott said that could be dangerous truth ttomalss agreed sarcastically much more dangerous than letting the big uglies discover things we have not i have heard that the big uglies worry the emperor himself why do they not worry you kssott said you are misinformed i most assuredly am not ttomalss said appending an emphatic cough i have that directly from a male who has it straight from the emperors own mouth all he got from kssott was a shrug we have been what we are for a very long time the race is not ready for rapid change nor capable of it would you disrupt our society for no good purpose no i would disrupt it for the best of good purposes survival ttomalss said would you keep it as it is so that the big uglies can disrupt it for us you find this a concern kssott said the imperial office of scientific management does not our views will prevail you may rest assured of that senior researcher our views will prevail he sounded very certain very imperial very much a highranking male of the race ttomalss wanted to kill him but even that wouldnt have done much good there were too many more just like him as chief negotiator for the americans sam yeager sometimes had to put his foot down to be included on the junkets the other humans got to take i did not come here to sit in a conference room all day and talk he told one of the lizards protocol officers i could do that back on tosev thank you very much i want to see some of this world but did you not come here to negotiate the protocol officer asked i did not believe the purpose of your crossing interstellar space was tourism the female had a point of sorts but sam was convinced he did too if fleetlord atvar and your other negotiators want to talk with me i will gladly talk with them he said but let them come along on the journey too to the protocol officer that must have seemed like heresy but stubbornness won the day for sam and once hed won once he was whisked off to the port city of rizzaffi he rapidly wished hed let the protocol officer have her way the prospect of visiting a seaside city on home had seemed irresistible till he got there to the lizards whose world was more land than water ports were afterthoughts not the vital centers they so often were on earth rizzaffi which lay on the shore of the sirron sea proved no exception it also proved to have the nastiest weather sam had ever knownand hed played ball in arkansas and mississippi home was a hot place the lizards found arabia comfortable but most of this world was dry which made the climate bearable for a mere human being rizzaffi was a lot of things dry wasnt any of them nigeria might have had weather like this or the amazon jungle or one of the nastier suburbs of hell you couldnt fry an egg on the sidewalk but you could sure poach one most of the buildings in the port were of highly polished stone things that looked like ferns sprouted from their sides anyway mossy licheny growths spread across them and even grew on glass the lizards routinely used air conditioning in rizzaffi not to cut the heat but to wring some of the water out of indoor air that did them only so much good every other advertisement in the town seemed to extol a cream or a spray to get rid of skin fungi you know what this place is frank coffey said after their first day of looking around tell me sam said im all ears this is where athletes foot germs go to heaven after they die if you think ill argue with you youre nuts sam said it had never quite rained during the first days tour but it had never quite not rained either it was always mist or drizzle or fog the sky an ugly gray overhead rizzaffi reminded him of a classic sciencefiction story about the mad jungles of venus stanley weinbaums paradise planet venus wasnt like that of course but weinbaum hadnt known it wasnt hed died a few years before the lizards came to earth hed barely made it to thirty before cancer killed him news of his death had hit sam hard theyd been close to the same age he thought about mentioning paradise planet to coffey after a moment he thought again the younger man hadnt been born when the story came out to coffey venus had always been a world with too much atmosphere a world with the greenhouse effect run wild a world without a chance for life he wouldnt be able to see it as weinbaum had imagined it when jungles there were not only possible but plausible and that to sam was a shame as he discovered the next day even the plants in rizzaffis parks were like none humanity had ever seen the trees were low and shrubby as they were most places on home they had leaves or things that might as well have been leaves growing directly from their branches rather than from separate twigs or stalks but those leaves were of different color and shape from the local ones with which sam was familiar stuff that looked something like grass and something like moss grew on the ground below the treeish things an animal that resembled nothing so much as a softshell turtle with a red joseph stalin mustache jumped into a stream before sam got as good a look at it as he wanted what was that thing he asked their guide it is called a fibyen the lizard answered it feeds in the mud and gravel at the bottom of ponds and creeks those tendrils above its mouth help tell it what its prey is frank coffey said it looked like something id see sunday morning if i drank too much old overcoat saturday night he spoke in english the guide asked him to translate he did as well as he could the translation failed to produce enlightenment after a good deal of backandforth the guide said alcohol does not affect us in this particular way no matter how much of it we drink lucky you coffey said before that could cause more confusion still sam said i have a question go ahead the lizard replied with some relief you have sent many of your creatures from a dry climate from home to tosev to make parts of our planet more like yours yeager said the guide made the affirmative gesture sam went on why have you not also sent creatures like the fibyen and the plants here in rizzaffi tosev has many areas where they might do very well why i will tell you why because you tosevites are welcome to areas like this the guides emphatic cough said how welcome humans were to such places some of us must live here in this miserable place but we do not like it i do not believe anyone who was not addled from hatching could like it and that reminds me the lizards eye turrets swiveled in all directions though how far he could see through rizzaffis swirling mist was a good question yes sam asked when the guide didnt say anything for some little while have you big uglies got any ginger the lizard demanded that wonderful herb helps me forget what a miserable damp slimy hole this is i would give you anything you like for a few tastes and i am sure i am far from the only one who would well well frank coffey said isnt that interesting this time he didnt translate from english to the races language thats one word sam said also in english this wasnt the first time humans had got such a request he wondered how to answer the guide really though only one way was possible i am very sorry but we are diplomats not ginger smugglers we have no ginger we would not give it out if we did because it is against your laws what else could he say when he wasnt sure if this lizard was an addict or a provocateur the guide let out a disappointed hiss that is most unfortunate it will make many males and females very unhappy a pity sam said meaning anything but perhaps we should go back to the hotel now yes the lizard said perhaps we should with the air conditioning going full blast the hotel was merely unpleasant after hot wet weather hot dry weather seemed a godsend the sweat that had clung greasily to sams skin evaporated then salt crusts formed instead and he started to itch for a human showering in a stall made for lizards was an exercise in frustration apart from the force of the stream it involved bending low and banging ones head against the ceiling over and over yeager wouldnt have liked it when he was young now that he was far from young and far from limber it became an ordeal but he endured it here for the sake of getting clean he ate in the hotel refectory he didnt think it deserved to be called a restaurant as usual the food was salty by earthly standards that probably wasnt good for his blood pressure but he didnt know what he could do about it he fretted about it less today than he would have most of the time hed sweated out enough salt to need replenishing and he could get pure alcohol and dilute it to palatability with water nobody here knew anything about ice cubes the race cared nothing for cold drinks but warm vodka was better than no vodka at all his son had a sly look in his eye when he asked well dad arent you glad you came along if home needed an enema theyd plug it in right here sam replied which made jonathan choke on his drink the older yeager went on even so i am glad i came when will i ever get the chance to see anything like this again how many people have ever seen a fibyen i didnt even get to see it jonathan said but you know what else im not going to lose any sleep about missing it i lose enough sleep to sleeping mats sam said kassquit may not have any trouble with them but shes been sleeping on them all her life me he shook his head and wiggled and stretched something in his back crunched when he did that felt good but he knew it wouldnt last outside lightning flashed now real rain started coming downcoming down in sheets in fact sam knew the lizards did a good job of soundproofing their hotels the thunderclap that followed hard on the heels of the lightning still rattled his false teeth karen yeager said this is a part of home none of the lizards who came to earth ever talked much about i can see why too jonathan said how many people brag about coming from mobile alabama and this place makes mobile look like paradise sam whod been through mobile playing ball needed to think about that mobile was pretty bad but his son had it right and if that wasnt a scary thought it would do till a really spooky one came along makes you see why the race doesnt care much about ships too jonathan added i wouldnt want to live here either i had the same thought sam said but their ports cant all be like this sure mobile is a port but so is los angeles good point jonathan allowed he suddenly grinned theyve sent us to the south pole and now to this place maybe theyre trying to tell us they really dont want us gallivanting all over the landscape maybe they are too bad in that case sam said even rizzaffi is interesting in a horrible kind of way sure it is his son said besides the more the race shows us they dont want us to do something the likelier we are to want to do it sort of reminds me of how i felt about you and mom when i was sixteen it would sam said darkly and they both laughed they could laugh now back then sam had often wanted to clout his one and only son over the head with a baseball bat it had probably been mutual too sure it was sam though but by god he was the one who really had it coming not me of course not me kassquit liked rizzaffi no better than did the wild big uglies she probably liked it less and found it more appalling the tosevites whod come to home on the admiral peary were at least used to weather to variations on a theme theyd lived on the surface of a planet she hadnt the air conditioning aboard a starship had no business changing if it did something was badly wrong somewhere even ordinary weather on home disconcerted her the change in temperature from day to night seemed wrong it felt unnatural to her even though she knew it was anything but but in sitneff the change from what she was used to hadnt been extreme in rizzaffi it was she felt as if she were breathing soup whenever she left the hotel cooling moisture clung to her skin instead of evaporating as it did in drier climates she envied the race which did not sweat but panted ordinary males and females kept their hides dryexcept for contact with the clammy outside air she couldnt and if her sweat didnt evaporate she wasnt cooled or not to any great degree she not only breathed soup she might as well have been cooking in it the wild big uglies kept going out in the horrible weather again and again kassquit soon gave up they really were wild to get a look at everything they could and came back to the hotel talking about the strange animals and stranger plants they had seen their guide seemed downright smug about what an unusual place rizzaffi was kassquit recognized the difference between unusual and enjoyable the americans didnt seem to when sam yeager talked about the fibyen kassquit read about the animal and saw a picture of it at the terminal in her room having done that she knew more about it than he did hed seen one in the flesh and she hadnt but so what to her something on a monitor was as real as something seen in person how could it be otherwise when shed learned almost everything she knew about the universe outside her starship from the computer network almost everything she kept looking at the way jonathan and karen yeager formed a pair bond she eyed linda and tom de la rosa too but not so much and not in the same way when she looked at sam yeagers hatchling and his mate she kept thinking this could have been mine that it could have been hers was unlikely she knew as much but jonathan yeager had been her first sexual partnerher only sexual partner ttomalss had offered to bring other wild big ugly males up from the surface of tosev but she had always declined she could not keep them on the starship permanently and parting with them after forming an emotional bond hurt too much to contemplate shed done it once with jonathan and it had been knives in her spirit do it again do it again and again her hand shaped the negative gesture better not to form the bond in the first place so she thought anyway she also noticed karen yeager watching her she understood jealousy of course she understood it it gnawed at her whenever she saw jonathan and karen happy and comfortable together you have him i do not why are you jealous kassquit wondered because she hadnt been raised as a big ugly she needed a long time to see what a wild tosevite would have understood right away you have him but i had him once for a little while do you wonder if he wants me back she took a certain sour pleasure in noting those suspicious glances from the wild female tosevite she also realizedagain much more slowly than she might havewhy karen yeager had wanted her to put on wrappings to reduce her attractiveness males and females of the race could demonstrate such foolishness during mating season but happily did without it the rest of the year but big uglies as kassquit knew too well were always in season it complicated their lives she wondered how theyd ever managed to create any kind of civilization when they had that kind of handicap a good many members of the race remained convinced that the big uglies hadnt created any kind of civilization they were certain the tosevites had stolen everything they knew from the race that would have been more convincing if the big uglies hadnt fought the conquest fleet to a standstill when it first came to tosev kassquit had occasionally pointed this out to males and females who mocked the big ugliesmocked her in effect for what was she if not a big ugly by hatching they always seemed surprised when she did that they hadnt thought it through they knew they were superior they didnt have to think it through no one in rizzaffi had ever seen a big ugly before except in video wild or citizen of the empire didnt matter at the hotel the staff treated her about the same as the american tosevites she wasnt convinced the staff could tell the difference she didnt say anything about that she feared she would find out she was right she sat glumly in the refectory eating a supper that wasnt anything special the starship where shed lived for so long had had better food than this she didnt stop to remember that that food had mostly tosevite origins though after the colonization fleet arrived some of the meat and grain came from species native to home as often happened she was eating by herself the american big uglies did not invite her to join them to make matters worse they chattered among themselves in their own language so she couldnt even eavesdrop she told herself she didnt want to she knew she was lying and then a surprising thing happened one of the wild tosevites got up and came over to her table she had no trouble recognizing him thanks to his brown skin i greet you researcher he said politely and i greet you major coffey kassquit answered may i sit down the tosevite asked yes please do kassquit said then she asked a question of her own why do you want to to be sociable he replied that is the word is it not sociable that is the word yes kassquit made the affirmative gesture coffey sat down the table like most in the refectory had been adaptednot very wellto tosevite hindquarters and posture the wild big ugly said what do you think of rizzaffi not much kassquit answered at once that startled a laugh out of coffey she asked what is your opinion of this place about the same as yours he said when i was a hatchling i lived in the southeastern united states summers there are very warm and very humid but this city beats any i ever saw he added an emphatic cough to show rizzaffi was much worse than any other place he knew he used the races language in the same interesting way as sam yeager he spoke fluently but every once in a while an odd or offbeat phrase would come through kassquit suspected those were idioms the wild big uglies translated literally from their own language had they done it often it would have been annoying as things were piquant seemed the better word kassquit said as much major coffeys face showed amusement kassquit wished her own features made such responses but ttomalss hadntcouldnt haveresponded to her when she tried to learn to smile as a hatchling and the ability never developed coffey said so you find us worth a laugh then that is not what i meant kassquit said some of your ways of putting things would make fine additions to the language i thank you the wild big ugly said your language has certainly hatched many new words in english yes i can see how that might bewords for things you did not have before you met the race kassquit said many of those certainly coffey agreed but also others we sometimes say credit for instance when we mean money the first word he stressed was in the races language the second in his own he went on and we will often use an interrogative cough by itself when we want to say what do you mean or an emphatic cough to mean something like i should say so but that is a barbarism kassquit exclaimed the race has never used the coughs by themselves i know but we are not talking about the races language right now we are talking about english what would be a barbarism in your language is just new slang in ours english is a language that has always borrowed and adapted a lot from other tongues it has met how very strange kassquit said the races language is not like that no eh frank coffey laughed a noisy tosevite laugh what about ginger that is something the race did not have before it came to tosev kassquit said a little defensively even more defensively she added to me it would only be a spice biologically i am as much a tosevite as you are yes of course coffey laughed again on a different note back on tosev though i would not have expected to sit down to supper with a female without wrappings i will say that well you are not on tosev kassquit replied with some irritation i follow the empires customs not yours karen yeager already bothered me about this i say your view is foolishness you are the guests here the empire is your host if anything you should adapt to our customs not the other way round i was not complaining the wild big ugly said i was merely observing kassquit started to accept that in the polite spirit in which it seemed to have been offered then she stopped with her reply unspoken she sent frank coffey a sharp look how had he meant what hed just said was he making an observation or was he observing her and if he was observing her what did he have in mind what did she think about whatever he might have in mind those were both interesting questions since kassquit wasnt sure what she thought about whatever he might have in mind she decided she didnt need to know the answers right away without even noticing shed done it she made the affirmative gesture she didnt need to know this instant sure enough frank coffey would spend a lot of timeprobably the rest of his lifeon home and if he was interested and if she was interested they both might pass the time more pleasantly than if not or on the other hand they might quarrel no way to know ahead of time that helped make tosevite social relationships even more complicated than they would have been otherwise was the experiment worth attempting then she knew she was getting ahead of herself reading too much into what might have been a chance remark but she also knew tosevite males probably would show interest if an opportunity presented itself and she knew she probably would too compared to tosevite males tosevite females might be less aggressive compared to the race she was a tosevite no doubt about it atvar watched with a certain wry amusement as the shuttlecraft returned from rizzaffi nothing could have persuaded him to go there he knew better you could come down with a skin fungus just by sticking your snout outdoors the place made much of tosev seem pleasant by comparison he wondered if suggesting they visit rizzaffi had been an insult of sorts one too subtle for them to understand that was risky sam yeager had a feeling for such things atvar shrugged hed find out one after another the big uglies came off the shuttlecraft even from the terminal atvar had no trouble recognizing kassquit because she did not wear wrappings the way the wild tosevites did she was a strange creature as much like a female of the race as a big ugly could be the more atvar got to know her the more he wondered if she came close enough if all the big uglies on tosev were like her would they make satisfactory citizens of the empire he sighed he really couldnt say she remained essentially tosevite essentially different in a way the rabotevs and hallessi didnt with them cultural similarity overwhelmed biological differences they were variations on a theme also expressed in the race big uglies werent no matter what cultural trappings were painted on them they remained different underneath here they came the wild ones and kassquit on a cart that had its seats adapted to their shape the cart stopped just outside the terminal a gate opened the tosevites hurried inside atvar walked forward after all these years dealing with big uglies he still had trouble telling one from another here he had trained himself to look for sam yeagers white head fur if the tosevite ever put on a hat atvar wasnt sure he could pick him out from the others as things were though he managed i greet you ambassador he said and i greet you fleetlord yeager replied i still find it very strange to be called by that title do you understand perhaps atvar said life does not always give us what we expect though consider my surprise when the conquest fleet came to tosev and i discovered we would not have a walkover on our hands sam yeager let out several yips of barking tosevite laughter there you have me fleetlord and i admit it you must have found that a lot stranger than i find this to tell you the truth i was never so horrified in all my life atvar said and sam yeager laughed again the former head of the conquest fleet asked and what did you think of rizzaffi interesting place to visit yeager said drylynot the fitting word not when speaking of the port city i would not care to live there only someone addled in the eggshell would atvar said i marvel that you chose to visit the place at all there now hed said it he could try to find out if someone really had insulted the big uglies by suggesting they go there but sam yeager shrugged and said it is an unusual part of your planet well that is a truth by the spirits of emperors past atvar used an emphatic cough fair enough the tosevite ambassador said i for one would like to see unusual places we will see enough of the ordinary while we are here and if the unusual is not always pleasantwe can leave and i am glad we have left but i am also glad we went if you go to rizzaffi with that attitude you will do all right atvar said if you go to rizzaffi with any other attitudeany other attitude at all mind youyou will want to run away as fast as you can not so bad as that yeager said it does have some interesting animals in the neighborhood that fibyen is a queerlooking beast is it not well yes atvar admitted but i would not go to rizzaffi for interesting animals alone if i wanted to see interesting animals i would go to the zoo that way i would not grow mildew all over my scales he got another loud tosevite laugh from sam yeager when i put on corrective lenses outside to see something up close they steamed over yeager said i am not surprised atvar replied when you go back to your hotel we will talk of things more interesting than rizzaffi the emperor himself has taken an interest in your being here you know he cast down his eye turrets we are honored of course yeager said polite or ironic atvar couldnt tell the big ugly went on he probably wants to figure out the smoothest way to get rid of us just like the rest of you no such thing atvar had to work hard not to show how appalled he was was the race so transparent to tosevites if it was it was also in a lot of trouble or was that just sam yeager proving once again that he could think along with the race as if he had scales and eye turrets and a tailstump atvar dared hope so other big uglies often didnt listen to yeager no matter how right he usually proved now he asked is there any chance i might have an audience with the emperor myself would you like to atvar said in surprise and sam yeager made the affirmative gesture for all the world as if he were a male of the race the fleetlord replied i cannot arrange that you must submit a request to the court the courtiers and the emperor himself will make the final decision i see yeager eyed atvar in a way that made him uncomfortable despite the big uglys alien nearly unreadable features i suspect a recommendation from someone of fleetlords rank would not hurt in getting my request accepted yeager said shrewdly or am i wrong no you are not wrong influence matters regardless of the world atvar said i will make that recommendation on your behalf if it is accepted you will have to learn some fairly elaborate ceremonial i can do that i think sam yeager said and i thank you for your kindness i expect you will want something for it one of these days which is only right i will do what i can to arrange that influence runs both ways after all we have a saying you scratch my back and i will scratch yours i understand your meaning atvar said this saves me the trouble of raising such a delicate topic i am glad yeager said and that was irony i also hope the emperor will be kind enough to forgive any breaches of protocol i might accidentally commit i am only an ignorant alien who knows no better had any other alien ever known so much about the race atvar had his doubts he said yes there is precedent for such forgiveness from the days when the first rabotevs and hallessi came to reverence sovereigns long ago well i am very glad to hear it the big ugly said what is the usual penalty for botching the rituals in front of the emperor he would not cast down his eyes when he named the sovereign that proved him foreigna word the race hadnt had to think about for a long time before invading tosev it also irritated atvar no end with a certain sour amusement then he answered traditionally it is being thrown to the beasts there he took sam yeager by surprise is it he said forgive me for saying so but that strikes me as a trifle drastic he paused what are the beasts these wicked males and females are thrown to you are too clever atvar said in the ancientest days long before home was unified they were sdanlilarge fierce predators ever since though they have been courtiers in sdanliskin masks who tell the incompetent wretches what fools and idiots they are and how they did not deserve their audiences really sam yeager asked atvar made the affirmative gesture the wild big ugly laughed i like that it is very symbolic just so atvar said the pain perhaps is less than that of actually being devoured but the humiliation remains males and females have been known to slay themselves in shame after such a session with the courtiers for most of them of course one audience with the emperorhe cast down his eye turretsis all they will ever have and is or would be the high point of their lives when it suddenly becomes the low point instead they can think only of escape an audience with the emperor would in a sense be wasted on a wild big ugly he wouldnt appreciate the honor granted him without a hundred thousand years of tradition behind it what would it mean to him a meeting with a sovereign not his own a meeting with a sovereign he reckoned no more than equal to his own back on tosev atvar had had to pretend he believed the big uglies notemperors to be of the same rank as the emperor here on home he didnt have to go through that farce but for sam yeager it was no farce it was a truth the big ugly said well you would not have to worry about that with me no i suppose not atvar said yeager had just gone a long way toward confirming his own thoughts of a moment before even so the fleetlord went on i will as i said support your request if you like how the courtiers and the emperor respond to it though is not within the grip of my fingerclaws i would be very grateful for your support fleetlord very grateful indeed yeager used an emphatic cough back on tosev the races ambassador would meet with my notemperor only seems fair to turn things around here he truly did believe a wild big ugly chosen for a limited term by an absurd process of snoutcounting matched in importance the ruler of three and a half inhabited planets spread over four solar systems ah but if the emperor had only ruled four planets since he didnt atvar had to put up with yeagers provincial arrogance again ambassador i will do what i can on your behalf maybe the emperor would reject the idea but maybe he wouldnt he was certainly interested in the big uglies and concerned about them atvar suspected the audience if granted would not be publicized too many males and females would envy the big ugly yeager said you know we american big uglieshe used the races slang for his species without selfconsciousnesshave a literature imagining technological achievements of which we are not yet capable i have heard that yes atvar replied why do you mention it now because there are times when my being here on home feels as if it came from one of those stories the tosevite said if i were to meet the emperor of another intelligent species how could it seem like anything but what we call science fiction he laughed i probably should not tell you that i am sure the doctor never would have said anything so undiplomatic you are honest you are candid atvar said and no matter how well you can think like one of us you are not and i fear never will be after some little while on home karen yeager was getting used to being stared at whenever she went out on the streets of sitneff the lizards didnt come right up and harass her and jonathan and the de la rosas but eye turrets always swiveled toward the humans some males and females would exclaim and point karen didnt like it but she supposed it was inevitable sometimes she stared right backmostly at the males and females who wore wigs and tshirts and sometimes even shorts shorts ventilated for their tailstumps did they have any idea how ridiculous they looked probably about as ridiculous as humans with shaved heads and body paint but she didnt dwell on that and then one day like the most curious lizard she was pointing and exclaiming at the little green manthat was what he looked likecoming out of a shop look she exclaimed in english a halless she felt as if shed spotted a rare and exotic species of bird the halless was about as tall as a lizard which meant he came up to her chest he was the green of romaine lettuce though his hide was scaly not leafy he stood more nearly erect than lizards did his feet were wide and flat his handsonly three fingers and a thumb on eachspidery and delicate like the rabotev shuttlecraft pilot theyd met he had a shorter snout than did males and females of the race unlike the rabotevs and the lizards he had ears long pointed ones set high up on his round head his eyes were on stalks longer than those of the rabotevs and could look in different directions at the same time none of the lizards paid any special attention to him they were used to hallessi he stared at the humans with as much curiosity as the members of the race showed in a high thin squeaky voice he said i greet you tosevites and we greet you halless karen answered wondering what she sounded like to him may i ask your name wakonafula he answered which didnt sound like a handle a lizard would carry and you are karen gave her name so did her husband and tom and linda de la rosa they seemed willing to let her do the talking so she did we have never met anyone from your world before can you tell us what it is like wakonafula made the negative gesture i am sorry but i cannot not from personal experience i was hatched here on home as were several generations of my ancestors i have seen videos of halless but i suppose you will have done that too and i have also seen videos of tosev how can you possibly exist on such a miserably cold wet world it does not seem that way to us tom de la rosa said we are evolved to find it normal to us home is a miserably hot dry world that strikes me as very strange wakonafula said when it is so pleasant here but as you say you are adapted to conditions on tosev however nasty they may be why did your ancestors leave their planet and come to home karen asked a fair number of students come here from halless and also from rabotev for that matterfor courses not available on other worlds the halless answered home still has the best universities in the empire even after all these millennia and some students having completed their work choose to stay here instead of going back into cold sleep and back to the worlds where they hatched we are citizens of the empire too after all back when india belonged to britain and not to the race some of its bright youngsters had traveled halfway around the world to study at oxford and cambridge not all of them went back to their homeland once their studies were done either some stayed in london and formed an indian community there funny to think that the same sort of thing could happen so many lightyears from earth may i ask you a question linda de la rosa asked now wakonafula used the affirmative gesture speak he urged i thank you linda said does it not trouble you that home has the best universities if your folk ruled halless instead of the colonists from home would it not have the very best of everything trir the humans lizard guide spluttered indignantly she sounded like an angry tea kettle karen had trouble blaming her if linda wasnt preaching sedition she was coming mighty close but wakonafula said you have asked several questions not one let me answer like this if it were not for the race we would still be barbarians we would die of diseases we easily cure today thanks to the race we would go to war with one another our planet had several rival empires when the conquest fleet came thanks to the race we live at peace if halless is not equal to home in every wayand it is not as far as i can tell from hereit is far closer than it was before the conquest in the fullness of time it will catch up he sounded calmly confident in the fullness of time how many humans had ever had the patience to wait for the fullness of time the race did back on earth the lizards had always insisted that hallessi and rabotevs thought more like them than like humans judging by wakonafula they had a point humans commonly preferred kicking over the apple cart now to waiting for the fullness of time on the other hand how reliable was wakonafula was he a chancemet hallessi as he seemed to be or was he a plant primed to tell the big uglies what the race wanted them to hear how could anyone be sure that was a good question karen knew she had no certain answer for it if you will excuse me i must be on my way the halless said now and left yes he might well have hadprobably did havebusiness of his own to take care of but that casual departure roused karens suspicions and then trir said you see that all species within the empire are happy to be a part of it once roused karens suspicions soared this was pretty clumsy propagandabut then the lizards never had been as smooth about such things as people were more than a little annoyed she said i am very sorry but i do not see anything of the sort how could you not the guide asked in what sounded like genuine surprise the halless said i heard what he said karen broke in but his saying it does not have to make it a truth he could easily have received instructions from superiors about what he was to tell us that is a shocking suggestion trir exclaimed karens husband made the negative gesture i do not think so jonathan yeager said such things happen all the time on tosev no reason they should not happen here as well why should we resort to such trickery trir asked to make us believe things in the empire are better than they really are karen said do you not agree that would be to your advantage trir let out an indignant hiss i will not even dignify such a claim with a response its foolishness must be as obvious to you as it is to me was there any point to arguing more reluctantly karen decided there wasnt the lizard was not going to admit anything maybe trir really didnt see there was anything to admit karen wouldnt have been surprised only saddened to find that was so plenty of humans couldnt see their superiors ulterior motives either and the guide also seemed perturbed saying perhaps we should go back to the hotel that way no more unfortunate incidents can take place this was not unfortunate this was interesting tom de la rosa said we learned something about the hallessi and something about the empire and if we didnt learn exactly what you wanted us to well too bad karen thought but trir was unlikely to see things like that a genuinely unfortunate incident did happen not long before they got to the hotel a lizard skittered up to them and said you things are what they call big uglies right you are not hallessi or rabotevs noyou cannot be i know what they look like and you do not look like that you must be big uglies go away do not bother these individuals trir said sharply it is not a bother karen yeager said yes we are from tosev why do you ask ginger the stranger added an emphatic cough you must have some of the herb i will buy it from you i will give you whatever you want for it tell me what that is and i will pay it i am not a poor male another emphatic cough such things had happened before but never with such naked obvious desperate longing i am sorry karen said but we have no ginger you must the lizard exclaimed you must i will go madutterly mad i tell youif i do not get what i need police the guide shouted hissing out a string of curses the lizard who wanted drugs scurried away trir said please ignore that males disgraceful conduct it is abnormal depraved and altogether disgusting you should never have been exposed to it we know about the race and ginger karen said the problem on tosev is far larger and far worse than it is here impossible trir declared proving lizards could be parochial too not only not impossible but a truth karen said and tacked on an emphatic cough rememberon our home planet ginger is cheap and easily available a large number of colonists there use it in fact it is beginning to change the entire society of the race there a drug what a ridiculous notion you must be lying to me on purpose trir said angrily she is not now jonathan yeager used an emphatic cough remember ginger brings females into their season if females are continuously in season males also come into season continuously on tosev the races sexuality has grown much more like ours the guides tailstump quivered in agitation that is the most disgusting thing i have ever heard in my life which does not mean that it is anything but a truth karen said a little investigation on your computer network will prove as much i do not believe it trir said in a voice like a slamming door karen did not believe the lizard would do any investigating among the race as among humans clinging to what one was already sure of was easier and more satisfying than finding out for oneself trir pointed and here is the hotel here is where i can get rid of you and your dangerous ideas theres no place like home karen said in english her husband and the de la rosas laughed trir was bewildered since karen was annoyed at her she didnt bother translating and left the lizard that way the scooters aboard the admiral peary easily outdid the ones the lewis and clark had carried the little rockets had the advantage of thirty years development in electronics motors and materials they were lighter stronger faster and better than the ones glen johnson had used in the asteroid belt they carried more fuel too so he could travel farther in principle though they remained the same they had identical rocket motors at front and back and smaller maneuvering jets all around get one pointed the way you wanted it to go accelerate get near where you were going use the nose rocket to decelerate the same amount and there you were easy as pie in theory of course lots of things that were easy in theory turned out to be something else again in reality this was one of those even with radar gauging distances and vectors and burn times wasnt easy but johnson had started as a marine pilot flying pistonengined fighters against the race hed been shot down twice and still carried a burn scar on his right arm as a souvenir of those insane days if he hadnt been recovering from his wounds when the fighting stopped he would have gone up againand likely got shot down again this time permanently life for human pilots during the invasion had been nasty brutish and almost always short and johnson had done as much patrol flying in earth orbit as any man around before joining the crew of the lewis and clark and hed taken a scooter from the lewis and clark to one rock in the asteroid belt or another and from rock to rock as well if any human being was qualified to fly one while orbiting home he was the man he discovered spacesuit design had changed while he was in cold sleep too the changes werent major but the helmet was less crowded instruments were easier to read and there were fewer sharp edges and angles on which he could bang his head all of this was the sort of thing the lizards would have done automatically before they ever let anybody into a spacesuit people didnt work that way if things werent perfect people went ahead regardless that was why the admiral peary had got to the tau ceti systemand why the doctor hadnt testingone two three johnson said into his radio mike do you read read you five by five scooter a voice replied in his ear do you read me also five by five johnson said ready to be launched roger the outer door to the air lock opened johnson used the maneuvering jets to ease the scooter out of the lock and away from the ship only after he was safely clear of the admiral peary did he fire up the rocket at the stern it gave him a little weight or accelerations simulation of weight he guided the scooter toward the closest lizard spaceship calling the horned akiss he said into his radio mike an akiss was a legendary creature among the raceclose enough to a dragon for government work horned akiss made a pretty good name for a military spacecraft which that one was repeatcalling the horned akiss this is the admiral peary s numberone scooter requesting permission to approach as previously arranged permission granted a lizards voice sounded in his ear approach air lock number three repeatnumber three to guide him red and yellow lights came on around the designated air lock the lizard continued remember you and your scooter will be searched before you are permitted into the ship i understand johnson said the males and females aboard the lizards ship werent worried about weapons if he tried a treacherous attack on the horned akiss the rest of the races ships would go after the admiral peary what they were worried about was ginger smuggling the radar and computer would have told johnson when to make his deceleration burn and for how longif hed paid any attention to them he did it by eye and feel instead and got what was for all practical purposes the same result the scooter lay motionless relative to the air lock when the outer door opened he eased the scooter inside with the maneuvering jets the same way as hed brought it out of the admiral peary s air lock behind him the outer door closed the lizard on the radio said you may now remove your spacesuit for search before johnson did he checked to make sure the pressure in the air lock was adequate the lizard hadnt been lying to him even so he was cautious as he broke the seal on his face plate and ready to slam it shut again if things werent as they seemed they were the air the race breathed had a smaller percentage of oxygen than the earthly atmosphere but the overall pressure was a little higher so things evened out he could smell the lizards a faint slightly musky odor not unpleasant the horned akiss crew probably didnt even know it was there when he got back to the admiral peary hed smell people the same way for a little while till his nose got used to them again the inner airlock door opened two lizards glided in moving at least as smoothly weightless as humans did we greet you one of them said nowout of that suit he added an emphatic cough i obey johnson said under the suit he wore a tshirt and shorts he could have gone naked for all the race cared the lizards in charge of security had long wands they used to sniff out ginger one went over the spacesuit the other johnson and the scooter only after no alarm lights came on did johnson ask are you satisfied now moderately so answered the one whod examined him we will still xray the scooter to make sure you have not secreted away some of the herb in the tubing but for now you may enter the horned akiss if you prove to be smuggling you will not be allowed to leave i thank you so much johnson exclaimed and used an emphatic cough and i greet you too both lizards mouths fell open in silent toothy laughs johnson was laughing too hed visited the races spacecraft before their searches were always as thorough as this one they didnt know whether the admiral peary had ginger aboard they didnt believe in taking chances though together they said we greet you we like you if you are carrying the herb we will like you too well to let you leave as we have said otherwise welcome except for that mrs lincoln how did you like the play johnson thought wryly i thank you so very much he repeated tacking on another emphatic cough for good measure he also bent into the posture of respect that made the lizards laugh again you are more sarcastic than you have any business being one of them said oh no johnson used the races negative gesture you are mistaken this is normal for big uglies they laughed one more time no wonder your species is so much trouble said the one whod spoken before no wonder at all johnson agreed now come ontake me to your leader he did some laughing of his own i always wanted to say that neither of the lizards got the joke but they understood irony as well as he did both of them assumed the posture of respect they chorused it shall be done superior big ugly as a matter of fact by their body paint and his own eagles johnson did outrank them it was pretty damn funny any which way and they did take him to their leader the corridors in the horned akiss were narrower and lower than those aboard the admiral peary not surprising not when lizards were smaller than people the handholds were of a slightly different shape and set at distances johnson found oddly inconvenient but he managed with minimal difficulty the laws of the universe operated in the same way for the lizards as they did for mankind the differences between spacecraft were in the details the broad brush strokes remained the same medium spaceship commander henreps office even reminded johnson of lieutenant general charles healeys it had the same sense of carefully constrained order henrep looked even more like a snapping turtle than healey did too but he couldnt help ithe was hatched that way fixing johnson with both eyes he asked what is the real purpose of this visit friendship johnson answered nothing but friendship an overrated concept henrep declaredyes he did have a good deal in common with healey johnson used the negative gesture again i think you are mistaken superior sir the race is going to have to learn to get along with wild tosevites and wild tosevites are going to have to learn to get along with the race if we do not we will destroy each other and neither side would benefit from that henrep remained unimpressed the race can certainly destroy your species just as certainly you cannot destroy us you can no doubt ruin tosev you can perhaps damage home you cannot harm halless or rabotev the empire would be wounded yes but even at the worst it would go on that is the situation as we here know it now yes johnson replied but how do you know my notempire has not sent starships to rabotev and halless to attack their inhabited planets in case of trouble elsewhere between your kind and mine are you sure that is not so by the way henrep glowered the only thing he was sure of was that he couldnt stand the human floating in front of him his tailstump quivering with anger he said that would be vicious and brutal beyond belief so it would so would destroying us johnson said we can do each other a lot of damage that is why it would be better to live as friends it would have been better to destroy you before you had any chance of threatening us henrep said angrily he not only acted like lieutenant general healey he thought like him too maybe it wouldthough i would not agree with that johnson said but it is much too late to worry about that now and so superior sir friendship a phone on henreps desk hissed before he could tell johnson just where to put his friendship the lizard listened spoke a quick agreement and hung up one of his eyes swung back to johnson you have no ginger he sounded almost as accusing as if the human had tried to smuggle twenty tons of the herb i could have told you that i did tell you that so you did but you are a big ugly that makes you a liar until proved otherwise henreps second eye turret moved toward johnson how long do you think your slow homely excuse for a ship could survive if we really went after it long enough to smash up your planet superior sir johnson turned what should have been a title of respect into one of contempt and if you do not believe me you are welcome to find out for yourself henrep sputtered like a leaky pot with a tight lid over a hot fire johnson swallowed a sigh so much for friendship he thought jonathan yeager held up a hand the guide waggled an eye turret in his direction to tell him he might speak he asked how old did you say that building back there was why did you not pay closer attention when i spoke before trir snapped well excuse my ignorance jonathan said in english karen said whats her problem shes supposed to be telling us whats what thats her job if we want to find out more she should be happy beats me jonathan said also in english that didnt seem to suit trir either the guide said why do you not speak a language a civilized person can understand maybe i will jonathan answered returning to the races tongue when i see you acting like a civilized person trir sputtered and hissed indignantly thats telling her tom de la rosa said in english his wife nodded karen said i think we all need to behave ourselves better she used the language of the race and looked right at trir the guide made a gesture jonathan had not seen before one obviously full of annoyance you big uglies have to be the most foolish species ever to imagine itself intelligent she said do you not even understand what is going on around you all the humans exchanged confused looks it could be that we do not jonathan said perhaps you would be generous enough to explain the situationwhatever the situation isto us that produced an exasperated snort from trir that such things should be necessary she muttered and then reluctantly used the affirmative gesture oh very well there does seem to be no help for it can you not sense that along with other females in this region i am approaching the mating season this is its effect on my behavior before long the males scent receptors will start noting our pheromones and then life will be hectic for a little while oh jonathan said the lizards went through mating seasons on earth too but there were so many gingertasters there that the rhythm of their life wasnt so well defined as it was here on home he went on apologies i did not know it your pheromones mean nothing to us you know tosevites trir said more to herself he judged than to him she gathered herself well that is the situation if you cannot adjust to it do not blame me she still sounded far more irritable than lizards usually did jonathan said we will try to adjust perhaps you should do the same if that is possible for you of course it is possible trir sounded furious how dare you presume it is anything but possible well if it is suppose you tell me once more how old that building back there is jonathan said if you had been listening but the lizard caught herself oh very well since you insist it was built in the reign of the th emperor rekrap more than seven thousand years agofairly recently then fairly recently jonathan echoed oh yes superior female truth seven thousand of the races years were about thirtyfive hundred of earths so that building wasnt older than the pyramids it was about the same age as stonehenge old as the hills as far as mankind was concerned nothing special not to the race tom de la rosa asked what are the oldest buildings in this city here in sitneff trir said most of the construction here dates from modern times this is a region with some seismic activitynot a lot but some few of the structures here go back much beyond twentyfive thousand years all the humans started to laugh frank coffey said even dividing by two thats not what i call modern he spoke in english but tacked on an emphatic cough just the same and he wasnt wrong what had people been doing years ago hunting and gatheringthat was it they were just starting to filter down into the americas the latest hightech weapons system was the bow and arrow they might have domesticated the dog on the other hand they might not have too no one on earth knew how to plant a crop or read or write or get any kind of metal out of a rock and the race the race by then had already conquered the rabotevs lizards were living on epsilon eridani as well as tau ceti life here on home had changed only in details in refinements since then theyre still doing the same things they did back then and doing them the same old way pretty much jonathan thought us we got from nowhere to here and we got here under our own power trir looked at things differently it is because rebuilding is sometimes necessary in this part of the world that sitneff enjoys so few traditions it is part of the present but unfortunately not really part of the past as the humans laughed again the guides eye turrets swung from one of them to the next do i see that you are dubious about what i have said laughing still jonathan said well superior female it all depends on what you mean by the past back on tosev our whole recorded history is only about ten thousands of your years old that made trirs mouth drop open in a laugh of her own how very curious she said perhaps that accounts for some of your semibarbarous behavior maybe it does jonathan said he thought trirs rudeness was at least semibarbarous but he was willing to let it pass this wasnt his planet after all linda de la rosa saw things differently what sort of behavior do you call it when you insult the guests you are supposed to be guiding we did not need nearly as long as you did to learn to travel among the stars and we deserve all proper respect for that she finished with an emphatic cough trirs nictitating membranes flicked back and forth across her eyes a gesture of complete astonishment how dare you speak to me that way she demanded i speak to you as one equal to another as one equal telling another she has shown bad manners linda de la rosa answered if you do not care for that behave better you will not have the problem any more in that case i promise you how can you be so insolent trirs tailstump quivered furiously maybe i am a semibarbarian as you say maybe i just recognize one when i hear one linda told her that didnt make trir any happier in tones colder than the weather even at homes south pole she said i think it would be an excellent idea to return to your lodgings now i also think it would be an excellent idea to furnish you with a new guide one more tolerant of your vagaries they walked back to the hotel in tense silence trir said nothing about any of the buildings they passed the race might have signed its declaration of independence in one and its constitution in the next if it had the humans heard not a word about it the buildings remained no more than piles of stone and concrete whatever had happened in them in days gone by whatever might be happening in them now would remain forever mysteriousat least if the humans had to find out from trir and things did not improve once jonathan and the rest of the americans got back to the hotel a sort of tension was in the air trir was far from the only snappy peevish lizard jonathan saw the scaly crests between the eyes of males crests that normally lay flat began to come up in display nobodys going to want to pay any attention to us for the next few weeks jonathan said to karen after they went up to their room she nodded sure does look that way doesnt it they arent going to pay attention to anything but screwing themselves silly which is what they always say we do jonathan added with any luck at all the lizards snooping and translating would be embarrassedif the jamming let their bugs pick up anything either they dont know us as well as they think they do or they dont know themselves as well as they think they do maybe karen answered or maybe they just took their data from you when you were in your twenties ha jonathan said dont i wish he paused then added what i really wish is that i could do half now of what i did then of course theres not a guy my age who wouldnt say that men karen said not altogether unkindly you just have to make up in technique what you lose in ah enthusiasm is that what it is jonathan said she nodded in an experimental way he stepped toward her the experiment proved successful enough that after a little while they lay down on the sleeping mat together some time after that he asked well did i did you what karens voice was lazy make up in technique what ive lost in enthusiasm she poked him in the ribs well what do you think besides you seemed enthusiastic enough to me good later after they were both dressed again karen remarked the funny thing is we talk about sex even more than we do it the lizards she shook her head they talk about it even less than they do it its like they try to forget about mating season when it isnt happening hell they do forget about it when it isnt happening jonathan said if something had happened to the colonization fleet so it never got to earth the males from the conquest fleet wouldnt have cared if they never mated again poor bastards without the pheromones it just doesnt matter to them that isnt quite what i meant they dont write novels about what goes on during mating season or plays or songs or much of anything they dont care not the way we do jonathan thought that over slowly he said when theyre not in the mating season they dont care about sex at all he held up a hasty hand yes i know you just said that i wasnt done when they are in the season they dont care about anything else theyre too busy doing it to want to write about it or sing about it maybe karen said jonathan suddenly laughed she sent him a quizzical look he said back on earth if they keep using ginger the way they were they really will get to where theyre a little horny all the time the way we are i wonder if they will start writing about it then back there and what the lizards here on home will think of them if they do probably that theyre a bunch of perverts karen said they already think that about us yeah i know you old pervert you jonathan said but we have fun atvar tried to keep his mind on the discussion sam yeager had presented some serious proposals on ways in which the race and the wild big uglies could hope to keep the peace both back on tosev and in the solar systems that made up the empire hed also pointed out the obvious once more now that the big uglies had interstellar travel of their own trade with the empire would take on a new footing the race would have to start taking steps to accommodate tosevite starships those were important points certain males and females here on home had realized as much years earlier nothing had been done about that realization though no one seemed to know when or if anything would be taken care of nothing moved quickly here nothing had had to not for millennia but anyone who delayed while dealing with the big uglies would be sorry and in short order atvar knew that he made the point whenever he could and as forcefully as he could hardly anybody seemed to want to listen to him and he had trouble listening to sam yeager right now the scales on his crest kept twitching up they were not under his conscious control he had pheromones in the scent receptors on his tongue next to that ordinary business even important ordinary business seemed pallid stuff at last when he realized he hadnt heard the last three points the wild big ugly had brought up he raised a hand i am sorry ambassador he said i am very sorry indeed but even for an old male like me mating season is here i cannot keep my mind on business while i smell females we can take this up again when the madness subsides if that is all right with you sam yeager laughed in the loud barking tosevite way and we can take it up again when the madness subsides even if that is not all right with me he said the race may not have mating on its mind most of the year but you sure make up for lost time when you do ruefully atvar made the affirmative gesture that is a truth ambassador it is not a truth we are particularly proud of but it is a truth you do not offend me you are what you are the big ugly said i will remind you that you needed much longer to say the same thing about us that is also a truth atvar admitted and it is a truth that your habits still strike us as unhealthy and repulsive but your biology has made you what you are as ours has done with us we can accept that what is particularly unhealthy and repulsive to us is the way ginger has made us begin to imitate your sexual patterns our biology has not adapted us to be continuously interested in mating well you can borrow some of our forms from us sam yeager replied back on tosev you already seem to have discovered the idea of marriageand the idea of prostitution the two key words were in english the language of the race had no short exact term for either atvar had heard both english words often enough before going into cold sleep to know what they meant he despised the words and the concepts behind them the race had brought civilization to the rabotevs and the hallessiand to the tosevites what could be more humiliating than borrowing ways to live from barbarians nothing he could think of but right now he could hardly think at alland he did not much want to either if you will excuse me he said and rose from his chair and hurried out of the conference chamber somewhere not far away a female was ready to mate that was all he needed to know he turned his head now this way now that seeking the source of that wonderful alluring odor it was stronger that way he hurried down a corridor his hands spread stretching out his fingerclaws as far as they would go males often brawled during mating season some of the brawls were fatal penalties for such affrays were always light and often suspended everyone understood that such things happened under the influence of pheromones it was too bad but what could you do there there she was and there was another malea miserable creature by his body paint a hotel nutritionist second classheaded for her atvar hissed furiously of their own accord the scales that made up his crest lifted themselves from the top of his head that was partly display for the females sake partly a threat gesture aimed at the hotel nutritionist go away the nutritionist said hissing angrily instead of answering with words atvar leaped at him ready to claw and bite and do whatever he had to do to make his rival retreat the hotel nutritionist was much younger but not very spirited he snapped halfheartedly as atvar came forward but then turned and fled without making a real fight of it atvar let out a triumphant snort he turned back to the female now he said urgently and now it was she bent before him her tailstump twisted to one side out of the way he poised himself above and behind her their cloacas joined pleasure shot through him still driven by the pheromones in the air atvar would have coupled again but the female skittered away enough she said you have done what you needed to do i have not yet done everything i want to do atvar said the female ignored him he hadnt expected anything different he might have hoped but he hadnt expected and his own mating drive was less urgent than it had been in his younger days he trotted off if that hotel nutritionist second class made a sufficiently aggressive display to this female he might yet get a chance to mate with her but my sperm are still in the lead atvar thought smugly he went out into the street it was chaos there as hed thought it would be males and females coupled on the sidewalk and even in the middle of traffic sometimes males overwhelmed by pheromones would leap out of their vehicles and join females or females in cars and trucks would see a mating display and be so stimulated that they would stop their machines get out and assume the mating position in the middle of the road accidents always skyrocketed at this time of year along with the brawls it was no wonder that the race didnt care to think about the mating season when it finally ended males and females simply were not themselves and they knew it who would want to remember a time like this let alone celebrate the mating urge the way the big uglies did incomprehensible atvar coupled with another female out in front of the hotel then sated for the moment he watched the show all around him it was interesting for the time being but he knew he was pheromoneaddled when the pheromones wore off so would the appeal of the spectacle overhead a pair of squazeffi flew by they were conjoined a lot of creatures mated at this time of year that way the eggs the females laid would hatch in the springtime when the chance for hatchlings survival was highest like other flying creatures on home they had long necks beaky mouths full of teeth and bare membranous wings with claws on the forward margin their hides were a safe sensible greenbrown not much different from the color of his own skin tosev had nothing like squazeffi similar animals had once existed there but were millions of years extinct instead the dominant fliers there were gaudy creatures with feathers atvar had never got used to birds not in all the time hed spent on the big uglies homeworld they looked more like something a gifted but strange videogame designer might imagine than anything real or natural he wondered what the tosevites thought of squazeffi and other proper flying things if he still remembered to ask after mating seasonby no means certain not with the pheromones addling himhe would have to ask them in the meantime in the meantime he ambled back into the hotel a big uglythe dark brown one named coffeywalked past him like rabotevs and hallessi the tosevite was oblivious to the pheromones filling the air around him he said i greet you exalted fleetlord as if atvar werent thinking more of females than of anything else the fleetlord managed to reply and i greet you frank coffey smelled like a tosevitea strange odor to a male of the race but not one to which to pay much attention during mating season then atvar spotted trir the guide saw him at the same time his crest flared erect he straightened into a display a male used only at this time of year trir might not have intended to mate with him but the visual cues from his display had the same effect on her as females pheromones had on him she bent into the mating posture he hurried around behind her and completed the act after his hiss of pleasure she hurried away frank coffey had paused to watch the brief coupling may i ask you a question exalted fleetlord he said ask still feeling some of the delight hed known during the mating act atvar was inclined to be magnanimous how does the race get anything done during mating season the wild big ugly inquired that is a good question atvar answered females too old to lay eggs help keep things going and there are a few males who poor fellows do not respond to pheromones rabotevs and hallessi are useful in this role too now that we can bring them back here they have mating seasons of their own of course but we do not need to take those into account here as much as we do on their home planets i suppose not coffey said and then thoughtfully i wonder how many intelligent species have mating seasons and how many mate all through the year until we got to know about you tosevites we thought all such species were like the race atvar said the first two we came to know certainly were so we thought it was a rule now though the tally stands at three species with seasons and one without i would have to say this sample is too small to be statistically significant i would say you are bound to be right the tosevite looked up toward the ceilingno up beyond the ceiling as his next words proved i wonder how many intelligent species the galaxy holds who can guess atvar said we have probed several stars like home with no planets at all and one other with a world that supports life but is even colder and less pleasant for us than tosev not worth colonizing in our judgment one of these days we will find another inhabited world and conquer it suppose someone else finds the empire coffey asked atvar shrugged that has not happened in all the history of the race and by now our radio signals have spread across most of the galaxy no one from beyond has come looking for us yet he swung his eye turrets toward the wild big ugly i think we would do better to worry about the species with which we are already acquainted coffey did not presume to disagree with him most of the time the race mocked tosevite sexuality for a small stretch of each year though males and females here far outdid the wildest of wild big uglies in sheer carnality kassquit had seen two mating seasons before this one they astonished and appalled her the creatures shed thought she knew turned into altogether different beings for a little while she had seen mating behavior in the starship orbiting tosev after the colonization fleet brought females to her homeworld some of those females had come into season on their own others gingertasters had had chemical help that was disruptive enough as their pheromones sent males all over the ship into heat but this this was a world gone mad and it was a madness of which she had no part the race scorned tosevite sexuality yes kassquit knew that only too well shed been on the receiving end of such comments more times than she could count back in the starship orbiting tosev she hadnt heard so many since waking up on home it wasnt that males and females here were more polite if anything the reverse was true but a lot of them were simply ignorant of how big uglies worked for the time being kassquit could have done the mocking males and females coupled on the streets they coupled in the middle of the streets males brawling over females clawed and bit one another till they bled yes kassquit could have done the mockinghad she found anyone to listen to her the race paid no attention right now males and females were too busy joining to worry about anything else later once the females pheromones wore off everyone would try to pretend the mating season had never happened kassquit had already seen that and once the females pheromones had worn off males and females would go back to disparaging the tosevites for their lascivious and disgusting habits shed seen that too now though she could talk with the american big uglies they hadnt come down to the surface of home when she watched the two previous mating seasons the server in the hotel refectory was a female she skittered about as if shed tasted too much ginger but kassquit did not think that was the problem unless she was wrong the female had to hurry to get her work done before some male interrupted her to frank coffey kassquit said this is a difficult time truth the wild big ugly laughed we tosevites do not do things like this the race must think about nothing but mating what a perverse and depraved sexuality its males and females must have for a moment kassquit thought he was serious in spite of that laugh he sounded exactly like a pompous male grumbling about the big uglies then she realized he had to be joking no matter how serious he sounded that made the jest all the more delicious she laughed too at first the way the race did and then noisily like any other tosevite she did that only when she thought something was very funny frank coffey raised an eyebrow do you disagree with me how can you possibly disagree with me i wonder how we big uglies can hope to deal with creatures so constantly obsessed with mating that only made kassquit laugh harder do you have any idea how much you sound like some kind of selfimportant fool of a male pontificating about tosevites why no coffey said again kassquit needed a couple of heartbeats to be sure he was kidding again the brief doubt made the joke funnier she got out of her seat and bent into the full posture of respect i thank you she said for what now the brown big ugly seemed genuinely confused rather than playing at confusion as he had a little while before for what kassquit echoed i will tell you for what for puncturing the pretensions of the race that is for what you are grateful for that coffey asked was his surprise here genuine or affected kassquit couldnt tell the wild big ugly went on since you are a citizen of the empire i would have thought that you would be angry at me for poking fun at the race kassquit made the negative gesture no she said and added an emphatic cough the race can be foolish the race can be very foolish sometimes they realize it sometimes they do not but being a citizen of the empire is more much more than being a member of the race that is not how it has seemed to us tosevites coffey said well no kassquit admitted but that is because of the special circumstances surrounding the occupation of tosev special circumstances now frank coffey did the echoing i should say so i have never denied them kassquit said i could not very well could i but you will have seen i think that the empire treats all its citizens alike regardless of their species and we all have the spirits of emperors past looking after our spirits when we pass from this world to the next she looked down for a moment when she mentioned the spirits of emperors past coffey didnt none of the wild big uglies did he said i will admit you are better at treating all your citizens alike than we are though we do improve but you will understand we have different opinions about what happens after death the tosevite opinions kassquit had studied left her convinced they were nothing but superstition how could a being like a male big ugly with preposterous powers have created the entire universe the idea was ridiculous and even if such a being had done such a thing why had he not seen fit to tell the big uglies about the race and the empire before the conquest fleet arrived no the notion fell apart the moment it was examined closely but mocking tosevite superstitions only hatched hatred and enmity kassquit said in this case i think we will have to agree to disagree fair enough coffey replied that is an idiom in english i did not know the races language also used it for her part kassquit was surprised the big uglies could come up with such a civilized concept she did not say that either for fear of causing offense she did say you wild tosevites have proved less savage than many here on home expected that set frank coffey laughing by our standards we are civilized you know we may not be part of the empire but we are convinced we deserve to stand alongside it yes i know you are kassquit replied which kept her from having to state her own opinion about american convictions evidently though she did not need to for the wild big ugly said you do not think we are right no i do not home has been unified for a hundred thousand years the race has been traveling between the stars for twentyeight thousand years when the race came to tosev you tosevites were fighting an enormous war among yourselves you are still not a unified species all this being true how do you presume to claim equality with the empire because we have won it the wild big ugly answered and used an emphatic cough i do not care how old the race is in america the question to ask is what have you done yourself no one cares what your ancient ancestor did here is what we did in the united states when the race attacked us without warning we fought the invaders to a standstill we won our independence and we deserve it you said as much yourself to trir down by the south pole i admired you for your honesty for i know we are not altogether your folk admired me kassquit wasnt used to hearing such praise home had plants that always turned toward the sun she turned toward compliments in much the same way i thank you i thank you very much you are welcome frank coffey said and i will tell you one other reason why we deserve to stand alongside the empire he waited kassquit made the affirmative gesture urging him to go on he did because you and i are sitting here in the refectory of a mediumgood hotel in sitneff on home and i at least did not come here on a starship the race built is that not reason enough i am proud of the empire kassquit thought but the wild big uglies have their pride too even if it is for smaller achievements perhaps it isfor you at any rate she said she would not admit the tosevites deeds matched those of the race that would have gone too far all right i suspect we are also agreeing to disagree here coffey shrugged that too is part of diplomacy i suppose it is kassquit hesitated then said there are times when i wish i did not have to deal with my own species as if it were made up of aliens but to me it is i do not know what to do about that you have a real problem there frank coffey said gravely i have had some trouble with some part of my own species because i am dark in a notempire dominated by pale tosevites that was more true when i was young than it is now he laughed at himself than it was when i went into cold sleep i should say i would expect it to be better still now but i have no data and i was never as cut off from my own kind as you are no you have a common language with other american tosevites a common set of beliefs a common history all i share with tosevites are my looks and my biochemistry there are times when i wish we could meet halfway i could become more like a wild big ugly and you wild tosevites could become more like citizens of the empire we have changed a good deal since the race came to tosev coffey said maybe we will change more but maybe the whole empirenot just youwill need to change some to accommodate us the sheer arrogance of that made kassquit start to flare up coffey held up a hand to forestall her you know that the race has done this on tosev i admit ginger has driven some of the change but it is no less real on account of that males and females of the race did act differently there from the way they did here on home kassquit had seen that it wasnt just ginger either on tosev the race moved faster than it did here it had to to try to keep up with the surging big uglies you may have spoken a truth kassquit said slowly that is most interesting if you do not mind my saying so you are most interesting coffey said you balance between the race and us tosevites i know you are loyal to the empire but have you ever wondered what living as an ordinary big ugly would be like i should say i have kassquit added an emphatic cough i thank you for thinking to ask i thank you very much sometimes perhaps biology can more readily lead to empathy than culture can perhaps that is so frank coffey said mating season distracted ttomalss no less than atvar if anything it distracted the psychologist more he was younger than the fleetlord and so more able and more inclined to distribute his genes as widely as he could he knew he should have paid more attention to the wild big uglies and to kassquit but everything went to the befflem during mating season the race understood that so did the hallessi and rabotevs who had mating seasons of their own if the tosevites couldnt figure it out well too bad for them at supper one day linda de la rosa asked ttomalss our guide will regain her usual disposition after mating season is over yes yes he answered distractedly pheromones in the air still left him half addled well that is good the wild tosevite said because trir turned into a firstclass bitch once it started she added an emphatic cough the key word was not in the language of the race but from its tone ttomalss had no trouble realizing that it was imperfectly complimentary he shrugged hormonal changes can produce mood swings among us do you tosevites know nothing similar tom de la rosa looked up from his zisuili chop in herbs oh no senior researcher we are altogether unfamiliar with such things he laughed a raucous tosevite laugh his mate poked him in the ribs with her elbow that only made him laugh harder the byplay puzzled ttomalss he studied a videotape of it several times only when his wits sharpened with the end of the mating season did he figure it out kassquits mood could swing considerably during her fertility cycle and swing in a fairly regular way the alterations were less extreme than the ones the race went through during mating season but they were there the races physicians never had figured out why tosevite females bled about once every twentyeight days had that not been universal they would have thought it pathological linda de la rosa asked how much longer will your mating season last how much longer until we can get down to serious business again or even serious sightseeing tom de la rosa added as things are now trir is useless and i do not suppose any other guide male or female would be much better about another ten days ttomalss answered already things are less frenzied than they were when the season began if you say so tom de la rosa replied was that agreement or sarcasm ttomalss couldnt tell being unable to tell annoyed him he went upstairs to his room the air there was fairly free of pheromones he could think after a fashion he knew from experience he would have to redo half the work he did at this season of the year but if he didnt do anything he would have even more to catch up on once the mating madness ebbed when he checked his computer for messages and new data he let out an interested hiss a report from senior researcher felless had just come in from tosev felless had imagined herself an expert on big uglies before ever setting foot on their home planet once there shed promptly got addicted to ginger shed mated with ttomalss and once in a scandalous scene with the races ambassador to the deutsche and several officials who were visiting him little by little she had acquired real expertise on the big uglies ttomalss noted that she hadnt been recalled to home though males and females trusted his judgment more than hers he wondered how much she resented being stuck on a world whose only redeeming feature for her was a drug of course felless was a contrarian by nature not liking a place might help set up a perverse attraction for it in her and she was truly addicted to ginger here on home the herb was scarce and because it was scarce expensive not on tosev on the big uglies homeworld ttomalss sometimes thought it easier to taste ginger than not to felless would have agreed with him he was sure of that gingertaster or not though felless had become a keen observer of the tosevite scene here was her image with a little static hashing it from the journey across the lightyears she was saying i wish we would have brought more scientists with the colonization fleet but who would have thought we would have needed them those we do have here are nearly unanimous in saying the wild big uglies have surpassed us in electronics and are on their way to doing so in physics and the mathematics relating to physics the camera cut away to a picture of a tosevite journal presumably one dealing with some science felless voice continued in the background i am also informed that the problem may be even more severe than was realized until quite recently our scientists have not kept close watch on the big uglies scientific and mathematical publications not least because the tosevites use mathematical notation different from ours our experts say the big uglies symbology is for the most part neither better nor worse than ours simply different but because few of our experts have become familiar with their notation some of their advances were not noted until years after they occurred give me some examples please ttomalss said as if felless could reply at once even had he been speaking into a microphone hooked up to a transmitter to tosev he would have had to wait all the years for his signal to cross between this solar system and tosevs and then just as long for her answer to come back he knew that maybe the stresses of the mating season were leaving him less rational than usual or maybe he had realized that these journal articles amplified what had been in the public press and caught the physicist pesskrags interest even then now maybe she would have the chance to learn more about what the big uglies really were up to when it came to physics as if listening to him even though shed spoken years before felless did start giving examples they impressed ttomalss less than shed plainly expected they would had she claimed the big uglies were building weapons systems the race could not hope to match he would have been alarmed so would the governing bureaucrats here on home and so would reffet and kirel back on tosev advances in theoretical physics though ttomalss was a psychologist not a physicist he wasnt sure what felless was talking about half the time for that matter she was a psychologist too he wondered how well she understood the material that had agitated her again she addressed the very point that had concerned him several theoreticians will be submitting their own reports on these topics before long they are still working to discover all the implications of the new data they are unanimous however that these implications are startling if the big uglies want to muck around on experiments that will never have any practical use they are welcome and more than welcome to do just that ttomalss said it distracts them from the sort of engineering that could actually prove dangerous to us when he checked to see if anyone else on home had evaluated felless latest report he was amused but not astonished to discover that one male and two females had already submitted reports whose essence was what hed just said one of the females made a cautious addition to her report not being familiar with the physical sciences or with tosevite notation i am not ideally suited to judge whether felless concerns are justified ttomalss called that female and asked do we have anyone here on home who is familiar with the tosevites notation she shrugged senior researcher i have not the faintest idea why would anyone wish to learn such things though when our own notation has served us well for as long as home has been unified and probably longer a point the psychologist admitted still at the moment it could be relevant simply in terms of threat evaluation that is a truthof sorts the female said if however there is no threat to evaluate then the issue becomes irrelevant she hung up maybe the question did not interest her maybe like ttomalss she was still at the tag end of the mating season and not inclined to take anything too seriously if she didnt have to at the moment about the only ones not half addled by the urge to reproduce were the big uglies even in his present state ttomalss felt the irony there one evening at supper he approached sam yeager and said i greet you superior tosevite may i ask you a few questions and i greet you senior researcher the ambassador from the united states replied go ahead and ask i do not guarantee that i will answer that depends on the questions we can both find out truth ttomalss said what do you know of theoretical physics and tosevite mathematical notation sam yeager laughed of theoretical physics i know nothing i do not even suspect anything he used an emphatic cough to show how very ignorant he was of mathematical notation i know our numbers and the signs for adding subtracting multiplying and dividing he held up a finger in a gesture the big uglies used when they wanted to add something oh wait i know the sign for a square root too though i have not had to extract one since i got out of school which is a very long time ago now somehow i do not think this is what concerns our scientists on tosev ttomalss said well what does concern them the big ugly asked possible tosevite advances in theoretical physics ttomalss answered i do not know all the details myself i do not know any of them sam yeager said with what sounded like a certain amount of pride i never thought theoretical physics could be important until we had to figure out how to make atomic bombs to use against the race back during the fighting i was involved in that project because i was one of the few tosevites who had learned enough of the races language to interrogate prisoners even if you do not know the details then you are aware that these theoretical advances can be important ttomalss said the tosevite ambassador made the affirmative gesture yes i know that i said i knew that but i also said i have no idea what american physicists are working on back on tosev and that too is a truth very well ttomalss said though it was anything but sam yeager must have sensed that laughing again in his noisy way he said senior researcher i would have been ignorant about these things before i went into cold sleep now the scientists have worked for all these years without me it only makes me more ignorant still he sounded as if he was telling the truth about that ttomalss wasnt sure how far to trust him though one thing worried the psychologist the american big uglies were not broadcasting news of what their physicists had learned toward home and their starship in orbit around it why not if they were making such advances ttomalss saw one possible reason they knew the race would be deciphering their signals and did not want it learning too much that worried him that worried him a lot mickey flynn watched glen johnson climbing into his spacesuit teachers pet flynn said solemnlythe most sobersided jeer johnson had ever heard look at the teachers pet johnson paused long enough to flip the other pilot the bird the lizards know quality when they see it flynn pondered that then shook his head there must be some rational explanation instead he said and then why do they want to see you again so soon anyhow havent they got sick of you by now i would have and theyre supposed to be an intelligent species instead of rising to that johnson just kept on donning the suit as he settled the helmet on its locking ring he said the one advantage of this getup is that i dont have to pay attention to you when ive got it on with the helmet in place he couldnt heard flynn any more that much was true but flynn went right on talking or at least mouthing anyhow he looked very urgent while he was doing it too were this the first time johnson had seen him pull a stunt like that he would have been convinced something urgent was going on and he needed to know about it as things were he went on into the air lock and began checking out the scooter he didnt expect to find anything wrong with the little local rocket ship but he made all the checks anyhow any pilot who didnt was a damn fool in his biased opinion it was after all his one and only neck everything checked out green yes he would have been surprised if it hadnt but life was full of surprises avoiding the nasty ones when you could was always a good idea the outer airlock door swung open he used the scooters maneuvering jets to ease it out of the lock then fired up the stern motor to take it in the direction of the nearest lizard spacecraft the pterodactyls wing that wasnt an exact translation but it came close enough he had no idea why the lizards wanted to talk with him but he was always ready to get away from the admiral peary for a little while as he crossed the double handful of kilometers between his spaceship and theirs he got one of those surprises life was full of a lizard scooter came out to meet him hello scooter of the race i greet you johnson called on the lizards chief comm frequency what is going on i greet you tosevite scooter the lizard pilot answered you are ordered to stop for inspection before approaching the pterodactyls wing it shall be done johnson said on the radio nobody could see him shrug i do not understand the need for it but it shall be done he applied the same blast to the forward engine as hed used in the rear to make his approach run to the lizards ship with his motion towards it killed he hung in space between it and the admiral peary he watched the lizards scooter approach on the radar screen and by eye it was bigger than the one he flew he had room for only a couple of passengers the other scooter could carry eight or ten members of the race at the moment though it had just two aboard whoever was piloting it had a style very different from his instead of a long blast precisely canceled the lizard flew fussily a little poke here a little nudge there his maneuvering jets constantly flaring like fireflies any human pilot would have been embarrassed to cozy up like that but the lizard got the job done after what seemed like forever the two scooters floated motionless relative to each other and only a few meters apart i am going to cross to your scooter for the inspection one of the spacesuited lizards said the maleor possibly femalewaved to show which one it was come ahead johnson waved back the lizard had a reaction pistol to go from yon to hither the gas jet pushed it across to johnsons scooter where it braked i greet you tosevite pilot resounded in johnsons headphones i am nosred and i greet you johnson gave his own name adding this is unusual why have you changed your procedures why i will tell you why nosred leaned toward johnson when their helmets touched the lizard spoke without benefit of radio turn off your transmitter direct sound conduction brought the words to johnsons ears he flipped the switch and took another precaution if nosred wanted a private chat the human was willing to find out why and the precaution wouldnt be noticeable from the outside their helmets still touching johnson said go ahead i thank you what i want to discuss with you is the possibility of your bringing ginger out of your starship the next time you come forth nosred said i might have known johnson thought the race figured big uglies were obsessed with sex the way it looked to people lizards were obsessed with gingerwhich sometimes led them to be obsessed with sex but that was a different story not without a certain pang johnson made the negative gesture i do not have any the ship does not have any nosred made the negative gesture too i do not believe you tosevite pilot ginger is too valuable a commodity and too valuable a weapon for you big uglies to have left it all in your own solar system you must have brought some with you logic requires it this is your own opinion this is not a truth johnson said he knew more than he was telling one of the things he knew was that he couldnt tell whether this lizard was setting a trap for him till he knew that he had no intention of trusting nosredor any other male or female of the race you do not think i am reliable nosred said in accusing tones that is the truth here that and nothing else he was right being right wouldnt get him any ginger johnson said it would be best if i proceeded on to the pterodactyls wing now your own folk will begin to wonder why we linger here without any communication they can monitor with an angry hiss nosred pulled back his radio came to life our preliminary inspection here reveals no ginger tosevite pilot you have permission to proceed on to our ship i thank you it shall be done johnson had to remember to turn his own radio back on he used his steering jets to reorient the scooters nose toward the pterodactyls wing then made his acceleration and deceleration burns by eyeball and feel he was good at what he did that deceleration burn left him motionless with respect to the lizard spaceship and only a few meters from the air lock nosred and his silent friend arrived several minutes later after another series of small finicky burns the lizards took them back aboard first though which meant johnson had nothing to do but twiddle his thumbs till the airlock master condescended to let him into the pterodactyls wing i thank you so very much johnson said and tacked on an emphatic cough so very emphatic he sprayed the inside of his faceplate with spit somehow though he doubted whether the lizard appreciated or even noticed the sarcasm his scooter and his person got the same sort of painstaking search they had the last time he went aboard one of the races spacecraft a small machine floated out of his spacesuit he snagged it what is that the airlock master demanded suspiciously a recorder johnson answered go ahead and examine it you will find no hidden ginger the lizard ran it through a sniffer and an xray machine only after he was satisfied did he return it to johnson the pilot bent into the posture of respect again you have my most deep and profound gratitude he used another nearly tubercular emphatic cough you are welcome the lizard said complacently johnson wondered if anything short of a kick in the snout would penetrate that unconscious arrogance the airlock master went on medium spaceship commander ventris wishes to speak with you now does he johnson said well then it shall be done of course once more the lizard in charge of the air lock took that for obedience not irony ventris let out a warning hiss when johnson floated into his office the lizards tailstump twitched angrily in anger or a good bureaucratic simulation thereof what is this i hear from scooter copilot nosred about your trying to sell him ginger while he inspected you out beyond my ship what is it johnson echoed sounds like nonsense to me i think not ventris said i think you big uglies are involved in more of your nefarious schemes i think it is nonsense johnson repeated what is more superior sir i think you are a fool for believing it and what is still more i can prove what i say i would like to see nosred do the same when ventris tailstump twitched now it was in genuine fury big talk comes easy to big uglies he said johnson pulled the little recorder from the front pocket of his shorts ventris stared at it as if hed never seen anything like it before he probably hadnt it was an american design not one taken directly from the race here your own hearing diaphragms will tell you what you need to know he punched the play button the recorder gave back a somewhat muffled version of the conversation johnson and nosred had had while their helmet radios were off when the recording ended johnson shut off the machine and put it back in his pocket you see i see that scooter copilot nosred will soon regret that he was ever hatched ventris said heavily good johnson said but do you also see that you owe me an apology do you see you owe my entire species an apology you are either joking or addled ventris said with a scornful hiss shall i take a recording of your remarks about big uglies and nefarious schemes to our ambassador superior sir johnson had no such recording but ventris didnt need to know that by the way ventris looked he might have stepped in a large pile of azwaca droppings i am sorry that you big uglies are here i am sorry that i have to have anything to do with you i apologize that nosred has been corrupted by a vile tosevite herb if your ambassador is unhappy about these sentiments too bad let him start a war sam yeager wouldnt start a war on account of a male who couldnt stand big uglies johnson knew it and ventris was only saying what a lot of lizards felt johnson knew that too he said well superior sir i just think there is something you ought to know and that is ventris asked icily we love you too good ventris said he got the irony there with no trouble at all here is a basis for understanding johnson had tried talking about friendship with henrep the commandant of the horned akiss it hadnt worked maybe mutual loathing would sam yeager misspelled a word he muttered something disgusted wadded up the paper and flung it in the direction of the wastebasket it didnt go in he got up walked over grabbed it and dropped it in then he went back to the table got a fresh sheet and started over a petition for an audience with the emperor had to be written by hand and it had to be perfect if you didnt care enough to do it right you didnt deserve to see the sovereign that was how the lizards saw it and he was in no position to persuade them they were wrong writing such a petition was easy for them they learned how in school even though their writing system was perfectly phonetic it wasnt the one yeager had grown up withand some of the language required for the petition was so oldfashioned it wasnt used on anything but petitions to the emperor so sam had already made errors on four sheets of paper after some more muttering he started writing again at least half the petition involved proclaiming his own unworthiness over and over again he laughed as he went through that part males and females of the race probably felt their own unworthiness as they wrote this was a much bigger deal for them than it was for him he wondered what would happen to him after he died when you got to be seventy you couldnt very well help wondering in the not too indefinite future youd find out but unlike the lizards he didnt believe spirits of emperors past were likely to be involved then he laughed again this time on a more sour note the lizards had run up temples to spirits of emperors past in their own territory on earth and wherever independent countries would let them thanks to the first amendment the united states hadnt tried to stop them and human reverence for the spirits of emperors past was stronger in the usaand especially in california and most especially in los angelesthan anywhere else in the world that so many years of so many crude jokes had been so solidly confirmed never failed to irk an adopted angeleno like him he went back to the petition only a few lines to go now he felt like a pitcher working on a nohitter nobody would mention it for fear of putting in the jinx here it came the last line no mistakes yet three more words two more words one more worddone sam felt like cheering he waited for his infielders to come up and slap him on the back they didnt of course nobody else knew hed finished the petition jonathan and karen knew he was working on it so did atvar but here it was done all in the form the race required he didnt see how the most finicky protocol master could turn him down trouble was the lizardly equivalent of dotting every i and crossing every t might not be enough the protocol masters might turn him down because he wasnt scaly enough to satisfy them or they might turn him down for the hell of itafter all they turned down most lizards who petitioned for an audience with the emperor he still hoped they wouldnt when was the last time a foreign ambassador had come before an emperor before home was unified surely that was a long time ago now back when neanderthals still squatted in caves in europe since then rabotevs and hallessi had come to home to pay their respects to the rulers of the folk whod conquered them but that was different that didnt count theyd already been conquered a subjects greetings werent worth as much as an equals so sam thought anyway the lizards were liable to have different ideas equality didnt mean to them what it did back in the united states back home it was an excuse to let everybody run like hell aiming at the top here on home here on home equality meant everybody staying in place and being content to stay in place the usa had been a growing concern for earth years home had been unified for two hundred times that long two hundred us histories all laid end to end say what you pleased about the lizards but this society worked no human culture had been around long enough to make that claimwhich didnt stop any number of human cultures from proclaiming their magnificent wonderfulness at the top of their lungs but in the space of one us history people had gone from sailing ships to starships how long had the race needed to make the same jump a hell of a lot longer of that sam was sure he telephoned atvar would the fleetlord answer or was he out enjoying the last little stretch of the mating season his image appeared on the monitor i greet you fleetlord sam said and i greet you ambassador atvar answered what is the occasion for this call may i come to your room yeager asked i have prepared my petition for an imperial audience and i would like a member of the race to check it for mistakes before i submit it i will gladly do this atvar said though i doubt it will be necessary you use our language very well even when you do not speak just as we do you often speak as we would if we were a little more interesting i thank you sam hoped that was a compliment i thank you but i would still like you to look the petition over i speak your language pretty well yes but it is not the one i learned from hatchlinghood and i have to try to write it much less often than i speak it and the language of this petition is different from what the race usually uses all these things being so well come ahead atvar said i still think you are worrying about having your clutch of eggs stolen by a beast that is not there but you are right that it is better to be too careful than not careful enough see you very soon then sam broke the connection his guards waited in the hall outside the door i am only going to visit fleetlord atvar two floors down he told them we have our orders superior tosevite one of the guards replied that sentence implied even more blind obedience among the lizards than it would have in the most spitandpolish military outfit back on earth arguing would have been pointless sam didnt try he just walked down the hall the guards accompanied him the floor was hard with their scaly feet the lizards had never seen as much need for carpets as people did the walls were painted a muddy greenish brown that never would have passed muster on earth the ceiling was too low sam had to duck whenever he walked by a lighting fixture but it was unmistakably a hotel the rows of identical doors with numbers on them the indifferent paintings on the walls some of them all the more indifferent to his eyes because the race saw two colors in what was the near infrared to himwhat else could it be he went down the stairway the steps werent quite the right size and spacing for his legs and the handrail was too low but he got down without a stumble one of the guards skittered ahead of him the other followed more guards stood outside atvars door they bent into the posture of respect we greet you superior tosevite they said and i greet you sam answered the fleetlord is expecting me as if to prove him right atvar opened the door just then the us ambassador and the lizard exchanged polite greetings atvar said please come in yeager did his guards for a wonder didnt follow even they could see no assassins were likely to lurk in atvars room atvar had a humanstyle chair in the room he waved sam to it i thank you sam said he handed the petition to the fleetlord is everything as it ought to be if it is not i will copy it over again or maybe ill just jump out a window depending he thought let me have a look at this as you know it must be perfect atvar said sam made the affirmative gesture he knew that all too well atvar went on your handwriting is not bad it is not particularly fluid but it is clear i have seen plenty of males and females with worse they are in a hurry and they scribble you obviously took pains over this i should hope i did sam used an emphatic cough when i did not take enough pains i made mistakes and had to start over the process is not supposed to be easy atvar said it is designed to weed out those who seek an audience for only frivolous reasons let me see here i do believe ambassador that everything is as it should be i cannot see how the protocol masters could reject this petition on any stylistic grounds at first that so delighted sam he thought atvar had said the petition was sure to be approved after a moment though he realized atvar hadnt said any such thing what other reasons are there for rejecting it he asked hed come up with a few of his ownwhat would the fleetlord find if the emperor does not care to see you there is no more to be said atvar answered i do not believe this to be the case but it may be if certain courtiers do not wish you to see the emperor that is also a difficulty but in that case there may be ways around it such as sam asked lizard politics at this intimate level was a closed book to humans how did members of the race get what they wanted in the face of opposition if we are able to learn who has set out to addle your egg perhaps we can appeal to a higherranking opponent atvar answered such ploys are not guaranteed to succeed but they are not hopeless this is very much the same sort of thing i would do in a tosevite factional squabble sam said in some ways our two species are not so very different in some ways possibly not the fleetlord said in others in others the difference is as large as the distance between our sun and the star tosev it could be something occurred to sam i have a question he said atvar made the affirmative gesture sam asked since i do not wear body paint how will the imperial laver and the imperial limner deal with me atvar started to answer then stopped short how do you know about the imperial laver and the imperial limner have you been researching imperial audiences on the computer network sam made the negative gesture no as a matter of fact i have been reading gone with the wind have you ever read it atvars mouth dropped open in a startled laugh that old kwaffa berry by the spirits of emperors past i had to go through it in a college literature course i have hardly thought about it from that day to this either how did you ever get your fingerclaws on it i found it in a secondhand bookstore yeager answered i do not suppose imperial ceremonial would have changed much from that time to this there was one area where humanity and the race differed widely no probably not atvar agreed he took endless millennia of unchanging ceremonial for granted gone with the wind he laughed again and how do you like it quite a bit actually sam answered what did you think of it they spent the next hour happily picking the novel to pieces the races cooks were willing to scramble eggs for the americans though they didnt eat eggs themselves karen yeager worked hard not to remind herself that the creatures these eggs came from would have scared the hell out of a chicken the flavor was about threequarters of what it should have been put enough salt on them and they werent bad speaking of salt she also had a couple of slices of aasson on her plate aasson was smoked and saltcured zisuili meat it came closer to bacon than the eggs did to hens eggs but it was salty as the devil nothing on home took the place of coffee instant came down from the admiral peary the lizards thought the stuff was nasty but theymostlystayed polite about it karen and jonathan wouldnt have been polite if they couldnt have it they both drank it without cream jonathan plain karen with sugar the race used sugar though less than people did tom and linda de la rosa liked their coffee light that they couldnt have except for the americans lab rats they were the only mammals on the planet to the lizards the very idea of milk was revolting nasty tom said not for the first time but id be even nastier without my caffeine fix might as well be ginger for me he sipped from his mug made a horrible face and then sipped again trir came into the hotel refectory i greet you tosevites she said cheerfully today we are going to go for a bus ride out into the country does that not sound pleasant she couldnt smile and simper the way human tour guides did her face wasnt made for it but she did the best with what she had in english jonathan murmured has she forgotten how snotty she acted when mating season was just getting started she probably has karen answered i dont think she had any control over that her husband made the sort of face tom de la rosa had i didnt have much control over the urge to kick her in the teeth he muttered what is that you are saying trir asked she didnt sound angry or contemptuous the way she had before when she heard english she just seemed curious the humans in the refectory all looked at one another karen knew what everybody else had to be thinking how do we tell her what a monster she was and do we tell her anything at all the best diplomacy might have been just to keep quiet try as she would though karen couldnt stomach that she said we could not help but notice how much friendlier you are now than you were when your mating season began oh that trir fluttered her fingers in what couldnt have been anything but embarrassment take no notice of it mating season is a time when ordinary rules and ordinary behavior go running out the door a human would have said they flew out the window it came down to the same thing the guide went on if i did or said anything to offend please accept my apologies she bent into the posture of respect if shed done or said anything to offend for a little while there she hadnt done or said anything that didnt offend but she didnt seem to remember how nasty shed been and she did seem sorry for it let it go then karen said jonathan and linda de la rosa made the affirmative gesture what else could you do short of kicking the guide in the teeth as jonathan had wanted i thank you trir said now as i was telling you we are going to go out into the country this morning out to a zisuili ranch zisuili are domestic animals valuable for their meat and hides and they we know something about zisuili linda de la rosa broke in the colonization fleet brought them to tosev ah yes of courseit would have trir agreed brightly they are some of our most important meat animals she pointed to karens aasson as you see they have also caused some of the most important environmental damage on our planet said tom de la rosa whod made a career out of the environmental effects homes imported plants and animals were having on earth they eat everything and they eat it right down to the ground they are efficient feeders trir agreed which meant the same thing but sounded a lot better i want to go see the zisuili jonathan said in english ive seen lizards with wigs by god now i want to see them riding around on whatever they use for horses i want to see them with tengallon hats on their heads and with sixshooters in their holsters i want to hear them hissing yippee and playing zisuiliboy music around their campfires that produced a pretty good stunned silence after half a minute or so karen broke it i want to see you committed to an asylum for the terminally silly jonathan didnt come out with quite so many absurd remarks as his father did but the ones he turned loose were doozies what is a zisuiliboy trir asked she must have recognized the wordor here part of a wordfrom her language in the midst of the english believe me you do not want to know karen told her trir plainly believed nothing of the sort karen sighed and went on it is nothing but a jokeand a foolish joke at that she sent jonathan a severe look he seemed notably deficient in anything resembling a sense of shame about fortyfive minutes later all the americans rode with trir toward the zisuili ranch kassquit came along too she hadnt seen much more of home than the americans had and she was bound to be at least as curious the bus had windows that were easy to see out of but hard to see into that kept members of the race from gawking and possibly from causing accidents the ride out to the ranch took a little more than an hour the border between city and country was not abrupt buildings gradually got farther and father apart the countryside looked not too different from the way it did in the rural areas outside of los angeles it was scrubland and chaparral with bushes giving way here and there to patches of what home used for trees and then karen almost fell off her seat she pointed out the window sure as hell there was a lizard mounted on something that looked like a cross between a zebra and a duckbilled dinosaur the creature was striped in a pattern of gold and dark brown that probably helped it fade into the background at any distance to her vast relief the lizard on its back sported neither cowboy hat nor colt revolver nor even a wig even so when she glanced over to jonathan she saw him looking almost unbearably smug what is the name of that riding beast she asked trir if she sounded slightly strangled well who could blame her that is an eppori the guide answered epporyu still have their uses even after all these years of mechanical civilization they require no fuel and they can go places where wheeled vehicles would have difficulties and some males and females enjoy riding them though the attraction has always been beyond me we have animals like that back on tosev sam yeager said when i was a hatchling i lived on a farm back then many more animals were in use than powered vehicles i learned to ridei had to would you care to ride an eppori trir asked maybe briefly he answered i was never one who enjoyed riding animals much vehicles are much more comfortable this is also my attitude trir said her eye turrets swiveled over the other humans perhaps some of your colleaguesor even you kassquitwould be interested in trying this kassquit promptly made the negative gesture i thank you but no i am happy enough with mechanical civilization i do not have any of these atavistic impulses you mentioned i will try unless my odor frightens the epporyu tom de la rosa said i have ridden back on tosev for most of the reasons you mentioned riding animals find their own fuel and they can travel almost anywherecertainly anywhere the larger animals from home that i study are likely to go one by one the rest of the americans agreed to make the effort karen was anything but enthusiastic she hadnt been on a horse for at least twenty years before going into cold sleep jonathan also looked dubious the things well do to keep from letting our friends down karen thought the zisuili were not a problem they looked like ankylosaurs with turreted eyes all the americans had seen them in person before and knew they paid no particular attention to people what the epporyu would do when they met humans might be a different story people werent just going to look at them they were going to try to get on their backsif the animals would put up with it sam tried to be the first human on an eppori everybody had been willing to let him set foot on home first and everyone was just as unanimous in telling him he couldnt ride first now youre the one we cant afford to lose frank coffey said in english and added an emphatic cough let em run away with one of us or trample him but not you the other americans nodded im outvoted karens fatherinlaw said you bet you are dad jonathan told him tom de la rosa tried to claim first ride by saying he was the best horseman among them the othersincluding lindapointedly observed that being able to ride a horse might not have thing one to do with riding an eppori they settled who would ride first by a method that fascinated trirstone paper scissors and when karens stone smashed frank coffeys scissors she won the prize once she had it she wasnt sure she wanted it if it werent for the honor of the thing id rather walk she said but she walked toward the eppori that a zisuiliboy named gatemp was holding for her when she started to go to the creatures left side gatemp made the negative gesture we mount from the right he said you would karen muttered the eppori swiveled an eye turret her way as she came up beside it it made a snuffling noise that might have meant anything she set a hand on its scaly hide it felt like living breathing crocodile leather she asked gatemp is it all right to get up i think so he answered why not find out yes why not karen said grimly she would have been awkward mounting from the left side she was worse than awkward from the right gatemps mouth fell open in a laugh she would have bet it would a lizard stirrup had only a bar on the bottom members of the race could grip it with their toes karen couldnt but her foot did fit on it fortunately the eppori seemed goodnatured it snuffled again but didnt buck or jump or do anything else too very horrifying it plodded forward for a couple of strides then turned one eye turret back toward her as if asking well what do you want me to do now the saddle was uncomfortable as could be she ignored that she wouldnt be on long how do i control it she asked gatemp with the reins and with your legs and with your voice he might have been talking about a horse sure enough after he gave her the basic instructions he said now you try make the eppori walk and go to the left it shall be done she said and hoped it would she squeezed the scaly body with her knees and twitched the reins as hed told her the eppori walked karen felt like cheering she tugged the reins to the left the animal turned in that direction she hadnt come more than ten lightyears to go riding but by god she could on the bus on the way back to sitneff jonathan yeager turned to his wife and said you smell like an eppori so do you karen answered we all do well no jonathan said tom smells more like zisuili but then he was the one who stepped in it you guys are never going to let me live that down are you tom de la rosas voice rose in mock anger youll be famous on four planets once the word gets around jonathans father said theyd been speaking english he translated for kassquit and trir being around animals larger than i am makes me nervous kassquit said who knows what they will do next they are animals after all by the way she spoke that should have been obvious to anybody jonathan whod grown up in the city had a certain amount of sympathy for her point of view but kassquit had never even seen an animal in person not till she got to home no wonder she was hinky about them now jonathan didnt say any of that though the less he said that involved agreeing with kassquit the less trouble hed have with karen frank coffey said animalsmost animals i should say i do not mean large carnivores or anything of the sortare not so bad once you get to know them and to know what they are likely to do until that happens though it is only natural to be wary near them truth sam yeager said as i told you i grew up on a farm so i ought to know we had the meanest mule in the county a mule is a work animal and can be a riding animal and is often stubborn i was very careful around him until i figured out what he would put up with and what made him angry after that we got along well enough i never heard that story before jonathan said no well maybe it is because you are stubborn as a mule yourself and would not listen even if i told it karen snickered jonathan gave her a dirty look which only made her snicker again but when he turned around and glanced at his father sam yeager tipped him a wink what was that supposed to mean it wasnt anything either kassquit or trir would notice was his old man making up the story about the mule so kassquit would feel better that would have been jonathans guess but he couldnt prove it they came to the outskirts of sitneff just in time for the evening rush hour it was crowded on the highway but things didnt coagulate the way they did in los angeles the roads were adequate for the number of cars that used them jonathan sighed there were times when seeing how smoothly the lizards managed things made him feel very much the barbarian when the bus stopped in front of the hotel some small flying things were making small rather sweetsounding chirps from the shrubbery in front of the building jonathan listened with interest he hadnt heard many animals with even remotely musical calls on home birdsong was unknown here till this moment he hadnt realized how much he missed it the chirping went on what are those creatures making that noise he asked trir those are called evening sevod the guide answered they are related to squazeffi and other such fliers they always call about the time the sun goes down evening sevod jonathan repeated the name so hed remember it i thank you they sound very pleasant well so they do trir said several of our musical composers have used their calls as thematic models really he said musicians on tosev sometimes do the same thing with the sounds of our animals that is interesting trir said forgive me but i had not thought you tosevites would know anything of music jonathan laughed at himself im not the only one who thinks were a bunch of barbarians we do he said if you want details i am sure senior researcher ttomalss can give them to you i have no idea whether any of our music would please you we have many different styles you are more diverse than we are i have noticed that in my research on tosev trir said home has been unified for a long time that means the race has been homogenized for a long time jonathan said back on tosev our different cultures are still very different from one another i know from my research on your species that this is a truth it strikes me as very strange even so trir said no stranger than tens of thousands of years of sameness seem to a tosevite jonathan replied the evening sevod kept piping in the bushes finally one of them flew out hed never imagined a robinsized pterodactyl if not for the light streaming out of the hotel lobby he wouldnt have got more than the faintest fleeting glimpse the little creature made one more musical squeak and then disappeared trir said but unity is natural unity is inevitable seeing what a species is like before the inevitable occurs is unusual was she right jonathan started to make the negative gesture but checked himself even before the lizards came cultures based on ideas and technology from western europe had become the strongest ones on earth to stay independent other countries had had to adopt western european techniques if they didnt they would go under as africa and india had done china had struggled with western ideas as it now struggled against the race japan had succeeded in holding its own after commodore perry made it open up to the wider world but it had done so by adopting western methodsand it might have failed too technology i think is more important than culture jonathans father saidthe two yeagers had been thinking along with each other but would you not agree that in large measure technology dictates culture trir asked in large measure but not completely sam yeager replied different cultures and different species can use the same technology in different ways we big uglies by now have access to almost the same technology as the race does but i do not think we are quite the same his grin meant nothing to trir but she did catch his ironic tone that is a truth she said but you and we are biologically distinct this is not the case with various cultures belonging to the same species she had a point she could be annoying but she wasnt stupid jonathan said you have to understand that it has only been a little more than a thousand of your years since we first went all the way around tosev it has only been half that time since one culture on our world got ahead of the others technologically to any great degree and of course it has been less than two hundred of your years since the race came maybe we will grow more alike as time goes by but not enough time has passed yet for that to happen only a thousand years since you circumnavigated your world trir let out a soft hiss full of wonder i had read this mind you in the abstract i knew it but to be reminded of it in that way she hissed again kassquit said is there any possibility that we could circumnavigate the refectory i am very hungry i am not so sure about circumnavigating it frank coffey said we could probably sit down in it that might do kassquit said trirs eye turrets went from one of them to the other it was a shame jonathan thought that lizards didnt play tennis the crowds on home could have followed the action without moving their heads back and forth while he woolgathered the guide said at least half to herself tosevites are very peculiar since hed just been thinking about tennis of all the useless things he could hardly quarrel with her his father didnt even try truthwe are peculiar sam yeager said and the race is peculiar and when we get to know rabotevs and hallessi better i am sure we will find they are peculiar too trir probably hadnt been thinking about the idiosyncracies of the different intelligent species shed been thinking big uglies were bizarre but all she said now was supper does seem a good idea the refectory featured krellepem from the ssurpyk sea finding out what krellepem were took some work jonathan finally gathered they were something like crabs or lobsters he ordered them so did the rest of the humans kassquit included trir wanted nothing to do with them when we evolved we left the seas and came up on land she said i am not interested in eating anything that did not bother to evolve jonathan had heard all sorts of excuses for not eating all sorts of thingsquite a few of them from his sons when they were littlebut never one that darwin would have approved of he admired trirs creativity when the krellepem came they looked more like trilobites than anything else jonathan had ever seen theyd evolved even less than hed expected the servers brought special tools for eating themtools that put him in mind of a hammer and chisel each segment of shell had its own chunk of meat inside this is a savage way of feeding oneself kassquit said as the pile of broken bits of krellep shell in front of her grew taller possibly frank coffey said but the results are worth it truth jonathan agreed the krellepem tasted something like oysters something like scallops he discovered they had meat inside their skinny little legs too and sucked it out one leg at a time the others started imitating him how do you do that trir asked watching them jonathan demonstrated trir said we would have to use tools to get at that meat our mouthparts are not flexible enough to do what you are doing she was right though jonathan hadnt thought about it till that moment lizards didnt have lips not the way humans did the edges of their mouths were hard they couldnt suck meat out of a tubular leg they couldnt kiss they cant make fart jokes jonathan thought and realized he was even tireder than hed suspected what is funny karen asked when he snorted he told her what is a fart joke trir asked the relevant phrase had been in english something that proves my mate is seriously deranged karen told her i thank you i thank you very much jonathan used an emphatic cough you tosevites can be most confusing trir said all the americans chorused we thank you we thank you very much they all used emphatic coughs trir was most confused glen johnson looked down on home from his orbital path in the admiral peary he shared the control room with mickey flynn and dr melanie blanchard flynn eyed him and said i dont believe the lizards are going to want to let you aboard any more of their spacecraft i told you bathing before you went would have been a good idea funny ha ha i laugh johnson said hear me laugh he glanced over toward the doctor she smiled but she wasnt laughing that left him relieved she said they really are anxious about ginger though arent they anxious about it and eager for it both at the same time johnson answered that one scaly bastard who went helmettohelmet with me good thing you had the recorder going she said if somebody wants to talk off the record thats usually the time when its a good idea to make sure hes on johnson said as soon as he told me to turn off my radio i figured he had to have ginger on his miserable little mind and as soon as i knew that i knew he was liable to try to diddle me if i didnt have any to give him did the captain of the lizard ship ever apologize for seizing you dr blanchard asked ventris oh hell yespardon my frenchfinally in a way once i browbeat him into it then he made it sound like it was our fault his scooter pilot got trapped by the wicked herb to hear him talk it was like ginger came after that lizard with a gun he didnt have anything to do with it of course why heaven forfend mickey flynn said the very idea is ridiculous that anything could possibly be a lizards fault he shook his head next thing you know therell be big uglies traveling between the stars dont hold your breath for that johnson said melanie blanchard looked from one of them to the other i can see how both of youd be welcome guests on the surface of home certainly flynn said the lizards wouldnt kill me theyd let their planet do it for them he mimed being squashed flat when are you going down to the surface johnson asked the doctor i dont know yet she answered ill have to take it easy down there for a whilei do know that i spent too long weightless aboard the lewis and clark is it safe for you to go he said i think so dr blanchard answered if i have any doubts when the time comes ill get a second opinion what if the other docs lie to you because they want to be the ones who go down there johnson asked she looked startled then shook her head no they wouldnt do that she said they need to know they can count on me too wouldnt be so good if the doctor who was treating you might want you dead instead of better flynn observed wanteddead more than alive johnson intoned solemnly she glared at each of them in turn had she been a lizard with eye turrets that moved independently she would have glared at both of them at the same time thanks a lot guys she said mostly in jest thanks a hell of a lot now ill be looking back over my shoulder whenever i see anybody else wearing a white coat well spread the word around flynn said that way the others will be looking over their shoulders at you too helpful melanie blanchard said very goddamn helpful to show how helpful it was she glided out of the control room therenow look what you did flynn said to johnson you scared her away me johnson shook his head i thought it was you her voice floated up the hatchway by which shed departed it was both of you as a matter of fact the two pilots looked at each other they pointed at each other johnson started to laugh mickey flynn refusing to yield to such vulgar displays of emotion looked even more impassive than before that only made johnson laugh harder than ever he said no wonder we confuse the damned lizards we confuse each other too you dont confuse me a bit flynn declared thats because you were confused to begin with johnson answered and if you dont believe me ask stone hell tell you flynn shook his head he thinks hes not confused which only makes him the most confused of all johnson raised an eyebrow i have to think that one over i hope nothing breaks flynn said helpfully but if it will assist in your cogitations let me remind you that he still more than half wants to see how long youll last if you go out the air lock without a suit since he was right yet again johnson did the only thing a sensible man could do he changed the subject well he said one of these days the lizards are going to get in an uproar about ginger that has something behind it how can they do that the other pilot replied everybody knows there is no ginger aboard the admiral peary yeah and then you wake up johnson said scornfully missiles with bombs in their noses are weapons we brought plenty of those ginger is a weapon too you think we dont have any flynn shrugged i know about missiles i know where they fit on the plans for the ship i know how to arm them i know how to launch them i know how to tell the ship to do all that automatically in about nothing flat so we can get the missiles away even if were under attack nobody has briefed me about ginger which is the sum total of what i know about it i will also point out that its the sum total of what you know about it too he was right again of course that didnt mean johnson wasnt also right not this time we can addle half the scaly soandsos down on that planet he insisted theres got to be a way to get the herb from hither to yon you are assuming what you want to prove mickey flynn said if youd gone to the same sort of school i did the nuns would have rapped your knuckles with a steel yardstick for a breach of logic like that if id gone to the kind of school you did id have to drop my pants if i wanted to count to twentyone johnson retorted flynn eyed him with mild astonishment you mean you dont truly you are a fountor at least a dripof knowledge thank you so much johnson suddenly snapped his fingers ive got it i hope you can take something for it flynn said with wellsimulated concern johnson ignored him i know where id put the ginger if i were designing the admiral peary he held up a hand if you make that particular suggestion im going to be very annoyed at you with dignity the other pilot said moi je ne comprende pas of course you dont johnson said listen how many people in cold sleep is this ship carrying seventeen flynn answered or was it fortysix thousand i forget heh johnson said funny but the point is you dont know for sure i dont either and neither do the lizards what looks like space for people in cold sleep could be space for the herb just as easily you have a low nasty suspicious mind flynn told him why thank you johnson said i dont know why not thank me johnson scowled id throw something at you but i might miss you and hit something valuable instead flynn assumed a look of injured innocence by his face his innocence had suffered enough injuries to end up on the critical list then he said you know if you keep speculating about all these things we havent got you wont make our esteemed and benevolent commandant very happy with you whos going to tell him johnson asked you certainly not mickey flynn replied but the walls have ears the ceilings have eyes and the floors probably have kidneys or livers or something else you wouldnt want to eat unless your stomach were rubbing up against your backbone walls with ears were a cliche ceilings with eyes at least made sense as for the rest your mother dropped you on your head when you were little only when i needed it flynn said of course there were times when she needed to be retrained or was that restrained amazing how ones entire childhood can revolve around a typographical error thats not all thats amazing johnson said darkly but flynn took it for a compliment which spoiled his fun over the next few days he wondered if the commandant would summon him to his office to give him a roasting then when that didnt happen he wondered why it didnt because the admiral peary carried no ginger and the idea that it might was ridiculous or because the ship was full of ginger and the less said about the herb the better the one thing that didnt occur to johnson was that healey hadnt heard his speculation the floors did indeed have kidneys or maybe livers dr blanchard worked with grim intensity in the exercise chamber doing her best to build up her strength for the trip down to the surface of home johnson spent stretches on the exercise bicycle too but he didnt get excited about them the way she did he was in pretty good shape for a man whod spent the last twenty years of his life weightless he could exercise till everything turned blue and not be fit enough to face gravity he said i wish theyd send one of the other docs down not you why she demanded working the bicycle harder than ever so that her sweaty hair plastered itself against the side of her face ill be damned if i want to go through all this crap for nothing well i can see that he said pedaling along beside her at his own slower paceone of the great advantages of a stationary bike but youre a hell of a lot better looking than they are not right now im not she said which wasnt true at least not to someone of the male persuasion she added besides i must smell like an old goat which was johnson denied it anyway saying im the old goat what you are is a guy with too much time on his hands she said exercise more thatll help some thanks a lot he muttered some problems you know youre not really looking for a cure well youd better be dr blanchard said and that was effectively that i greet you ambassador atvar told sam yeager when he met the big ugly in the hotel conference room and i am pleased to tell you congratulations are in order and i greet you i also thank you what kind of congratulations fleetlord the american tosevite inquired your petition for an audience with the emperor has been granted atvar answered this news comes through me and not directly to you because i have been appointed your sponsor so to speak that is excellent news excellent sam yeager not only used an emphatic cough he also got out of his chair and bent into the posture of respect i am in your debt for the help you gave me ah what does being a sponsor entail he was pleased atvar knew that but the wild big ugly was not overjoyed as a proper citizen of the empire would have been he was just pleasedmuch too mild a reaction his question though was reasonable enough atvar said a sponsor does about what you would expect he trains his hatchlingthat is the technical termin responses and rituals required in the audience if the hatchling disgraces himself the sponsor is also disgraced not all those who win audiences have a sponsor getting one is most common among those least likely to have their petitions accepted and so least likely to be familiar with the rituals among the poor and the ignorant eh sam yeager laughed in the noisy fashion of his kind which am i you are ignorant of course ambassador will you deny it atvar said i suppose i was chosen as your sponsor not only because i know you but because i am familiar with tosevites in general and because i have had a recent audience with his majesty i will do my best to help you avoid the pitfalls again i thank you sam yeager said i do hope the race will remember that i really am ignorant that i am only a poor stupid wild big ugly who knows no better if i make a mistake i will not be doing it on purpose i believe that is understood yes atvar said if the emperor and his court did not understand it your petition would have been rejected good the tosevite paused and something else occurs to me the emperor ought to grant kassquit an audience that took atvar by surprise both his eye turrets swung sharply toward yeager interesting he said why do you propose this for the good of the empireand for kassquits own good sam yeager answered she is a citizen of the empire after all and she is proud of being a citizen of the empire the empire might do well to show that it is proud to have her as a citizen what an interesting idea indeed atvar said you realize we may do this and use it in propaganda aimed at the tosevites under our control on tosev it would show them they can truly become part of the empire themselves oh yes i realize that the wild big ugly replied i will take my chances nonetheless for one thing it will be more than twenty of your years before those pictures arrive at tosev he stopped atvar eyed yeager with amused scorn the tosevite thought of the interval signals took to go from home to tosev as a long time if it wasnt happening right now it wasnt real for a big ugly but then atvar looked at sam yeager in a different way say what you would about him he was not a fool and you said for one thing ambassador but you did not go on with any more after the first what were your other points ah you noticed did you sam yeager shrugged well i suppose i can tell you my one other point would have been simply that kassquits audience with the emperor might do you less good than you would expect if you were to broadcast it widely in the areas of tosev that you rule oh and why do you say that atvar wondered if yeager was going to try to spout some persuasive nonsense to keep the race from doing what was really in its best interest to do but the wild big ugly answered because you will be photographing a tosevite female without her wrappings this will perhaps arouse some of your audience it will scandalize a great deal more i suspect though that it will have the desired effect on very few atvars hiss of dismay was altogether heartfelt i had forgotten about that he admitted you are a very clever tosevite sam yeager shook his head atvar understood the gesture the american big ugly said not at all fleetlord but i do know my own kind i had better would you not agree well perhaps atvar said which made sam yeager come out with another of his noisy laughs but then the fleetlord brightened i may be able to persuade her to wear wrappings for the purpose of the audience good luck sam yeager said at first atvar thought he meant that sincerely then he suspected irony judging such things when they came from one of another species another culture was never easy and then atvar thought about how stubbornly kassquit had refused to wear wrappings when the wild big uglies asked it of her she was proud to be a citizen of the empire and would not want to conform to the usages common among wild tosevites she did not seem to notice that her stubbornness was one of the most tosevite things about her maybe i can persuade her atvar said at last an audience with the emperor would be something she highly desired that is a truth sam yeager said but she would desire it as a citizen of the empire would she desire it as nothing but a propaganda tool i think finding out may be worth my while atvar said if you will excuse me he rang up kassquit on the conferenceroom phone yes exalted fleetlord i would be pleased to see you she said her intonation when speaking the races language differed only slightly from sam yeagers he had a language of his own she didnt but her tosevite mouthparts were the most important factor in determining how she sounded atvar said his farewells to yeager and went up to her room it had he saw been modified in the same ways as had the wild big uglies that made sense biology outweighed culture when it came to comfort i greet you atvar said i hope all is well as well as it can be when one is neither azwaca nor fibyen kassquit replied how may i help you today how would you like to present yourself before the emperor atvar asked kassquits small narrow immobile eyes widened that was a sign of astonishment in tosevites citizen of the empire or not kassquit shared reflexes with the rest of her species only natural atvar thought kassquit said there is nothing i would like better exalted fleetlord but why would the emperor wish to see one such as me what do you mean atvar asked though he knew perfectly well pretending he did not he went on are you not a citizen of the empire like any other you know what i am kassquit said bleakly i am a big ugly i am a citizen of the empire not like any other she had reason to sound bleak she was perfectly right as shed said she was a citizen of the empire unlike any other she was not and could not be a wild big ugly the race had made sure of that atvar sounded resolutely cheerful that is all the more reason for his majesty to wish to grant your petitionto show that every citizen of the empire is like every other citizen once out of the shell the cliche held good for members of the race for rabotevs and for hallessi it did not hold good for tosevites as atvar remembered just too late kassquit rubbed his snout in the mistake saying i remind you exalted fleetlord that i did not hatch from an egg well soon there will be millions of citizens who did not hatch from eggs atvar said resolutely you are the firsttruth but you will not be the last far from it he used an emphatic cough possibly not kassquit spoke with the air of one making a great concession then she hesitated would my audience be used for propaganda purposes with the wild big uglies on tosev she might have beenshe wasbetwixt and between but that did not make her a fool atvar reminded himself of that once more had she been less bright she would have had much more trouble coping with her situation than she did in fact cautiously the fleetlord answered it might that would depend in part on whether you are willing to put on wrappings for the occasion an unwrapped female might cause more ah controversy than approval among the wild tosevites kassquit made the negative gesture why should i accommodate myself to the prejudices of barbarians she demanded i am a citizen of the empire let the wild big uglies see what that means she did not use an emphatic cough her words were quite emphatic enough atvar answered her question though no doubt shed posed it rhetorically why should you accommodate yourself to barbarians because in so doing you would serve the empires interests but kassquit used the negative gesture again the empire should not accommodate itself to the wild big uglies either it should find ways to get them to accommodate themselves to it having them see another tosevite treated as an equal here on home would go some way toward that end atvar said then let them see me treated as an equal and not artificially wrapped kassquit said firmly if the emperor is willing to accept my petition under those circumstances i will submit it if notshe shruggednot submit it in any case atvar urged his majesty and the court may well accept it come what may simply because of the services you have already rendered the empire he was careful not to say the race well then it shall be done exalted fleetlord and i thank you for the suggestion kassquit said sam yeager urged me to propose this to you atvar said knowing she would hear as much from one of the wild big uglies if not from him his opinion is that your petition will probably be accepted whether or not you wear wrappings he is a clever male i hope he is right here kassquit said in my opinion he probably is atvar said the emperor should have a special interest in meeting a tosevite subject especially as he will also be meeting with the ambassador from these independent big uglies i would hope he might accept my petition even if i were not but kassquit broke off and made the negative gesture that is pointless i am a special case i have been made into a special case and i can do nothing about it no matter what i hope for there is no point to hoping for normality if i could tell you you were wrong i would but you are right and telling you otherwise would be not only pointless but untrue atvar said since you are special however you should exploit that for all it is worth that no doubt is a truth kassquit replied it is a truth i have been reluctant to use however i do want to be valued for myself not as as a curiosity you might say there will be many more tosevite citizens of the empire in years to come atvar said there may even be some on tosev now but i do not think there will ever be another one as completely acculturated as you are i would disagree with you kassquit said some hundreds or thousands of years from now after tosev is firmly incorporated into the empire all the big uglies there will be as i am i have my doubts about that atvar said thanks to ginger and to the strong native civilizations i suspect tosev will always be something of a special case a world apart in the empire tosevite cultures will not be subsumed to the same degree as those of the rabotevs and hallessi have been and of course i knew nothing of any tosevite culture when i was a hatchling kassquit said i thought of myself as a misshapen female of the race i kept wishing i would grow scales and eye turrets when it did not happen i wondered what i had done to be so bad atvar had authorized ttomalss experiment with kassquit hed followed it with interest not only had it been interesting it had also been necessary hed always been convinced of that up till now hed never felt guilty about it he wondered why not write your petition he said i fear we have done you an injustice in the past one we cannot possibly make up to you but what we can do we will by the emperor by the spirits of emperors past i promise you that yes of course ttomalss said in some surprise staring at kassquits image in the monitor i would be pleased to review your petition for an audience with the emperor but why if you do not mind my asking is this the first that i have heard of your submitting such a petition fleetlord atvar suggested that i do so kassquits features showed no expression but excitement sang in her voice he said he had the idea from sam yeager the wild big ugly reasoned that if the emperor would consent to see him he might also consent to seeing a tosevite citizen of the empirethe tosevite citizen of the empire now living on home ttomalss didnt need to think that over for very long before deciding sam yeager was bound to be right the propaganda value of such an audience was obviousonce someone pointed it out ttomalss tailstump quivered in agitation i should have thought of this for myself truthyou should have kassquit could be particularly liverless when she chose she went on but as long as someone has thought of it who does not matter very much may i bring you the petition now please do ttomalss said trying his best to hide the vaguely punctured feeling he had i am sure you will have written it out without a flaw after all the language we are speaking the language we both write is as much yours as mine so it is superior sir kassquit said for better and for worse so it is i will be there very shortly she was as usual as good as her word when the door button hissed ttomalss let her in i greet you he said and i greet you she replied bending into the posture of respect then she handed him the papers please tell me if everything is in order certainly ttomalss eye turrets flicked back and forth back and forth as he read through the petition when he looked at it he saw nothing that showed a big ugly rather than a female of the race had written it he occasionally raised one eye turret to look at kassquit she was of course what she had always been physically she was a tosevite culturally she belonged to the empire as far as i can see this is perfect i congratulate you i thank you kassquit said i am given to understand sam yeager had some trouble completing his petition ttomalss said i have spoken to him about this while i was preparing mine kassquit replied he tells me he has some trouble with formal written composition in a language not his own he is certainly fluent enough while speaking and in informal postings on electronic bulletin boards yes that is a truth ttomalss agreed back on tosev sam yeager had electronically masqueraded as a member of the race for some time before kassquit realized what he was the big uglies generally speaking were better at languages than the race they had to be with so many different tongues on their planet the last time the race had had to deal with languages other than its own was during the conquest of halless and that was ten thousand years ago now except for a handful of scholars no one knew anything about the hallessi languages any more that of the race had supplanted them within a few centuries after the conquest however much ttomalss hoped that would happen on tosev he had his doubts about whether it would english in particular was flourishing like a weed members of the race had had to learn it not to administer a conquered people but to treat with equals conservatives balked at doing so and more and more often were getting left behind kassquit said since you confirm that this petition is in proper format and correct superior sir i am going to give it to fleetlord atvar in the hope that his name will help win approval for it that jabbed a dagger of jealousy under ttomalss scales kassquit was his protegee not atvars a moments thought made him see the sense of kassquits plan atvar had recently earned an imperial audience himself he was serving as sam yeagers sponsor preparing the wild big ugly for his encounter with the th emperor risson that all had to mean the imperial courtiersand perhaps even the emperor himselfthought well of the former fleetlord of the conquest fleet ttomalss had petitioned for an imperial audience not long after coming back to home the court had not accepted his petition that hadnt left him particularly downlivered he knew how many petitions were submitted how few accepted still he had not imagined that the big ugly hed raised from a hatchling might win an audience ahead of him she was a grown individual now tosevite literature was full of references to generational struggles to young asserting their authorityno their right to wield authorityagainst those who had raised them such conflicts were much less common among the race where hatchlings were physically able to care for themselves at an early age and where those who mated to produce them were unlikely to be the ones who reared them such different social structures were bound to make acculturation more difficult that had been obvious since early in the invasion what ginger did to the race and its mating patterns though came as a rude surprise and the races adoption of tosevite institutions on tosev reversed tens of thousands of years of precedent such adoptions made thoughtful observersor perhaps just worried observerswonder which was in fact the dominant species on tosev that had nothing to do with the big uglies rapidly advancing technology either it was an altogether separate concern just what we need ttomalss thought sourly he returned the petition to kassquit she left his room he went back to trying to figure out just where the tosevites stood in terms of technology were the races experts right to be as alarmed as they were or were they even underestimating the danger because of their unfamiliarity with so much of what was being printed in tosevite scientific journals and what was not being printed in those scientific journals what were the big uglies trying to keep secret penetrating their computer networks was far harder now than it had been even when ttomalss went into cold sleep when the conquest fleet arrived the big uglies had had no computer networks theyd had no computers not in the sense that the race did we should have knocked them flat ttomalss thought not for the first time we almost did we should have finished the job i think we could have he laughed not that it was really funny shiplord straha had urged an allout push against the big uglies most males in the conquest fleet had reckoned him a maniacal adventurer he hadnt succeeded in toppling atvar and imposing his program in hindsight it didnt look so bad could things have turned out worse had straha got his way ttomalss made the affirmative gesture if tosev taught any lesson it taught that things could always turn out worse i told you so would have been a good title for an autobiographical account written by the planet itself ttomalss laughed again this time at the conceit but it wasnt really funny either no one whod left home for tosev in the conquest fleet had dreamt the big uglies would be able to put up a hundredth of the fight they had no one whod been on tosev at the time of the invasion would have dreamt the big uglies would have interstellar travel within a males lifetime but here they were where will they be in one lifetime more ttomalss wondered uneasily that led to another question will they be anywhere at all atvar had always considered the possibility of a war of extermination against the tosevites to make sure they could not threaten the empire even if they took the technological lead he would have left his plans behind for reffet and kirel he would have left those plans behind yes but would the current commanders have the nerve to use them both males struck ttomalss as less resolute than atvar every day they waited though made a successful cleansing less certain even if we try to annihilate the big uglies could we do it ttomalss shrugged he was no soldier and he had incomplete data thanks to the limitations light speed caused everyone here on home had incomplete data about tosev the trouble there was not everyone seemed to realize it males and females here were used to change that stretched over centuries and didnt stretch very far even in such lengths of time tosev wasnt like that no matter how much trouble members of the race whod never been there had remembering as much and more and more ttomalss was growing convinced that even the males and females of the race who actually lived on tosev were operating on incomplete data in their evaluation of what the big uglies were up to part of that was the races trouble with languages not its own part the different mathematical notation the tosevites used and part he suspected was a case of willful blindness if you didnt believe down deep in your liver that another species could come to know more than you did how hard would you look for evidence that that was in fact coming to pass not very he feared he checked his computer and telephone records to see whether pesskrag had ever called him back as hed thought no he made a note to himself to call the physicist soon having made the note he looked at it and deleted it delay was the very thing hed worried about and there he was telling himself to delay instead of waiting he telephoned pesskrag that very moment it did him no good he got the females outofoffice announcement he recorded a message of his own finishing i hope to hear from you soon the more time goes by the more i am convinced this issue is urgent pesskrag did call back the next day and found ttomalss in his room she said i apologize for not getting back to you sooner senior researcher i will blame part of the delay on the mating season which always disrupts everything truth ttomalss admitted what he could hardly deny but it is over now what have you and your colleagues done with the data i provided you we are still evaluating them trying to decide if they can possibly be credible we are making progress on the notation the physicist answered the mathematics does appear to be internally consistent but that does not make it easy to follow or easy to believe can you test it experimentally ttomalss asked you were hoping to do that when we spoke last and we still hope to pesskrag said but funds permissions and equipment have all proved harder to get than we expected i see ttomalss said and he did he saw that the race would go at its own pace nothing would hurry it normally that was good if it really needed to hurry maybe the lessons it most needed to take from the big uglies had nothing to do with technology kassquit came down to the refectory walking on air several of the american tosevites were there eating breakfast kassquit wished her features could match the mobility theirs had since they couldnt she had to show her happiness in other ways she went up to sam yeager and bent into the posture of respect before him i thank you ambassador she said and added an emphatic cough for what sam yeager asked before she could answer though he pointed to her they accepted your petition for an audience with the emperor they did kassquit made the affirmative gesture i thank you so much for suggesting it this is probably the proudest day of my life i am pleased for you and i congratulate you the whitehaired big ugly said if he would see me i thought it was likely he would see you too after all you are one of his and i am not to meet the emperor kassquit exclaimed to show i really am a citizen of the empire she wondered if the wild tosevites truly understood how important and exciting this was for her whether they did or not they congratulated her warmly frank coffey said this must mean a great deal to you even if it would not mean so much to one of us truth that is a truth kassquit said the dark brown big ugly did see what was in her liver intellectually at least if not emotionally what could be a greater mark of acceptance than an imperial audience ahacceptance now coffey made the affirmative gesture acceptance is something i can appreciate to show how much he could appreciate it he too added an emphatic cough for me researcher what showed i had truly been accepted by my society was getting chosen to join the crew of the admiral peary tom de la rosa laughed a loud tosevite laugh oh yes frank this does show acceptance he made his emphatic cough ironic at the same time everyone back in the united states loved you so much you got sent all these lightyears just so you could be part of the society there even kassquit saw the joke in that the american tosevites all thought it was very funny frank coffey laughed as loud as any of the others he said that sounds ridiculous i know it sounds ridiculous but the odd thing is no matter how ridiculous it sounds it is a truth and an important truth had i been less of an equal i would still be back on tosev and you would probably be having more fun back there than you are here too de la rosa replied maybe i would of course i would be old back there and i am not so old here coffey said this has its compensations if not for cold sleep i would surely be dead sam yeager said given the choice i prefer this kassquit said and you will also go before the emperor well so i will but i have to tell you i know it means less to me than it does to you the american ambassador said for one thing i have already met several of our notemperorspresidents we call them i have heard the word yes kassquit said coolly did he really imagine a big ugly chosen by snoutcounting was the equal to the emperor by all the signs he did however absurd she found the notion he said there is something else too something that shows how different from the empire we truly are here the goal is to meet the emperor in the united states the goal is to become the president do you see what i mean now kassquit had to try to understand emotionally something that was plain enough intellectually american big uglies could aspire to become the ruler of their notempire she knew those notemperors ruled for only a limited period and had other checks on their power even so she tried to imagine a male or female of the race setting out to become the emperor the picture refused to form in her mind oh such things had happened in the days of ancientest history though they werent much mentioned in the lessons hatchlings learned at school and once even after home was unified a deranged male had tried to murder an emperor that was mentioned even less often but that a member of the race a rabotev a halless or even a tosevite could aspire to supplant the emperor and rule the empire now automatically her hand shaped the negative gesture she said i do not believe your notemperors have control over the afterlife as well as this life well no neither do i though some of them would probably be happy enough to claim authority like that sam yeager said the other american big uglies laughed again which was the only thing that told kassquit he didnt mean it he went on and what you need to grasp researcher is that i do not believe your emperors have control over the afterlife either the races language did not have a word precisely equivalent to blasphemy it had never needed a word like that because the idea of denying that the spirits of emperors past controlled the existence yet to come had not hatched on home but even without a word for it kassquit understood the idea as soon as she heard it she said many billions of individuals of several different species have accepted what you reject that didnt faze sam yeager he said a great many individuals have believed a great many things that eventually turned out not to be so he held up a hand before kassquit could speak i do not say this is true for the spirits of emperors past i say it may be true as far as i know no one has found a way to bring certain truth back from the next world so many who have believed make a strong argument for truth all by themselves she said no he shook his head before remembering and using the races negative gesture as i said before many can believe something that is not a truth on tosev for centuries most males and femalesalmost all in factbelieved the planet was flat and that the star tosev revolved around it instead of the other way round belief does not make truth evidence makes truth and belief does not make evidence had he been talking about anything but belief in the afterlife kassquit would have agreed with him without hesitation as things were as things were she held that belief in a mental compartment separate from the rest of her life and the rest of her attitudes almost every citizen of the empire did the same belief in the spirits of emperors past and in what they could do in the world to come was deeply ingrained in the race the rabotevs the hallessi and kassquit angrily she said how can you tell me the beliefs of many do not matter when your notempire counts snouts to run its affairs to her annoyance that did not irritate the wild big uglies it amused them jonathan yeager said she has got you there sire of mine oh no she is sly but she is not sly enough to trick a gamy old zisuili like me sam yeager answered he turned back to kassquit snoutcounting is not about evidence it is about beliefs there is no sure evidence for the future and providing for the future is what a government does there are only beliefs about what is likely to happen next and what ought to happen next when it comes to beliefs snoutcounting is fine but beliefs are not truths no matter how much you might wish they were he is right karen yeager said she of course could be counted on to side against kassquit she continued on tosev we have many different beliefs about what happens after we die they cannot all be true but how can we tell for certain which ones are false kassquits opinion was that they were all false and that citizens of the empire held the only true belief she knew she had no evidence for that though not evidence of the sort that would help her in this argument she did the best she could from what i have heard a growing number of tosevites are accepting the empires beliefs this is true not only in the regions where the race rules but also in your own notempire or is that not so the wild big uglies started laughing again kassquit was confused and furious at the same time before she could say anything more tom de la rosa said some american big uglies want to believe in the spirits of emperors past because they are not happy with the beliefs they had before some want to believe in them because they like to imitate the race any way they can and some want to imitate them because they are fools or do you have no fools in the empire we have fools kassquit wished she could deny it but the language of the race wouldnt let her it had the word and the word pointed infallibly to the thing besides anyone who saw a male or female of the race topped with red or green false hair almost infallibly spotted a fool with such dignity as she could muster she added but we do not believe the word applies to those who reverence the spirits of emperors past i do not believe it does either if they have been brought up in their beliefs since hatchlinghood de la rosa said but those who change their beliefs later in life those who change them as a big ugly changes his wrappingsindividuals like that are often fools he sounded reasonable kassquit cherished reason she clung to it clinging to it had helped her stay as close to sane as she had there were times when she wondered how close that was with her cultural and biological heritages so different was it any wonder her stability often balanced on the point of a fingerclaw the wonder perhaps was that she had any stability to balance here tom de la rosas reason threatened that stability the thought that her spirit would be sustained by the spirits of emperors past in the world to come had also helped sustain her when things did not go well in this world even the slightest hint that that might not happen left her feeling threatened frank coffey said pale tosevites used to believe dark tosevites were inferior just because they were dark some pale tosevites still believe that i used to believe it sam yeager said it was something i was taught from hatchlinghood but there is no evidence to support it and i hope i know better now i hope you do too coffey sounded jocular but he did not laugh he nodded to kassquit by your looks i would say you are chinese sam yeager said something in english coffey nodded again then went on he tells me you are pale tosevites have shown these misplaced beliefs against chinese too and chinese against pale tosevites tom de la rosa added it is not all the fault of my kind of big ugly a lot of it is but not all believe what you will kassquit said what i believe is i am proud to have been granted an audience with the emperor and come what may i will go right on being proud and she did lizards always stared at jonathan yeager and the other americans when they left their hotel for any reason jonathan didnt suppose he could blame them people had done plenty of staring at lizards when they first met them he hadnt because of what his father and mother did hed grown up around lizards and took them as much for granted as he did humans being neither a mad dog nor an englishman he tried not to go out in homes noonday sun oh it wouldnt have killed him any more than a hot summer day in los angeles would have it wasnt much over a hundred and as angelenos were endlessly fond of saying it was a dry heat but while that made it more or less bearable it didnt make it pleasant early morning was pleasant sitneff cooled down into the seventies at nightanother consequence of low humidity jonathan enjoyed going to the park not far from the hotel finding a bench in the shade of the shrubby treeish things and watching home go by lizards on the way to work drove past in cars and buses that didnt look too different from the ones he would have seen in the united states these were smaller because lizards were smaller they had smoother lines and the differences between one model and another seemed smaller than in the usa maybe he was missing subtleties or maybe because the race valued efficiency more than people did their vehicles just deviated less from ideal designs than human machines did males and females skittered by on the sidewalk too some of them no doubt on the way to work others moving faster for the sake of exercise some of the runners would stop short when they noticed him others would keep one eye turret trained on him till they got out of sight they would use the other eye to watch where they were going there they had an advantage over mankind it wasnt necessarily an enormous advantage as jonathan saw when a lizard watching him banged into another coming the other way watching didnt just mean seeing it also meant paying attention anyone of any species could fail that test other males and females trotted through the park some were regulars and had seen him and the other humans there before a few would call out i greet you tosevite as they went by jonathan always waved and answered when they did friendly relations one lizard at a time he thought every so often a lizard would stop what he was doing and want to talk the ones with wigs and tshirts were more likely to do that than the ones who didnt try to imitate people that made sensetheyd already proved their interest in mankind jonathan was glad whenever it happened it let himhe hoped it let himget an unfiltered view of what life on home was like maybe lizards who paused and came up to talk were government plants but jonathan didnt think so in the ussr or the reich he would have been suspicious of what strangers told him he didnt think the race was so sophisticated about propaganda one very ordinary unwigged unclothed lizard didnt seem sophisticated at all after looking jonathan over from head to foot his moving eye turrets made the process obvious the male said so you are one of those things they call big uglies are you jonathan hid a smile not that the lizard would have known what one meant he made the affirmative gesture yes i am a big ugly he agreed gravely do you by any chance know a male called telerep the lizard asked he went to tosev with the conquest fleet he was a landcruiser gunner and a friend of mine i am sorry but no sorry or not jonathan couldnt help smiling now for one thing i was hatched near the end of the fighting for another tosev is a planet the size of home even if it does have more water do you know where your friend served it might have been halfway around the world from me no i do not know that the male said tosev does not seem so big i often wonder what happened to telerep and if he came through all right he was a good fellow we had some fine times together i know a few males and females who have heard from friends who joined the conquest fleet but not many for most well it is a long way between here and your world that is a truth jonathan said when i see our sun in the night sky as just another star i realize how far it is tosev yes hard for me to think of it as anything but a star you understand the lizard said and jonathan made the affirmative gesture again the lizard went on we call the constellation tosev is in the sailing ship what is your name for it to us it is the herder jonathan answered that was as close a translation of bootes as he could manage in the lizards language of course when we see that constellation we do not see our own sun in it the lizard drew back half a pace in surprise then his mouth fell open that is funny i had not thought of it so but you would not would you what do you call the constellation in which you see our sun that is the whale jonathan told him he had to explain the key word which came out in english a whale is a large creature that swims in our seas your sun is dimmer than ours i mean no offense when i tell you it seems faint when we see it on tosev i understand the lizard replied even if you are a wild big ugly i must say you sound quite civilized i thank you jonathan replied not without irony so do you that line drew different responses from different lizards this one laughed once more and i thank you superior tosevite his mouth dropped down yet again are you a superior tosevite or an inferior tosevite you have only those wrappingsno body paint to let me see what your rank is he straightened a little to show his own paint to jonathan as you can tell i am an optician second grade actually jonathan couldnt have told that without a chart the races system of using body paint to mark social distinctions went back to before home was unified it had been getting more complex since the days when men werent even painting mammoths on cave walls every seniority level in every occupation had its own distinctive pattern and colors lizardsand rabotevs and hallessiread body paint as easily as they read the characters of their written language some humans were nearly that good jonathan wasnt bad but optician wasnt one he recognized offhand he said if i had body paint it would say i was an ambassadors assistant ambassador another laugh came from the lizard there is a very oldfashioned word superior tosevite there have been no ambassadors since the days of ancientest history again i mean no offense but i must tell you you are mistaken jonathan said on tosev there have been ambassadors to and from the race for nearly ninety yearsninety of ours twice as many of yours where independent empires and notempires meet as equals they need ambassadors independent empires and notempires the male echoed what an interesting phrase i suppose i can imagine an independent empire after all you big uglies did not know about the empire till we came but what might a notempire be how else would you govern yourselves well there are several ways jonathan said the notempire we are from the united states is what we call a democracy he said that word in english then returned to the races language that means giving all adult males and females a voice in how they are governed as best he could he explained voting and representative government snoutcounting the optician exclaimed when jonathan was done and tapped his own snout with a fingerclaw if jonathan had had a nickel for every time hed heard that derisive comment from a lizard he could have damn near bought the admiral peary this male went on but what happens when the males and females being snoutcounted make a mistake we try to fix it jonathan answered we can choose a new set of representatives if we are not happy with the ones in power what happens when your government makes a mistake you are stuck with itis that not a truth our government makes very few mistakes the lizard said on earth that would have been a boast with no truth behind it a boast the ussr or the reich would have made here on home it might well have been true but very few mistakes were different from no mistakes at all jonathan said i can think of one mistake your government made speak what could that be the male asked plainly doubting it was anything of much weight trying to conquer tosev jonathan answered the lizard said well that may be a truth superior big ugly yes it may be actually i would say trying was not the difficulty i would say the difficulty was failing a nice point jonathan smiled again are you sure you are not an attorney one of the opticians eye turrets rolled downward as if he were examining his own body paint no i seem to be what i am so you tosevites make jokes about attorneys too do you we say they are the only males and females who can go into a revolving door behind someone else and come out ahead he and jonathan spent the next ten minutes trading lawyer jokes jonathan had to explain what a shark was before the one about professional courtesy made sense to the lizard once the male got it his mouth opened enormously widethe races equivalent of a belly laugh he said if you big uglies tell stories like those you really will convince me you are civilized i thank you though i was not worrying about it very much jonathan answered back on tosev we have stayed independent of the race we have come to home in our own starship if things like that do not make us civilized can a few silly jokes do the job you never can tell the lizard answered that is a truth superior big ugly you never can tell those other things may prove you are strong jokes though jokes show you can enjoy yourselves and if being able to enjoy yourself is not a part of civilization what is jonathan thought that over then he got off the bench and bent into the posture of respect before the startled lizard he got sand on his knees but he didnt care that is also a truth and a very important one he said i thank you for reminding me of it happy to be a help the lizard said as jonathan straightened the male added and now if you will excuse me i must be on my way he skittered off down the path had he been an ordinary lizard in the street or had the government sent him by after thinking that over jonathan slowly nodded to himself a plant he judged would have been more likely to call him a tosevite all the time simply for politeness sake this male either hadnt known or more probably hadnt cared that big ugly might be insulting that argued that he was genuine jonathan hoped so hed liked him he went back to the hotel room to write up the encounter while it was still fresh in his memory in the room they shared karen yeager read her husbands notes get into a revolving door in back of you and come out in front of you she said we tell that one i know jonathan answered we cant swap dirty jokes with the lizards we too bad karen broke in i can just see a bunch of guys and a bunch of males standing around in a bar smoking cigarettes and trading smut men tell me gals dont talk dirty when guys arent around to listen to it jonathan said karen gave him a sour look because she couldnt he laughed told you so anyway we cant swap dirty jokes with the race because they dont work the way we do not for that but jokes about the way society goes alongthose are different i see karen went a little farther in the notes so he liked the one about professional courtesy did he i thought hed bust a gut jonathan answered i bet hell be telling it all over sitneff today changing the shark to one of their dangerous animals they dont have a lawyer joke just like that one the way they do with some of the others they dont have as many dangerous animals as we do either karen answered maybe thats why maybe they dont have as many dangerous lawyers with pretty good timing her husband shook his head nah not likely karen made a horrible face if you want to tell dumb jokes with the lizards thats fine kindly spare me it shall be done superior female jonathan said dropping into the language of the race he didnt bother returning to english as he went on when my father goes to see the emperor i wonder what we will be doing probably seeing the rest of the capital with trir or some other guide karen stuck to english perhaps incautiously she added we may not have kassquit with us for a while either shell be studying for her audience too jonathan nodded thats true i had nothing to do with it either dad suggested it to atvar and atvar suggested it to kassquit and it went from there i know did i say anything else karen knew her voice had an edge to it no you didnt say anything jonathan had heard it too but would you say anything if she were going to walk off a cliff id say goodbye but that wasnt what jonathan wanted to hear and would only start trouble she might have wanted to start trouble if hed sniffed after kassquit like a male lizard smelling a females pheromones but he really hadnt even if kassquit went right on showing everything she hadand even if thanks to cold sleep she literally was better preserved than she had any business being all that went through karens head in something less than a second jonathan probably didnt even notice the hesitation before she said kassquit isnt my worry here shes playing on the races team she wondered if her husband would push it any further he just said okay there were reasons theyd stayed married for thirty years not the smallest of them was that they both knew when they shouldnt push it too far i wonder whats happening back on earth right now karen said i wonder what the boys are doing theyre older than we are that seems very strange tell me about it jonathan said and she knew he wasnt thinking about kassquit any more their kids may have kids by now i dont think im ready to be a greatgrandfather yet if we ever do make it back to earth you may be able to tack another great onto that karen said her husband nodded she got up from the foamrubber seat and looked out the window when she first came down from the admiral peary shed marveled at the cityscape every time she saw it why not when her eyes told her she was on a brand new world now though she took the view for granted as shed take the view from the front window of her house back in torrance for granted it was just what she saw from the place where she lived familiarity could be a terrible thing when she said that to jonathan he looked relieved oh good he said i was afraid i was the only one who felt that way i doubt it i doubt it like anything karen said we can ask frank and the de la rosas at lunch if you want to i bet theyll all say the same thing probably jonathan said dad too i bet hes seen more different things out of windows than all of us put together he blinked if we make it back to earth hes liable to be a greatgreatgreatgrandfather you dont see that every day were going to be a bunch of rip van winkles when we get back to earth karen said if wed fallen asleep when your father was born and woke up when the colonization fleet got there wed think wed gone nuts jonathan excitedly snapped his fingers there were people like that remember a few whod gone into comas in the twenties and thirties and then they figured out how to revive them all those years later they didnt think theyd gone nutsthey thought everybody around them had invaders from another planet not likely then they saw lizards and they had to change their minds they made a movie out of that didnt they karen said with whatshisname in it now thats going to bother me i know the guy you mean her husband said i can see his face plain as if he were standing in front of me but i cant think of his name either gee thanks a lot karen said somebody down here will remember it jonathan said or else somebody on the admiral peary will and if they dont we can radio back to earth and find outif we dont mind waiting a little more than twenty years jonathan grinned youre cute when youre sarcastic cute am i she made a face at him he laughed at her she made another face they both laughed this time their marriage had its strains and creaks but they got along pretty well karen forgot to ask about the actor at lunch which only annoyed her more she remembered to try at dinner i saw that movie on tv linda de la rosa said it was pretty good who was the guy karen asked beats me linda said sam yeager said i remember that one too my old friends ristin and ullhass played a couple of the lizards they did all kinds of funny things to make a living once they decided they liked staying with us and didnt want to go back to the race karen knew ristin and ullhass too she hadnt recalled that they were in that movie she said but who the devil played the lead you know the doctor who was bringing those people out of their comas after all those years darned if i know her fatherinlaw shrugged tom de la rosa and frank coffey couldnt come up with it either tom did say the guy had that tv show for a while he frowned trying to dredge up the name of the show when he couldnt he looked disgusted thats going to itch me till i come up with it its been itching me all day karen said i was hoping one of you would be able to scratch it she threw her hands in the air in frustration theyd been speaking english they were talking about things that had to do with the usa not with the racewith the exception of sam yeagers two lizard friends they went on in english even after kassquit came into the refectory karen didnt know about the others but she thought of kassquit as more lizard than human most ways as usual kassquit sat apart from the americans but when they kept trying and failing to remember that actors name she got up and walked over to them excuse me for asking she said but what is this commotion about something monumentally unimportant sam yeager answered we would not get so excited about it if it really mattered is it a riddle she said no just a frustration he told her there was an actor in a motion picture back on tosev whose name none of us can recall we know the film it would have come out some time not long before i went into cold sleep because i saw it this is like having food stuck between the teethit keeps on being annoying did this film involve the race kassquit asked only a little sam yeager explained the plot in three sentences why kassquit didnt answer she went back to her supper and ate quickly queer thing karen thought she really isnt very human i just wish shed wear clothes she gave a mental shrug and started eating again herself she hardly noticed when kassquit left the refectory though she did notice jonathan noticing she was a little surprised when kassquit not only came back a few minutes later but also came over to the americans again james dean kassquit said pronouncing the name with exaggerated care everybody exclaimed she was right as soon as karen heard it she knew that frank coffey bent into the posture of respect how did you find out he asked it was in the computer network kassquit answered the race has a good deal of information on tosevite art and entertainment that concern it how wild tosevites view the race is obviously a matter of interest to males and females on tosev and also to officials here on home i hoped it might be so when i checked good for you linda said we thank you truth sam yeager said james dean yes that is the name when he first started out i could not stand him as an actor i thought he was all good looks and not much else i have to say i was wrong he kept getting better and better karen thought her fatherinlaws age was showing shed always admired deans looksalong with most of the other women in the englishspeaking worldbut shed always thought he had talent too it was raw talent at first she wouldnt deny that maybe that was why he didnt appeal so much to the older generation the generation that had cary grant and clark gable as its ideals but it was real and the rawness of it only made it seem more real and sam yeager was right about one thing hed got even better with age too bad you did not get to see some of the films he had after you went into cold sleep she said rescuing private renfall is particularly good the computer network mentions that film kassquit said it was set during the races invasion was it not she waited for agreement then went on it has been transmitted to home for study you could probably arrange to see it if you cared to films from our home sam yeager said that is good news he used an emphatic cough karen and the other americans all made the gesture of agreement when sam yeager let atvar into his room the fleetlord swung an eye turret toward the monitor what are you watching there atvar asked a film from the united states yeager answered until a few days ago i did not know any of them had been transmitted to home one of the actors here gives a truly memorable performance atvar watched for a couple of minutes rescuing private renfall had its original english sound track the race had reinvented subtitles to let lizards who didnt speak english know what was going on after a bit atvar said much of this is inaccurate you were a soldier yourself ambassador you will see the inaccuracies just as i do sam could hardly deny it hed noticed several he said drama compresses and changes do all of your films show reality just as it happened well no the fleetlord admitted but why do your filmmakers show the race as either vicious or idiotic we were doing what we thought was right when we came to tosev and we were doing it as best we could if we had been inept and vicious as this film shows us to be not a male of the race would have been left alive on your planet he was right about that too but sam said i have seen some of the productions your colonists made after they came to our world they are as unkind to tosevites as we are to the race will you tell me i am wrong he watched atvar squirm plainly the fleetlord wanted to as plainly he knew he couldnt with a sigh atvar said well perhaps neither you tosevites nor the race are as kind as possible to those who were after all opponents that is a truth sam said and turned off the video and now fleetlord i am at your service atvar made the negative gesture on the contrary ambassador i am at your service it is a great honor to go before the emperor it is almost as great an honor to help prepare another for an audience this says more plainly than anything else can that my conduct when i was in his majestys presence was acceptable and that he would be willing to have someone else imitate me try to imitate you you mean sam said i am only an ignorant big ugly i will do my best not to embarrass myself but i do not know if i can be perfect i fear i have my doubts whether or not you have confidence in yourself i have confidence in you atvar said you will do well you think like one of us when the time comes you will think like one of us in the emperors presence i hope so sam said atvar reminded him of one of his managers sending him in to pinchhit with the game on the line saying i know you can rip this guy and sometimes sam would and sometimes he wouldnt he always had hope he always had a chance he didnt always succeed if he failed here the consequences would be larger than those of striking out with the tying run on third base in the ninth and we do have these videos to take you through the procedure atvar said they are not of course videos of actual audiences but they should serve well enough for the sake of rehearsal real imperial audiences are very rarely televised it is possible that kassquits will be and i am certain yours will however as it marks an extraordinary occasion sam grinned crookedly not that the fleetlord was likely to note the nuances of his expression thanks a lot make sure you put no pressure on me am i going to have a billion males and females with both eye turrets on everything i do maybe more atvar said this would attract considerable interest among the race and of course this event would also be broadcast to rabotev and halless and i suppose to tosev as well but speed of light means viewers on other worlds will not see your performance for some years oh good sam said that means i would not be known as an idiot on four worlds all at the same time it would take a while for the news to spread atvar might not have recognized a crooked grin for what it was but he knew sarcasm when he heard it he laughed the simplest way not to have this problem would be to do well in the audience easy for you to say sam muttered darkly but then bones creaking he bent into the posture of respect i am at your service superior teacher let us watch these videos you can explain the fine points to an ignorant foreigner like me foreigner atvar repeated in musing tones you may have noticed some archaic words in gone with the wind well foreigner is much more oldfashioned than any of those if not for the conquests of the rabotevs and hallessi it would have entirely disappeared from the language this is not necessarily bad sam said we big uglies have always needed the word foreigners are the individuals you fight withwhen you are not fighting with friends and relations instead our conquest would have been easier if you had not fought among yourselves atvar said you already had armies mobilized and factories producing military hardware as fast as you could truth friends of mine were thinking about going to work in them when the race came sam said but nowthe videos it shall be done atvar said obedient and ironic at the same time he spoke to the computer and done it was sam watched the ceremonyor rather the simulation of the ceremonyover and over he could pause whenever he wanted go back and look at something again whenever he needed to and skip whatever he already had down after a while he said i notice the male playing the role of the emperor wears an actors body paint not the gold paint the real emperor uses truth in dramas and films we allow that only on a casebycase basis atvar replied here it was judged inessential everyone knows whom the male is impersonating whether the actual gold is seen or not he turned an eye turret toward sam i suppose you will mock us for this sort of discrimination not me yeager used the negative gesture instead of special body paint our emperors would often wear special wrappings that no one else was allowed to use that was one way you told emperors from ordinary males and females ermine the purple if you wanted to paint your belly gold instead why not he couldnt help adding in the united states though our notemperor is just an ordinary citizen with a special job snoutcounting atvar said disdainfully why you think this is a suitable way to rule a state of any size is beyond me why should a mass of males and females added together be wiser than the decision a ruler makes after consulting with experts in the field under consideration answer me that if you please first experts can be wrong too look what the race thought about tosev sam yeager said if that wasnt a baleful stare atvar sent him hed never seen one he went on and second fleetlord who says rulers who do not need to answer to those who chose them always consult with experts before they make their choices sometimesoftenthey just do as they please this is a truth for us big uglies is it any less a truth for the race perhaps a little atvar answered and sam thought he might have a point except during mating season lizards were a little calmer a little more rational than people as sam had seen both back on earth and here on home they made up for it then the fleetlord continued we are sometimes guilty of arbitrary behavior if you will tell me the snoutcounting united states is not also sometimes guilty of it i must say you will surprise me you have seen the contrary for yourself well so i have sam said gruffly hed almost paid with his neck for president warrens arbitrary decision to attack the colonization fleet we think our system does better than others in reducing such behavior though you have been snoutcounting for how long in your notempire atvar asked sam had to stop and think to him the bicentennial had happened quite recentlybut that ignored his cold sleep it was not a little more than five hundred of your years he answered atvars hiss was a small masterpiece of sarcasm when you have five thousandor better twentyfive thousandyears of experience with it then you may claim some small credit for your system meanwhile meanwhile shall we go back to preparing you for your audience with his majesty maybe that would be a good idea sam had no idea whether democracy could lead humans to a state stable for millennia like the empire he had no idea whether any system could lead humans to a state stable for millennia humans were more restlessly changeable than lizards or at least humans with cultures springing from western europe had been more restlessly changeable than lizards for the past few hundred years that wasnt always so elsewhere on earth it hadnt been so in western europe before say the fifteenth century either if the lizards had chosen to come not long after they sent their probe they would have won everything their livers desired that thought had given a lot of human statesmen and soldiers nightmares over the years atvar started the video again he made it pause in the middle of the ceremony in thoughtful tones he said i still do not know what we are going to do about the imperial laver and limner i am not going to go before the emperor naked yeager said that is not our custom and i am not going to wear the body paint of a supplicant i am not a supplicant i am the representative of an independent notempire a notempire with all the same rights and privileges as the empire has my president he used the english word which atvar understoodis formally the equal of the emperor you make too much of yourself here atvar said stiffly he is not as powerful as the emperor i did not say he was back on tosev we had many notempires and empires before the race came some were large and strong others small and not so strong but they were independent a strong one did not have the right to tell a weak one what to do that principle was part of why we were fighting a war among ourselves when you came the president is not as powerful as the emperor but he is independent of him and sovereign in his own land atvars tailstump wiggled in agitation i am not the one to answer this the protocol masters at the imperial court will have to decide do please remind them that the united states is an independent notempire yeager said males and females who have never been to tosev are liable to have a hard time understanding that on their own believe me ambassadori am painfully aware of this atvar replied i will tell them to consult their records from ancientest history from the days before home was unified when there were still other sovereignties here besides the empire i do not know what survives from those times but they will i thank you sam didnt want to push atvar too far not many lizards here on home had experience back on earth no point to antagonizing the highestranking one who did this is important for both my notempire and the race he knew more than a little relief when the fleetlord made the affirmative gesture kassquit told the video on her monitor to pause she asked atvar you say these are the same images sam yeager is using to prepare for his audience with the emperor yes that is correct the fleetlord told her if you practice diligently you should do well enough oh i will kassquit promised i can think of no greater honor than to have the imperial laver remove my ordinary body paint and the imperial limner put on the new to her surprise atvar laughed hastily he said i mean no offense researcher but your reaction there is the opposite of the wild big uglys he refuses to have anything to do with the laver and the limner what for a moment kassquit could hardly believe her ears shed never liked them the races hearing diaphragms were much neater whenever they told her something she had trouble believing she mistrusted them did i hear you correctly exalted fleetlord you did you must remembersam yeager was at pains to make sure everyone remembersthe american tosevites are not imperial subjects and are proud of not being imperial subjects the pride may be misplaced but it is no less real on account of that eventually they will outgrow their presumption kassquit said perhaps such is the hope at any rate atvars voice was dry meanwhile let me see you go through this section of the ceremony once more it shall be done exalted fleetlord kassquit bent herself into several positions related to but not identical with the posture of respect she looked to the left she looked to the right she looked behind her none of that was as easy for her as it would have been for a member of the race for she had to turn her whole head to do it since she did not have eye turrets as with her ears there were still times when she resented having physical equipment different from that of the race she did not let her resentment show though or even dwell on it for she had to concentrate on the responses she was supposed to make to courtiers who were not in fact in the hotel room with her when she finished she looked to atvar when the fleetlord did not say anything for some little while fear bubbled up in her had she made such a dreadful mess of it she hadnt thought so but how much did she really know every so often she got forcefully reminded that even if she was a citizen of the empire she was not a member of the race at last his voice neutral atvar said you did this without previous study of these videos yes exalted fleetlord kassquit replied unhappily i used sources that described the ceremony but i have not seen it up until now did i did i do it very badly to her astonishment atvar made the negative gesture no except that you have no tailstump to move to right and left to accompany your head you did it perfectly the protocol masters have assured me that this is no impediment you cannot move what you do not have i congratulate you and all the more so because you learned this on your own really kassquit said in amazement the fleetlord made the affirmative gesture again kassquit whispered i thank you for what atvar said yours is the hard work yours the achievement you receive the praise you have earned nowdo you know the next part of the ceremony as well as you know this one i i believe i do exalted fleetlord atvar swung his eye turrets away then aimed them both right at her a sign he was paying close attention let me see it shall be done kassquit went through the next portion she hadnt seen the videos for it and wasnt quite perfect atvar found a couple of small things to correct she said i will improve them before the audience that didnt seem enough so she added i will improve them before you see me again do not be upset atvar told her you are doing quite well believe me nowon to the portion that follows on to that portion they went kassquit imagined her way through the whole ceremony at last atvar said you have done everything very well up to this point now you have come before the emperors throne you offer him your greetings kassquit bent into the special posture of respect reserved for the emperor alone it was awkward for a toseviteher back was too straightbut she managed it atvar didnt criticize her so she must have done it right or right enough then he said now the emperor speaks to you how do you respond the emperor speaks to me kassquit quavered is that likely to happen it can happen atvar answered when i left home to take the conquest fleet to tosev my audience with his majesty was purely formal when i saw the present emperor not long ago there was some informal talk it is up to his majesty of course the present emperor i think is more inclined to talk than his predecessor was he would not care to talk to the likes of me kassquit said i am an individual of no importance there i would disagree with you atvar said you are not an individual of high rank but you are important never doubt it you are the firstso far the onlytosevite to be reared entirely within the culture of the empire you are the shape of the future we hope you are the shape of the future at any rate how could i not be she asked if things go wrong on tosev it would be all too easy for you not to be atvar answered there may be no tosevites following any cultural models in that case what do you think the odds are kassquit asked atvar shrugged a gesture the race and big uglies shared who can guess it all depends on how dangerous the wild tosevites become he did his best to brush aside the question that is not something on which it is profitable to speculate back to business should the emperor speak to you how would you respond exalted fleetlord i might be too much in awe to respond at all kassquit answered honestly well silence is probably acceptable but if his majesty does choose to speak to you i think he would hope for some kind of response atvar might have been trained as a soldier but he had learned a good deal about diplomacy too kassquit recognized as much if he speaks to me informally i suppose i will try to answer the same way she said since the setting would be informal i do not suppose i can know in advance just what i would say all right the fleetlord made the affirmative gesture that will do we do not expect miracles we hope for effort you need not worry on that score researcher you have made your effort very plain i thank you this is important to me kassquit used an emphatic cough to show how important it was good atvar used another one your loyalty does you credit it also does credit to ttomalss who inculcated it in you yes i suppose it does kassquit said please forgive me my feelings toward ttomalss are complex how so had the fleetlord made the question perfunctory kassquit would have given it the same sort of answer but atvar sounded as if he was truly curious and so she thought for a little while before speaking at last she said i think it is yet another conflict between my biology and my upbringing when wild big uglies are small they fixate on those who sired and hatched them this is necessary for them because they are helpless when newly hatched but the race does not form that kind of bond i should hope not atvar said our hatchlings can take care of themselves from the moment they leave the egg why not if they could not they would have soon become prey in the days before we were civilized yes i understand that kassquit said it is only natural that ttomalss should have had trouble forming such a bond with me i give him credit he did try but it was not natural as it would have been for wild big uglies and i noticed his incomplete successthings being as they are i could hardly help noticing i could hardly help resenting what he could not give me either all this was some while ago though atvar said surely your resentment has faded over the passing years to some degreebut only to some degree kassquit replied you will know i am sure that there have been times when ttomalss has treated me as much as an experimental animal as a friend or someone else with whom he should have forged a bond of trust this failure has naturally kept resentment alive in me am i an autonomous individual or only an object of curiosity you are both atvar said which struck kassquit as basically honestat least it was the same conclusion shed reached herself the fleetlord went on because of your biology and your upbringing you will always be an object of interest to the race by now i suspect you have also resigned yourself to this to some degreebut only to some degree kassquit repeated adding an emphatic cough to that for example the race held me in cold sleep for years instead of reviving me and letting me become acquainted with home this decision was made for me i had no chance to participate in it myself there is some truth in that but only some atvar said one of the reasons the decision was made for you as you say is that we admire your professional competence and value your ability in dealing with the wild big uglies we wanted to do our best to make sure you would be in good health when they arrived kassquit made the negative gesture you do not understand exalted fleetlord you did that for your benefit for the races benefit for the empires benefit and not for mine there is a difference like it or not the fleetlord sighed i can see that you might think so but are you not a citizen of the empire you have certainly said so often enough yes i am a citizen of the empire i am proud to be a citizen of the empire kassquit used another emphatic cough but does the empire not have a certain obligation to treat its citizens justly if it does not why is being a citizen any sort of privilege you are an individual by atvars tone he did not mean it as a compliment you alsoforgive mesound very much like a tosevite your species is more individualistic than ours maybe the empire needs more tosevite citizens kassquit said perhaps things here have been too tranquil for too long atvar laughed at her things have not been tranquil since we found out what wild big uglies were capable of they will not be tranquil again for a long time to come but you may be right i think his majesty believes you are that is part of the reason you are receiving this audience whatever the reason it is a great honor kassquit said shall we rehearse the ceremony again exalted fleetlord i want everything to be perfect she used yet another emphatic cough ttomalss liked talking with major frank coffey his reason for liking that particular american had nothing to do with the big uglys personality though coffey was pleasant enough it wasnt even rational and ttomalss knew it wasnt knowing as much didnt make it go away he liked coffeys color he knew exactly why too the officers dark brown hide reminded him of the greenbrown of his own scaly skin it made the wild big ugly seem less alien more familiar than the pinkish beige of the other american tosevites he wasnt of course ttomalss understood that full well understanding didnt make the feeling go away coffey got up from the chair made for a big uglys hindquarters in one of the hotels conference rooms he stretched and sighed it was kind of you to make this furniture for us he said but you would never get rich selling chairs back on tosev i am sure that is a truth ttomalss said some of the things tosevites make for the race are also imperfect no species can ever be completely familiar with another the rabotevs and hallessi still surprise us every now and again interesting and i believe you even different cultures on tosev run up against this same difficulty coffey said i am glad you said it too it brings me to one of the fundamental troubles in the relationship between my notempire and the empire one that needs to be solved speak give forth ttomalss urged is that not why you have come to solve the difficulties between the united states and the empire had he been a big ugly himself the corners of his mouth would have curled up in the tosevites facial gesture of benevolent amiability he liked frank coffey he also made the mistake of assuming that because he liked coffey the wild big ugly would not say anything he did not like coffey proceeded to disabuse him of that assumption the difficulty is that the race does not recognize tosevite notempires as equals he declared and added an emphatic cough this must change if relations between us are to find their proper footing he used another one but that is not so ttomalss protested we have equal relationships with the united states with the sssr with the nipponese empire with britaineven with the reich though we defeated it how can you complain of this very easily frank coffey answered you say that we are your equals but down deep in your livers you do not believe it can you tell me i am mistaken you thought from the beginning that we were nothing but swordswinging savages down deep you still believe it and you still act as if you believe it will you make me believe i am wrong ttomalss thought that over he did not have to think for very long the wild big ugly had a point the race was proud of its ancient longstable civilization what could wild big uglies be but uncouth barbarians who were good at fighting and treachery but very little else slowly the psychologist said this is perceptive of you how did you come to realize it frank coffey laughed a loud tosevite laugh it is plain enough to any tosevite with eyes to see and it is especially obvious to a tosevite of my color he brushed a hand along the skin of his forearm a gesture he made with the air of one who had used it before what do you mean ttomalss asked you will know that pale tosevites have discriminated against those of my color coffey said and waited ttomalss made the affirmative gesture the american went on this discrimination is now illegal in my notempire we are all supposed to be equal legally and socially supposed to be i say there are still a fair number of pale big uglies who would discriminate against dark ones if only they could get away with it these days showing that too openly is not acceptable in the united states but one of us usually has no trouble telling when pale tosevites have such feelings even when they try to hide them and so you should not be surprised when i recognize the symptoms of the disease in the race as well i see ttomalss said slowly how did you persuade the pale big uglies to stop discriminating in law against you darker ones discriminating in law frank coffey echoed that is a nice phrase a very nice phrase we had two advantages first the reich discriminated against groups it did not like discriminated very blatantlyand we were at war with the reich so whatever it did looked bad to us and became something we were embarrassed to imitate and then the race tried to conquer all tosevites to resist the united states had to draw support from all its own inhabitants discriminating in law became something we could not afford to do and so we stopped back in ancientest history i believe the race was also divided into subspecies ttomalss said but long years of mixing have made us highly uniform i suspect the same may happen with you coffey shrugged so it may but it will not happen soon even by the way the race reckons time during your mating seasons your males and females are not too fussy about mating partners that helps you mix with us it is different i suppose it would be ttomalss said so social discrimination also lingers in mating even though discrimination in law does not yes it does the american big ugly replied now i praise you for your perceptiveness not many from another culture from another biology would have seen the implications of that i thank you ttomalss said i have been studying your species and its paradoxes for some years now i am glad to be reminded every now and then that i have gained at least a little insight perhaps my close involvement with kassquit has also helped coffey nodded he started to catch himself and add the races gesture of agreement but ttomalss waved for him not to bother the tosevite said i can see how it might have kassquit is a remarkable individual you did a good job of raising her by our standards she is strangeno doubt of thatbut i would have expected any tosevite brought up by the race to be not just strange but hopelessly insane we are different in so many vital ways again i thank you and i will not lie to you raising kassquit was the hardest thing i have ever done ttomalss thought about what hed just said he had spent some time in the captivity of the chinese female liu han shed terrorized him addicted him to ginger and made him think every day in her clutches would be his last had raising kassquit been harder than that as a matter of fact it had is imperfect gratitude always the lot of those who bring up tosevites major coffey laughed again this time loud and long maybe not always senior researcher but often very often you need not be surprised about that how do those who raise hatchlings tolerate this ttomalss asked what choice have theyhave wegot the wild big ugly said it is one of the things that come with being a tosevite do you speak from experience have you hatchlings of your own yes and no respectively coffey replied i have no hatchlings myself i am a soldier and i always believed a soldier would not make a good permanent mate but you must recall senior researcheri was a hatchling myself i locked horns with my own father plenty of times locked horns ttomalss repeated this must be a translated idiom from your language does it mean to quarrel that is exactly what it means interesting when you tosevites use our tongue you enliven it with your expressions ttomalss said some of them i suspect will stay in the language others will probably disappear your language has done the same thing to english major coffey said we use interrogative and emphatic coughs we say truth when we mean agreement we use other phrases and ways of speaking of yours too languages have a way of rubbing off on one another you would know more about that than i do ttomalss told him our language borrowed place names and names for animals and plants from the tongues of rabotev and halless past that those tongues did not have much of an effect on it and of course the rabotevs and hallessi speak our language now and speak it the same way as we do you expect the same thing to happen on tosev dont you coffey said ttomalss made the affirmative gesture yes over the course of years it mayit probably willtake longer there than with the rabotevs and hallessi your leading cultures are more advanced than theirs were he held up a hand you were going to say something about your equality let me finish if you please it shall be done exalted researcher the wild big ugly said with a fine show of sarcasm by all means go on i thank you so very much ttomalss said matching dry for dry what i wanted to tell you was that the process has already begun in those parts of tosev the race rules that is more than half the planet your notempire may still be independent but you cannot claim it is dominant i do not claim that i never have the united states never has coffey replied but the race seems unwilling to admit that independence means formal equality the emperor may have more power than the president of the united states as sovereigns though they both have equal rank that notion revolted ttomalss it would have revolted almost any member of the race to say the emperor was no more than equal to a wild big ugly chosen for a limited term by snoutcounting was absurd even if it was true under the rules of diplomacy rules the race had had to resurrect from ancientest history and also to borrow from the tosevites it was still absurd that he should think so went a long way toward proving frank coffeys point if ttomalss hadnt spent so many years working with the big uglies he wouldnt even have realized that realizing it made him like it no better you are very insistent on this sovereign equality he said and so we ought to be coffey answered we spilled too much of our blood fighting to keep it you take yours lightly because it has never been challenged till now ttomalss started to make a sharp reply coffey was presumptuous if he imagined the american tosevites truly challenged the race at the last moment though the psychologist held his peace not for the first time dealing with the tosevites made him feel as if he were trying to reach into a mirror and deal with all the reversed images he found there that the american big uglies could be as proud of their silly snoutcounted temporary leader as the race was of the emperor and all the tradition behind his office was preposterous on the face of it to the race but it was not preposterous to the americans ttomalss had needed a long time to realize that the big uglies might be as wrong about their snoutcounting as they were about the silly superstitions they used in place of due reverence for the spirits of emperors past they might be wrong yes but they were very muchvery muchin earnest the race needed to remember that it made dealing with the american tosevites more complicated and more difficult but when dealing with tosevites what wasnt difficult karen yeager looked at her husband she said do you know what id do no but youre going to tell me so how much difference does that make jonathan replied with the resigned patience of a man whod been a husband for a long time she sniffed resigned patience wasnt what she wanted right now she wanted sympathy she also wanted ice cubes id kill for a cold lemonade thats what id do she declared now that you mention it so would i jonathan said but you havent got any and i havent got any either so were safe from each other anyway besides were more than ten lightyears from the nearest lemon a cold coke then a cold glass of ippafruit juice a cold anything ice water for heavens sake karen walked over to the window of their hotel room and stared out the alien landscape had grown familiar even boring who would have thought the race didnt know about ice they know they just dont care theres a difference jonathan said and besides we already knew they didnt care weve spent enough time in their cities back on earth he was right karen sniffed again anyhow she didnt want right she really wanted ice cubes she said they dont care what we like thats what the problem is they know we like cold things and they havent given us a way to get any you call that diplomacy some of them know we like ice yeah they know it here her husband tapped his head but they dont know it here he set a hand on his stomach they dont really believe it besides i can guarandamntee you theres not a single icecube tray on this whole planet and this is a real fortrue civilization karen exclaimed jonathan laughed but she went on dammit theres bound to be something they could use to make ice cubes gelatin molds maybei dont know but we ought to be asking for them whatever they are and for a freezer to put them in talk to the concierge jonathan suggested if that doesnt work talk to atvar if he cant do anything about it youre stuck the concierge was a snooty lizard named nibgris he understood about freezers the race used them to keep food fresh just as humans did but the idea that someone might want small bits of frozen water flummoxed him what would you use them for superior tosevite he asked using the honorific with the same oily false politeness hotel people laid on back on earth to make the liquids i drink colder and more enjoyable karen answered nibgris eye turrets aimed every which way but right at her that meant he thought she was crazy but was too polite to say so out loud how can a cold drink possibly be more enjoyable than one at the proper temperature he asked to tosevites cold drinks are proper she said what do you expect me to use to hold the bits of water he inquired i do not know karen said this is not my world it is yours i was hoping you might help me is that not why you are employed here perhaps superior female you might use a few tens of measuring cups nibgris mouth fell open in a laugh he didnt expect to be taken seriously karen didnt care what he expected briskly she made the affirmative gesture they would do excellently i thank you please bring a small freezer and the measuring cups up to my room at once the concierges tailstump quivered in agitation we have not got that many cups in the entire establishment do you suppose you could send someone out to buy them karen asked i am sure your government would reimburse you even if it did not though i doubt the expense would bankrupt the hotel nibgris jerked as if a mosquito had bitten him a sarcastic big ugly seemed to be the last thing he knew how to face it is not the expense he said plaintively it is the ridiculousness of the request is any request that leads to making a guest more comfortable ridiculous karen asked well no nibgris spoke with obvious reluctance people who worked in hotels always claimed their first goal was making their guests comfortable more often than not it was really making things more convenient for themselves that didnt seem much different here on home i would do it myself but i do not have any of your money karen said it would be a great help to me and to my mate and to all the other tosevites we would be most grateful she added an emphatic cough by the way nibgris tongue flicked in and out he cared nothing for humans gratitude but the resigned sigh that followed was amazingly manlike it shall be done superior tosevite i thank you karen said sweetly she could afford to be sweet now shed got what she wantedor thought she had nibgris took his own sweet time about having the lizards who served him bring up the freezer when karen called the next day to complain the concierge said my apologies superior tosevite but there has been a certain disagreement with the kitchens the cooks claim that anything connected with food or drink in any way is their province and they should be the ones to bring the freezer and the measuring cups to you i do not care who does it i only care that someone does it karen used another emphatic cough transfer my call to the head of the kitchens if you would be so kind i will see if i can get some action out of that maleor is it a female a femaleher name is senyahh nibgris transferred the call with every sign of relief senyahh seemed startled to see a big ugly staring out of the monitor at her yes you wish she asked in tones just this side of actively hostile i wish the freezer nibgris promised me yesterday and the measuring cups in which to freeze water karen was feeling just this sideor perhaps just the other sideof hostile herself snarling at one more lizard functionary was the last thing she wanted to do but by then she would have crawled through flames and broken glass to get her hands on ice cubes why do you think i am responsible for fulfilling nibgris rash promises senyahh demanded i see no necessity for such a bizarre request that is because you are not a tosevite karen said by the spirits of emperors past i am glad i am not too senyahh tacked on a scornful emphatic cough karens temper snapped by the spirits of emperors past senyahh i am glad of the same thing you would be as much a disgrace to my species as you are to your own the head of the kitchens hissed furiously ignoring her karen went on i expect the freezer and the cups inside of a tenth of a day if they are not here i shall complain to fleetlord atvar who has the hearing diaphragm of the present emperor once atvar is through with you you may find out more about the spirits of emperors past than you ever wanted to know a tenth of a day do you hear me she broke the connection before senyahh could answer as she angrily stared at the blank monitor she wondered if shed gone too far would fear of punishment persuade the head of the kitchens to do as she wanted or would senyahh decide atvar was unlikely to side with a big ugly and against a fellow lizard karen would know in a couple of hours being mulish jonathan askeda word he must have got from his father ill say the trouble karen had had poured out of her she finished do you think i antagonized the miserable lizard probablybut so what jonathan sounded unconcerned if you act like a superior the lizards will think you are it works the same way with us only a little less i think and if you dont have a freezer inside a tenth of a day you really ought to give atvar a piece of your mind hell back you do you think so karen asked anxiously you bet i do jonathan used an emphatic cough even though they were speaking english if he tells you no you can sic dad on him and youd better believe he doesnt want that karen judged jonathan was right atvar had enough important things to quarrel and quibble about with sam yeager that something as monumentally trivial as ice cubes would only prove an irritation if she were senyahh she wouldnt have cared to risk the fleetlords wrath time scurried on just beforejust beforethe deadline the races equivalent of a doorbell hissed for attention two lizards with a square metal box on a wheeled cart stood outside a cardboard carton full of plastic cups lay on top of the metal box you are the tosevite who wanted a freezer one of the lizards asked he sounded as if he couldnt have cared less one way or the other i am karen said well here it is he said and turned to his partner come on fegrep give it a shove as soon as we plug it in we can go do something else right fegrep said pretty crazy a freezer in a room and why does the big ugly want all those stupid cups hed just heard karen speak his language but seemed to think she couldnt understand it or maybe he just didnt care under other circumstances karen might have got angry as things were she was too glad to see the freezer to worry about anything else the workmales wheeled it into the room eased it down off the cart and plugged it in then they left karen opened the freezer it was cold in there sure enough she started filling the measuring cups full of water and sticking them inside the freezer ice cubes she told jonathan all we have to do is wait theyre round he observed how can they be ice cubes she corrected herself ice cylinders thank you mr websters dictionary of the english language her husband might have got angry too instead he took a bow as he must have known it would that annoyed her even more after she started making ice cubes she refused to think of them as cylinders she kept opening the freezer every so often to see how they were doing youre letting the cold air out jonathan said helpfully i know i am she answered i dont care ive been waiting all this time i can wait a little longer some small stretch of time after she would have had ice cubes if shed been patient she had them anyhow coaxing them out of the measuring cups wasnt so easy but she managed she put five of them in a glass of roomtemperaturewhich is to say lukewarmwater then waited for them to do their stuff after five minutes she rested the glass against her cheek for a moment ahh she said then she drank ahhhh she said shed never thought of ice water as nectar of the gods but it would do it would definitely do let me have some jonathan said get your own glass karen told him i earned this one he bent into the posture of respect and gave her an emphatic cough her snort turned into a laugh jonathan fixed himself a glass of ice water he made the same sort of ecstatic noises as she had she laughed again shed known he would atvar gave only half a hearing diaphragm to senyahhs complaints when the female finally paused to draw more air into her lung he cut her off hear me kitchen chief any reasonable requests from these tosevites are to be honored anydo you hear me senyahh glared at him out of the monitor i do not call a request for a freezer and a swarm of measuring cups reasonable exalted fleetlord members of the race were more patient than big uglies at times like this atvar wondered why let me make myself very plain any request is reasonable that does not involve major expensea yeartenths hotel revenues let us sayor danger to a member of the race anything within those limits your only proper response is it shall be done superior tosevite and then you do it that is outrageous senyahh exclaimed i am sorry you feel that way atvar replied but then your record at this hotel has been good up until now i am sure that will help you gain a new position once you are released from this one for you will be released from this one if your insubordination continues for even another instant do i make myself plain enough for you to understand kitchen chief you do you are not nearly so offensive as the big ugly i dealt with though senyahh said is that a resignation atvar asked with obvious reluctance the kitchen chief made the negative gesture no exalted fleetlord it shall be done she broke the connection atvar hoped he had put the fear for a happy afterlife into her he wouldnt have bet anything he worried about losing though if shed tried so hard to obstruct one tosevite request she was liable to do the same or worse with another some males and females enjoyed being difficult she might as well be a big ugly atvar thought his mouth fell open in a laugh a moment later he wondered why and snapped it shut that wasnt funny but the real trouble with the big uglies wasnt that they reveled in making nuisances of themselves the real trouble was that they were too good at it hed thought that too many times back on tosev that he had reason to think it here on home only proved hed been right to worry on the other world and that the males and females whod recalled him hadnt known what they were doing it proved that to atvar anyhow several of the officials whod ordered him back from tosev still held their posts by all appearances they were still satisfied theyd done the right thing that they now had to deal with big uglies here on home should have given them a hint that the problem on tosev hadnt been atvar it should have but had it not likely not as far as the former fleetlord could see the troublewell a trouble anyhowwith the big uglies was that they were too good at whatever they set their minds to the way kassquit and sam yeager were approaching their imperial audiences was a case in point he hadnt said so to either one of them but few members of the race could have matched how much theyd learned or how quickly he hissed softly that thought reminded him of something he had to do he called the protocol master in the capital the males image appeared on the screen this is herrep i greet you exalted fleetlord and i greet you protocol master atvar replied politely i wonder whether your staff has yet finished researching the question i put to you not long ago the time for the wild big uglys audience with his majesty fast approaches i am aware of that yes herrep said he was an old male older even than atvar and had held office a long time his scales had the dusty tone age gave them and sagged slightly on his bones because of their looser hides old males and females looked a little more like tosevites than younger members of the race did herrep went on i hope you understand this is a matter from the very ancientest days and not one to be researched in the same way as one from more recent times why not the fleetlord asked research is research is it not so it would seem to me at any rate but the protocol master made the negative gesture not necessarily for most research anyone with a computer connected to the network and a certain curiosity can do as well as anyone else but much of the material we are looking through is so old it never went into the computer network at all we have to locate it physically to make sure we do not destroy it by examining it and sometimes also to interpret it the language is so very old it has changed a good deal between that time and this atvar let out another low hiss this one of wonder i did not realize your material was as old as that you have my apology you might as well be dealing with the same sort of situation as the big uglies do when they go through their archives i do not know what sort of research the big uglies do or what sort of archives they have herrep said but i do know i have an answer for you or the beginnings of an answer do you atvar said eagerly tell me please however little i care to admit it your wild big ugly of an aspirant appears to be correct the protocol master replied the imperial laver and imperial limner are not involved in the ceremony when the representative from an independent empire greets the emperor in ancientest days before home was unified the emperor sometimes sent out ambassadors of his own to other emperors their lavers and limnersfor they too had such officialswere not involved either i thank you atvar said so independence is what matters i do not suppose that sam yeagers coming from a notempire would affect the situation a notempire herrep said please forgive me exalted fleetlord but i am unfamiliar with the term as best he could atvar explained the american tosevite penchant for snoutcounting the protocol masters eye turrets moved in a way that said the idea revolted him it revolted atvar too but the big uglies seemed to thrive on it herrep asked on tosev such a temporary snoutcounted sovereign is considered the equal of any other that is a truth you need have no doubt of it whatever atvar used an emphatic cough notempires are more common than empires there the united states is one of the oldest ones it has used this system for more than five hundred of our years herrep hissed scornfully and this is supposed to be a long time by our standards no by the standards big uglies use protocol master it is a fairly long time atvar answered you realize i would have to stretch a point and stretch it a long way to consider the representative of such a sovereign equal to an ambassador from a true empire herrep said there is no precedent for such a thing there may not be any precedent on home but there is a great deal of it on tosev atvar said the protocol master made the negative gesture on tosev there is precedent for fleetlords treating with such individuals there is none for the emperor to do so if you refuseand especially if you refuse at this stageyou offer the american big uglies a deadly insult this is the sort of insult that could prove deadly in the most literal sense of the word atvar said as for stretching a pointthere is all the tosevite precedent for empires dealing with notempires if we recognize the united states as independentand what choice do we have when it is we have to recognize that precedent too and remember the american big uglies are here they are also as formidable as that implies i do not want to do what is expedient herrep said i want to do what is right alarm coursed through atvar he wished hed never uttered the word notempire in the protocol masters hearing by the nature of his job herrep cared more for punctilio than for the real world the real world hadnt impinged on the imperial court for more than a hundred thousand years but it was here again one way or another herrep was going to have to see that carefully the fleetlord said if helping to ensure peace not just between two independent entitiesthat took care of empires and notempiresis not right what is and if you consult with his majesty himself i think you will find he has a lively interest in meeting the ambassador from the united states on the monitor herrep stirred uncomfortably i am aware of that i had for a moment forgotten that you were as well atvar almost laughed but at the last moment kept his amusement from showing that struck him as a particularly revealing comment the protocol master went on very well exalted fleetlord i have no good reason to accept tosevite precedents but you remind me i have no good reason to reject them either we shall go forward as if this wild big ugly represented a proper empire i thank you atvar said by the spirits of emperors past i think you are doing that which is best for the empire i hope so herrep said dubiously but i wonder about the sort of precedent i am setting will other wild big uglies from different notempires come to home seeking audience with his majesty should they have it if they do it is possible that they may replied atvar who thought it was probable that they would a starship from the sssr was supposed to be on the way in factbut then the sssrs rulers had killed off their emperor something the fleetlord did not intend to tell herrep if they succeed in coming here they will have earned it will they not one group of independent big uglies the nipponese have an emperor whose line of descent they claim runs back over five thousand of our years still a parvenu next to the emperor herrep said atvar made the affirmative gesture the protocol master sighed still i could wish they had got here first we shall just have to endure these others they are all nuisances whether they come from empires or notempires atvar said with a sigh of his own that came from years of experience much of which he would rather not have had he went on it may almost be just as well that many of them have kept their independence they are too different from us we had little trouble assimilating the rabotevs and hallessi and we thought building the empire would always be easy even if we do eventually succeed with the big uglies they have taught us otherwise you would know better than i herrep said aside from the obvious fact that snoutcounting is ridiculous everything i have seen of these big ugliesthe ones who have come to homesuggests they are at least moderately civilized atvar made the affirmative gesture oh yes i would agree with you the american tosevites sent the best they had i was not worried about their lack of civilization especially not here on home i was worried about how fast they progress in science and technology and about how different from us they are sexually and socially i do wonder if those two difficulties are related what could we do if they are as of now nothing has occurred to meor so far as i know to anyone else then why waste time wondering you are a sensible male protocol master of course this is what you would say atvar replied the trouble is the big uglies make me wonder about the good sense of good sense if that makes any sense to you by herreps negative gesture it didnt atvar wasnt surprised nothing about tosev really made sense to the race trouble oh yes tosev made plenty of trouble dr melanie blanchard and mickey flynn were floating in the admiral peary s control room when glen johnson pulled himself up there johnson felt a small twinge of jealousy listening to them talk as he came up the access tube he knew that was idiotic which didnt prevent the twinge yes dr blanchard was a nicelooking womanone of the nicerlooking women for more than ten lightyears in any directionbut it wasnt as if she were his and she would be going down to the surface of home before long a journey on which neither he nor flynn could hope to follow its too bad she was saying when johnson emerged that is really too bad what is johnson asked news from earth mickey flynn said johnson waited flynn said no more johnson hadnt really expected that he would with such patience as the junior pilot could muster he asked what news from earth an arab bomb in jerusalem killed dr chaim russie melanie blanchard said he was the grandson of dr moishe russie the man for whom the lizards medical college for people is named did you know this chaim russie johnson asked i met him once he was still a boy then she answered i knew reuven russie his father a little better hed married a widow she had a boy and theyd had chaim and another son of their own who i think was also a doctor and they were happy she shook her head reuven russie would have been up in his eighties when this happened so he might not have lived to see it for his sake i hope he didnt johnson nodded the news was fresh here but all those years old back on earth dr blanchard had taken that into account a lot of people didnt johnson said was the bomb meant for lizards or for jews who knows she answered i dont think the bombers were likely to be fussy they werent before i went into cold sleep anyhow no i suppose not johnson looked at flynn there were advantages to being out in the asteroid belt for so long news from earth had to be big to mean much to us when the lizards fought the nazis that matteredespecially because they blew up the germans spaceship the hermann goring flynn said yeah glen johnson felt a certain dull surprise that the name didnt rouse more hatred in him than it did back in the vanished age before the lizards came hitler had been public enemy number one and the fat luftwaffe chief his righthand man then all of a sudden the nazis and the usa were on the same side both battling desperately to keep from being enslaved by the race goring went from zero to hero in one swell foop if the germans started shooting missiles at the lizards more power to em and if theyd been building the missiles to shoot them at england or the russians well that was then and this was now nothing like a new enemy to turn an old one into a bosom buddy that was then and this was now now was unimaginably distant for anybody old enough to remember the days before the lizards came the most ancient of the ancient back on earth and a handful of people here whod cheated time through cold sleep he looked out through the antireflectioncoated glass that was home unwinding beneath him in its gold and greens and blues seas surrounded by lands not continents as islands in the world ocean the admiral peary was coming up toward sitneff where sam yeager and the rest of the american delegation were staying looks like a pretty good dust storm heading their way johnson said the goldbrown clouds obscured a broad swath of ground that kind of weather is probably why the lizards have nictitating membranes dr blanchard said gesundheit mickey flynn responded gravely ive heard the term before but i never knew quite what it meant why you sandbagging soandso johnson thought if that wasnt bait to get the nicelooking doctor to show off and be pleasant hed never heard of such a thing he only wished hed thought of it himself melanie blanchard was only too happy to explain its their third eyelid a lot of animals back on earth have them too it doesnt go up and down it goes across the eye like a windshield wiper and sweeps away the dust and grit oh flynn said he paused no doubt for effect i always thought it had something to do with cigarettes with cigarettes dr blanchard looked puzzled johnson did too but only for a moment then he groaned his groan made the doctor think in a different way she groaned too even louder flynn smiled beatifically he would have seemed the picture of innocence if he hadnt been so obviously guilty thats one more thing these evil people did when they shanghaied me johnson told dr blanchard i used to spend more of my time on earth than i did in space and i used to smoke so when they tied me up and carried me away on the lewis and clark i had to quit cold turkey take a good look at him flynn told the doctor can you imagine anyone whod want to tie him up and carry him away anyone in his right mind i mean she ignored that and replied to johnson in a way you know they did you a favor smoking tobacco is one of the dumbest things you can do if you want to live to a ripe old age lung cancer heart disease stroke emphysema all sorts of pleasant things can speed you out the door i liked it johnson said nothing like a cigarette after dinner or after he sighed it had been a very very long time since hed had a cigarette after sex he tried to remember just how long and with whom close to seventy years now even if hed managed to dodge a lot of them now mickey flynn surveyed him with an eye that if it wasnt jaundiced definitely had some kind of liver trouble he knew why perfectly well hed managed to hint about sex in front of dr blanchard if he hinted about it he might make her interested in it perhaps even with him or he might not doctors were unflappable about such matters and melanie blanchard didnt likereally didnt likecigarettes damn things stink she said been so long now since ive had one id probably say you were right johnson admitted but i sure used to like them lots of people did she answered lots of people back on earth are paying for it too back when disease was likely to kill you before you got old i dont suppose there was anything much wrong with tobacco something else would get you before it did but now that we know something about medicine now that most people can expect to live out their full span smoking has to be one of the stupidest things anybody can do johnson busied himself with looking out the window he hadnt had a cigarette in something close to fifteen years of body time if a kindly lizard offered him a smoke though he suspected he would take one a male of the race who hadnt been able to enjoy a taste of ginger in a long time probably felt the same way about his chosen herb johnson never got tired of the view one of the reasons hed become a flier was so he could look down and see the world from far above now he was looking down at another world from even farther above as such things went home was an earthlike planet a lot of the same geological and biological forces were at work both places but while the results theyd produced were similar enough for beings evolved on one planet to live fairly comfortably on the other they were a long way from identical the differences were what fascinated him he got so involved staring at an enormous dry riverbed he almost missed the intercom colonel johnson colonel glen johnson report at once to scooter bay one colonel johnson colonel glen johnson report at once to bye he said and launched himself down the tube hed ascended a little while before as long as nobody was screaming at him to report to lieutenant general healeys office hed cheerfully go wherever he was told hed go to see healey too he was military down to his toes but he wouldnt be cheerful about it goodyou got here fast a technician said when he came gliding up whats going on johnson asked we got a mayday call from the lizards if you can believe it the tech answered their stuff is good but it looks like it isnt quite perfect one of their scooters had its main engines go out not far from us were closer than any of their ships and they ask if we can bring the scooter crew back here till they make pickup ill go get em johnson said and started climbing into the spacesuit that hung by the inner airlock door he paused halfway through laughing he went on theyll fluoroscope every inch of those poor lizards before they let em into their ships gotta make sure they arent smuggling ginger you know well sure the technician said theyll probably send that rabotev for the pickup too he doesnt care anything about the stuffthough he might care about the money he can bring in for smuggling it theres a thought johnson finished getting into the spacesuit he ran diagnostic checks on the scooter as fast as he could without scanting them he didnt want to get in trouble out there and need rescuing himself when the outer airlock door opened he guided the scooter out with the steering jets the tech gave him a bearing on the crippled lizard scooter his own radar identified the target he fired a longish blast with his rear motor the admiral peary shrank behind him he used the lizards signaling frequency i greet you members of the race are you well do you need anything more than transportation this is a scooter from the tosevite starship come to pick you up partly by eye and partly by radar he decided when to make the burn that would bring him to a halt near the lizard craft in difficulties we thank you tosevite except for engine failure we are well the lizard whod answered was silent for a moment probably pausing for a rueful laugh these things are not supposed to happen they are especially not supposed to happen when you big uglies can make fun of us for bad engineering yours is better than ours and everyone knows it johnson peered ahead yes that was a scooter of the sort the race built nobodys engineering is perfect though we already know that too you are generous to show so much forbearance the lizard replied were our roles reversed we would mock you if you like you may think of me as laughing on the inside johnson said meanwhile why not leave your scooter and come over to mine once i kill my relative velocity i will take you back to my ship your friends can pick you up at their convenience it shall be done superior sir the lizard said by the way the two members of the race handled themselves as they pushed off from their disabled craft they were experienced in free fall johnson put one of them in front of him and one behind so as not to disturb his scooters center of mass too much as he burned for the admiral peary he made the same sort of remark he had with the technician they will fumigate you before they let you back on any of your own ships his passengers were silent they would have been silent if they were laughing too he looked at each of them in turn laughing they werent jonathan yeager was glad his father had talked the race into letting him and the rest of the american delegation come along to preffilo for the imperial audience and not only because a dust storm filled the air in sitneff with a brown gritty haze the humans had been to a lot of places on home but not to the imperial capital except for the trip to the park near the south pole jonathan had been less impressed than hed expected if youd seen one lizard city youd damn near seen them all they varied among themselves much less than american towns did figuring out why wasnt hard cities in the usa were only a few centuries old and showed wildly different influences of geography and culture cities here on home differed one from another in geography in culture not at all theyd all been part of the same culture since long before modern man took over from the neanderthals theyd all been improved and reworked time and again and they all felt pretty much the same preffilo wasnt like that anyhow jonathan had expected a bustling imperial capital something on the order of london in victorias day or moscow when he went into cold sleep but preffilo wasnt like that either home had its bureaucrats its males and females who ran things and they came to the imperial capital to hear their sovereigns wishes they didnt make a swarming mess out of the city though and the reason they didnt was simple the emperor didnt want them to in a way preffilo was like kyoto in the days when the emperor of japan was a figurehead and the shogun ran things it preserved the way things had been a long time before here a long long long time before back when what was now only symbolic had been real stretching earthly comparisons though went only so far the emperor here was no figurehead hed never been a figurehead notso far as jonathan knewthroughout the whole long history of the race most emperors tempered their authority with common sense it was a strong custom that they should the race respected custom more than any humans even the japanese did but there were occasional exceptions scattered through the lizards history some glorious othersrather morehorrible if an emperor wanted to stir things up he could along with feeling like the beating heart of a power greater than any earth had ever known preffilo also felt old even to the lizards for whom everything within the scope of written human history seemed no more antique than month before last their capital felt old some englishman had earned immortality of a sort by calling vanished petra a rosered city half as old as time it was immortality only of a sort for nobody bothered to remember the rest of the poem these days or even the englishmans name there were similar poems about preffilo in the language of the race the differences were twofold for one thing preffilo wasnt just half as old as time it had been a going concern for thousands of years before home was unified in those days mammoths and cave bears must have seemed about as likely to inherit the earth as skulking human beings and for another preffilo wasnt a vanished city it was still a going concern and looked forward to the next hundred thousand years with only minimal changes geography again played a role in that the races capital happened not to lie in earthquake country only how well a building was built said how long it would stay up the lizards commonly built very well along with the palace a fair number of structures in preffilo were supposed to be older than the unification of home going back to what the race called ancientest history jonathan was hardly in any position to disagree with what the guide told him the humans guide here was a male named jussop jonathan liked him better than trir he didnt seem to take questions as personal affronts the way she sometimes did of course not many folk came to see sitneff the tour guide business there was underdeveloped things werent like that in the capital lizards rabotevs and hallessi all visited here humans they might be out of the ordinary but jussop would accommodate them once they were settled in their hotel he took them to the mausoleum where urns holding the ashes of eons worth of past emperors were on display jonathan wasnt sorry to escape the hotel the race had tried to keep its guests comfortable but it hadnt done the best job in the world the rooms back in sitneff were a lot more inviting considering how much they left to be desired that wasnt good news even the little bus that took them from the hotel to the mausoleum had seats that fit human backsides worse than those on the bus in sitneff jonathan grumbled but in english his father might have been diplomacy personified ignoring the miserable seats sam yeager asked jussop how did you arrange for us to have a private viewing of the mausoleum i hope we do not inconvenience too many males and females who want to commune with the spirits of emperors past well you must understand i did not personally make these arrangements ambassador the guide replied sam yeagers title seemed natural in his mouth though except in historical fiction it had fallen out of the races language not long after the unification of home jussop went on his majestys government does wish to extend you every courtesy you must also understand it is not perhaps strictly a private viewing what does that mean karen asked sharply before jonathan could it was supposed to be jussop made a vaguely conciliatory gesture you will not be swarmed with these others who seek to commune with spirits of emperors past the other superior tosevite is right about that never fear he left it there in spite of other questions from the rest of the americans the bus rounded a corner and silently stopped the questions stopped at the same time thats amazing jonathan whispered the rest of the humans stared as avidly as he did if you had set the parthenon in the middle of an enormous japanese garden you might have created a similar effect the mausoleum didnt really look like the parthenon but it had that same exquisite simplicity nothing in excess and everything that was there perfect without being ostentatious the landscaping with open ground stones of interesting color and shape and a few plants strategically placed and intriguingly trimmed came a good deal closer to its earthly counterpart lovely sam yeager said to jussop i have seen pictures but pictures do not do it justice for some things only being there will do that is a truth ambassador the guide replied it is an important truth too and not enough folk realize it we walk from here as we go along the path the view will change repeatedly some even say it improves but the walk to the mausoleum is part of the experience you are all capable of it good it was somewhere between a quarter mile and half a mile the pathmade very plain on the ground by the pressure of who could say how many generations of feetwound and curved toward the entrance every so often jussop would silently raise a hand and wave to signal that they had come to a famous view the perspective did change did it improve jonathan wasnt sure how did you go about measuring one magnificence against another and then when theyd drawn close to the mausoleum the race proved it could make mistakes to match any mere humanity ever managed a hiss from behind made jonathan look back over his shoulder to see what was going on a horde of reporters and cameramales and females hurried after them on the path like a swarm of locusts some of the lizards with cameras wore wigs which seemed not just ridiculous butherea desecration is this building not marvelous one of the reporters shouted is it not inspiring another demanded does it not make you seek to reverence the spirits of emperors past a third yelled the closer they came the more excited and vehement they got a fourth reporter said tell me in your own words what you think of this mausoleum then without giving any of the americans a chance to use their own words the lizard went on do you not feel this is the most holy most sacred site on four worlds do you not agree that nowhere else is the same combination of serenity power and aweinspiring beauty would you not say it is unmatched in splendor unmatched in grandeur unmatched in importance get them out of here tom de la rosa told jussop before i pick up one of these sacred rocks and bash in their headsassuming they have any brains there which does not seem likely before the guide could do anything the reporters and camera crews had caught up with the humans the reporter who wanted to put words in everyones mouth thrust hisor possibly hermicrophone in jonathans face i will not comment about the mausoleum since i have not yet been inside jonathan said but i think you are unmatched in rudeness except possibly by your colleagues i am the ambassador his father said and the archaic word seemed to have some effect even on the jaded reporters sam yeager went on my hatchling speaks truth we did not come to this place for publicity we came to see what is here to see and to pay our respects to your beliefs even if we do not share them will you kindly have the courtesy and decency to let us do thatundisturbed but the public needs to know a lizard shouted this is not a public matter it is private strictly private jonathans father said and if you do not go away the protest i make when i have my audience with the emperor will be most public indeed jussop had been quietly speaking into a handheld telephone the races police were most efficient no more than two or three minutes went by before they hurried up to escort the reporters away come on come on one of them said the big uglies do not want you around this is not a traffic accident where you can ask bloodthirsty questions of some poor male who has just lost his best friend spluttering protests the reporters and camera crews reluctantly withdrew most reluctantlysome of them kept shouting inane questions even as the police pushed them away from the americans i apologize for that superior tosevites jussop said i apologize with all my liver i did not think it would be so bad maybe he was telling the truth maybe he wasnt short of making a worse scene the americans couldnt do much about it now major frank coffey said let us just go on then and hope the moment is not ruined it turned out not to be the only reason it turned out not to be was that the mausoleum was wonderful enough inside to take the bad taste of the reporters out of jonathans mouthand by what he could see from everyone elses too tau cetis buttery light poured through windows and glowed from granite and marble urns of hellenic simplicity and elegance but not of a shape any human potter would have chosen held the last remains of a couple of thousand emperors the sequence was spotty before home was unified it seemed to be complete after that nobody said anything for a long time people wandered where they would looking admiring even footfalls rang monstrously loud here because the americans were representatives of an independent country they had special permission to take pictures inside the mausoleum permission or not no one touched a camera it would have profaned the place karen quietly squeezed jonathans hand he nodded not even the memorial to washington dc in little rock had affected him like this whatever the many differences between mankind and the race the lizards understood majesty sam yeager paused outside the imperial palace to admire the grounds they were landscaped with the same spare elegance that informed the gardens surrounding the imperial mausoleum he turned to atvar who as his sponsor walked one neat pace behind him and to his right and who had stopped at the same time as he had i hope you will not be angry if i tell you that these grounds remind me of something the nipponese might do sam said the fleetlord made the negative gesture i am not angry for the same thing has occurred to me i think you would do better though not to make this comparison to the courtiers within that made sam chuckle no doubt you speak truth i suppose they would say the race had the idea first and that too would be a truth indeed it would these grounds have been more or less as they are for a very long time even by the standards of the racemuch longer than all of tosevite history put together atvar said and now shall we proceed one moment if you please sam said after glancing at his watch i left the hotel early so i could gawk a bit before the ceremony starts we have time i will not disgrace the united states by being late when he was playing minorleague ballin a vanished century in a vanished time that had not known the lizardshed never once missed the train or the bus to the next town half of getting anywhere in life was simply showing up on time atvar also wore a watch like every other lizard timepiece sam yeager had ever seen his was digital their style had started a fad among humans for the same kind of watches and even for clocks yeager was oldfashioned he went right on wearing a watch with hands even if this one had been made for homes day which was about an hour and a quarter longer than earths and for keeping time by tenths but that was a small thing the palace in front of him was anything but unlike most of the races buildings it had been designed when those within had to worry about their safety and it looked the part sam wouldnt have wanted to attack it with anything short of an armored division where the grounds looked japanese the palace seemed more russian than anything else he supposed the onion domes topping some of the gray stone towers put that thought in his mind but the palace wasnt really russian any more than the mausoleum was really a match for the parthenon those were just comparisons his human mind groped for the races architecture had its own logic and not all of it followed anything he was used to he looked at his watch again then gathered himself i am ready he said it is time let us go on on they went the entry door was made of some flamecolored tigerstriped wood truly unearthly in its beauty it had been polished till it shone the ironwork of the hinges and latch looked massive enough to stop a charging elephant sam laughed at himself this door might have been built to stop a great many things but elephants werent one of them the great portal silently swung open herrep the protocol master stood just inside sam took a deep breath hed faced up to presidents hed faced up to hardthrowing kids whod stick one in your ear just because they had no idea where the lousy ball would go once they let loose of it and he could damn well face up to this snooty lizard he took one more deep breath then crossed the threshold as soon as he did he assumed the posture of respect he had to work to keep from laughing again im an old man i must look like a real idiot crouched down here with my butt in the air no air conditioning either not even what passed for it among the lizards sweat rolled off him you may rise herrep said i thank you sams back creaked as he got to his feet in the name of the people of the united states in the name of the president of the united states i thank you i come in peace in the name of peace i convey my folks greeting to the emperor and wish him good health and many years in his name i thank you and i accept the greeting in the spirit in which you offer it the protocol master said now if you would be so kind as to follow me it shall be done sam said remotecontrol cameras on the ceiling and the wall swung with him as he moved no baying swarm of cameramales and females here as there had been at the mausoleum sam was old enough to remember the ballyhoo days of the s they had nothing on what the lizards had done there herrep led him past an elderly female who sat with a basin of water and a scrubbing brush the imperial laver then the protocol master walked past another female just as ancient this one with a fancy set of body paints the imperial limner sam sketched the posture of respect to each of them in turn without fully assuming it they both returned the gesture he recognized them as important parts of the imperial court they recognized him as someone who did not require their services it was a quiet compromise and one that did not show how much argument lay behind it proper compromises seldom did after leaving the imperial limner behind a bend in the corridor herrep paused for a moment we are not on camera here he said i just wanted to tell you researching this ceremonial was endlessly fascinating i believe the emperors of ancientest days would recognize what we do here it might not be exactly what they were used to seeing but they would recognize it i am glad to hear you say so yeager replied politely it is also not too different from the ceremonies we use on tosev herrep waved that aside as if of no account that was no doubt how he felt about it to him big uglies were barbarians and how could what barbarians did among themselves matter to a civilized male the answer to that was simple it began to matter when the barbarians grew too strong for a civilized male to ignore and that was what had happened here shall we proceed then the protocol master said we can hardly stop now males and females would talk sam answered herreps eye turrets swung sharply toward him sam yeager only waited he wasnt surprised to discover that the protocol master had no idea what to make of levity even of the mildest sort herrep pointed forward sam made the affirmative gesture as soon as he turned the next corner he knew he would be back on camera knowing this was all part of a fancy charade did not could not keep awe from prickling through him the audience chamber was designed to make anyone of any species coming before the emperor feel small and unworthy the eonsdead males and females whod done the designing had known their business too up near the shadowfilled ceiling a small flying thing chittered shrilly long colonnades of shining stone drew the eye up and drew it on toward the throne at the far end of the hall a courtier appeared before sam he carried on a staff an american flag data transmissions from earth meant the race knew what the stars and stripes looked like as sam and the flagbearer walked down the aisle toward the throne a recording of the starspangled banner blared out no doubt lizard commentators would be quietly explaining to their audience what the strange music meant atvar had said that the banners displayed in the audience hall belonged to empires extinguished by the empire here on home on rabotev on halless and on earth yeager recognized the mexican flag and the australian and the brazilian and the chinese he could not stop to look for and look at others spotlights gleamed from the gilded throneor was it solid gold they also gleamed from the emperors gilded chest and belly sam thought that was funny no doubt the lizards found human royal regalia just as ridiculous two large lizardsthey came up past the middle of his chestin plain gray body paint stepped out to block his path they were imperial guards an ancient survival in an empire where no one had tried to assassinate a sovereign in tens of thousands of years like the swiss guards who protected the pope they looked as if they still knew how to fight even if they didnt have to i come in peace sam assured them they drew back yeager advanced to the end of the aisle just in front of the throne the spotlights on the th emperor risson made his allgold body paint glow that might have awed any lizard who came before him it didnt do much for sam one way or the other he assumed the special posture of respect reserved for the emperor there on the stone smoothed by uncounted tens of thousands of males and females of the race the rabotevs and the hallessi whod done the same thing on the same spot from the throne the emperor said arise ambassador sam yeager i thank you your majesty sam replied and again rose creakily to his feet i bring peaceful greetings from my notemperor and from the males and females of the united states our hope is for trade for mutual prosperity and for mutual respect may this be so risson said it has been a very long time since an independent ambassador came before an emperor of the race everything changes your majesty sam said some things change quickly some very slowly but everything changes most members of the race would have argued with him change here happened at a pace to make a snail into a bullet it was seldom visible within the course of a single lifetime for the lizard in the street that meant it might as well not have happened at all but appearances deceived truth risson said simply yeager was relieved the emperor knew what he was talking about risson went on one thing i hope will never change though is the friendship and peace between your notempire and the empire your majesty that is also my fondest hope sam got to try out an emphatic cough for all the lizards across the planet who might be watching excellent the emperor replied so long as there is good will on both sides much can be accomplished i hope to converse with you again on other occasions sam yeager of the united states risson had been rehearsing too he pronounced the name of sams country as well as any lizard could and he spoke the words of dismissal as smoothly and politely as anyone could have yeager assumed the special posture of respect once more this time he could rise without waiting for permission the flagbearer preceded him up the aisle away from the imperial throne the audience was over risson had more personality than hed expected the gold paint and all the ceremonial hemming in the emperor made him seem more a thing than an individual plainly making any such assumption about risson would be rash despite the role he played he was very much himself i thank you for your help sam quietly told the lizard whod carried the stars and stripes ambassador it was my privilege the lizard replied which might have meant that he was proud to have played a role no matter how small in historyor might have meant someone had told him to carry the flag and hed done it he peeled off where he had joined the american yeager continued into the bend in the corridor where herrep had assured him he was not being filmed the protocol master waited for him there i congratulate you ambassador herrep said your performance was most satisfactory i thank you sam answered not splendid or magnificent or brilliant or anything like that most satisfactory he nodded to himself under the circumstances and from such an exacting critic it would definitely do kassquit watched sam yeagers audience from a hotel room in preffilo she had not come to the imperial capital with the delegation of wild big uglies but separately she did not want her audience with the th emperor risson to be seen as merely an afterthought to that of the american ambassador it probably would beshe was after all a big ugly herself even if not a wild onebut she wanted to distance it as much as she could she studied the ambassadors performance with a critical eye since he represented an independent notempire the ceremony was somewhat different for him he did more than well enough remembering his responses and acting with dignity he also seemed unaware that billions of eyes would be upon him here on home and then on the other worlds fully ruled by the empire and on tosev he surely wasnt but seeming that way was all that mattered she hoped she would be able to bring off such an unaffected performance herself she remembered hearing that sam yeager when he was younger had been an athlete of some sort perhaps that gave him an edge in seeming natural for he would already have appeared before large audiences let me not disgrace myself kassquit thought spirits of emperors past show all the worlds that i truly am a citizen of the empire she was not used to the idea of prayer but it seemed more natural here in preffilo than it ever had before after all the remains of the past emperors were here surely their spirits would linger here as well she visited the mausoleum a few days after the american tosevites had done so the guide a male named jussop said we had a little trouble with the wild big uglies some reporters got their livers all in an uproar when it came to asking questions that will not happen with you i am glad to hear it kassquit answered she recognized the need for publicity every now and again but faced the prospect without enthusiasm having had no privacy whatever as a hatchling and young adult she jealously clung to what shed been able to accumulate since with a disapproving hiss jussop went on another thing is those wild big uglies thought the mausoleum was handsome and everything like thatthey said all the right thingsbut you could tell it did not mean anything to them the way it is supposed to they have different beliefs kassquit said they know no better in a way i am sorry for them well you sound like a proper person a person with the right kind of attitude jussop said come along then and i will show you what there is to see i thank you kassquit sketched the posture of respect without fully assuming it she went into the full posture once she got inside the mausoleum it might not have meant much to the wild big uglies but it certainly did to her it was in fact the most spiritual moment of her life surrounded by the ashes of emperors past she also felt surrounded by their spirits and they seemed to accept her she seemed to belong there she might have the body of a tosevite but she was part and parcel of the empire slowly reverently she walked from one urn to the next glancing briefly at the memorial plaque by each so many sovereigns so many names some she knew from history some shed never heard of no doubt no one but scholars or collectors of trivia would have heard of them well that was fine too they were all part of the ancient magnificent edifice that was the empire all of their spirits would cherish her when she passed from this world the americans will never know this certainty she thought sadly yes i am sorry for them at last when her liver was full of peace she turned to jussop i thank you i am ready to leave now this has been the most awefilled day of my life i do not see how anything could surpass it you are going to have an audience with the emperor are you not the guide asked kassquit made the affirmative gesture jussop said in that case you would do well not to speak too soon kassquit thought about it then made the affirmative gesture again truth i stand corrected which counted for more she wondered as she lay down on the sleeping mat of her hotel room the spirits of emperors past or the actual physical presence of the reigning emperor she had trouble deciding but she knew she would be one of the lucky few who could decide for she would soon meet the th emperor risson in the flesh a few reporters did wait outside the imperial palace when she and atvar were driven up to it she wondered if it was built like a fortress to hold them at bay she wouldnt have been surprised how does it feel to be the second tosevite granted an audience with his majesty one of them called as she and her sponsor got out of their car i would rather think of myself as the first tosevite citizen of the empire granted an audience with his majesty kassquit answered how did you become a citizen of the empire another reporter asked while the camera crews came closer and closer i was only a hatchling at the time you would do better to ask senior researcher ttomalss who arranged it kassquit said and now if you will excuse me i must proceed i cannot be late for the audience they could not have cared less whether she was late all they wanted was a story from her her being late and being disgraced would make as good a story as her audience it might make a better one since another big ugly had just come before the emperor sam yeager was a wild big ugly of course not a citizen but would the male or female in the street care one tosevite looked just like another as far as the race could tell she ignored the further shouted questions from the reporters and walked into the entryway by which shed been told to go in an involuntary sigh of relief escaped her when the closing door shut off their queries you did well there said a male waiting inside after reading his body paint kassquit bent into the posture of respect i thank you protocol master you are welcome you earned the praise herrep replied reporters will eat your life if you give them half a chanceeven a quarter of a chance so are you ready to proceed with your audience i hope so superior sir kassquit said i shall do my best not to embarrass you or myself or fleetlord atvar who lent me so much help i thank you atvar said but i believe you would have done well without me too herrep made the affirmative gesture i have confidence in you he said i have heard excellent reports of your preparation and the american ambassadors audience left nothing to be desired your species may differ from ours in many ways but you seem competent not knowing your kind i was hesitant before now though i see my qualms were as empty as a hatched egg he did not seem like a male who said such things lightly i thank you protocol master kassquit said again herreps only reply was let the ceremony begin unlike sam yeager kassquit not only had to come before the imperial laver and limner but counted doing so a privilege she gave them the ritual thanks the soap the laver used to remove her everyday body paint was harsh on her soft skin so was the brush with which the old female rubbed off the last traces kassquit would have endured far worse than that to come before her sovereign the imperial limner was even older than the laver she poked with a fingerclaw one of the glands intended to produce nutritive fluid for a tosevite hatchling how am i supposed to get the pattern right when you have these bumps here she complained that wasnt ritual it was just ordinary grumbling kassquit wondered if she dared answer it after brief hesitation she decided she did please do the best you can i cannot help my shape any more than you can help yours i do not have this trouble with rabotevs or hallessi the limner heaved a sigh oh well might as well get used to it i suppose more and more of you big ugly things will come see his majesty she might have been old but she was an artist with the brush despite kassquits shortcomings in shape the pattern for an imperial supplicant rapidly covered her torso i thank you gracious female kassquit said when the limner finished that was ritual getting back to it felt good she went on i am not worthy that is a truth you are not the limner agreed and added an emphatic cough you are granted an audience not because of your worth but by grace of the emperor rejoice that you have been privileged to receive that grace i do kassquit used her own emphatic cough advance then and enter the throne room i thank you like his majesty you are more gracious more generous than i deserve kassquit bent into the posture of respect the limner did not when kassquit and herrep paused in a jog in the corridor before she went out into the audience chamber proper the protocol master said fear not your talk with the limner will be edited before it is broadcast she has done so many of these ceremonies they have lost their grandeur for her really i had not noticed kassquit said herrep started slightly then saw the joke and gave her a polite laugh kassquit asked may i proceed superior sir herrep made the affirmative gesture and she stepped out into that vast shadowed echoing hall for a moment awe almost paralyzed her this was where the empire became the empire upon the unification of home this was where the rabotevs and hallessi acknowledged the emperors sovereignty and made the empire more than worldwide and now in a smaller way she too was becoming part of imperial history of itself her back straightened pride filled her as she walked toward the throne she almost gasped when the emperors graypainted guards suddenly appeared out of the shadows and blocked her path kassquit gestured with her left hand declaring i too serve the emperor the guards silently withdrew she advanced in the spotlight the emperor and his throne blazed with gold kassquit averted her eyes from the radiance as she assumed the special posture of respect before her sovereign from above her the th emperor risson said arise researcher kassquit her name in the emperors mouth she held the posture saying i thank your majesty for his kindness and generosity in summoning me into his presence when i am unworthy of the honor ritual steadied her as shed hoped it would arise i say again the emperor replied and kassquit did the emperors eye turrets swung up and down as he examined her he said i am greatly pleased to welcome my first tosevite citizen to home i have heard that you are very able which gladdens my liver i thank you your majesty kassquit said dazedly no one had told her risson would say anything like that when he made the gesture of dismissal she might have invented antigravity for she did not think her feet touched the floor even once as she withdrew along with the rest of the americans sam yeager watched kassquits audience on television she goes through all the rituals of submission you talked them out of tom de la rosa said to him for her theyre all right sam answered the emperors her sovereign but hes not mine and i wasnt going to pretend he is looks like shes got all the moves down pat frank coffey remarked sam nodded im not surprised jonathan and i met her years before we went into cold sleep shes not quite human poor thing but shes plenty smart he dropped into the lizards language for a oneword question for his son truth truth jonathan agreed he didnt add an emphatic cough as sam yeager had thought he might but then karen was sitting right there next to him and wouldnt have appreciated any such display of enthusiasm as far as karen was concerned kassquit was entirely too human but sam had been talking about the way she thought not the way she was made linda de la rosa said the emperor paid her a nice compliment there thats the point of the audience sam said he wants to show everybodythe lizards here on home and eventually rabotevs and hallessi and humans toothat theyre really just one big happy family the race isnt as good at propaganda as we are but theyve got the right idea for that what did you think of risson dad jonathan asked we all right sam asked major coffey only after coffeys nod showed electronics were foiling the races bugs did he go on he impressed me more than i figured he would most of what he said was stuff he had to say but the way he said it made me sit up and take notice hes got brains i think hes not just sitting up there because hes descended from the last lizard who had the job the succession is about the only place where family ties really matter to the race isnt it karen said looks that way to me sam agreed the emperor has his ownharem i guess youd call itof females and one of the eggs one of those females lays hatches out the next emperor and how they go about deciding which egg it is they know and god knows but i dont he laughed back before he went into cold sleep hed never worried about how the lizards dealt with the imperial succession it hadnt seemed like anything that could matter to him which only went to show you never could tell he laughed again it wasnt as if he hadnt already known that his whole career since the day he met his first lizarda slightly wounded prisoner somewhere south of chicagohad been a case of you never can tell the door hissed for attention sam didnt know about the rest of the americans but he missed a good oldfashioned doorbell his knees ached as he got to his feet he wondered if the lizards were going to complain about the bug suppressor if they did he intended to send them away with a flea in their hearing diaphragm bugging ambassadors residences was impolite even if it happened all the time but the lizard who stood in the hallway wore the body paint of an assistant protocol master sam recognized it because it was similar to herreps but a little less ornate yes he said as neutrally as he could what can i do for you you are the ambassador sam yeager lizards had as much trouble telling people apart as most people did with members of the race if sam hadnt been the only human on the planet with white hair the assistant protocol master wouldnt have had a chance i ought to dye it he thought irreverently but heaven only knew what the race used for dyes he made the affirmative gesture yes i am the ambassador good you will come with me immediately what why yeager was primed to tell the assistant protocol master that he still had a thing or twodozento learn about diplomacy you didnt order an ambassador around like a grocery boy but he never got the chance for the female said because you are summoned to a conference by the emperor oh sam said a sovereign could order an ambassador around like a grocery boy he gave the only reply he could under the circumstances it shall be done what are they up to dad jonathan asked in english beats me this one isnt in the rules or not in the part they showed me anyhow sam answered in the same language if im not back in two days call the cops he was jokingand then again he wasnt his own government had kidnapped him it wasnt completely inconceivable that the race might do the same if the race did though he was damned if he knew what the humans here could do about itthis side of starting a war anyhow the assistant protocol master hissed for a bad moment sam feared she understood english some lizards here dideven that rabotev shuttlecraft pilot had but the female said only please be prompt she led yeager out of the hotel and into a car with darkened windows no one looking in could see the car held a human no reporters waited at the curb none waited outside the imperial palace either sam was impressed again whatever this was it wasnt a publicity stunt this will be a private audience he asked the assistant protocol master semiprivate the lizard replied and it will be a conference not an audience ceremony will be at a minimum all right i am sure it is a great honor to be called like this sam didnt say whether it was an honor he wanted that was part of diplomacy too you are the first ambassador so summoned in more than a hundred thousand years the assistant protocol master said the race hadnt had any independent ambassadors come before it in all that time yeager thought about pointing that out but forbore diplomacy again he almost laughed when he found the conference room nearly identical to those in the hotel back in sitneff all across the usa such rooms looked about the same evidently that also held true on home the walls were a greenbrown not far from the color of a lizards hide the table in the middle was too low to be quite comfortable for humans there were a couple of chairs more or less made for people in the conference room yeager sat down in one of them a few minutes later kassquit came in and took the other i greet you ambassador she said politely and i greet you sam replied how many conferences back on earth had featured a naked woman not manyhe was sure of that jumping out of a cake afterwards maybe but not at the conference itself when the door opened again the emperor came in his gilding marked him off from his subjects kassquit sprang out of her chair and assumed the special posture of respect sam followed suit more slowly he did everything more slowly these days rise both of you the th emperor risson said the reason i called you here was to see whether we could progress toward settling the differences between the race and the american tosevites he didnt think small in a sovereign that was or could be an admirable quality sam returned to the chair that wasnt quite right for his shape i hope we can your majesty he said that would be wonderful the th emperor risson turned one eye turret toward him the other toward kassquit which of us is outnumbered ambassador he asked both of us yeager replied two big uglies one male of the race two citizens of the empire one american no emperor has ever been outnumbered by tosevites before risson said even though sam had used the races slang for humans the emperor was too polite to imitate him risson went on and yet tosevites have occupied the races thoughts and the thoughts of the emperors for a good many years now well your majesty we have been paying a fair amount of attention to the race ourselves lately sam said in a dry voice he wondered whether risson would catch the dryness when the emperors mouth dropped open in a laugh sam knew he had matching dry for dry risson said yes i can see how that might possibly be so the lizard leaned forward and now can you tell me what you american tosevites require from the race since it has drawn your notice yes i can tell you that sam yeager answered i can tell you in one word as a matter of fact we want equality do you not believe you should wait until you have earned it the th emperor risson returned eighteen hundred years ago when we first discovered your kind you were savages he spoke a word of command a hologram of a knight sprang into being in the air sam had seen that image a thousand times he was by now good and sick of the blond crusader i have never denied that the race was civilized long before we were he said but that male is long dead and i sit here on your home planet talking with you your majesty i came here in my notempires ship too if we fought you would lose risson said if we fought we would hurt you badly sam said we have been able to hurt you badly for some time now and grow more able every year but i thought we were here to talk about peace so we are the emperor said equality do you truly know what you ask yes your majesty i think i do sam answered a japanese might have understood the demandmight have made the demandmore fiercely the empire looked at the usa the way the usa and europe had looked on japan when she muscled her way into the great powers the japanese werent white men they were wogs nothing else but after they got strong enough though it stopped mattering yeager shook his head in slow wonder the day after pearl harbor hed tried to join the army and fight the japs because of his false teeth the army turned him down then though theyd been glad enough to take him when the lizards came a little more than five months later now here he was sympathizing with japan life could be very strange kassquit said your majesty i understand the races pride the empires pride do you fully understand the tosevites pride the tosevites pride by the way the th emperor risson said it that had never once crossed his mind sam wasnt surprised the race did look down their snouts at big uglies just as americans and europeans had looked down their noses at the japanese but risson went on researcher it is possible that i do not i thank you for pointing it out to me i am pleased to serve your majesty kassquit murmured sam smiled her face didnt show anything but if that wasnt pride of her own hed never heard it equality pride risson said perhaps half to himself and then i am glad i had this talk it has given me a great deal to think about that was dismissal polite dismissal but dismissal even so as the lizards whisked sam back to his hotel he found he too had a lot to think about ttomalss was one of the few members of the race who understood what being a parent involved that was what all his patient years of raising kassquit from a hatchling had got him and now he was going through the part of parenthood that seemed strangest the hatchling hed raised had taken wing on her own not only had kassquit enjoyed an audience with the emperor but shed also conferred with him in private because the conference was and stayed private the male in the street never found out about it to most members of the race kassquit remained just another big ugly but a female at the imperial court let ttomalss know are you not proud of what you accomplished she asked yes i am very much so ttomalss answered and broke the connection in a hurry it wasnt that he was lying on the contrary he was proud of kassquit all the same he also felt himself surpassed and that was an odd and uncomfortable feeling it wasnt so much that kassquit had had the audience with the th emperor risson ttomalss saw the propaganda value there but that risson had summoned her back to confer yes that got under the psychologists scales ttomalss had never won an imperial audience himself he didnt particularly expect one he was prominent but not that prominent he thought he might have been worthy of consultation though if the emperor thought otherwise what could he do about it not a thing not a single solitary thing yes kassquit had spread her wings all right they had proved wider and stronger than ttomalss ever expectedmaybe wider and stronger than his own he knew big uglies often had this experience he wondered how they stood it without being torn to pieces it couldnt be easy of course they had biological and cultural advantages he didnt they knew such things were liable to happen some of them even hoped their hatchlings would surpass them under other circumstances ttomalss might have admired such altruism he had more trouble practicing it himself to keep from thinking about kassquit and her triumphs he telephoned pesskrag getting hold of the physics professor wasnt easy returning calls might have been a custom from another world as far as she was concerned ttomalss hoped she was busy in the laboratory not off to the south pole with friends her messages would follow her either way of course but she might be more inclined to answer them if she was working and not out having a good time when she didnt call back for two days ttomalss began to get not only annoyed but worried he wondered if something had happened to her he called her department chairfemale only to learn that that worthy had just gone into the hospital with a prolapsed oviduct excesses of the mating season he thought sourly no one else in the department seemed to know anything about where pesskrag was or what she was doing he wondered if he ought to get hold of the police pesskrag finally did call him the next day when ttomalss saw her image in the monitor he still wondered if he ought to get hold of the police her nictitating membranes were swollen and puffy with exhaustion she looked as if shed just escaped a kidnapping attempt she said i apologize for being so very hard to reach senior researcher and then she yawned right in ttomalss face seeing that teethfilled gape of jaw made ttomalss want to yawn too that desire to imitate a yawn was almost a reflex in the race idly ttomalss wondered if the big uglies had anything similar that would have to wait though it would probably have to wait for years this on the other hand what have you been doing ttomalss asked experimenting pesskrag said and yawned again this time ttomalss did yawn back the physicist shut her mouth with an audible snap she pointed at him and it is your fault tooyours and the big uglies all right i accept my share of the blame ttomalss said do you have any results from your experiments yet only very preliminary ones she answered and gave forth with another yawn she seemed on the point of falling asleep where she sat gathering herself she went on full computer analysis will take some time it always does preliminary results do suggest that the big uglies probably are correct how interesting ttomalss said and pesskrag made the affirmative gesture the psychologist went on you are the expert in this matter if the big uglies are correct what are the implications again much of this will have to wait for full analysis pesskrag replied ttomalss impatiently lifted a hand the psychologist opened her mouth againthis time for a laugh not a yawn she might have been drunk with weariness as she continued but we are going to see some changes made what sort of changes ttomalss asked how should i know she said would you judge a hatchlings whole career when it is still wet from the juices of its egg ttomalss did his best to sink his fingerclaws into patience let me ask you a different way he said is this a matter that will only matter in learned journals and computer discussion groups or will it have practical meaning sooner or later a lot of what is discussed in learned journals and computer groups has practical meaning pesskrag said stiffly but then she relented all right i know what you mean i would say this will have practical meaning just how soon i am less certain we will need to confirm what we think we have found and that too will take some time then assuming we do confirm it we will have to see what sort of engineering the physics leads to how long do you suppose that will take ttomalss asked years certainly i would not be surprised if it took centuries the physicist answered we will have to be very careful here after all everything will have to be worked out in great detail we will have to make sure these changes do not disrupt our society or do so to the smallest possible degree deciding what the safest course is will of course be the responsibility of planners not scientists of course ttomalss echoed tell me one thing more if you would be so kind how soon could something like this pass from physics to engineering if those in charge cared nothing for change or disruption what an addled notion pesskrag said ttomalss did not argue he only waited she went on i cannot imagine the circumstances under which such a thing would be permitted i certainly hope the males and females in charge of such things are more responsible than you seem to believe if such matters were gripped by the fingerclaws of our males and females alone i would agree with you ttomalss said do please remember the source of your inspiration here though let me ask my question in a different way what do you suppose the big uglies have been doing with the data you are just now discovering the big uglies pesskrag spoke as if she were hearing of tosevites for the first time after some thought she shrugged i am sorry senior researcher but i have not the faintest idea how matter and energy behave is my province how these strange aliens act is yours i will tell you how to estimate their behavior ttomalss said please do the physicist sounded polite but skeptical make the most radical estimate of possibilities you have the power to invent in your own mind ttomalss said he waited again when pesskrag made the affirmative gesture he went on once you have made that estimate multiply its capacity for disaster by about ten having done that you will find yourself somewhere close to the low end of tosevite possibilities pesskrag laughed ttomalss didnt he didnt say anything at all after a little while pesskrag noticed he wasnt saying anything she exclaimed but surely you must be joking i wish i were the psychologist said if anything i am not giving the big uglies enough creditor maybe blame is more likely to be the word i want i do not understand pesskrag said let me show you then you may possibly have seen this image before ttomalss called up onto the screen the picture of the tosevite warrior the races probe had snapped he said please believe me when i tell you this was the state of the art on tosev eighteen hundred years agoeighteen hundred of our years half that many by the local count oh i see pesskrag said slowly and now her voice trailed away yes and now ttomalss said and now several of their notempires have kept their independence in spite of everything the race could do and now they are making important discoveries in theoretical physics before we are do you still believe i am joking or even exaggerating possibly not pesskrag said in troubled tones we would not have made this discovery for a long time if ever i am convinced of that so are my colleagues even imagining the experiment requires a startling radicalism and the race is not radical ttomalss said pesskrag hesitated then used the affirmative gesture once more so did the psychologist he went on i need to tell you i need to make you understand in your belly that by our standards the big uglies are radical to the point of lunacy if you do not understand that you cannot hope to understand anything about them let me give you an example during the fighting after the conquest fleet landed they destroyed a city we held with an atomic weapona weapon they had not had when the fighting started do you know how they did it by remote control i would assume pesskrag replied ttomalss made the negative gesture no that is how we would do it that is how they would do it now i am sure at the time their remotecontrol systems were primitive and unreliable they sailed a boat that travels underwaterone of their military inventionscarrying the bomb into this harbor when the boat arrived a brave male on it triggered the bomb killing himself and the rest of the crew in the process madness the physicist said yes and no ttomalss answered remember it did us much more harm than it did the big uglies and so they did not count the cost they have a way of proceeding without counting the cost that is why i asked where this discovery might go and how long it might take to get there the way pesskrags eye turrets twitched told how troubled she was i am sorry senior researcher but i still cannot say for certain we are going to have to modify a good deal of theory to account for the results of this experiment we will also have to design other experiments based on this one to take into account what we have just learned i do not know what sort of theoretical underpinnings the big uglies already have if this was an experiment of confirmation for them not an experiment of discovery if that turns out to be so they may have a bigger lead than i believe and in that case ttomalss always assumed the tosevites knew more and were more advanced than the available evidence showed he was rarely wrong about that he did sometimes err on the conservative side even so since he was trying to be radical that worried him but no member of the race could be as radical as a big ugly realizing that worried him too i need to do more work before i can properly answer you pesskrag said her words proved ttomalss point for him that worried him more still a tosevite physicist wouldnt have hesitated before answering and that worried him most of all lieutenant general healey gave glen johnson a baleful stare as the two of them floated into the admiral peary s small cramped refectory too bad sending you down to the surface of home would kill you the starship commandant rasped otherwise id do it in a redhot minute since when has that kind of worry ever stopped you after a long long pause johnson added sir he didnt have to waste much time being polite to healey as far as he knew the admiral peary had no brig he didnt need to worry about blowing a promotion either what difference did it make when he never expected to see earth again he could say whatever he pleasedand if healey felt like baiting him hed bait the commandant right back healeys bulldog countenance was made for glowering but the scowl lost a lot of its force when its owner lost the power to intimidate you are insubordinate the commandant rasped yes sir i sure am johnson agreed cheerfully youd be doing me a favor if you sent me down to home with the doctor you know that id be keeping company with a nicelooking woman till gravity squashed me flat youd be stuck up here with yourselfor should i say stuck on yourself that struck a nerve healey turned the glowing crimson of redhot iron a comparable amount of heat seemed to radiate from him too he got himself a plastic pouch of food and spent the rest of supper ignoring johnson the meal was a sort of a stew bits of meat and vegetables and rice all bound together with a gravy that was oriental at least to the extent of having soy sauce as a major ingredient a spoon with a retracting lid made a good tool for eating it johnson did wonder what the meat was it could have been chicken or possibly pork on the other hand it could just as well have been lab rat how much in the way of supplies had the starship brought from earth the dietitians no doubt knew to the last half ounce johnson didnt inquire of any of them some questions were better left unanswered when he reported to the control room the next morning brigadier general walter stone greeted him with a reproachful look you shouldnt ride the commandant so hard the senior pilot said he started it johnson knew he sounded like a threeyearold he didnt much care did you tell him he should stay off my back he has reasons for being leery of you stone said we both know what they are dont we too bad johnson said we both know his reasons never amounted to a hill of beans too dont we no we dont know that walter stone said what we know is nobody ever proved those reasons have anything to do with reality theres a reason for that too they dont johnson had stuck with his story since the s tell it to the marines said stone an army man since johnson had been a marine now for something approaching ninety years he chose to take umbrage at thator at least to act as if he did he got on fine with mickey flynn he and stone had been wary around each other ever since he involuntarily joined the crew of the lewis and clark they would probably stay that way as long as they both lived stone wasnt obnoxious about his opinions the way lieutenant general healey was that didnt mean he didnt have them to him johnson would always be below the salt even if theyd come more than ten lightyears from home prig johnson thought and then another word that sounded much like it the first was fair enough the second wasnt and he knew as much stone was extremely good at what he did johnson knew himself to be unmatched at piloting a scooter no human being was better than walter stone at making a big spaceship behave johnson had seen that with both the lewis and clark and the admiral peary if the other man had a personality that seemed to be made of stamped tin then he did that was all hello dr melanie blanchard floated up into the control room and johnson forgot all about stones personality if any the doctor went on im making my goodbyes the shuttlecraft will take me down to home tomorrow well miss you johnson said most sincerely stone nodded the two of them had no quarrel about that dr blanchard said no need to the doctors aboard will be able to take care of you just fine in case anything goes wrong theyll do better than i could in fact my specialty is coldsleep medicine and they tend to people who are actually warm and breathing to begin with johnson and stone looked at each other johnson could see he and the senior pilot shared the same thought he spoke before stone could we werent exactly thinking of your doctoring oh melanie blanchard laughed you boys say the sweetest things she was careful to keep her tone light shed been careful for as long as johnson had known her he was sure he and stone werent the only men aboard the admiral peary who thought of her not just as a physician he was pretty sure nobodyd had the chance to do anything but think the ship was big enough to fly from earth to home but not big enough to keep gossip from flying if there were anything to gossip about if anything could travel faster than light gossip could no gossip had ever clung to dr blanchard johnson wished some would have it would have left him more hopeful he smiled at her now you think we talk sweet you should give us a chance to show you what we can do take no notice of him walter stone told the doctor i agree with everything he says but take no notice of him anyway johnson looked at stone in surprise flynn wouldnt have disdained that line johnson hadnt thought stone had it in him melanie blanchard laughed flattery will get younot as much as you wish it would she said the laugh taking any sting from the words being noticed is nice having people make nuisances of themselves isnt she held up a hand you two havent i could name names i couldbut i wont why not johnson asked if you do well have something interesting to talk about youll be talking about me behind my back whether i name names or not she said i know how things work if you were going down there theyd talk about you too oh not the same wayyou arent women after allbut they would will you tell me im wrong sure johnson said if we were going down to home theyd talk about him he jerked a thumb at walter stone me include me out stone said thank you mr goldwyn johnson said stone grimaced he looked as if he hadnt wanted to give johnson even that much reaction johnson turned back to melanie blanchard five gets you ten your shuttlecraft pilot wont be a lizard rabotevs and hallessi dont care about ginger they dont care about taking ginger she said i bet theyd like the money theyd make for smuggling ityouve said that yourself of course we havent got any ginger to give them so it doesnt matter of course johnson and stone agreed together johnson didnt know for sure whether the admiral peary carried ginger whatever his suspicions he could think of three people who might sam yeager lieutenant general healey and walter stone he didnt ask the senior pilot he was sure of one thingthe lizards thought the humans starship was full of the stuff from top to bottom come to think of it dr blanchard might know the truth about the herb too had she just come out and told it or was she operating on the principle that the race might have managed to bug the admiral peary and needed to be told what they already wanted to hear she said im going to go below and make sure ive got everything ill need down on the surface of home in the meantime she glided over to johnson and gave him a hug and a kiss then she did the same thing with walter stone and then waving impartially to both of them she was gone damn johnson said a reverent curse if ever there was one the memory of her body pressed against his would stay with him a long time at his age sex wasnt such an urgent business as it had been when he was younger that didnt mean hed forgotten what it was all about walter stone looked amazingly lifelike as he stared toward the hatchway down which dr blanchard had gone he shook himself like a man coming out of cold water now that you mention it yes he said lot of woman there johnson observed id run into somebody like that i probably would have stayed married and stayed on earth he waited for stone to point out that hed be dead now in that case the other man didnt he only nodded with a sigh johnson added of course you notice she isnt married herself maybe shes not as nice as she seems or maybe she thinks men are a bunch of bums stone said youve got an exwife maybe shes got an exhusband or three that hadnt occurred to johnson before he could say anything a lizards voice spoke from the radio attention the tosevite starship attention the tosevite starship we have launched a shuttlecraft to pick up your physician this is the object you will discern on your radar sure enough there it was a blip rising from home toward the admiral peary we thank you for the alert ground control stone said in the language of the race a little later the shuttlecraft pilots face appeared in the monitor as johnson had guessed he was or perhaps she was a darkskinned shortfaced rabotev with eyes on stalks not in turrets i greet you tosevites the pilot said please give me docking instructions our docking apparatus is the same as the empire uses stone said he had no doubt almost said the same as the race uses but that wouldnt do with a rabotev lights will guide you to the docking collar call again if you have any trouble i thank you the shuttlecraft pilot replied it shall be done the rabotev was certainly capable heshe docked with the admiral peary with a smooth efficiency anyone whod flown in space had to respect with the duty in the control room johnson couldnt give dr blanchard another personal goodbye he sighed again memory wasnt a good enough substitute for the real thing karen yeager was starting to get to know the sitneff shuttlecraft port it wasnt as familiar to her as los angeles international air and spaceport but she had some idea which turns to take to get to the waiting area the shuttlecraft port also had one great advantage over lax she was a vip here not one more cow in a herd she and jonathan got whisked through security checkpoints instead of waiting in lines that often doubled back on themselves eight or ten times i could get used to this she said as they took their seats in the waiting area if the seats werent perfectly comfortablewell they wouldnt be here very long her husband nodded could be worse in english he added only drawback is everybody staring at us well yes there is that karen said she too felt as if every eye turret in the waiting area were turned her way that wasnt quite true but it wasnt far wrong either lizards attracted much less attention at airports back on earth of course there were millions of lizards on earth and only a handful of humans here on home she shifted in her seat no it wasnt comfortable at all back on earth some airports had special seating areas for the race karen didnt plan on holding her breath till the lizards returned the favor here a shuttlecraft landed its braking rockets roared the race was better at soundproofing than mere humans were but she still felt that noise in her bones three lizards got out of the shuttlecraft their friends or business colleagues or whatever they were greeted them when they came into the terminal after glancing at his watch one of the americans guards said your fellow tosevite should be grounding next i thank you karen and jonathan said the same thing at the same time as couples whove been married for a long time will they smiled at each other the guard was right the groundcrew at the port moved the last shuttlecraft off the flamescarred tarmac a few minutes later another one landed a hundred yards off to the left this time the pilot who emerged was a rabotev the lizards in the waiting area paid no particular attention to him or her they were used to rabotevs but they exclaimed and pointed when dr melanie blanchard came down the landing ladder after him shes moving as if shes got the weight of the world on her shoulders isnt she jonathan said she probably feels that way too karen said shes been out of gravity for quite a while now dr blanchard trudged across the concrete toward the waiting area lifting each foot and then putting it down took an obvious effort a lizard scurried into the shuttlecraft and came out with a pair of suitcases of earthly manufacture he hurried after the human carrying her luggage wasnt very hard for him by the way things looked it might have killed her turning to the guards karen said can you please keep the reporters away from her she is too tired to answer questions right away it shall be done superior sir the lizards still had as much trouble telling humans sexes apart as people did with them karen couldnt get too annoyed though because the guards did do what shed asked the reporters shouted their questions anyhow but they had to do it from a distance dr blanchard waved to them that took effort too i am glad to be here she called in the language of the race she didnt look or sound glad she looked as if she wanted to fall over and when she got to karen and jonathan she sank into one of the seats by them regardless of how uncomfortable it was whew she said sweat gleamed on her face can i rest for a little while before we go on sure jonathan said how are you hammered she answered frankly i remember i used to take gravity for granted what i dont remember is how i feel like ive got two great big football players strapped to my back youll get used to it again karen said melanie blanchard nodded even that looked anything but easy for her i suppose i will she said in the meantime though im a shambling wreckonly i cant shamble for beans either one of the lizard guards came up to her and bent into the posture of respect i greet you superior female shall we now return to the hotel where your species stays i thank you but please let me rest first she replied i have been weightless for a very long time and i need a little while to get used to being back in gravity again the guard made the affirmative gesture as you say so shall it be he went back to holding off the reporters i wish it were as you say so shall it be dr blanchard said in english then id tell myself everything was fine and it would bephysician heal thyself id love to only problem is i cant when we do go back to the hotel you can stretch out on a sleeping mat karen said then come over to our room if youve got the energy weve got ice cubes as near as i can tell theyre the only ones on the planet she spoke with what she hoped was pardonable pride and weve got the races equivalent of vodka jonathan added what they use for flavored liquor is amazingly nastyof course they think the same thing about scotch and bourbon but this is just ethyl alcohol cut with water you can drink it warm but karens rightits better cold vodka over ice sounds wonderful getting up off the sleeping mat and going to your room dr blanchard laughed ruefully and shook her head maybe if i say pretty please youll bring me a drink instead that might be arranged karen said well be friends forever if it can melanie blanchard said is the car back to the hotel very far from here about as far as it was from the shuttlecraft to where you are jonathan answered the doctor heaved herself to her feet she wobbled for a moment jonathan held out his arm she took it but then steadied and stood on her own to the guard she called i am ready to go to the car now as long as i do not have to move too fast set whatever pace you please superior female the lizard replied our orders are to accommodate ourselves to your needs i thank you that is very kind dr blanchard dropped back into english to tell karen and jonathan why dont you lead the way you know where youre going and i havent got the faintest idea i dont think well lead i think well go one on each side of you in case you need propping up jonathan said that turned out to be a good idea dr blanchard walked as if she were a st bernard plowing through thick snow homes gravity field seemed harder for her than drifts after a blizzard were for a dog the lizard carrying her suitcases followed while the guards spread out on all sides when they reached the car she sank down into a seat with a groan of pleasure this one even fits my butt she said happily all the time in the world on an exercise bike up there isnt the same as ten minutes in gravity believe you me it isnt she seemed a little better by the time they got back to the hotel that relieved karen shed feared the doctor would be in no shape to take care of herself let alone anybody else but melanie blanchard walked more easily than she had before and even paused briefly to talk with reporters waiting outside she might need a while to do a thorough job of adjusting but it seemed likely she would when the humans went into the lobby karens fatherinlaw met them with an expression she found hard to fathom was it grim or was he swallowing a belly laugh he sounded grim when he said we have a situation here whats up dad jonathan asked a cleaning crew went into your room while you were out meeting dr blanchard sam yeager answered they were fooling with the rats cages weve had an escape oh dear melanie blanchard said i was hoping to do some work with them thats not the problem karen said which was if anything an understatement sam yeager nodded no its not the race told us theyd raise holy hell if anything of ours got loose on home we promised on a stack of bibles we wouldnt let the critters looseand we didnt they dont care what theyve done to earths ecology karen said they claim thats not their worry but if we return the favor its a different story how many got away eight or ten i think her fatherinlaw answered youll know better than i do when you see your room because you have a better notion of how the cages were laid out but as of now im open to suggestions why should we worry karen said its the lizards own fault if they want to catch the rats tell em to buy a cat everybody laughed dr blanchard said excuse me and sat down on the edge of a table that was probably more comfortable than perching in what the race used for chairs the table was flat not curved the wrong way for a human fundament they are setting traps sam yeager said i have no idea how much good that will do can they find something rats really want to eat can the rats find something to eat and drink on their own he spread his hands i dont know about that either stay tuned for the next exciting episode and well find out theyll have vermin of their own dr blanchard looked and sounded happier sitting down theyll have creatures that hunt vermin too the next interesting question may be whether those creatures feel like hunting rats befflem tsiongyu and their wild cousins id expect jonathan said yes that could be mighty interesting befflem have turned into godawful nuisances back on earth thered be a sort of poetic justice if rats did the same thing here i doubt the race would appreciate it his father said dryly but they cant blame us for the escape they did it themselves i wouldnt want to be one of those cleaners right now not for all the tea in china i wouldnt if i wake up and find myself nose to nose with a rat ill probably scream karen said if i wake up and find myself nose to nose with a rat ill probably scream too sam yeager said thatll scare the rat out of a years growth but i dont suppose itll do much else if anything earthly can establish itself on home id bet on rats dr blanchard said thoughtfully theyve evolved to live anywhere and eat anything and theyve evolved to live in cities alongside people they might feel right at home here on home that occurred to me too sam yeager said i dont know if its fully occurred to the race yet you have to have lived on earth for a while before you understand just what pests rats can be and there arent that many lizards here who have if they dont get it now they will pretty soon karen said they may anyhow jonathan said maybe rats cant make it here maybe they wont find anything to eat maybe the exterminators will get em maybe something local will think theyre delicious maybe dr blanchard said but nobodys ever gone broke betting on rats senyahh held a strange creature by the tail the creature was deceased the bandage on the kitchen chiefs other hand said it hadnt perished without putting up a fight what is this horrible thing exalted fleetlord senyahh demanded atvar eyed it with a grim sense of recognition the tail was long and naked and scaly which made the animal seem a little less alien the creatures body though was softskinned and furry its head had the flaps of skin tosevite creatures used to concentrate sound waves for their hearing diaphragms the head was at the moment somewhat the worse for wear what did you hit it with atvar inquired a frying pan senyahh answered it bit me anyhow and i almost missed it it is as fast as a beffel but i never saw anything like it before what is it i believe it is called a rat atvar pronounced the unfamiliar word as well as he could it is one of the escaped tosevite animals congratulations on killing it oh one of those horrible creatures senyahh said i thought they would be bigger and uglier and go around on their hind legs this is quite ugly enough in my opinion atvar said and i meant those congratulations we believe the housekeeping staff let eight or ten rats escape this is the first one of which we have seen the slightest trace senyahh swung the dead beast by the tail it will cause no more trouble she declared a hunters pride in her voice this one will not no atvar agreed but what of the others what if they breed what if they flourish on tosev they are major pests do they have any diseases or predators here i have my doubts the head of the kitchens had her own concerns she asked are they good to eat i believe so but the big uglies do not commonly consume them atvar pointed to the female you are welcome to experiment on your own but do not do not serve the results of your experiment to the american tosevitesnot even to karen yeager with whom you quarreled he used an emphatic cough the cleaning crew that freed the rats has been sacked if you give the americans rat to eat you will envy their fate do you understand me do i make myself plain yes exalted fleetlord it shall be done or rather it shall not be done no matter how tempting it may be you have my word on it senyahh declared all right take the miserable creature away then atvar said i am more familiar with these animals than i ever wanted to be after the kitchen chief left his room atvar said several pungent things he did not blame the female who had killed the rat she was only doing her job the cleaning crew had it been up to him they would have got worse than the sack their foolishness had endangered all of home yes atvar knew more about rats than he wanted to he knew much more about rats than any male or female whod never been to tosev he hadnt wanted the animals to come down to the surface of home in the first place hed wondered if the big uglies had brought them here to wage their own brand of ecological warfare hed warned hed fussed and hed been undone not by the american tosevites but by the hotels housekeeping staff theyd decided they felt like playing with the animals now everyone would have to pay for it then atvar made the negative gesture the big uglies wouldnt have to pay a thing they might have got what they wanted he couldnt prove that no matter how it seemed to him but it hadnt been their fault that was only too obvious he tried to look on the bright side of things an exercise with which hed had frequent practice on tosev species from home were making the big uglies planet more livable more comfortable for the race the tosevites couldnt make that sort of arrangement here on home all they could do was make nuisances of themselves that unfortunately was an exercise with which theyd had frequent practice on tosev as if to prove the point sam yeager chose that moment to telephone him i greet you ambassador atvar said resignedly what can i do for you this morning i would like to request permission to bring down another ten rats from the admiral peary to replace the ones that were allowed to escape the ambassador replied oh you would atvar said yes please sam yeager said they are very useful to us because they let us test foods easily and conveniently we were sorry to lose the ones the housekeepers released he made sure that got under atvars scales atvar couldnt do anything about it either because hed earned the right the fleetlord tried to stall i cannot decide this on my own i will have to consult with local authorities back on tosev fleetlord we call that passing the buck sam yeager used three words of english it means seeking to evade responsibility that is not like you i hope to hear an answer very soon good day he broke the connection atvar hissed angrily some of the anger was aimed at the big ugly the rest at himself the ambassador was right he did seek to evade responsibility for letting more rats come down to the surface of home unlike the males and females who had never left this planet he had a pretty good notion of how damaging the tosevite creatures could be letting more of them come here even caged was not in the races best interest but if it was in the big uglies best interest atvar hissed again sam yeager had come right out and said it was the only way the race could reject the ambassadors request would be to insult the american tosevites and possibly to jeopardize their health atvar did not care to be responsible for that he did not think any other male or female would care for it either he wondered if he ought to make some calls anyhow on the off chance he was wrong his hand shaped the negative gesture that struck him as pointlessand also as passing the buck as sam yeager had put it instead of telephoning members of his own species he called the big ugly back why hello fleetlord i greet you sam yeager said as politely as if they hadnt been sparring not long before and i greet you atvar replied tryingwith indifferent success he fearedto match that politeness what can i do for you now the american tosevite asked still smoothly does this have to do with what we were talking about a little while ago or is it about something else the same topic atvar respected the big ugly for coming to the point and respected him even more for doing so in an inoffensive way you have permission to bring ten more of these rats here they are to remain caged at all times as their predecessors were to have done i thank you fleetlord and i do understand the restrictions sam yeager said we agreed to them from the beginning we have not violated them either it was your own folk who freed the rats stilli supposein this hotel atvar didnt like that i suppose he also wasnt happy that sam yeager was completely correct with luck the housekeepers whod got more curious than they should have would have trouble finding work anywhere for the rest of their lives atvar would have loved to fine or imprison them but they hadnt done anything criminalso the local prosecuting attorney assured him whether theyd done anything damaging was a different question worse luck will any special tosevite bait attract these creatures the fleetlord asked if so we will use it in our traps our traditional bait is cheese sam yeager answered then he had to explain to atvar what cheese was the explanation left the fleetlord as much revolted as enlightened the idea of milk was disgusting enough to the race the idea of deliberately letting it rot before eating it was worse trying to suppress nausea atvar inquired do you have any of this stuff closer than the tosevite solar system we have none here on the surface of homei know that the american ambassador said there may be some aboard the admiral peary if you like i will ask the ship to send some down with the rats if there is i thank you atvar said i thank you very much in fact that would be generous of you and greatly appreciated sam yeager sounded wryly amused unlike a certain species i could name we do not deliberately seek to disrupt the ecology of another world you have made your political point ambassador atvar on the other hand sounded sour we have sought to make tosev more homelike and friendly to ourselves you have done the same on certain parts of the planet never so drastically as your folk are doing the tosevite ambassador said and we know better now you brag about the races long spell of civilization but it does not seem to have made you sensitive to ecological concerns the race was chiefly interested in shaping ecologies to its own needs it had done so on rabotev and halless and was still busy doing it on tosev sam yeagers attitude made atvar less proud of that than he might have been he did not intend to let the wild big ugly see what he was thinking bitter experience on tosev had taught him that revealing anything to the big uglies was a mistake they never took such revelations as simple confidences but always as signs of weakness and they exploited such signs for all they were worth would sam yeager do the same atvar did not doubt it for an instant we see nothing wrong in manipulating the environment for our own benefit the fleetlord said that is one of the hallmarks of an intelligent species would you not agree manipulation is one thing destruction something else altogether the american ambassador insisted very often the difference lies in the point of view atvar said or will you tell me i am mistaken he waited sam yeager used the negative gesture atvar respected his honesty he went on this being so you accuse us of being strong enough to make ourselves comfortable on a new world to this i must plead guilty who gave you the right to do that sam yeager asked we gave it to ourselves by being strong enough to do it atvar replied yeager studied him you say these words fleetlord and you seem pleased with them and i suppose you have reason to be pleased with themnow but i tell you this when i hear them they are to me nothing to be pleased with they are a judgment on your kind a judgment on the whole race and judgments like that have a way of being fulfilled atvar stared at him in astonishment he sounded more like one of the mullahs whod made life so unpleasant for the race on tosev s main continental mass than the highly civilized being the fleetlord knew him to be do you threaten me ambassador atvar demanded no fleetlord the wild big ugly replied i do not threaten you if i say the sun will rise tomorrow either i simply observe if that is the sort of observation you are going to make you would do better to keep it to yourself atvar said coldly as you wish fleetlord sam yeager said but have you not seen that the truth will come and find you regardless of whether anyone points it out to you ahead of time yes he did sound like a mullah what i have not seen in this particular instance is that you are speaking truth atvar said sam yeager only shrugged he spread his hands as if to say you will find out atvar deliberately turned his eye turrets away from those hands to his annoyance the american ambassador only laugheda loud grating tosevite laugh at supper in the refectory that evening jonathan yeager listened to his fathers account of the conversation with atvar sam yeager was speaking english i tell you i felt like daniel in the old testament i was doing everything but shouting and waving my arms and yelling thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting how did he take it dr melanie blanchard asked he got mad sam answered i would have got mad too if somebody talked to me like that but i still dont think im wrong if youre that arrogant it usually comes back and bites you as far as im concerned you handled it just right tom de la rosa said what theyve done to ecosystems back on earth is a shame and a disgrace theyd better not think were happy about it but now the shoe is on the other foot jonathan said now theyre worried about rats here not zisuili and azwaca and befflem and all their plants back on earth the shoe pinches more when its on their foot oh the rats dad snapped his fingers almost forgot we do have permission to bring down replacements you insulted atvar and you still got away with that frank coffey said not bad ambassador not bad at all he clapped his hands together i didnt insult him till after hed agreed sam yeager grinned arent i sly everybody laughed jonathan said he didnt change his mind afterwards nope his father answered or if he did he didnt tell me if they shoot down the shuttlecraft with the rats in it then well know he was really angry that drew more laughs tom de la rosa hoisted his glass of moreorless vodka in salute all the americans drank a couple of tables away kassquit sat by herself sometimes she joined the other humans when they ate sometimes she didnt that seemed to fit her betwixtandbetween nature stuck between what shed been born and what shed been raised as having watched mickey and donald grow from their eggs into fair copies of human beings jonathan thought he understood that better than most he scratched his head which reminded him he needed to shave it again soon was he wrong or had kassquit been more standoffish than usual lately after a moments thought he nodded to himself unless he was wrong she hadnt eaten with the americans since dr blanchard came down from the admiral peary he switched to the language of the race calling say researcher will you not come over and eat with us karen gave him a hard look he pretended not to notice this had nothing to do with the fact that he and kassquit had been lovers up on her starship in the early s he and karen hadnt been married yet or even engaged they had been going together though and his research had almost spelled the end of that this was just social jonathan really meant that because of what she was kassquit was to a certain degree isolated from everyone around her humans and lizards alike getting her to mingle wasnt just diplomacy it also felt like psychotherapy as usual kassquits face showed nothing she might have been joyful furious gloomyyou couldnt tell by looking she said i did not think you would want me there not when you were so busy using your own language we will speak yours if you do join us that wasnt jonathanit was melanie blanchard we have no problem speaking the races language even if we are a little more comfortable with our own the familiar is often welcome especially when one is far from home well i suppose that could be a truth if one had known anything resembling a home in ones past kassquit said i have concluded that a cubicle in a starship makes an inadequate substitute no doubt you are right sam yeager said trying to smooth things over but if you join us you may make a closer approach to something homelike than you would with the race or of course you may not but how will you know unless you try the experiment i do not think i can have a true home either with the race or with you wild tosevites kassquit said unhappily if there were more tosevite citizens of the empirenot tosevites raised as i was necessarily but those who live in the empires culture despite their speciesi might find more in common with them than i do with you or the race there are probably a fair number of such persons on tosev now jonathans father said this of course does you no good at all here truth kassquit said and if i were to go back into cold sleep and seek them out on tosev who knows how things would change there by the time i arrived variability i think is the key to tosevites generally that was undoubtedly how humans seemed from the races point of viewthe one kassquit naturally adopted as her own but a lot of lizards refused to see that changes in the way humans did things could affect them kassquit didnt make that mistake anyhow frank coffey said do come sit with us kassquit you ask me this she said are you certain you desire my company major coffey made the affirmative gesture of course i am he said and added an emphatic cough kassquits face still showed nothing but she brought her plate to the table where the americans were sitting do you mind if i ask what you were talking about before she inquired mostly about the rats that were released here and about bringing more of them down from the admiral peary so we can go on testing food jonathan answered is that still necessary kassquit asked have the animals found many problems for you i had no such aids when i woke up on home but i have eaten the food here and i am still well we would rather not take chances we do not have to take dr melanie blanchard said we would also rather avoid unpleasant surprises if we can the race can eat almost anything we tosevites can eat on our world but who would have expected the trouble ginger causes them that seemed only common sense to jonathan he thought kassquit would make the affirmative gesture she was nothing if not logical instead she let out an audible sniff how likely is this dr blanchard shrugged the motion seemed easier and less of an effort than it would have right after she came down to the surface of home little by little she was getting reacquainted with gravity she said who knows what is certain is that we would like to prevent it if possible do you object few members of the race would not on those grounds the race is more cautious than we tosevites are i do not object on the grounds of prudence kassquit said i do wonder if one of the reasons you wanted to bring rats here was in the hope that they might escape and establish themselves that would let you pay the race back for ecological changes caused by creatures from home on tosev not fair jonathan said if we had released the rats you could accuse us of that but members of the race did it we kept the animals caged we were going to keep them caged too we know just what sort of pests they can be kassquit considered that at last reluctantly she did use the affirmative gesture from you jonathan yeager i will believe this why would you not also believe it from dr blanchard jonathan asked she knows much more about these things than i do yeswhy melanie blanchard echoed i mean you no harm researcher in fact i would like to examine you if you do not mind i probably know less about medicine as a whole than a physician from the race but i know a lot more about being a tosevite i might find something a physician from the race would miss had jonathan been in kassquits shoes he could have been grateful for that offer if she got sick what could the lizards do about it not much not that he could see a human doctor though had to know how people ticked but kassquit looked at dr blanchard as if shed just suggested vivisection i thank you but no she said the races techniques have always been adequate up until now no doubt dr blanchard said but then you have never been very ill have you you are still young and you were never exposed to most tosevite diseases you are now beginning to reach the age where your body will show the wear it has accumulated more regular examinations are a good idea i thank you but no kassquit repeated i will continue in my present way of doing things until it shows itself to be unsatisfactory this is not a good idea jonathan told her technicians maintain computers and other machines you should also maintain yourself and so i do and so i shallwith the race kassquit said if this proves inadequate as i told you i shall consider other options her determination was unmistakable jonathan scratched his head again it didnt add upnot to him anyway but karen whispered in his ear in english she doesnt like the doctor jonathan blinked that hadnt occurred to him once his wife pointed it out though it seemed so obvious that he wondered why it hadnt he also wondered why kassquit didnt like the doctor theyd hardly had anything to do with each other frank coffey asked would a member of the race want a tosevite doctor certainly not kassquit didnt use an emphatic cough but her tone of voice left no doubt about how she felt all right then coffey was unperturbed why would you want to use a physician of a different species when you have another choice kassquit looked at him you too would recommend that i trust myself to dr blanchard she had a little trouble pronouncing the name but less than a lizard would have when coffey made the affirmative gesture kassquit sprang to her feet you are all against me she exclaimed and stormed out of the refectory the only reason she didnt slam the glass door behind her was that its mechanism wouldnt let her what was that all about linda de la rosa asked in english is it me she doesnt want to deal with or is it because im a human being and not a lizard melanie blanchard asked in the same language i think it may be you went through jonathans mind he glanced at his wife and would have bet she was thinking the same thing neither he nor karen said anything though they might have been wrong even if they turned out to be right who could guess why kassquit felt the way she did she was a riddlesometimes jonathan suspected even to herself his father said the same thing a different way kassquit takes some getting used to its not her fault she is the way she is god knows i do think shes got a good heart jonathan nodded karen let out a distinct sniff among the americans though she found herself outvoted snoutcounting jonathan thought he was amused but knew neither his wife nor kassquit would have been kassquit wanted nothing more than to avoid the wild big uglies she wished she could have nothing to do with them they did not understand her they mocked her so it seemed from her point of view at any rate no matter what she wanted though she had to deal with the tosevites shed been brought to home to deal with them no matter how revolting they acted she couldnt just walk away from her work with them more than once she thought if i were a female of the race i could being what she was she had fewer choices she could not abandon the wild big uglies half the timemore than half the timemembers of the race couldnt tell her apart from them anyway she tried to avoid them at mealtimes that didnt always work because they didnt all eat at the same times every day she stayed as far from them in the refectory as she could that probably would have sufficed with the race whose members were sophisticated enough to recognize a good sulk the big uglies though were as nosy as so many befflem and just about as enthusiastic because the american tosevites usually ate breakfast early kassquit had started eating late she didnt like that because she got hungry she did it even so but when frank coffey came in for a snack he found her there she hoped he would take care of what he wanted and leave her alone he didnt he came over to the table where she was sitting and said may i join you if you insist kassquit said coldly a male of the race would have taken the hint she would have thought the big ugly might also she hadnt been subtle but coffey just said i thank you and sat down then he asked why are you angry at dr blanchard what has she done to you how could she have done anything to you she just got here i am not angry at dr blanchard kassquit saidangrily the wild big ugly sitting across the table from her did not respond he just let the words hang in the air they seemed so manifestly false kassquit felt she had to modify them she has not done anything to menot directly ah yes frank coffey was like a beffel that had taken a scent what has she done indirectly then you ought to know kassquit did not bother to hide the bitterness she felt i do not have any idea what you are talking about the american big ugly said a likely story kassquit said you do not need to lie to me you know that is nothing but a waste of time on your part lie about what coffey asked you have completely confused me i am sorry but that is a truth i wish i believed in the spirits of emperors past i would swear by them to convince you what oath would you like me to use for a truthful person oaths do not matter for one who is not truthful they do not help kassquit snapped the big ugly made the affirmative gesture that is well said you have known me since i came down to the surface of home i have been here most of a year now what is your opinion of me have you believed me to be a truthful person or one of the other sort up until now i believed you to be truthful kassquit said your behavior here though makes me doubt it very much what behavior here what have i done frank coffey asked as i say i confess that you have baffled me kassquit took a deep breath your pretending not to know why i dislike dr blanchard and what grievance i hold against her i do not know that i do not understand it he used an emphatic cough that is a truth kassquit for the sake of your own health i think you would be wise to let her examine you if you do not like her i can see how you might be reluctant but i do not know why you do not like her she seems friendly enough and she is a capable physician friendly enough friendly enough kassquit all but spat the words yes i can see why you would say so i certainly can and what is that supposed to mean did the american tosevite make his interrogative cough sound sarcastic or was that just a trick of kassquits overheated imagination she recognized the possibility but she didnt think so as if you do not know she said furiously you all got along fine down here without the services of a physician none of you has needed a physician coffey started to say somethingprobably that you never could tell when someone would need a physician she overrode him the real reason she came down to home is obvious enough not to me he said you had better tell me what this real reason is why to provide you with a mating partner from among your fellow wild big uglies of course kassquit said frank coffey stared at her again he started to say something kassquit didnt stop him this time he stopped himselfby starting to laugh and once he started he could not stop raucous tosevite mirth poured out of him kassquit thought it would never end finally after what seemed like forever the torrent slowed i see nothing funny about it kassquit said in icy tones that only started the wild tosevite laughing again this time the fit did not last quite so long but when it ended tears left bright streaks down coffeys cheeks oh dear he said wheezing and gasping for breath i think i hurt myself but i could not help it i am very sorry kassquit but you packed an impressive amount of misunderstanding into one sentence there i do not believe i misunderstood anything kassquit said you had better explain to me why you think i did it shall be done superior female coffey began ticking off points on his fingers dr blanchard did not come down here to become my mating partner the two of us have not mated we have never discussed mating not even once we have not made advances at each other i have no idea whether she would be interested in mating with me if i had to guess i would doubt it i know for a fact that i am not particularly interested in mating with her so you say kassquit jeered coffey nodded then he used the races affirmative gesture yes so i say and it is a truth too i see you are a citizen of the empire you certainly do not understand how things work among wild big uglies and i ought to ask you a question of my own why do you care about what dr blanchard and i may or may not do because i was hoping to mate with you myself kassquit answered had she been raised as a wild big ugly she might not have been so blunt but then had she been raised as a wild big ugly she would have been different in so many ways the question wouldnt have arisen in that form oh frank coffey said and then oh again in an altogether different tone of voice when he didnt say anything else for some little while kassquit asked well what do you think of that he wasnt laughing any more kassquit didnt think she could have borne it if he were despite her prodding he didnt answer right away when he did he spoke slowly and thoughtfully i think you know i would be lying if i said the idea of mating with you had never crossed my mind i had thought that yes kassquit agreed that was why i was so upset when dr blanchard came down from your starship she is one of your kind in a way that i cannot be i thoughti fearedshe would make a better partner for you the brown big ugly did laugh then but kassquit judged much more at himself than at her he said i have trouble believing anyone named melanie could make a good partner for mebut to understand that you would need to know the american gone with the wind not the races book of the same name kassquit didnt understand the american gone with the wind meant nothing to her she did finally start to believe that he wasnt eager to mate with dr blanchard and if he wasnt this idea had crossed your mind then you say and what did you think of it when it did obviously part of me liked it very muchbut that part has never been what anyone would call fussy he replied no matter how far removed from the affairs of wild big uglies she was she had no trouble figuring out what he meant he went on the rest of me was not nearly so sureis not nearly so surethat would be a good idea you are isolated from our ways of doing things i was very much afraid i would be taking advantage of you why kassquit asked in genuine puzzlement would we not both take pleasure from this how is that more advantageous to you than to me things are more complicated than thator they often are anyway back on tosev coffey said we do not have a mating season the way the race does and emotional attachments between partners are usual with us in fact mating among us does not just spring from previously existing emotional attachments the act of mating the pleasure of mating giving pleasure to another in mating helps cause emotional attachments do you have any idea what i am talking about oh yes kassquit said softly she remembered all too well how bereft she had felt when jonathan yeager left the races starship and returned to the surface of tosev and how devastated she was when she learned he was making a permanent mating arrangement with karen yeager that had seemed like betrayalnothing less if frank coffey were to abandon her for a wild tosevite female too she shoved that thought aside and made the affirmative gesture i understand exactly what you mean her tone must have carried conviction for coffey did not argue with her any more he just said knowing all this you would still wish to go forward i would she answered i may end up unhappy i understand that but i feel empty now next to empty even unhappy does not seem so bad that makes more sense than i wish it did the wild big ugly said he noddedagain kassquit thought more to himself than to herand laughed quietly in that case superior female there is an english expression that seems to fit here my place or yours kassquit needed a moment to figure out what that meant but only a moment why not mine she said they rode up the elevator together kassquit hung the privacy please sign in front of her room then frank coffey said wait i had better make sure you do not become gravid let me get a sheath i will be back right away he took a little longer than kassquit had expected but not long enough for her to complain when he returned it had been a long time since she lay down with a male tosevite but she remembered what to do and he knew how to stimulate her he turned out to know better than jonathan yeager had at first that surprised her then she realized jonathan yeager must have been almost as inexperienced as she was and then she stopped caring about such things afterwards frank coffey was careful to keep his weight on his elbows and knees and not on her the races language does not have words for this he said i thank you is not nearly strong enough he kissed her i hope that says something oh yes kassquit felt near tears she hadnt realized how much shed missed this oh yes she used an emphatic cough it didnt seem adequate either she kissed him this time a member of the race wouldnt have understood he seemed to ttomalss knew he had too many things going on all at the same time he kept waiting to hear whether pesskrag and her fellow physicists were making progress in their experiments he monitored what the wild big uglies were up to and reported back on that to atvar the retired fleetlord also seemed to be running in too many directions at once rats he said to ttomalss out of a clear sky we have got to find those creatures and get rid of them senior researcher or this entire world will suffer on account of them truth ttomalss agreed maybe you should clear everyone out of this hotel and fumigate it the way you would for pests of our own i have discussed this matter with sam yeager atvar said unhappily he is not enthusiastic about moving he is not obstructivehe will relocate if we insist but he is not enthusiastic diplomacy is or can be a nuisance i hesitate to displace him if i can accomplish my goals by other means how many more rats have you recovered ttomalss asked even more unhappily atvar answered one after that which senyahh killed and it was not captured here in the hotel but in the park across the way that is another reason i hesitate to displace the wild big uglies it may already be too late it may already be too late ttomalss didnt respond to that it was the races usual lament when dealing with the tosevites here it was liable to be true in more ways than atvar had meant it after leaving the fleetlords suite ttomalss left a message for pesskrag the physicist took her time about calling him back maybe she was busy experimenting maybe shed finished experimenting but had nothing new to tell him maybe she was just sick and tired of him till she did eventually answer he couldnt say what with everything else that was going on ttomalss hardly had the chance to turn an eye turret toward kassquit every now and then her room in the hotel was not electronically monitored as were those of the wild big uglies not that those microphones had yielded much the american tosevites appeared to have antimonitoring electronics of their own not only was she assumed to be on the emperors side but she had also strongly objected to being monitored back on the starship orbiting tosev without that continuous monitoring ttomalss had to rely on what he observed when he and kassquit were together he would have done better observing one of his own species he knew that however acculturated kassquit was her basic responses remained tosevite and alien one morning at breakfast he said you will correct me if i am wrong but do you not seem more cheerful than usual kassquit paused to take a bite of aasson after she swallowed she answered you might say so yes superior sir you might say so good i am glad to hear it ttomalss was also glad he had seen it do you happen to know why you are more cheerful if she did he would do his best to make sure conditions did not change for her yes superior sir i do know kassquit said and said no more trying not to show the exasperation he felt ttomalss asked do you mind telling me why you are more cheerful than usual is it by any chance the aftereffect of your audience with the emperor he felt proud of himself for being so insightful and he felt correspondingly deflated and annoyed when kassquit used the negative gesture no superior sir i do not mind telling you she replied ttomalss brightened hoping that was why shed used it but she went on though i am and always will be proud the emperor received me i must confess that that is not the main reason why i am more cheerful these days once more she didnt elaborate this time ttomalss did let out an irked hiss i ask again why are you then do you truly want to know kassquit inquiredperhaps ironically though that did not occur to the psychologist till later at the time he just made the affirmative gesture kassquit said very well then superior siri will tell you i am more cheerful than usual because i have begun mating again i find it much more satisfactory and much more enjoyable than selfstimulation do you have any other questions ttomalss didnt he finished breakfast in a hurry and left the refectory as fast as he could that didnt take him far enough away he left the hotel too and strode at random down the streets of sitneff he hoped immersing himself in his own kind would take the bad taste of tosevites off his tongue even kassquit or was it especially kassquit she had everything the race and the empire could give her she had a reasonable rank and more than adequate wealth she even had the privilege of an imperial audience which ttomalss himself did not enjoy and what did she value what made her happymade her so happy ttomalss couldnt help but notice tosevite mating behaviorand that even after she was warned against it it hardly seemed fair she is a big ugly after all ttomalss thought sadly in spite of everything we have done for her she is still nothing but a big ugly that was a liverbreaking notion air whooshed out of his lung in a long sad sigh she was as much a citizen of the empire as any tosevite could possibly be more than any other tosevite was likely to be for thousands of years if ever but her biology still drove her in ways no member of the race could fully understand or was that true back on tosev there was a small but growing number of males and females who used ginger to simulate the big uglies yearround sexuality some of them had even adopted the tosevite custom of permanent exclusive mating bonds to most of the race they were perverts even more depraved than the big uglies themselves but might they not one day serve as a bridge between the empire on the one hand and the wild and stubbornly independent tosevites on the other and might kassquit not be part of that same bridge ttomalss could dare hope but tosev had dashed the races hopes again and again ever since the conquest fleet arrived in a tosevite legend hope was the last thing to emerge from a box of troubles the legend didnt say what happened next ttomalss guess was that the troubles leaped on newhatched hope and devoured it an automobile warning hissed at him he sprang in the air in surprise and skittered back to the curb hed walked off against traffic something he never would have done if he hadnt been so gloomy and distracted if that car had smashed me it would have been your fault kassquit the audience with the emperor made her proud but mating with a wild big ugly and with which she hadnt said made her happy ttomalss wondered if he ought to see which american tosevite seemed unusually happy these days but would a wild big ugly show it the way kassquit did the americans were used to mating in a way she wasnt she would rather be pleased in this way by her own kind than honored by the empire a stray beffel beeped at ttomalss he was usually kind to animals but he made as if to kick this one the beffel had been a stray for a while it recognized that gesture and scrambled away on its short strong legs before the blow could connect he wouldnt have actually kicked but the beffel couldnt know that my superiors will have to hear of this but how am i supposed to put it in a report ttomalss wondered how can i phrase it so that it does not reflect badly on kassquitor on me atvar would understand hed seen how things were on tosev and he had some notion of normal tosevite sexual behavior but most of the socalled experts here on home had no direct experience with big uglies they would be offended or disgustedor maybe they would be offended and disgusted ttomalss didnt want kassquit punished for what was to her normal behavior that wouldnt be fair he stopped so abruptly that a female in a blue wig that looked nothing like any real big uglys hair almost ran into him she said something rude he ignored her which made her say something even ruder he still paid her no attention he stood there on the sidewalk in front of a meat market if kassquits behavior is normal for her why are you getting so upset about it because she took me by surprise no the answer there wasnt very hard to find was it the race did not approve of surprises or respond well to themanother reason tosev had caused it so many headaches males and females liked to know how everything worked how all the pieces fit together and exactly what their part was in the bigger scheme of things to the race big uglies sometimes seemed to act almost at random part of that was because tosevites worried less about the future than did members of the race if they saw present opportunity they grabbed with both hands and their sexual and family ties made them do things inexplicable to the race sexual ties ttomalss muttered the words out loud a male going by kept one eye turret on him till he passed out of sight again the psychologist hardly noticed though in other circumstances he would have been mortified to draw so much attention he still didnt know with which american male kassquit had mated only four candidates two of them had permanent mating contracts with females ttomalss had learned though that big uglies respected such contracts only imperfectly and jonathan yeager had been kassquits first partner all those years before would they have returned to each other or would tom de la rosa have forsaken his partner as an ecological expert de la rosa was formidable in sexual terms ttomalss had no idea what he was like in sexual terms he knew just as little about major frank coffey in that context dark brown big uglies had a formidable sexual reputation among paler ones but that reputation appeared to be undeserved under the skin tosevite subspecies were remarkably similar then there was sam yeager himself he had been mated but his longtime partner was dead would he be looking for sexual opportunities now how could a member of the race hope to know you could ask him ttomalss thought then he made the negative gesture the american ambassador would not get angry at the question ttomalss was reasonably sure of that but yeager would laugh at him he was pretty sure of that too he was no more fond of making a fool of himself than anyone else of any species just when he had decided he couldnt make a reasonable guess about the candidates he realized he hadnt really considered all of them big uglies occasionally became intimate with members of their own sex because of pheromones and crest displays such behavior was much rarer among the race could kassquit have experimented with a female kassquit could have done almost anything what she had done she knew and ttomalss didnt he also had to admit to himself that he couldnt figure it out from the evidence he had maybe a big ugly could have he wouldnt have been surprised but despite all his years studying the tosevites he was no big ugly himself he was glad of that too imagine putting a sexual liaison ahead of an audience with the emperor if that didnt prove how different the tosevites were what would he did his best to look on the bright side of things sooner or later the truth would come out his store of data would grow the bright side turned darker no matter how much data he had would he ever really understand the americans had been living in one anothers pockets ever since they got to home they had few secrets from one another keeping secrets wasnt easy and they hardly ever bothered even so not everything got talked about right out in the open karen yeager was probably the last one to realize major coffey and kassquit had started sleeping together when she did she was horrified isnt that treason or something she demanded of her husband i doubt it he answered i cant see frank giving secrets away to the lizards no matter what can you it would take a lot more than a whatdoyoucallita honey trap thats what they sayto get him to do anything like that karen considered reluctantly she decided jonathan was right she made herself an almostvodka chilling it with ice shed fought so hard to win well maybe so she said but its still disgusting shes hardly even human jonathan didnt say anything that was no doubt smart on his part karen remembered just too late that he hadnt found anything disgusting about sleeping with kassquit if men could they would or most of them would she really isnt karen said as if jonathan had contradicted her i know shes not he answered uncomfortably but she does try it makes her more more pathetic than if she didnt part of her wants to bei think a lot of her wants to be but she doesnt know how how could she seeing the way she was raised shes crazy yeah but she could be a lot crazier and you know what the saddest thing is tell me ominous echoes filled karens voice her husband usually heeded those echoes not today he spoke as if he hadnt heard them the saddest thing is she knows how much shes missing and she knows shes never going to get itnot from us and not from the lizards either how do you go on after youve figured something like that out she seems to have found some way to amuse herself karen said thats not fair hon jonathan said if you hadnt done anything for twenty yearsand i dont think kassquit has not since mewouldnt you grab the chance if it came along karen thought about twenty years of celibacy going without was easier for most women than for most men but even so maybe she said grudgingly no matter how grudgingly she said it jonathan had to know how big an admission that was give her a break will you he said she needs all the breaks she can get and she hasnt caught very many of them maybe karen said again even more grudgingly than before but what about frank whats he thinking is he thinking there are four women on this planet jonathan said as far as i know hes never come on to you or linda if he has nobodys said anything about it he hasnt with me anyway karen said all right then lets figure he hasnt with linda either jonathan said melanie blanchard just got here that leaves he didnt finish the sentence but he didnt have to every word he said made good logical sense but this wasnt a matter for logicor it didnt feel like one to karen anyhow when she said its kassquit she summed up everything that wasnt logical about it jonathan only shrugged i cant do anything about it i havent done anything about it either and you know darn well i havent if you dont like it take it up with frank and good luck to you he wasnt often so blunt karen wished he hadnt been this time either she said i couldnt do that okay fine her husband said in that case wouldnt you say its none of your beeswax and if it isnt what are you worrying about talk about not being fair karen exclaimed how long have you known without telling me a while he said which told her less than she wanted to know he went on if you watch them you can kind of tell its the way they look at each other when they think nobody else is paying any attention karen had always paid as little attention to kassquit as she could while staying polite or maybe even a little less than that and she evidently hadnt paid as much to frank coffey as she should have i still have trouble believing it she said oh its true jonathan said if it werent why would frank have started taking rubbers from the medical supplies for that karen had no answer she did wonder how her husband knew coffey was doing that had he actually seen him or did he know how many he and tom de la rosa were likely to use and figure the excess must have gone to frank karen decided she wasnt curious enough about that to ask she said i still dont think it can be good for what were trying to do here its sleeping with the enemy thats what it is sorry hon but i dont think youre right jonathan told her anything that keeps us from going nuts here is pretty good far as im concerned kassquits no more mata hari than she is martha washington if anybody gives anything away in pillow talk shes likely to be the one he was altogether too likely to be right about that because he was karen didnt try to contradict him she just said the whole idea is repulsive thats all jonathan said nothing at all no sleeping with kassquit hadnt repelled him that wasnt anything karen didnt already know after all hed done it before they were married since he hadnt tried doing it since she didnt suppose she ought to mention it but biting her tongue wasnt easy in the face of that silence from her husband she said im going down to the refectory its just about time for lunch go ahead jonathan answered im not hungry yet ill come down in a while ive got some paperwork i need to catch up on maybe he did and maybe he didnt karen wouldnt have bet one way or the other plainly though he didnt want to go on talking about kassquit and frank coffey karen didnt see what she could do about it short of ramming the topic down his throat that wouldnt accomplish anything but starting a fight life was too short wasnt it with a twinge of regret she decided it was ill see you later then she said i am hungry that wasnt a lie she left the room and walked down the hall to the elevators when one arrived it announced itself with a hiss not a bell she wondered if she would ever hear a bell again when a door opened sometimes small things made all the difference between feeling at home and being forcibly reminded you were on an alien world she got into the elevator it was smoother than any earthly model shed ever known she braced herself for more alienness in the refectory the food there or most of it wasnt bad but it wasnt what she was used to either she supposed a japanese traveling through south dakota had the same problem if so she sympathized some of the booths had been adapted to accommodate humans the adaptations were clumsy but functional a lizard came up to her with a menu here are todays offerings superior tosevite the server said i thank you karen read through it ah you have the azwaca cutlets again bring me those please it shall be done superior tosevite and to drink the ippafruit juice chilled if you have it ippafruit juice had a citrusy tartness to it we do the server made the affirmative gesture we would not for ourselves but we have seen how fond of cold things you tosevites are please wait i will take your order to the cooks it will not be long good karen said for the moment she had the refectory to herself that suited her she wasnt in the mood to face anyone else just then anyhow she wished the refectory were cooler she wished all of home were cooler of course what she wished had nothing to do with how things really worked she knew that even if she didnt like it very much the race had cooled the refectory even this far only to accommodate her kind the lizards liked things hot the heat of a medium summers day in los angeles wasnt heat to them at all it was chill the server brought the ippafruit juice it wasnt as cold as lemonade would have been back on earth but it was chilled the tangy sweetness pleased her had the race brought ippa fruit to earth if so a trade might easily spring up plenty of people would like it ill have to ask tom she thought if anyone here would know he was the man when she finished the juice the server refilled her glass from a pitcher in a lot of ways restaurants on earth and home were similar your meal will come very shortly he assured her two or three times sounding much like a human waiter anxious to preserve his tip the americans didnt need to worry about tipping though not while they ate in the hotel refectory karen didnt even know if lizards were in the habit of tipping if they were the government took care of it here the server had just brought her the cutletsand some roasted tubers on the sidewhen kassquit walked into the refectory karen nodded not in a friendly way that was beyond her but at least politely she wanted to see how kassquit would behave and what if anything she had to say for herself kassquit nodded back with that same wary politeness i greet you the halfalien woman said and i greet you karen answered i hope you are well and happy i am well yes i thank you for asking kassquit considered the rest of the question happy who can say for certain there certainly were times in the past when i was more unhappy what was that supposed to mean ah karen said the most noncommittal noise she could make but one that invited kassquit to keep talking if she wanted to she must have for she went on i suppose even ordinary wild tosevites are often unhappy when they are young for they do not yet know how they will fit into their society she paused karen made the affirmative gesture that was true enough kassquit continued it was i think worse for me for i knew i did not fit in at all not in biology not in appearance not in speakingnot in anything reallyand i was often reminded of this no i was not happy karen felt ashamed of disliking kassquit no other human being in the history of the world had gone through what kassquit had and a good thing too karen thought and now she asked now i have a place of my own i have some acceptanceeven the emperor does not find me altogether unworthy and i am not completely cut off from my biological heritage as i was for so long again what did she mean that she and frank coffey were fooling around as jonathan had said karen couldnt think of anything else that seemed likely she surprised herself when she nodded again and said good atvar heard from ttomalss that kassquit and the wild big ugly had become physically intimate we instructed her not to do this what is it likely to mean senior researcher he inquired will she abandon us for the americans i do not believe so exalted fleetlord ttomalss replied this is just another complication noti hopea catastrophe just another complication atvar let out a weary hissing sigh i have heard those words or words much like them too often for my peace of mind he laughed i remember when i once had peace of mind before you went to tosev ttomalss asked certainly atvar said not afterwards by the spirits of emperors past he cast down his eye turrets never afterwards i believe that exalted fleetlord the psychologist said and all things considered you were fairly lucky the big uglies never captured you that is a truth atvar had forgotten about ttomalss ordeal he returned to the business before him ironic that kassquit should form this attachment so soon after her audience with the emperor indeed ttomalss said morosely i asked her about this myself in fact she said the audience was a source of pride but the liaison was a source of satisfaction tosevite sexuality is different from ours and there is nothing much to be done about it that was another truth the race had wasted a lot of time and energy on tosev trying to get the big uglies to change their customs before deciding it was wasting its time and energy the tosevites were not going to change what they did any more than the race would the fleetlord wished that thought hadnt occurred to him ginger had made a significant part of the race change its sexual patterns atvar let out a sudden thoughtful hiss do you know senior researcher i believe we may have missed a chance on tosev in what way ttomalss asked i wonder if through drugs we might make the big uglies sexual patterns more like ours and those of the other species in the empire atvar said as far as i know this was never investigated i believe you are right exalted fleetlord ttomalss said the work might prove worthwhile if you send a message now researchers there can begin experimenting before too many more years have passed i may propose that atvar said if they find such a drug well and good if they fail to find it we are no worse off just so ttomalss made the affirmative gesture and now if you will excuse me i did want to let you know about kassquits situation for which i thank you atvar laughed again sourly though why i should thank you for exercising my liver is beyond me this is one of those times when politeness and truth part company i fear i understand ttomalss left the fleetlords room the psychologist could go the problem he had posed would stay he had to be annoyed that kassquit would choose her biological heritage over her cultural one as far as atvar could tell though that was the extent of ttomalss annoyance he didnt have to worry about the effect kassquits possible shift of allegiance would have on negotiations with the wild big uglies atvar thought about commanding her to stop mating with frank coffey only the suspicionthe near certaintythat she would ignore such a command held him back she was no less headstrong than any wild tosevite stubbornness especially about sexual matters was in their blood he also thought about removing her from his party and sending her halfway round the world he could do that he had the authority but it would mean depriving the race of kassquits insights into the way tosevites functioned at the moment she was demonstrating how they functioned atvar wondered if that had even occurred to her he doubted it tosevites let their sexual desires dictate their behavior to a degree the race found ridiculous and unimaginableexcept during mating season at which time males and females had their minds on other things no he said more to himself than to anyone else he would keep kassquit here in sitneff that might mean he would have to weigh carefully anything she said about the american tosevites fair enough weighing data was something he was good at he realized he would also have to weigh what he got from ttomalss who would not be anything close to objective about his former ward sending a message to tosev was another matter atvar no longer had authority to do it on his own he hadnt since his recall but altering the big uglies sexuality might be important he was even willing to go through channels to make sure the idea reached the distant colony he was willing yes but he wasnt enthusiastic years of handling affairs on tosev himself as the emperors autonomous viceroy had left him impatient with the idea of gaining others permission before acting he was convinced he knew enough to do what needed doing on his own anyone who thought otherwise had to be misguided of course the entire cumbersome bureaucracy here on home had eventually decided otherwise atvar remained convinced those bureaucrats were fools when he talked to them here he did his best not to show it ttomalss was rightthis was an important idea it was even more important than getting even with the bunglers whod recalled him so he told himself anyhow his majestys chief scientific adviser was a female named yendiss she heard atvar out and then asked what assurance do you have that researchers can actually discover or synthesize a drug of this sort assurance why none atvar answered but i have one contrary assurance to offer you superior female oh yendiss said and that is if researchers do not look for a drug of this sort they are guaranteed not to find it atvar said in the monitor yendiss eye turrets swung sharply toward him are you being sarcastic fleetlord she demanded not at all atvar made the negative gesture i thought i was stating a simple and obvious truth if such a drug is there to be found we ought to find it making the big uglies more like us would reduce some acute sociological strains on tosev it would make assimilating the tosevites much easier is that not an important consideration the scientific adviser did not answer directly instead she asked do you have any idea how expensive this research might be no superior female atvar answered resignedly but whatever it costs i am convinced making it will be cheaper than not making it send me a memorandum yendiss said make it as detailed as possible listing costs and benefits by the way she said that she plainly thought costs the more important consideration once i have something in writing i can submit it to specialists for their analysis and input it shall be done atvar broke the connection he let out a loud frustrated hiss the race had done business like this for a hundred thousand years that was finewhen the business had nothing to do with the big uglies how many years would go by before the specialists made up their minds yendiss wouldnt care she would say getting the right answer was the most important thing sometimes though the right answer seemed obvious getting it quickly began to matter anyone whod dealt with tosev knew that how many centuries had the race spent preparing the conquest fleet after its probe showed that the big uglies were ripe for the taking enough so that by the time the conquest fleet arrived the tosevites werent ripe any more would this be more of the same not if i have anything to do with it atvar declared and made another call before long the imperial protocol master looked out of a monitor at him i greet you fleetlord herrep said i doubt this is strictly a social call so what do you want of me i would like to speak with the emperor for a little while atvar replied this has to do with affairs on tosev are you trying to leap over some functionary who obstructs you herrep asked in a word yes his majesty rarely lets himself be used that way the protocol master warned if he refuses i am no worse off though the race may be atvar said he does see the big uglies as a real problem for the race though which not many here seem to do please forward my request to him if you would be so kind let him decide i believe it is important very well fleetlord herrep said please note that i guarantee nothing the decision is in the grip of his majestys fingerclaws i understand and i thank you atvar answered whatever he chooses i shall accept of course i shall what choice have i got the protocol master broke the connection too late atvar realized herrep hadnt said when he would forward the request to the emperor or how long it might be till risson called backif he did a delay of a few days wouldnt matter a delay of a few months or even a few years wouldnt be anything out of the ordinary for the race that kind of delay might be unfortunate but who without firsthand experience of the big uglies would realize exactly how unfortunate it might be atvars telephone hissed frequently whenever it did he hoped it would be the emperor returning his call whenever it wasnt he felt an unreasonable stab of disappointment and then four days after hed spoken with herrep it was the female on the line spoke without preamble assume the posture of respect so you may hear his majestys words it shall be done atvar replied and he did it the female disappeared from the monitor the th emperor rissons image replaced her atvar said i greet you your majesty i am honored to have the privilege of conversation with you rise fleetlord tell me what is on your mind risson replied he sometimes stood on hardly more ceremony than the big uglies did herrep seems to think you have come up with something interesting i hope so your majesty atvar explained risson heard him out then asked what are the chances for success i would not care to guess about them because i have no idea atvar replied but they must be much greater than zero our biochemists are skilled and on tosev they will have studied the big uglies metabolism for many years if we do not make the effort what hope do we have of success that i can guess none truth risson said very well you have persuaded me i shall issue the necessary orders to pass this idea on to our colony on tosev let us see what the colonists do with it if the big uglies were more like us they would certainly be easier to assimilate we should do all we can to try to bring that about i think you are right your majesty and i thank you very much atvar said you will also have seen for yourself by now how little inclined toward compromise the wild big uglies are this may eventually give us a new weapon against them one we can use when we would hesitate to bring out our bombs let us hope so anyhow the emperor said is there anything more when atvar made the negative gesture risson broke the connection he does take the big uglies seriously atvar thought if only more males and females did dr melanie blanchard poked and prodded sam yeager she looked in his ears and down his throat she listened to his chest and lungs she took his blood pressure she put on a rubber glove and told him to bend over are you sure we need a doctor here he asked she laughed ive never known anybody who enjoys this she said i do know its necessary especially for a man your age or do you really want to mess around with the possibility of prostate cancer with a sigh sam assumed the position the examination was just as much fun as he remembered he said suppose ive got it what can you do about it here x rays certainly dr blanchard answered chemotherapy possibly if we can get the race to synthesize the agents wed need or maybe surgery with lizard physicians assisting me im sure some of them would be fascinated she took off the glove and threw it away doesnt look like we need to worry about that though well good sam straightened up and did his best to restore his dignity how do i check out youre pretty good she said id like it if your blood pressure were a little lower than but thats not bad for a man your age not ideal but not bad you used to be an athlete didnt you a ballplayer he answered never made the big leagues but i put in close to twenty years in the minors you could do that before the lizards came ive tried to stay in halfway decent shape since youve done all right dr blanchard told him i wouldnt recommend that you go out and run a marathon but you seem to be okay for all ordinary use ill take that sam said thanks very much for the checkupor for most of it anyhow youre welcome she started to laugh sam raised an eyebrow she explained i started to tell you my pleasure but that isnt right i dont enjoy doing that no matter how necessary it is well good he said again and got another laugh from her she packed up her supplies and walked out of his room sam laughed too though he was damned if he was sure it was funny the closest most intimate physical contact hed had with a woman since his wife diedand hed been on the wrong end of a rubber glove if that wasnt mortifying he didnt know what would be he didnt usually worry about such things he didnt usually get reminded about them quite so openly though he was still a man his parts did still work he laughed once more they would work anyhow if he could find himself some company major coffey had managed sam shrugged no accounting for taste kassquit had always fascinated him but hed never thought she was especially attractive he shrugged again jonathan would have told him he was wrongand karen would have hit jonathan for telling him that someone knocked on the door that meant an american stood in the hall a lizard would have pressed the button for the door hisser sam looked around had dr blanchard forgotten something he wondered hopefully he didnt see anything that looked medical too bad he opened the door there stood tom de la rosa sam aimed an accusing forefinger at him youre not a beautiful woman he said de la rosa rubbed his mustache with this on my upper lip im not likely to be one either well come on in anyhow sam said ill try not to hold it against you im so relieved tom walked past yeager and over to the window youve got a nicer view than we do see what you get for being ambassador sam had come to take the view for granted now he looked at it with fresher eyes it was pretty impressive in a stark southwestern way reminds me a little of tucson or maybe albuquerque somewhere in there tom de la rosa agreed if we dont get what we need here you know tucson and albuquerque are going to look a lot more like this they look a lot more like this now than they did when we went into cold sleep i do know that sam said arizona and new mexico are just about perfect country for plants and animals from home and if they crowd ours out i dont know how were going to get rid of them tom said the lizards dont show a whole lot of give on this one youve got that wrong sam said de la rosa sent him a questioning look he spelled out what he meant the lizards dont show any give at all on this one as far as theyre concerned theyre just making themselves at homeor at homeon earth de la rosa winced at the audible capital letter when he recovered he said but its not right dammit theyve got no business imposing their ecology on us starlings and english sparrows in the united states and kentucky bluegrass and russian thistle which is what a lot of tumbleweeds are sam said mournfully rats in hawaii mongoosesor is it mongeese too rabbits and cats and cane toads in australia i could go on its not as if we havent done it to ourselves but we didnt know any better most of the time we didnt anyhow tom de la rosa said the race knows perfectly well what its doing it knows more about ecology than well learn in the next hundred years the lizards just dont give a damn and they ought to they say they havent introduced anything into territory we rule they say what they do on territory they rule is their businessand if their critters happen to come over the border they dont mind if we get rid of them mighty generous of them theyd tell king canute he was welcome to hold back the tide too tom said bitterly the only thing they wouldnt tell him was how to go about it well tom heres the question ive got for you sam said if the lizards dont want to change their mindsand it doesnt look like they dois this worth going to war to stop thats not the point the point is getting them to stop de la rosa said sam shook his head no they dont want to they dont intend to theyve made that as plain as they possibly can as far as theyre concerned theyre moving into a new neighborhood and theyve brought their dogs and cats and cows and sheep and some of their flowers along with them theyre just making themselves at home bullshit they understand ecological issues fine they dont have any trouble at all tom said look at the fit they pitched about the rats have they caught any besides the first two itd serve the race right if the damn things did get loose as far as i know those are the only ones theyve got their hands on sam said but you still havent answered my question is this something we fight about or is it already too late for that you cant put things back in pandoras box once theyre loose can you probably not de la rosa looked as disgusted as he sounded but the arid country on eartheverywhere from australia to the sahara to our own southwestis never going to be the same the least we can do is get an agreement out of them not to introduce any more of their species to earth thats locking the barn door after the horse is long gone though ive been over this with atvar before hes always said no i dont think hes going to change his mind sam yeager sighed he saw toms point hed seen with his own eyes what creatures from home were doing in and to the southwestand things had only got worse since he went into cold sleep he sighed again atvar will tell me the race is as sovereign in the parts of earth it rules as we are in the usa hell say we have no right to interfere in what the lizards do there hell say we complain about being interfered with but now were meddling for all were worth its not a bad argument how am i supposed to answer him throw the rats in his face tom suggested that will get him to understand why were worried he already understands he just doesnt care theres a difference sam said no matter what happens from our point of view the lizards get major benefits by importing their animals and plants if we try to tell them they cant were liable to have to fight to back it up is this worth a war tom de la rosa looked as if he hated him you dont make things easy do you atvars told me the same thing from him i take it as a compliment ill try to do the same from you sam said but you still havent answered my question the lizards are changing the planet i agree with youthats what theyre doing do we wreck it to keep them from changing it thats not a fair way to put things tom protested no thats what it boils down to from here sam said we can have a damaged ecology or we can have a planet that glows in the dark or else youll tell me its not worth a war but nothing short of war is going to make the lizards change their policy about this instead of answering de la rosa stormed out of the room yeager wasnt particularly surprised or particularly disappointed tom was a hothead you needed to be a hothead to get involved in ecological matters every so often though even hotheads bumped up against the facts of life sometimes the cost of stopping a change was higher than the cost of the change itself he looked out the window again he imagined saguaros putting down deep roots here he imagined owls nesting in the saguaros and roadrunners scurrying here and there in the shade of the cactuses snapping up whatever little lizardy things they could catch he imagined sidewinders looping along he imagined how the lizards would feel about all of thatespecially the ones who had the misfortune to bump into sidewinders would they go to war to keep it from happening they might but it was already happening back on earth too late to stop it now and whatever else happened he couldnt imagine an american colonization fleet crossing the lightyears and coming down on home the race had the population to spare for that sort of thing the usa didnt he wondered how much hed accomplished by coming here that hed got here alive was pretty impressive too hed had the audience with the emperor and the private meeting afterwards but what had he gained that he couldnt have got from reffet and kirel back on earth anything if he had he was hard pressed to see it he understood tom de la rosas frustration he had plenty of frustration of his own the lizards here on home were less inclined to compromise than the ones back on earth had been they thought they were right and any miserable big ugly had to be wrong one thing the flight of the admiral peary had proved humans could fly between the stars the race couldnt ignore that the lizards would have to be wondering what else might be on the way maybe the colonists back on earth could radio ahead and let home know other starships were coming but maybe not too if humans wanted to send secret expeditions they might be able to sam grimaced the reich might do that and any german expedition would come with guns not just handy but loaded the nazis owed the lizards for a defeat after all this time would they try to pay them back how am i supposed to know sam asked himself all he knew about what the reich was like these days he got from the radio bulletins beamed homeward by america and by the lizards themselves it didnt seem to have changed all that muchand there was one more thing to worry about whenever jonathan yeager saw kassquit he wanted to ask her if she was happy she certainly gave all the signs of it or as many as she could with a face that didnt show what she was thinking frank coffey seemed pretty happy these days too jonathan had no great urge to ask him if he was that was none of his business not unless coffey felt like making it his business jonathan wondered what the difference was that hed been intimate with kassquit all those years ago he thought there was more to it than that he hoped so anyhow he had the strong feeling that major frank coffey could take care of himself he wasnt nearly so sure about kassquit she couldnt be a lizard however much she wanted to but she didnt exactly know how to be a human being either she was liable to get hurt or to hurt herself and what can you do about it if she does jonathan asked himself the answer to that was only too obvious he couldnt do a damn thing and he knew it he also knew karen would grab the nearest blunt instrument and brain him if he tried he sighed he couldnt blame karen for being antsy about kassquit to his wife kassquit was the other woman in scarlet letters ten feet high kassquit wasnt at her best around karen either it came as something of a relief when trir said would any of you tosevites care for a sightseeing tour today at breakfast one morning what sort of sights do you have in mind showing us linda de la rosa asked perhaps you would like to go to the crimson desert the guide said it has a wild grandeur unlike any other on home i want to go tom de la rosa said i would like to see what you term a desert on this world when so much of it would be a desert on tosev all the americans volunteeredeven jonathans father who said none of the negotiations going on right now will addle if we pause pausing may even help some of them jonathan knew his dad wasnt happy with the way things were going he hadnt expected him to come out and say so though then kassquit asked may i also come i too would like to see more of home yes researcher you are welcome trir said we will leave from in front of the hotel in half a daytenth all of you should bring whatever you require for an overnight stay the crimson desert karen said musingly i wonder what it will be like hot jonathan said his wife gave him a sardonic nod had they been going to the desert on earth he would have warned her to take along a cream that prevented sunburn as a redhead she needed to worry about it more than most people did but tau ceti wasnt the sun it put out a lot less ultraviolet radiation even in the warmest weather sunburn wasnt so much of a worry here they boarded the bus that had taken them out to the ranch the driver left the hotels lot and pulled out into traffic they were off the bus dark windows kept lizard drivers and passengers in other vehicles from gaping at big uglies it didnt keep the americans from looking out whenever jonathan saw a lizard in a wigor every once in a while a lizard in a tshirthe had everything he could do not to howl with laughter then hed run a hand over his own shaven skull and think about sauces and geese and ganders in the halfhearted lizard way the bus was airconditioned that meant it was hot inside but not quite stifling jonathans father started to laugh whats funny dad jonathan asked another bus ride his father answered i used to think id taken the last one when i quit playing ball but i was wrong i bet you never expected to take one on another world jonathan said well thats a fact sam yeager agreed all the same though a bus ride is a bus ride some things dont change and i keep looking for greasy spoons by the side of the road i dont suppose the race knows anything about chopsuey joints or hotdog stands probably a good thing they dont jonathan said yeah i suppose his father said but it hardly seems like a road trip without em ive been spoiled i have this idea of how things are supposed to work and im disappointed when they turn out different you probably expect flat tires too jonathan said his father nodded you bet i do ive seen enough of them heck ive helped change enough of them i wonder what the lizards use for a jack lets hope we dont find out jonathan said to his relief his father didnt argue with him they had no trouble getting to the crimson desert the bus rolled south and east out of sitneff into open country by any earthly standards that would have been desert by the standards of home it wasnt it was nothing but scrub treeish things were few and far between but smaller plants kept the ground from being too barren every once in a while jonathan spotted some kind of animal scurrying along though the bus usually went by too fast to let him tell what the creature was mountains rose ahead the bus climbed them the road grew steep and narrow jonathan got the feeling not a whole lot of vehicles came this way he hadnt thought home would have roads to nowhere but the one they were on sure gave that feeling up and up it went the bus engine labored a little the driver turned off the air conditioning but it kept getting cooler inside the bus anyhow it might have dropped all the way down into the seventies it was the coolest jonathan had been anywhere on home this side of the south pole a few minutes later they came to what was obviously the crest of the grade trir said this is the thirdhighest pass on all of home without checking an atlas jonathan had no idea whether she was right but nothing about the place made him want to disbelieve her the bus seemed relieved to find a downhill slope the driver knew her business she never let it get going too fast but she was never too obvious about riding the brakes either the change in the weather on the other side of the mountains was immediate and profound before long three or four americans and kassquit all called for the driver to turn the air conditioning on again with a sigh she did it suddenly seemed to be fighting a much more savage climate there trir pointed ahead out through the windshield now you can see why this place got its name jonathan craned his neck for a better look sure enough the cliffsides and the ground were of a reddish color brighter than rust he wouldnt have called most of it crimson but he wouldnt have revoked anyone elses poetic license either and color names didnt translate perfectly between the races language and english to begin with down went the bus into the middle of the desert by the noises the air conditioning made it was working harder and harder by the way sweat ran down jonathans face it wasnt working hard enough how hot is it outside he asked probably about fiftyfive hundredths trir answered the race divided the distance between waters freezing and boiling points into hundredthsthe exact equivalent of celsius degrees the usa still routinely used fahrenheit jonathan was struggling to do the conversion in his head when frank coffey spoke in horrified english jesus thats just the other side of it could get that hot on earth just barely but trir spoke as if this was nothing out of the ordinary what was that line about mad dogs and englishmen noel coward had never heard of lizards when he wrote it ten minutes later the bus stopped air like a blast furnace rolled inside its a dry heat jonathan thought in something not far from despair that worked fine when the temperature was in the nineties over a hundred it wore thin at the moment all it meant was that jonathan would bake instead of boiling trir seemed perfectly happy is it not a bracing climate she said come out all of you and look around she skittered out of the bus and down onto the ground major coffey wasnt the only human being who said jesus but theyd come all this way there wasntjonathan supposed there wasntmuch point just to staying in the bus he got to his feet and went out into the crimson desert jesus didnt begin to do it justice jonathan found he had to keep blinking almost as fast as he could if he didnt his eyeballs started drying out in between blinks he looked around the place did have a stark beauty to it wind and dust had carved the crimson cliffs into a cornucopia of crazy shapes not all the shades of red were the same there were bands and twists of rust and scarlet and crimson and carmine and magenta here and there he spotted flecks of white all the brighter for being so isolated tau ceti beat down on him out of a greenish blue sky does anything actually live here tom de la rosa asked can anything actually live here he didnt sound as if he believed it jonathan had trouble believing it too but trir made the affirmative gesture why certainly you can see the saltbushes there and the peffelem plants jonathan couldnt have told a saltbush from a peffelem plant if his life depended on it both varieties looked like nothing but dry sticks to him where do they get their water he asked the inside of his mouth was drying out too they have very deep root structures the guide replied all the way to china didnt seem to apply not here on home or maybe it did by the way the air and the ground felt plants might have needed ten lightyears worth of roots to draw any water to these parts but then to his amazement something moved under those sticklike caricatures of plants what was that he said his voice rising in surprise some kind of crawling thing trir answered indifferently there are several varieties in these parts most of them live nowhere else on home they come already cooked too i bet jonathans father said in english when he translated that into the races language trir laughed it is hot certainly but not so hot as all that i agree kassquit said shed been raised to take for granted the temperatures lizards normally lived with this probably felt the same for her as it did for trir the americans though were used to earthly weather dr blanchard said be careful of heatstroke im glad i made sure we brought plenty of water can we go back inside the bus please linda de la rosa said im feeling medium rare or maybe a little more done than that but i wanted to talk about the famous fossils not far from here trir said these are some of the fossils that the famous savant iffud used to help establish the theory of evolution she paused you tosevites are familiar with the theory of evolution are you not why no major coffey said straightfaced suppose you tell us what it is it sounds as if it might be interesting cut it out frank jonathan said in english and poked him with an elbow then he went back to the language of the race he is joking senior tour guide we have known of the theory of evolution for more than three hundred of your years we have known of it for more than years trir said starchily so there jonathan thought but the trip to the crimson desert had turned out to be interesting in ways he hadnt expected and he told himself he would never complain about the weather in sitneff again no matter what mickey flynn gazed out of the admiral peary s control room at home below i feel superfluous he remarked not a great deal for a pilot to do here now that i contemplate matters theres nothing for a pilot to do here as a matter of fact you buzz around on a scooter same as i do glen johnson said oh huzzah joy and rapture were not what filled flynns voice im sure mickey mantle played catch with his little boy too after he retired do you suppose he got the same thrill as he did when he played for kansas city not fair johnson said but then he liked flying a scooter the difference between him on the one hand and flynn and stone on the other was that he was a pilot who could fly a starship while they were starship pilots to them scooters were like rowboats after the queen mary johnson went on with a little luck youll have the chance to fly her back to earth too well yes there is that flynn agreed how very antiquated do you suppose well be there at the tail end of the twentyfirst century like civil war veterans when the lizards camethats the comparison that springs to mind there were a few johnson said not many but a few so there were flynn nodded ponderously but at least they lived through the time in between they saw the changes happen with their own eyes when we get back well have been on ice most of the time everything we run into will be a surprise youre in a cheerful mood today arent you johnson said and the other pilot nodded again some of those worries had occurred to johnson too he didnt see how he could have avoided them alone in his bunk in the wee small hours all these lightyears from earth what did he have to do but worry after a bit he added something else makes me wonder speak give forth flynn urged okay here it is how come there arent any other american starships here or starships from anywhere else come to that we started first you may possibly have noticed this flynn said then again since you were in cold sleep for so long you may have given up noticing things for lent oh yeah we started first i knew thatknew it once i woke up anyway johnson said but so what the admiral peary s not as fast as a lizard starship youd figure the state of the art back on earth would get better theyd build faster ships and wed have company only we dont who knows whats on the way flynn said well i dont johnson admitted but radios twice as fast as a lizard shipi suppose that means its twice as fast as anything were likely to make too theres the molotov but have you heard about starships besides her on the way no one has whispered anything into my pink and shelllike ear flynn replied johnson snorted ignoring the noise the other pilot continued this is not to say our beloved commandant and the race dont know more than i do johnsons comment about their beloved commandant was worse than insubordinate it was downright mutinous flynn clucked in mild reproach johnson cared very little he said the lizards might tell us whats going on you think healey ever would oh ye of little faith flynn said which was and wasnt an answer at the same time thats me johnson agreed thats me right down to the ground and i ask you wheres our next starship after the molotov wheres the new american ship or the japanese one hell the nazis are liable to be back in space again maybe theyre waiting for news from us to get back to earth flynn said maybe they didnt know if the cold sleep worked as well as they thought maybe the here be dragons notices printed on all the road maps made them think twice but now theyll have to think that if we can do it anybody can do it maybe johnson said that makes more sense than anything i thought of why am i not surprised flynn asked ha funny johnson gave him a dirty look it bounced off his armor of irony muttering johnson continued if youre right though things have changed back on earth the germans solve problems by throwing bodies at them till they go awayor they used to anyhow takes a lot of bodies to stretch from earth to tau ceti flynn observed and everyone who found out about a failure would laugh at the failed party the nazis always did have a hard time seeing a joke when it was on them mm maybe johnson said again once more the other pilot had an answer for him whether it was the answer well how could he say when he was in orbit around home and the answer whatever it was lay back on earth he looked down at the lizards world the landscape down there was almost as familiar as earths by now with less cloud cover than was usual on earth he could see better too they were coming up on sitneff the dust storm that had plagued the city where the americans were staying had subsided i wonder how melanies doing down there he said pretty well by all the reports flynn said why did you think she couldnt live without you actually i thought shed be so glad to get away from you that shed start dancing too soon and hurt herself johnson answered have i been reviled have i been insulted have i been slandered have i been traduced have i been given the glove have i been slammed have i been cut have i flynn went on pouring out synonyms till anyone would have thought him the second coming of the illustrious dr roget enough already johnson exclaimed by the time it was much more than enough mercifully the other pilot fell silent johnson enjoyed the quiet for about five minutes then the intercom summoned him to lieutenant general healeys office he enjoyed that not at all he would rather have gone to the dentist by all the signs healey was less than enamored of having him there the commandant growled congratulations youve managed to make the lizards love you sir johnson said woodenly if he wasnt baiting healey healey would be baiting him he didnt want to give the other man a handle if he could help it but healey only nodded which made his j edgar hoover jowls wobble thats right your rescue mission with the scooter impressed the hell out of them and so weve arranged a cultural exchange mission with the race sir johnson said again this time in surprise were going to trade them one of our scooters for one of theirs healey said theres not a damn thing on one of our scooters that can help them militarily and they must feel the same way about theirs so well swap and look them over and see if we learn anything oh johnson knew he still sounded startled had anyone but healey told him that he wouldnt have been but hed always figured healey would sooner swap missiles with the lizards than information im so glad this meets with your approval the commandants sarcasm would have stung more if johnson hadnt already been on the receiving end of it so often healey said the scooter is waiting at lock two the sooner you fly it to the horned akiss the sooner well get a lizard scooter to play with all right johnson said now that i know where im going i expect i can get there it does make things easier you know healey waved that away he waved away almost everything johnson said whether or not the motion showed go on he said johnson went he enjoyed flying the scooter had lieutenant general healey known how much he enjoyed it the commandant probably would have chosen someone else for the job healey never had wanted him to have any fun well too bad for the redoubtable lieutenant general johnson got into his spacesuit then ran checks on the scooter everything came up green he hadnt thought healey would want him to have an unfortunate accident but you never could tell the outer airlock door opened johnson used the scooters little steering jets to ease it out into space as soon as he did he started to laugh he knew exactly how the little spacecraft was supposed to respond when he goosed it it was definitely slower than it should have been which meant it was heavier than it should have been you sandbagging son of a bitch he exclaimed having first made sure his radio was off before sending the lizards a scooter healey had made sure it didnt perform as well as it might have he wanted the race to keep right on underestimating what humans could do that struck johnson as singularly pointless way the hell out here if he said anything about it though the commandant would probably order him back and clap him in irons instead he called the horned akiss on one of the races signaling frequencies he found out the lizards there were expecting him that came as a relief it would have been just like healey to send him out and hope the race would shoot him down evidently notnot this time anyway once johnson got clear of the admiral peary he aimed the scooter at the horned akiss and fired up the rear engine sure enough the little rocketship was lugging an anvil its acceleration wasnt a patch on what it should have been inside his suit he shrugged sooner or later hed get there and in due course he did he wasnt invited aboard the lizards ship instead one of their scooters waited for him i greet you tosevite the lizard aboard it called shall we exchange craft that seems to be the point of the exercise johnson brought his scooter up alongside the bigger one and killed relative velocity by then hed stopped worrying about the extra weight he was carrying it was like flying with a couple of passengers and hed done that often enough he read the races language so the controls on the other scooter made sense to him he had to explain his to the lizard who might never have heard of english or of arabic numerals fortunately the maleor was it a female didnt get flustered saying it all seems straightforward enough it is johnson agreed just take it slow and easy and you will do fine good advice i had not thought a tosevite would be so sensible the lizard replied the same also goes for you slow and easy as you say oh yes johnson made the affirmative gesture he was cautious flying the lizards scooter back to the admiral peary he had to get used to it it performed about the way hed expected though he hoped the lizard pilot wouldnt be too disappointed with the logy machine the big uglies had sent to the race and then when johnson was almost back to the american starship he said something about the commandant that would have made all his earlier remarks fit for a love letter he couldnt prove a thing but he had a feeling he shook his fist in the direction of lieutenant general healeys office healey couldnt see him of course any more than the commandant could hear him too damn bad he thought sam yeager was sick and tired of the conference rooms in the hotel in sitneff one morning he asked atvar fleetlord would it offend you if we moved our discussions across the way to the park for a while would it offend me no the lizard replied i do not think we would be so efficient there though and will you not grow uncomfortable as the day warms up thats why i said for a while yeager told him but i do not think it will be too bad sitneff is not that much warmer than los angeles the city where i settled not long after the fight with the conquest fleet ended well then ambassador let it be as you wish atvar said maybe changing where we talk will also change the direction in which our talks are going i must say that also occurred to me sam agreed i am afraid their direction could use some changing the way he looked at things the problem was that his talks with atvar had no direction he would propose things the fleetlord would either reject them talk around them or say they needed more study before anything could be settled to the race more study often meant a delay of decades if not centuries sam had been reluctant to point that out not wanting to derail things altogether but he had concluded that things were already about as derailed as they could be he wondered whether atvar felt the same way or whether the lizard was satisfied to stall sam hoped not one way or the other it was time to find out cars and trucks and buses halted when yeager appeared at the crosswalk drivers and passengers all turned their eye turrets his way i enjoy being with you in public atvar remarked as they crossed it is not easy for me to be anonymous not with the body paint i put on next to you though i am invisible most refreshing glad to be of service sam said dryly atvar laughed when they got to the park sam led them to some tables and benches screened from the morning sun by the treelike shrubs behind them are you sure you are comfortable ambassador atvar asked i thank you for your concern but i am fine sam said he nodded politely to a rabotev walking along the path the darkskinned alien hopped in the air in surprise sam yeager turned back to atvar i am fine as far as comfort goes anyhow i am less happy with the direction of our talks to use your term i am sorry to hear that it makes my liver heavy atvar said if it does fleetlord a little more real cooperation might work wonders sam said bluntly from my point of view the race seems to be doing its best to make these discussions go nowhere while appearing to make progress what an extraordinary notion atvar exclaimed how can you possibly say that when you have conferred with the emperor himself he cast his eye turrets down toward the pale sandy soil beneath his feet i can say it because it appears to me to be a truth i am honored the emperor said he wanted to help settle the differences between the race and the united states i am honored yes but i am not very impressed he offered no proposals only his good will good will is valuable i do not reject it but good will by itself does not solve problems you must not expect haste from us atvar said remember we are not used to dealing with independent notempires he laughed again we are not used to dealing with notempires at all i understand that i have tried to take it into account sam said i am sorry but it does not seem to be a good enough explanation if you do not deal with us through diplomacy we will end up fighting am i wrong probably not atvar answered if we do fight the race will win am i wrong you would have been right when i went into cold sleep fleetlord i know that sam said now now i am not so sure any of your planets would get away untouched you have been able to wreck tosev for a long time now we can also reach you you would do well to remember that is this diplomacy or only a threat atvar asked it is diplomacy it is also a threat yeager answered i do not try to deny it you did not worry about threatening us when you came to tosev you went ahead and did it and not just with words you invaded my notempire you occupied parts of it for years you dropped nuclear weapons on washington and seattle and pearl harbor these are truths even if perhaps you would rather not remember them now if we fight again your worlds will learn what sort of truths they are he waited there was a chance that atvar would stand up and spit in his eye if that happened he didnt know what hed do resign the ambassadorship maybe and go back up to the admiral peary and back into cold sleep someone else would have a better chance of getting a worthwhile agreement out of the lizards atvars tailstump lashed in agitation whatever hed expected to hear what sam had just told him wasnt it at last he answered ambassador you fought in that war how can you speak of visiting its like on home and the other worlds of the empire you still do not see my point fleetlord or not all of it sam said the prospect bothers you more because now it might happen to you too he added an emphatic cough it did not bother you at all when it could only happen to big uglies and that is what i am trying to tell you you were wrong not to be bothered under those circumstances we have a saying what goes around comes around do you understand that i had to translate it literally i think i do atvar said it is another way of saying that what we did to you you can now do to us that is part of it but only part of it yeager said you did it to us and you thought you were right to do it to us why should we not think we are also right to do it to you he watched the fleetlords tailstump quiver again he could make a pretty good guess about what atvar was thinking because we are the race and you are nothing but a pack of wild big uglies but that was the sort of thinking that had sent the conquest fleet out it might have made some sense against an opponent who couldnt hit back the lizards didnt face that kind of opponent any more if they didnt keep it in mind everybody would be sorry when atvar still didnt say anything sam spoke again quietly this too is what equality means to his surprise atvars mouth fell open in a laugh though the lizard was anything but amused you know of course that shiplord straha almost cast me down from my position his reason for doing so was that i had not prosecuted the war against the tosevites hard enough to suit him he felt that if we did not do everything we could regardless of consequences to overcome tosevite resistance we would regret it one day enough of the assembled shiplords thought him wrong to let me keep the job i reckoned him a maniac again you know of this oh yes i know of this sam made the affirmative gesture after straha defected to the usa one jump ahead of atvars vengeance the exile and yeager had become good friends sam didnt remind atvar of that it would have been rude instead he said but now i have to say i am not sure i see your point it is very simplenot complicated in the least atvar answered my point is straha was right here we are all these years later and straha was right irony has a bitter taste this time sam had to think hard before deciding what to say next he had heard straha say the same thing for all he knew the shiplord was saying it right now back on earth does straha still live he asked i was in cold sleep a long time and have not heard i do not know if he still lives but the signal that he has died has yet to reach home atvar replied sam used the affirmative gesture again when news took years to travel from one sun to the next still could be a nebulous notion the fleetlord went on are you not grateful for my mistaken moderation are you sure it was mistaken yeager said there is no guarantee you would have won a great and final victory with straha in command by what i recall you were fighting pretty hard as things were we will never know will we atvar said could the result have been much worse for my species than what in fact occurred i think it could have sam yeager said if you had not won you would have had all the surviving tosevite notempires and empires mad for revenge against you the fighting on tosev might never have stopped atvar shrugged and so even with constant fighting on tosev we probably would not have had to worry about tosevites visiting home fleetlord we really have a problem here and you need to recognize it yeager said if the race cannot get used to the idea that we big uglies are doing things only you have been doing for thousands of years then the two sides will collide they cannot help but collide and that will not be to anyones advantage better to no ones advantage than to yours alone atvar said i do not believe an agreement on even terms that everyone adheres to would be to anyones disadvantage sam said if i am wrong no doubt you will correct me i think the emperor would also want an equitable agreement that was my impression from my meetings with him again you will correct me if i am wrong you are not wrong where we differ ambassador is in determining what goes into an equitable agreement an equitable agreement is one where both sides have the same duties and the same obligations sam said why should that be so when one side is stronger than the other atvar came back our superior strength should be reflected in any treaty we make sam used the negative gesture what he felt like doing was tearing his hair but he refrained first all independent empires and notempires have the same rights and duties he said this is true on tosev and it used to be true on home as well ask the protocol master if you do not believe me and second as i have pointed out before how much stronger you are is no longer obvious the way it was when i went into cold sleep whether you are stronger at all is no longer obvious in fact he waited he had to wait quite a while at last atvar said this may not prompt a treaty you know this may prompt an effort to exterminate you while we still can the race has been talking about that for a long time sam did his best not to show how alarmed he was i do not believe exterminating us would be easy or cheap i do believe you might end up exterminating yourselves in the process possibly but if we could be rid of you without destroying ourselves altogether the price might well be worth paying is this your opinion the governments opinion or the emperors opinion sam asked the answer to that might tell him where these talks were goingif they were going anywhere he waited it is my opinion atvar said perhaps i am mistaken perhaps peace will prove a benefit to all concerned and not merely a breathing space in which you tosevites gather yourselves for a blow against the race perhaps this is a truth but the evidence from tosev makes me doubt it why am i here then sam asked this time atvar did not answer him at all atvar had begun to hope he never again saw the park across the way from the hotel in sitneff after his talk there with sam yeager he pictured bombs bursting on tosev and on home and on the empires other two worlds how strong were the americans no way to know not for certain all he could know was how strong they had been when the latest signals left tosev the race had comfortably run the empire at light speed for thousands of years delays of signals from one planet to the next had mattered little but tosev was farther from home than either rabotev or halless which made delays longer and the tosevites changed far faster than any species in the empire which made those delays more critical maybe there was a good answer to the problem but atvar failed to see it he was worried enough to telephone the emperor again he didnt get through to risson he hadnt expected to not at oncethings simply didnt work that way he did hope the message he left would persuade risson to call him back his majestys courtiers knew the emperor took a keen interest in tosevite affairs half a day later atvar did get a call from preffilo that female was on the line again atvar assumed the special posture of respect as the emperors image appeared on the monitor as risson had before he said rise fleetlord and tell me what is on your mind it shall be done atvar said once more and summarized what he and sam yeager had had to say to each other he finished what are we going to do your majesty it strikes me that our choices are to grant the big uglies privileges they have not earned and do not deserve or else to face a devastating war neither seems satisfactory will the american tosevites fight if we refuse to make these concessions the emperor asked are they as strong as their ambassador claims he didnt sound the least bit selfconscious at using the old old word to describe sam yeagers status as for your first question your majesty they might atvar answered pride pushes them more strongly than it does us that he might find it harder to recognize the races pride than the big uglies had never occurred to him he went on as for the second question how can we be certain where the tosevites are these days he reminded the emperor of the problem with communicating with tosev risson made the affirmative gesture yes i know the difficulty it has always been next to impossible to administer tosev from home as you say the lag is much more important there than with our other two worlds back when the race first discovered the big uglies were much more advanced than anyone on home had thought the conquest fleet had dutifully radioed the news from tosev to home all those years latermore than twenty of tosev s turns around its stardetailed orders had started coming back from home and the bureaucrats here the only problem with them was they were ridiculously unsuited to the situation as it had developed atvar had had the sense to ignore them the males and females here had taken a lot longer to have the sense to stop sending them what do you recommend now risson persisted do you believe making the concessions the american tosevites demand is necessary to ensure peace do you believe it will ensure peace or will it only encourage the big uglies to demand more from us later with the big uglies that second possibility is never far from the surface atvar said they have only those dull nails in place of fingerclaws but they grab fiercely even so that has also been my impression the emperor said if we reject their demands would they truly fight on that account i am not certain i wish i were in the short run i am inclined to doubt it but they would surely arm themselves more powerfully they would build more starships we might decide on a preventive war against them there is no certainty that war would succeed now the longer we wait the less our likelihood of victory that i would say is certain risson hissed unhappily you are telling me our best choice would be to order allout war against them now our best choice would have been to order allout war against them as soon as the first round of fighting stopped atvar thought grimly but he couldnt have done that it might have left tosev uninhabitable and the colonization fleet was on the way after muttering strahas name under his breath he said when it comes to dealing with the wild big uglies your majesty there are no good choices we have to thread our way through the bad and try to avoid the worst i see the emperor said i always saw but the coming of this starship has poked my snout in it more strongly than ever he paused sam yeager struck me as being a reasonable individual oh he is atvar agreed but he has his duty which is to represent his notempire and he does that quite well when you consider that he also views the world from an alien perspective dealing with him becomes all the more difficult an alien perspective risson echoed we are not used to that sam yeager speaks our language well he adapted to the ceremonial of the audience as well as a citizen of the empire could have done truth i was proud to be his sponsor i do not say he is unintelligenton the contrary atvar said but he is different his differences are to some degree disguised when he speaks our language the assumptions behind his thoughts are not assumptions we would make we believe otherwise at our peril what are we going to do can we annihilate the independent big uglies even if we want to risson asked i do not know atvar answered i simply do not know conditions on tosev are different from the way they were when the latest signals reached us how they are different who can guess but they are different whatever the difference is i doubt that it redounds to our advantage this is a disaster the emperor said a disaster nothing less we would have done better not to land on tosev at all to leave the big uglies to their own devices maybe they would have destroyed themselves by now they would not have had any external rivals then so they might have gone on with their local wars it could be your majesty atvar said unfortunately this is not a choice we can make now we have to deal with the situation as it is not as it was when the conquest fleet arrived i understand that the th emperor risson said but am i not allowed to wish it were otherwise why not your majesty we all have wishes about what might have been when it comes to the big uglies how could it be otherwise the way things really are is less than satisfactory truth the emperor said now tell me this if you would be so kindsuppose we grant every concession the american big uglies seek from us if we give them everything they say they want will that be enough to make them keep whatever agreement they may make with us they are in their own way honorable they would intend to stick to the terms of a treaty your majesty atvar said the trouble with them is that unlike us they are changeable in twenty years or fifty years or at most a hundred years they will not be what they are now they will look at the treaty and they will say this is not relevant because we are not the same as we were we are smarter we are stronger you need to change this that and the other thing to reflect these new conditions and you may be sure the new terms they demand will be to their advantage not ours we do change but we change slowly and sensibly risson said by all the signs they change for the sport of changing oh they do your majesty they admit it atvar replied change has become ingrained in their culture in a way it never did with us their motorcars look different from year to yearnot because the new ones run better though they often do but merely so it can be seen that they are new they change the style of their cloth wrappings in the same way and for the same reason it is as if we changed the style of our body paint every few years we could not do that it would hatch chaos risson exclaimed i understand that it is one of the reasons i find our young males and females with their false hair and even their wrappings so disturbing but the big uglies embrace change where we mostly endure it atvar said anyone who does not see that does not see the first thing about them it drives us mad that we are so different often drives the big uglies mad i think but their variability has proved a great source of strength for them the emperor let out another unhappy hiss again you are telling me war now may be our best hope it may be atvar said unwillingly but it also may not if war comes it will cost us more than we have paid in the whole history of the empire i do not believe sam yeager was lying or bluffing when he said the american big uglies would attack all our worlds in case of war i do not believe we will be able to block all their attacks either they will hurt us they will hurt us badly whether the other independent tosevites will join them against us i cannot say if they do that would make a bad situation worse how much worse i am not prepared to guess and what will happen to tosev if war breaks out between us and the independent big uglies risson asked well your majesty i am not there in his wisdom the previous emperor your illustrious predecessor chose to recall me atvar could not keep acid from his voice he went on my opinion however for what it may be worth is that the big uglies should never get another chance to start a war if they are addled enough to fight now and if that means leaving tosev uninhabitable for us and for them so be it up until this time they were local menaces restricted to their own solar system that unfortunately is no longer the case it is too late now to send you back to tosev the emperor said atvar bent into the special posture of respect risson had just done what no one else had done before him hed admitted the race had made a mistake in recalling the fleetlord he gestured for atvar to rise then went on do all you can to promote a peaceful resolution of our difficulties if that fails if that fails we will do what becomes necessary and we will do our best it shall be done your majesty atvar said i hope it shall risson replied as i say we shall attempt it at any rate he is not confident we can beat the big uglies if it comes to war atvar realized the fleetlord would have been more shocked had he been more confident himself what had the tosevites learned in the years since the latest signals from tosev reached home what would they learn in the years while the order to attack was speeding from home to tosev whatever it was how would they apply it to weapons would the race be able to keep up to counter them if the spirits of emperors past are with us we will not have to do that atvar said let us hope they are let us hope we do not have to risson said but let us also be as ready as we can so we will see trouble as it hatches and before it grows too much atvar wished the emperor hadnt added the last two words but made the affirmative gesture anyway ttomalss had stopped stalking around sitneff looking for befflem to boot kassquit would do whatever she did if it brought her emotional and physical satisfaction well and good if it brought her emotional travail she was an adult and would have to cope with it as best she could so the psychologist told himself anyhow if a small mean part of him rather hoped his former ward ran into emotional travail he had the grace to be ashamed of that part he did his best not to let it affect his thinking or his actions it wasnt as if he had nothing else on his mind one morningearly one morningpesskrag telephoned him and said i hope you know you are responsible for commencing the unraveling of work thought to be truth for tens of millennia am i ttomalss said around a yawn and how should i feel about thisbesides sleepy i mean you areyou and that other psychologist back on tosev that felless pesskrag said if you two had not brought the big uglies research to our attention we might have remained ignorant of these developments forever now that you know of them what can you do with them ttomalss eye turrets were beginning to decide they would work together after all once he got some breakfast he probably would be capable of rational thought he wouldnt have bet on that when the telephone first hissed for his attention that is why my colleagues and i have been experimenting so diligently to begin to find out what we can do the physicist answered she went on we are not altogether sure we believe what we are finding i have asked you beforejust what is so startling about these tosevite discoveries ttomalss said are you in a better position to tell me than you were the last time we spoke we may see more change in the next two to five hundred years than we have seen at any time in our history since home was unified pesskrag said what sort of change ttomalss demanded how will things be different he hoped for concrete answers pesskrag remained resolutely abstract senior researcher at present i have no idea but as we evaluate each experiment it will suggest others and we will probably have a much better notion of exactly where we are going in a few more years there are times when i believe you are doing your best to addle me with frustration ttomalss said pesskrag laughed and made the negative gesture ttomalss made the affirmative one yes i do believe that will you not give me at least some idea of how much you have learned since we last spoke laughing still the physicist replied it shall be done superior sir last time we spoke i believe i said our knowledge was like a new hatchling still wet with the juices from its egg we have indeed advanced from that point now in my opinion our knowledge is like a new hatchling on which the sun has dried the juices from its egg i thank you so very much ttomalss pungent sarcasm set pesskrag laughing all over again ttomalss stubbornly persisted how far is the gap from fascinating experiment to workable new technology i am very sorry senior researcher but i have no way to judge that pesskrag replied it will be a while technology that induces such major changes will have to be investigated with unusual care that will slow its implementation we will need a good many lifetimes before we can fully evaluate it shed said that before too suppose we were reckless suppose we were reckless to the point of being addled ttomalss tried to force on her a mental exercise hed used before suppose we knew whatever it is you now think we know suppose we cared nothing for consequences only for getting the maximum use from this new knowledge how soon after your discoveries could we have workable new technology he had to give pesskrag credit she did try to imagine that though it was alien to all her thinking patterns we would have to be completely addled to work in that way she said you do understand as much ttomalss used the affirmative gesture oh yes that is part of the assumption i am asking you to make very well pesskrags eye turrets both turned up toward the ceiling ttomalss had seen that gesture in many males and females who were thinking hard he used it himself in fact after a little while the physicists eyes swung toward him again you understand my estimate is highly provisional now ttomalss had all he could do not to laugh however wild pesskrag was trying to be she remained a typical conservative female of the race he could not hold it against her yes i understand that he said gently i am only looking for an estimate not a statement of fact very well she said always bearing that in mind if i were as wild as a wild big uglyfor that is what you have in mind is it not i might find something useful within oh a hundred fifty years this assumes no disasters in the engineering and no major setbacks i see i thank you ttomalss was willing to bet the tosevites would be faster than that the question was how much faster than that would they be pesskrag was pretending to a wildness she did not have the big uglies did not have a great many things but they had never lacked for wildness shed given ttomalss an upper limit he had to figure out the lower limit for himself she said i thought i would shock you i see i do not no you do not ttomalss agreed your expertise is in physics mine is in matters pertaining to the wild big uglies i admit the field lacks the quantitative rigor yours enjoys even so what i do know of the tosevites persuades me that your answer is believable that is truly frightening pesskrag said i have trouble taking my own estimate seriously and yet it fazes you not at all oh it fazes me but not quite in the way you mean ttomalss said how long had the big uglies been working on this line of experiments before felless noticed they were doing it how much of their research had never got into the published literature for fear of drawing the races noticeor come to that for fear of drawing rival tosevites notice those were all relevant questions he had answers to none of them he found another question for pesskrag if the big uglies do succeed within the timeframe you outline could we quickly match them maybe her voice was troubled if so though we would have to abandon the caution and restraint we have come to take for granted that would produce even more change than i have outlined i know ttomalss said pesskrag said if we are forced to change as rapidly as the big uglies will we become as unstable as they are i doubt it i doubt we could but we would have to become more changeable than we are i think to some degree this has already happened with the colonists on tosev ttomalss answered as far as i am concerned that is not a recommendation pesskrag said i have read of the colonists strange perversions inspired by tosevite drugs i have even read that some of them prefer living among the wild big uglies to staying with their own kind can such things be true they can they are ttomalss said as is often true when examining social phenomena though causation is more complex than it is in the purely physical world i do not care pesskrag said stoutly why would any sensible male or female want to live among alien barbarians anyone who does such a thing cannot possibly be worthwhile in my opinion why some males and females who were good friends beforehand become addicted to ginger together they formed mating bonds like those common among the big uglies ttomalss said pesskrag let out a disgusted hiss ttomalss shrugged like them or not these things have happened on tosev for a long time we reckoned such mated pairs perverts as you say and were glad to see them go as well we should have been pesskrag broke in perhaps we certainly thought so when these pairs first came to our attention ttomalss said but ginger is widespread on tosev and a surprising number of close friends of opposite sexes have become more or less permanent mating partners so many that we saw we were losing valuable males and females to the big uglies by driving all such pairs into exile these days there is a sort of tacit tolerance for them on tosev as long as they do not behave too blatantly in public disgusting pesskrag added an emphatic cough bad enough that the big uglies have revolting habits but they are as they have evolved to be and so i suppose they cannot help it if our own males and females on that planet are no longer fit to associate with decent members of the race though we have a real problem tosev has presented us with nothing but problems ever since the conquest fleet got there ttomalss said and yes i think our society on that world will be different from the way it is elsewhere in the empireunless ginger becomes so widespread here and on our other worlds that we begin to match patterns first seen there i hope with all my liver that this does not happen pesskrag said so do i i am a conservative myself as any sensible male past his middle years should be ttomalss said but you were the one who said we would see change in the relatively near future is it a surprise that some of this change would be social as well as technological i understand technological change i understand how to manage it pesskrag said i am not sure anyone knows how to manage social change why should anyone the race has little experience with it and has not had any to speak of since home was unified do you know who has experience managing social change ttomalss asked pesskrag made the negative gesture but then said the colonists on tosev that is astute but it is not quite what i meant close but not quite the psychologist said as a matter of fact i had in mind the tosevites themselves their whole history over the past thousand of our years has involved managing major social changes they have gone from slaveowning agrarians to possessors of a technical civilization that rivals our own and they have not destroyed themselves in the process too bad the physicist said you may be right if we had stayed away for another few hundred years they might have solved our problem for us ttomalss said then again if we had stayed away for another few hundred years they might have come to home anyway in that case all the problems we have with them now would seem trivial by comparison all the problems we have now yes pesskrag said the problems on the horizon are not small believe me superior sirthey are not please give me a written report in language as nontechnical as you can make it ttomalss said as things are i would rather not put any of this in writing until my colleagues and i are ready to publish the physicist said do you believe others will steal your work i am sure we can discourage that ttomalss said until we know more i am afraid to let this information out at all pesskrag said and ttomalss could not make her change her mind excuse me the lizard who spoke to jonathan yeager in the lobby of the hotel in sitneff was not one he had seen before the male was evidently unfamiliar with his kind too continuing you would be one of the creatures called big uglies would you not yes that is a truth jonathans amusement faded as he got a look at the lizards rather sloppily applied body paint and you would be a police officer would you not yes that is also a truth the lizard had a quiet almost hangdog air he seemed embarrassed to make the affirmative gesture i am inspector second grade garanpo i have a few questions to ask you if you would be so kind questions about what jonathan asked well about the ginger trade superior sir if you really want to know garanpo answered ginger comes from your world does it not yes of course it does jonathan said but i do not know why you need to ask me about it i have been here ever since the american diplomatic party came down to the surface of home we had no ginger with us then and we have none now which of the tosevites would you be meaning no offense but you all look alike to me the inspector said jonathan gave his name garanpo sketched the posture of respect without fully assuming it i thank you i want to know because when there is ginger one naturally thinks of you tosevites why jonathan asked unless i am mistaken there has been ginger on home for many years it must have been brought here by males and females of the race because this is the first tosevite starship to come here perhaps you should be looking closer to home so to speak than you are perhaps we should perhaps we are you are a very clever fellow to make a joke in our language garanpos mouth dropped open in what was obviously a polite laugh but perhaps we should also come to the source you might say why jonathan asked again whatever your latest problem with ginger is why do you think it has anything to do with me with you personally superior sir i never said a thing about that garanpo said i never said it and i do not mean it but i think it does have something to do with you big uglies and that is a truth for the third time inspector what is your evidence oh my evidence i thank you for reminding me the police officer made as if to assume the posture of respect again then checked himself well my evidence is that the price of ginger on the streets lately has fallen right on its snout if you understand what i am saying i understand what you mean yes inspector jonathan answered i do not understand why you think this has anything to do with us big uglies though one of your starships is much more likely to have done the smuggling but we did not have any new ships come in from tosev just before the price of the herb tumbled garanpo said damn jonathan thought but he said you have not had any new tosevite ships come in either why blame the admiral peary our ship has been peacefully orbiting home for some time now there was recently contact between your ship and one of ours this was shortly before the price change in ginger garanpo said no one has found ginger on the horned akiss which is the name of our shipand no one can prove it got from the horned akiss to the surface of home but that is the way things look no one can prove it yet i should say yes i should say that but we are working on it which is also a truth damn jonathan thought again this time he said i think you had better tell my sire the ambassador what you have just told me i think you had better tell him the abridged version of it too do you know superior tosevite my supervisor often says the very same thing to me the lizard replied abridge it garanpo he says and so i do my best but somehow i find myself pining for the details have you ever had that feeling where you are pining to tell all you know because some little part of it may turn out to be the important part and of course you never know which part ahead of time so he went on for some time the feeling jonathan had was guilt at inflicting him on his father however unpleasant that might be though he feared it was necessary garanpo had some circumstantial evidence anyhow your sire you tell me garanpo said as he and jonathan rode up the elevator together now that is interesting very interesting i cannot think of many members of the race who could name their own sires i am sure i cannot are you sure you can he doesnt know hes just insulted me and my mother jonathan reminded himself he made the affirmative gesture and said yes inspector i am sure our mating customs differ from yours well they must garanpo said i do not know much about you big uglies i admit if he was like any human cop jonathan had ever met he was sandbagging like a mad bastard he went on do you really choose your leaders by snoutcounting it does not strike me as a very efficient system we really do it seems to work for us jonathan answered the elevator stopped the door slid open jonathan got out without being told garanpo turned left the direction in which sam yeagers room lay jonathan nodded to himself yes the lizard knew a good deal more than he was letting on after a couple of strides garanpo seemed to realize jonathan wasnt following one of his eye turrets swung back toward the american i do need you to show me the way you know he said testily yes of course inspector jonathan said if garanpo didnt know his fathers room numberand probably his hat size toohe would have been amazed hello son sam yeager said in english after he let jonathan and garanpo in he switched to the language of the race to ask who is your friend jonathan introduced the policemale his father said i greet you inspector i am pleased to meet you and what can i do for you today garanpo did a better job of summing up the ginger situation than jonathan had thought he could he finished and so your uh ambassadorshipthat is a funny word is it not now you know why i think some of the big uglies up in space may have been involved in all this i can see why you think so yes sam yeager replied i can also see that you have nothing resembling proof members of the race out in space might have held ginger to release it at a time when the price was to their liking too you know oh yes that is a truth your ambassadorship garanpo said they might have but they might not have too the timing makes me think they did not and if they did not what do you propose to do about it i am not going to answer a hypothetical question if you have proof tosevites are involved in this business by all means come and see me again jonathans father said i do want to point out though that possession and sale of ginger are not illegal for us among tosevites it is only a spice not a drug is conspiracy illegal garanpo asked and then waved away his own question never mind forget i said that i will do just what you say your ambassadorship and i thank you for your time a pleasure to meet you as well jonathan yeager he sketched the posture of respect to both americansa little more deeply to jonathans fatherand left the room what do you think dad jonathan asked i dont know sam yeager checked the antibugging gadgetry on the table between them then nodded to himself okay inspector garanpo didnt manage to plant anything new in here thats a relief i guess we can talk pretty freely what do i think i think somebody upstairs screwed up i think whoever it is better not screw up again or well have trouble diplomatic immunity wont even start to get us out of what do you think ive got the feeling youre right jonathan said in a troubled voice id be surprised if the admiral peary didnt have ginger along id be amazed if the admiral peary didnt have ginger along his father agreed its not just a weaponits a can opener too it can help us find out all kinds of things we wouldnt know about otherwise it can get us into all kinds of trouble we wouldnt know about otherwise too jonathan said oh you bet it can his father added an emphatic cough even though they were speaking english it can and id say it just has what are we going to do about it jonathan asked sam yeager made a sour face only one thing i can think of to do ive got to have a little hearttoheart with lieutenant general healey all things considered id rather have a drunk tree surgeon yank my appendix without anesthetic jonathan winced he couldnt help himself you dont like lieutenant general healey do you what gave you that impression his father said they grinned at each other sam yeager went on why i think the commander is a swell old boy the capital letters thudded into place he dropped his voice when he muttered brass hat jonathan wasnt sure he was supposed to hear but evidently he was for his father continued healeys the sort of guy who would have cheered his head off when we blew up lizard colonists in cold sleep hes the sort of guy who he broke off by his expression though jonathan had a good notion of what was in his mind his father probably figured healey was the sort of guy who would have locked him up and lost the key after he let the lizards know what the usa had done there were a lot of people like that quite a few of them understandably held high military rank with a sigh sam yeager said well its just got to be done i dont think the race can unscramble our communications our gear was state of the art in and better than anything they had on earth i wonder what weve got now probably walks the message up to the ship and whispers in healeys ear id like to be a fly on the wall when you do talk to him jonathan said nope no flies this has got to be between him and me his father said officially i dont know anything officially i dont even suspect anything im just calling to check thats how its got to be officially the rest is officially off the record there were times jonathan knew when arguing with his father was useless he could tell this was one of those times since his hint hadnt worked he just said okay dad you know what youre doing he hoped his father would let him know how things had gone somewhere later on sam yeager sent him a look of mingled surprise and gratitude he thought i was going to squawk jonathan realized and jonathan might well have squawked if he were the age he had been when his father went into cold sleep but hed done some growing and changing of his own in the seventeen years till they put him on ice he set a hand on his fathers shoulder it really is okay ill just stay tuned for the next exciting episode thats all well find out who done it then right well sure his father answered right before the last commercial break thats how it always works isnt it they both smiled jonathan wished life really were so simple who didnt who wouldnt he went back down to the lobby he more than half expected to find inspector garanpo poking around there looking for signs of ginger but the lizard had left garanpo had a disorganized air that was also disarming jonathan had the feeling a keen brain lurked behind that unimpressive facade with a sigh he went into the refectory he couldnt do anything about whatever garanpo found out he hoped his father could whether anyone up on the admiral peary would pay attention to the american ambassador was an interesting question sam yeager was a civilian these days while the starship was a military vessel would lieutenant general healey remember he was supposed to take orders from civilians if he didnt what could dad do about it frank coffey was sitting in the refectory talking with kassquit jonathan would have liked to hash out some of his worries with the major but he couldnt now what he would have to say wasnt for kassquits ears jonathan hoped coffey did remember not to tell his new lady friend too much then he laughed at himself hed assured karen that that couldnt possibly happen and now he was worrying about it kassquit and frank coffey laughed they had not a care in the worldnot a care in more than one world jonathan envied them more than hed thought he could he had worries sure enough so did coffey as a matter of fact the only difference was he didnt know it yet how stupid had they been up on the admiral peary when sam yeager had a long conversation with lieutenant general healey nobody aboard the admiral peary except the commandant officially knew what they talked about that didnt keep rumors from flying of course if anything it made them fly faster than ever as soon as glen johnson heard a rumor involving healey and ginger he just nodded to himself sure as hell the scooter hadnt performed the way it should have when he took it over to the horned akiss sure as hell it had seemed as if the little rocketship was heavier than usual it had been heavier than usual somebody must have figured out a way to pack it full of ginger while fooling the races sensorsor maybe the lizards using those sensors had been well paid not to notice anything out of the ordinary such arrangements were common enough on earth no doubt they could be cooked up here too johnson felt like kicking himself because he hadnt figured out what was going on before he delivered the scooter he didnt like thinking of himself as a chump or a jerk what choice did he have though not much he wasnt the only one on the starship to work out what had probably happened either when he came up to the control room to take a shift less than a day after yeager and healey talked mickey flynn greeted him with and how is everyones favorite drug smuggler this morning i havent the faintest idea johnson answered you cant mean me i cant why not because that would violate regulations and id get a spanking if i violated them this has of course been your abiding concern since time out of mind why certainly johnson said would i be here if it werent the mind reels at the possibilities flynn replied even if you were smuggling drugs to the race though why would you worry about it that was a good question in truth johnson didnt much care how the lizards amused themselves in their spare time he wouldnt have minded sending them ginger if it had been his idea his voice roughened as he answered ill be damned if i want that shithead in charge of us making me do his dirty work for him im shockedshocked i tell you anyone who didnt know better would think youd conceived a dislike for the man what johnson said to that had something to do with conceiving but not much his opinion of lieutenant general healey was certainly less than immaculate it seemed like fate thenand not a very benign sort of fate eitherthat the commandant of the admiral peary summoned johnson to his office as the pilot came off his shift mickey flynn said there you see he was listening all along i dont care he already knows what i think of him johnson answered which was true enough but however little he wanted to he did have to find out why lieutenant general healey wanted to see him healey greeted him with the usual unfriendly glare but he said nothing about what johnson had said in the control room instead fixing him with a glare the commandant barked are you ready to fly the lizards scooter back to the horned akiss weve learned everything were likely to from it that depends sir johnson answered healeys bulldog glower only got angrier depends on what he demanded hard suspicion in his voice on whether youve loaded it up with ginger the way you did with ours if you have you can find yourself another sucker on account of the lizards are going to land on whoever tries to pull the same stunt twice like a ton of bricks youre the best scooter pilot weve got its almost the only thing youre good for i can order you to fly that scooter the commandant said yes sir you sure can johnson agreed cheerfully and you can fling me in the brig for disobeying orders too because i wont take it out of the air lock till you tell me the truth about it i always knew you and that lizardloving yeager were two of a kind the commandant snarled that answered johnsons question without directly answering it why dont you send stone sir he asked in turn hes always happy to do anything you say he is the senior pilot healey said stiffly you mean you cant afford to lose him but you can afford to lose me johnson said well sir ive got news for you i cant afford to lose me so when you send that scooter over find yourself another boy to ride herd on it the commandant glowered at him healey had come to expect insubordination from him over the years outright insurrection was something else again consider yourself under arrest colonel healey said report to the brig at once happy to sir johnson answered only one question where the hell is it i havent gone looking for it till now i didnt even think we had one we do and you have so healey said its on b deck room enjoy yourself sir i wont be talking to you so i expect itll be a pleasure johnson also had the pleasure of leaving before the commandant could reply he headed straight for the brig it proved to be a compartment like any other on the starship the only difference was it had a door that wouldnt open from the inside once he closed it after himself that could be no fun at all in case of emergency but johnson refused to dwell on unpleasant possibilities he strapped himself onto the standardissue bunk and took a nap nobody bothered him he began to wonder if healeyd told anyone he was jugged then he wondered if anybody would come by and feed him he had visions of someone finding a starved shriveled corpse in the brig the next time healey decided to throw someone in there which could be years from now he told himself he was being silly stone and flynn would notice he wasnt showing up for his shift theyd ask where he was wouldnt they healey would have to tell them wouldnt he it all seemed logical enough but when logic and lieutenant general healey collided all bets were off three hours later the door to the cell opened it was major parker healeys adjutant johnson looked at him and said i want a lawyer funny colonel funny like a crutch parker answered what you think im kidding johnson said my ass pardon my french and where are you going to find a lawyer here the other officer asked in what he evidently intended for reasonable tones he looked dyspeptic anyone who had to listen to healey all the time had a good reason for looking dyspeptic as far as johnson was concerned he said okay fine screw the lawyer let me talk to ambassador yeager that ought to do the job by god that ought to do it up brown parker looked as if hed asked for the moon the commandant sent me here to let you out as long as you give me your word of honor youll keep your mouth shut sorry johnson shook his head no deal hes the one who got into this mess and got me into it with him he ought to be making me promises not asking for them id just as soon stay here how long before the whole ship starts wondering why how long before the lizards start wondering why too colonel you are deliberately being difficult the adjutant said his voice starchy with disapproval you noticed johnson exclaimed parker turned red johnson nodded you bet your left nut im being difficult major healey still thinks this is my problem and hes dead wrong its his and hed better figure that out pretty damn quick ill be back parker made it sound like a threat the commandant wont be very happy with you well im not very happy with him either johnson said but he didnt think the other officer heard him another two hours went by they were not the most exciting time glen johnson had ever spent he wondered if healey knew how potent a weapon boredom could be leave him in here long enough and hed start counting the rows of thread in his socks for want of anything more interesting to do maybe he should have agreed when parker offered him the deal no goddammit he thought healey had played him for a patsy he wouldnt be the commandants good little boy now the door opened again there floated parker his face as screwed up as if hed bitten into a persimmon before it was ripe he jerked a thumb toward the corridor behind him go on he said get out johnson didnt move whats the hitch he asked no hitch parker said your arrest is rescinded officially it never happened youre restored to regular duty effective immediately what more do you want egg in your beer an apology might be nice johnson said if he was going to be difficult why not be as difficult as he could healeys adjutant laughed in his face youll wait till hell freezes over and then twenty minutes longer do you want to he made as if to close the door once more no never mind johnson said he hadnt actually demanded one only suggested it he didnt have to back down or not very far he pushed off from the far wall of the brig and glided out into the corridor ah freedom funny parker said hardeharhar you bust me up you think i was kidding johnson said well you probably would whats that supposed to mean the other man said im just as much an american as you are i know what freedoms worth you sure dont act like it johnson said and your boss wouldnt know what it was if it piddled on his shoes the twoword answer healeys adjutant gave was to the point if less than sweet johnson laughed and blew him a kiss that only seemed to make parker angrier johnson wasnt about to lose any sleep on account of it he pushed off again and returned to the land of the free and he hoped the home of the brave he brachiated to the refectory walter stone was there eating a sandwich and drinking water out of a bulb the senior pilot waved to johnson who glided over to him and grabbed a handhold i hear youve been naughty again stone said not me johnson shook his head its our beloved skipper he told me to smuggle more ginger to the lizards and im afraid i turned him down fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me you havent got the right attitude stone said sorry but im afraid i do johnson said healey wants me to give the lizards ginger okay fine he doesnt care if they catch me and toss me in one of their clinks for the next thirty years thats not fine not by me not when the race knows what were up to and the lizards do know you cant tell me any different stone looked as if he would have liked nothing better he didnt though and if he couldnt johnson thought nobody could kassquit was happy she needed a while to recognize the feeling she hadnt known it for a whilea long while shed known satisfaction of a sort most commonly at a job well done sometimes that masqueraded as happiness now that shed run into the genuine article again she recognized the masquerade for what it was she knew sexual satisfaction was part of her happiness so shed told ttomalssand shed taken a different kind of satisfaction at discomfiting him but the longer the feeling lasted the more she noticed other things that went into it chief among them was being valued for her own sake that was something shed seldom known among the race by the nature of things it wasnt something she could easily know in the empire to ttomalss and to the other males and females who dealt with her she was about as much experimental animal as she was person she couldnt be a proper female of the race and she couldnt be a normal big ugly either but frank coffey made her feel as if she were he talked with her members of the race had talked to her looking back she thought even jonathan yeager had talked to her now she discovered the difference but to frank coffey what she said mattered at least as much as what he said and that held true whether they were talking about something as serious as the relations between the empire and the united states or as foolish as why her hair was straight while his curled tightly there are black tosevites in the united states whose hair is straight he said one day are there she said and he made the affirmative gesture and are there also tosevites of my type with hair like yours this time he used the negative gesture no or i have never heard of any the black tosevites i mentioned artificially straighten theirs why would they want to do such a foolish thing kassquit asked to look more like the white tosevites who dominate in the united states coffey sounded a littleor maybe more than a littlegrim oh kassquit felt a sudden and altogether unexpected stab of sympathy for wild big uglies shed never seen by the spirits of emperors past i understand that i used to shave all the hair on my body to try to look more like a female of the race i used to be sorry i had these flaps of skinears instead of hearing diaphragms too i even thought of having them surgically removed i am glad you did not he said and leaned over to nibble on one of them kassquit liked that more than shed thought she would after a moment frank coffey went on you know more than i do about being a minority that is something surprising for a black american tosevite to have to admit but i was never a minority of one never till now kassquit pointed out well no he said for once though i feel more isolated simply because i am a tosevite than because i am a black tosevite that i admit is an unusual feeling you are not black kassquit said you are an interesting shade of browna good deal darker than i am certainly but a long way from black his skin tone showed up to fine advantage against the smooth white plastic of the furniture in the refectory sometimes my shade of brown has proved more interesting than i wished it would he said laughing this time kassquit heard no bitterness in his voice he added you and i are part of the default setting for tosevites after all the default setting kassquit wondered if shed heard correctly and also if coffey had used the races language correctly he made the affirmative gesture he meant what hed said whether it was correct or not then he explained most tosevites have dark brown eyes and black hair skin color can vary from a dark pinkishbeige like tom de la rosa through tosevites like you to those a little darker than i am but the hair and eyes stay the same the default setting you see only in the northwestern part of the main continental mass did tosevites with very pale skins light eyes and yellow or reddish hair evolve they have colonized widelythey were the ones who developed technological civilization on our planetbut they hatched in a limited area the default setting kassquit said it again thoughtfully this time this makes me one of the majority as far as tosevites are concerned it certainly does coffey made the affirmative gesture you were hatched in china i believe and there are more chinese than any other kind of tosevite i have heard this before kassquit said when i was all alone among the race it did not seem to matter much now that i am not alone any longer it means more now that i am not alone any longer those words meant more than shed ever dreamt they could maybe that was the secret of her new happiness no not maybewithout a doubt except for the brief bright segment of her life when jonathan yeager came board her starship she hadnt kept company with other big uglies throughout her life she didnt realize how much she missed that company till she had it again being among her own biological kind simply felt right maybe that was because wild big uglies understood her in ways the race couldnt for all she knew it was just because tosevites smelled subconsciously right to her pheromones didnt play as obvious a role with tosevites as they did with the race but that didnt mean they werent there whatever the reason she liked it quietly frank coffey said when i set what i have gone through in my lifetime against what you have suffered i am embarrassed that i have ever complained next to you i am nothing but a beginner most of it has not been so bad kassquit said when you are in a situation that never changes you do your best to get used to it whatever it is only when you have something to compare it against do you begin to see it might not have been everything you wished it would be truthnot a small truth either coffey said that is probably why so many dark brown tosevites accepted secondclass status in the united states for so long he smiled you see i said dark brown but they did not see anything else was possible and so they complained less than they might have when pale tosevites attitudes about us began to change we took as much advantage of it as quickly as we could and as you have said yourself you proved you deserve to be included in your tosevite society by isolating yourself here on home kassquit said he shrugged some things are worth the price from what i have heard in the signals sent out from tosev relations between dark and pale tosevites in the united states are smoother now than they were when i went into cold sleep do you think you are responsible for that kassquit asked maybe a littlea very little coffey answered i would like to think that i have made a difference in my notempire even if the difference is only a small one he pointed to her you now you have made a difference in the empire oh yes a great difference kassquit wished she werent being ironic but she was the race has had to figure out what to do with one big ugly who does not know what to do with herself considering how you were raised you have done very well the american tosevite added an emphatic cough i thank you kassquit said i tell myself this i have told myself this a great many times i wish i could persuade myself it is a truth well it is if my opinion is worth anything coffey said you are highly educated and highly capable i am highly abnormal in a great many ways kassquit tacked on an emphatic cough of her own i know this you will not offend me by agreeing with it truth is truth with me as with anyone else have you ever wondered what you would have been like if ttomalss had not got you from your mother coffey asked only ten thousand times she exclaimed i could have been an average big ugly part of her a large part irresistibly yearned for that just to be someone like everyone else around her what would that be like it seemed wonderful at least to one who had never known the feeling you could have been an average female chinese big ugly not long after the conquest fleet came frank coffey said this is a less delightful prospect than you may believe you would have had only about a fifty percent chance of living past the age of fivetosevite years of course you probably would not have learned to read let alone anything more you would have worked hard all your life and likely would have been mated to a male who did as he pleased but would not give you the same privilege sex differences in social roles are much larger among us than they are in the race he spoke truthskassquit knew as much even so she said i would have been myself the self i was meant to be here now the way i am what am i nothing i cannot even speak a tosevite language no matter what language you speak you make yourself understood coffey said not only that but you have something worth saying what else matters i thank you again kassquit said whenever we speak you make me feel good this is a pleasure worth setting alongside the pleasure you give me when we lie together the wild big ugly mimed the beginnings of the posture of respect just the way a member of the race might have done i thank you he said it is mutual you know as such things should be it is not just that you do not dislike me or look down on me because i have dark skin i do not think the other americans here do that but it has never occurred to you that disliking or looking down on me because of my skin is even a possibility that is not and cannot be true of them not with society in the united states being as it was when we all went into cold sleep do you suppose it can be true of society in your notempire as it is now kassquit asked i do not think so coffey answered more change still will have come i suppose by the time i get back to tosev maybe then and maybe not too kassquit didnt want to think about his leaving she remembered how unhappy shed been after jonathan yeager went back down to the surface of tosev she was happier now than she had been with him would she be unhappier without frank coffey in proportion to the degree she was happier with him probably that seemed logical even if logic didnt always play a large role in emotional dealings i am happy now by the spirits of emperors past i will enjoy being happy now i will savor it and if i am unhappy later i suppose i will end up savoring that too as if reading her thoughts coffey said i am not going anywhere for a while good kassquit said and used one more emphatic cough by now a fair number of shopkeepers in sitneff were used to having big uglies drop in on them karen yeager ignored her husbands teasing about having no clothes to shop for here she knew jonathan wouldnt have minded watching her or any other reasonably goodlooking woman who wore body paint and nothing else because she couldnt shop for clothes like any good teasing jonathans held a grain of truth she had to improvise bookstores fascinated her as they fascinated her fatherinlaw very often one of her guards would pull out a transaction card and buy something for her sooner or later his superiors would pay him back since none of the guards grumbled about how much money karen cost she guessed the repayment arrangements were more efficient than they would have been in the usa the races printed lines ran from top to bottom of the page and from right to left across it lizards opened books at what would have been the back by american standards and worked their way forward other than that their volumes were surprisingly similar to the ones humans used they stored a lot of data electronically but they hadnt abandoned words on paper why should we a bookstore clerk responded when she remarked on that books are convenient they are cheap they require no electronic support why make things more complicated than necessary back on earth the answer would have been because we can sometimes the race was wise enough not to do what it had the technical ability to do not so many humans had that kind of wisdom one of her guards said if a beffel chews up a book that is an annoyance if a beffel chews up an electronic reader that is a larger annoyance and a larger expense befflem are nuisances another guard said i often wonder why we put up with them they run wild and get into everything he swung his eye turrets toward karen then looked away again a moment later she knew what that meant lizards often compared humans to befflem she didnt think of it as an insult though the race often meant it that way she liked the small feisty creatures the lizards kept as pets she would have liked them even better if they hadnt gone feral and made nuisances of themselves over such a broad part of earth are you finished here superior tosevite the first guard asked her she made the affirmative gesture i am she said since we have been speaking of befflem would you be kind enough to take me to a pet store it shall be done superior tosevite did the guard sound amused or resigned karen couldnt quite tell she would have bet on the latter though she didnt care she enjoyed the races pet shops at least as much as bookstores the bookstores did smell better pet shops on earth were often full of earthy odors pet shops on home were full of unearthly odors sharper and more ammoniacal than their equivalents back in the usa karen didnt mind all that much the odors werent dreadful and after a few minutes she always got used to them befflem in cages scurried around and squabbled with one another and beeped at anyone who went by and stuck out their tongues to help odors reach their scent receptors they also beeped at the larger more dignified tsiongyu the races other favorite pets the tsiongyu usually ignored the befflem every once in a while though they lost their air of lordly disdain and tried to hurl themselves through the wire mesh of their cages at the lowslung scaly beasts that annoyed them when they did the befflem only got more annoying a beffels chief purpose in life often seemed to be getting someone or something angry at it karen fascinated the befflem just as the odors in the pet store were alien to her her smell was nothing theyd ever met before they crowded to the front of their cages their tongues flicked in and out in and out tasting the strange odors of earth their beeps took on a plaintive note the befflem might almost have been asking what are you what are you doing here the tsiongyu by contrast pretended karen wasnt there they were longlegged elegant and snooty too smart for their own good was how she thought of them they ignored the members of the race in the pet shop too they could be affectionate once they got to know somebody with strangers though it was as if they were society matrons who hadnt been introduced there were also cages with evening sevod and other flying creatures in them they stared at karen out of turreted eyes it wasnt evening so the sevod werent singing the other flying animals squawked and hissed and buzzed karen wouldnt have wanted anything that made noises like that in her house by the prices on the cages the lizards didnt mind the racket at all farther back in the store were aquariums filled with homes equivalent of fish they looked much less different from fish on earth than land creatures here did from land creatures on karens home planet water imposed more design constraints on evolution than air did but the turreted swiveling eyes went back a long long way in the history of life on home for the fishy things used them too one silver variety swam along just below the surface of the water it had unusually long eye turrets they stuck up into the air as if they were twin periscopes on a submarine a guard said when the shooter sees a ffissach or some other prey on a leaf over its stream it spits water at it knocks it down and eats it truth karen said the male made the affirmative gesture karen came closer and looked at the little watery creatures with new interesttill one of them literally spat in her eye she jumped back in a hurry dabbing at her face with the sleeve of her tshirt the guards all laughed they thought that was the funniest thing theyd ever seen once karen had dried off she did too you see superior tosevite said the guard whod told her about shooters i do see karen said but why did the shooter spit water at me i was not sitting on a leaf the guards thought that was pretty funny too as they left the pet shop the manager called would you not like a beffel of your own superior tosevite life with a beffel is never dull karen believed that she didnt rise to the sales pitch though out on the sidewalk a lizard came up to her and said excuse me but are you not one of the creatures called big uglies yes that is what i am karen agreed most of the time members of the race used the name without even thinking it might be insulting she wondered how often whites had said nigger the same way around frank coffey then suddenly she had other things to worry about the lizard opened his mouth wide and bit her in the arm she screamed she pounded the lizard on the snout she kicked him she grabbed his arm when he tried to claw her too after a heartbeat of stunned surprise the guards jumped on the lizard and pulled him off her big uglies killed both my best friends on tosev he shouted i want revenge i have to have revenge you are as addled as an unhatched egg abandoned in the sun a guard said karen paid next to no attention lizards teeth were sharp and pointed she bled from at least a dozen punctures and tears on earth improvising a bandage would have been easy for cloth was everywhere not so here she pulled her tshirt off over her head and wrapped it around her arm seeing her in a bra and shorts wouldnt scandalize the lizards they thought she was peculiar any which way two guards dragged off the lizard whod bitten her the third one bent into the posture of respect saying i apologize superior tosevite from the depths of my liver i apologize that male must be deranged karens arm hurt too much for her to care about the lizards psychiatric condition through clenched teeth she said take me back to the hotel i want to have our physician look at these wounds and clean them it shall be done superior tosevite the guard said and done it was back at the hotel both lizards and humans exclaimed when they saw her with a bloody shirt wrapped around her arm they exclaimed again when she told them how shed got hurt please get out of the way she said several times i need to see dr blanchard well this is a lovely mess the physician said when she got a good look at karens injuries she cleaned them which hurt then she disinfected them which hurt worse a couple of those are going to need stitches im afraid will they get infected karen asked good question dr blanchard said she didnt answer right away reaching for the novocaine instead that hurt going in but numbed things afterwards before she started suturing though she went on we havent seen much in the way of germs here on home that bother us but ill tell you i wish you hadnt picked this particular way to try the experiment so do i karen said feelingly the lizard must have been storing up resentment since the days of the conquest fleetwell since the days when word from the conquest fleet got back from home and the first big ugly he saw he just went chomp good thing he didnt have a gun probably a very good thing melanie blanchard agreed um you may not want to watch this youre right i may not looking was making karen woozy do you think a tetanus shot would help i doubt it they wont have tetanus here theyll have something else instead the doctor answered which made an unfortunate amount of sense i will give you a bunch of our antibiotics though i hope theyll do some good but i cant promise you anything why not give me some of the ones the lizards use too karen asked i would except i think theyre more likely to poison you than help you dr blanchard answered i dont know of any that have been tested on us i dont think anyone ever saw the need before oh joy karen said if i start breaking out in green and purple blotches if you do all bets are off melanie blanchard said but i dont want to try anything like that before i have to because it is dangerous for you i think id better consult with some of the races doctors to find out which drugs i ought to use just in case i didnt come here intending to be a guinea pig karen said people hardly ever do intend to become guinea pigs dr blanchard observed sometimes it happens anyway what do you think the chances are karen asked dr blanchard sent her a severe look guinea pigs dont get to ask questions like that they find out oh joy karen thought again when jonathan yeager went into cold sleep he never thought he would have to worry about whether his wife came down with a wound infection hed imagined a nuclear confrontation between the admiral peary and the forces of the race but never an angry lizard with a longfestering grudge and a nasty set of teeth he wished he hadnt thought of the grudge in those termsnot that he could do anything about it now how are you he asked karen every morning for a week sore nauseated too she would answershe was taking a lot of antibiotics at the end of the week jonathans heart began coming down from his throat his wife seemed to be healing well dr blanchard took out the stitches she gave a cautious thumbsup saying with luck no more excitement id vote for that karen said excitement isnt why i came here and good old dull looks nice right now youve got apologies from everybody but the emperor himself jonathan said his wife shrugged id rather not have got bitten in the first place if its all the same to you well yes i can see that jonathan said im glad you seem to be healing all right youre glad karen exclaimed what about me i was joking with the doctor about breaking out in green and purple blotchesand i was hoping i was joking if you know what i mean our germs dont seem to bother the lizards so its only fair the ones on home should leave us alone jonathan said thats what melanie told me thats nice and logical his wife replied when its your arm though logic kind of goes out the window the crazy lizard could have raised an even bigger scandal jonathan said how by biting your father karen said that would have done it all right hes the ambassador after all not just an ambassadors flunky like yours truly well im just an ambassadors flunky too jonathan said a little uneasily comparisons with his father made him nervous he was good enough to get here his father was good enough to head up the american embassy not a lot of difference but enough he shook his head that wasnt what he wanted to think about right now he went on i had something else in mind what if the crazy lizard had bitten kassquit kassquit karen thought about it then started to giggle yes that would have been a hoot wouldnt it poor lizard is angry at the big uglies because his friends got killed during the fighting and then he would have hauled off and bitten the only big ugly who wishes she were a lizard and has the citizenship to prove it that would have been better than man bites dog the lizards story was pathetic if you looked at it from his point of view here hed nursed his grief and his grudge all these yearsit would have been close to eighty of the earthly variety since he got the bad newsand what had he got for it one snapat a human who hadnt been more than a baby when the fighting stopped oh yes hed got one more thing hed got all the trouble the race could give him theyd lock him up and eat the key which was what they did instead of throwing it away jonathan didnt worry about going into sitneff even after his wifes unfortunate incident his guards asked him about it once he said any male of the race who bites me will probably come down with acute indigestion and in my opinion he will deserve it too that startled the guards into laughing one of them said superior tosevite do you taste as bad as that actually i do not know jonathan answered i have never tried to make a meal of myself the guards laughed again they didnt try to restrict his movements and keeping them from doing that was what hed had in mind like karen he prowled bookstores he read the races language even better than he spoke it words on a page just sat there they could be pinned down and analyzed in the spoken language they were there and gone since word of the conquest fleets arrival on tosev got back to home the lizards had spent a good deal of time and ingenuity writing about humans their customs and the planet on which they dwelt much of that writing was so bad it was almost funny jonathan didnt care he bought lots of those books no matter how bad they were they said a lot about what the lizard in the street thought of big uglies the short answer seemed to be not much according to the races writers humans were addicted to killing one another often for the most flimsy of reasons photographs from the reich and the soviet union illustrated the point they were also sexually depraved photographs illustrated that point too photographs that wouldnt have been printable back on earth here the pictures were likelier to rouse laughter than lust and humans were the ones who grew ginger ginger had spawned a literature of its own most of that literature seemed intended to convince the lizards of home that it was dreadful stuff a drug no selfrespecting member of the race should ever try some of it put jonathan in mind of reefer madness and other propaganda films from before the days he was bornhis father would talk about them every now and again but there were exceptions one life one mate was by the defiant female half of a permanently mated lizard pair permanently mated thanks to ginger and what it did to female pheromones the pair was for all practical purposes married except the idea hadnt occurred to the lizards till they got to tosev the female described all the advantages of the state and how it was superior to the ordinary friendships males and females formed she was talking about lovebut again that was something the lizards hadnt known about till they bumped into humanity she went on almost endlessly about how the mixture of friendship and sexual pleasure produced a happiness unlike any shed known at home the ginger might have had something to do with that too but she didnt mention it rhetorically she asked why such an obvious good should be reserved for big uglies alone she complained about the races intolerance toward couples that had chosen to create such permanent bonds with ginger the biographical summary at the back of the book it would have been the front in one in english said she and her mate were living in phoenix arizona jonathan knew not all permanently mated pairs were expelled from the races territory these days the author and her partner though had done as so many others had before them and found happiness as immigrants in the usa jonathans guards had a low opinion of one life one mate bad enough to be a pervert one of them said worse to brag about it meaning no offense superior tosevite another added this kind of mating behavior is natural for you we of the race thought it was peculiar at first but now we see that is an inescapable part of what you are but our way is as natural for us as yours is for you would any tosevites want to imitate our practices hordes of lustcrazed women not caring who joined with them panting and eager for the first man who came along dryly jonathan said some of our males might not mind so very much well it would be unnatural for them the second guard insisted and your way is unnatural for us next thing you know this addled female will want each pair to take care of its own eggs and hatchlings too his mouth fell open and his jaw waggled back and forth in derisive laughter that is how we do things jonathan said yes but your hatchlings are weak and helpless when they are newly out of the egg the guard said proving hed done somebut not quite allof his homework about big uglies ours need much less care truth the first guard said was it the truth the race took it as gospel but jonathan wasnt so sure his folksand then he and karenhad raised mickey and donald as much as if they were human beings as possible the little lizards had learned to talk and to act in a fairly civilized way much faster than hatchlings seemed to do among the race maybe giving them lots of attention had its advantages and maybe you dont know what the devil youre talking about jonathan thought mickey and donald were no more normal lizards than kassquit was a normal human with her example before them the americans had gone ahead anyway jonathan had been proud of that when the project first began he wasnt so proud of it any more his family had done its best but it couldnt possibly have produced anything but a couple of warped lizards he had more sympathy for ttomalss than hed ever dreamt he would that was something he intended never to tell kassquit i have a question for you superior tosevite the second guard said ginger is common and cheap on your world suppose all the males and females of the race there fall into these perverted ways how will we deal with them how can we hope to deal with them when they have such disgusting habits the question was real and important it had occurred to humans and to other members of the race the answer as far as jonathan knew nobody had one yet he tried his best i do not believe all members of the race on tosev will change their habits more of them use ginger there than here yes but not everyone there doesfar from it and those who keep to their old habits on tosev have learned to be more patient and respectful toward those who have changed their ways perhaps members of the race here should learn to do the same sometimes different is only different not better or worse all three of his guards made the negative gesture the one who had not spoken till now asked how do you tosevites treat the perverts among you i am sure you have some every species we know has some yes we do jonathan agreed how do we treat them better than we used to i will say that we are more tolerant than we were perhaps you will find that the same thing happens to you as time goes by perhaps we will but i doubt it that third guard said what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong how can we possibly put up with what anyone sensible can tell is wrong with a single swing of the eye turret his companions made the affirmative gesture your difficulty is the races society has not changed much for a very long time jonathan said when anything different does come to your notice you want to reject it without even thinking about it and why should we not by the spirits of emperors past we know what is right and proper the guard declared again his comrades plainly agreed with him jonathan could have gone on arguing but he didnt see the point he wasnt going to change their minds they were sure they already had the answershad them and liked them hed never thought of the lizards as victorian but he did now the race didnt arrest walter stone after he returned their scooter to them glen johnson assumed that meant whatever ginger had been aboard was removed before they got it back stone said what would you do if i told you they didnt even search the scooter what would i do johnson echoed well the first thing id do is id call you a liar stone looked at him are you calling me a liar his voice held a distinct whiff of fists behind the barn if not of dueling pistols at dawn johnson didnt care that depends he answered are you telling me the lizards didnt search the scooter if you are youre damn straight im calling you a liar they arent stupid they know where ginger comes from and they know damn well the easter bunny doesnt bring it youre the one who brought it the last time stone observed yeah and you can thank our beloved commandant for that too johnson said ive already thanked him in person i have i have he played me for a sucker once and he wanted to do it again do you think the lizards would have given me thirty years or would they have just chucked me out the air lock they didnt find any ginger on the scooter stone said tacitly admitting they had looked after all they didnt find it when you took it over johnson said suppose there hadnt been that delay before you flew it suppose id taken it when healey told me to what would they have found then i expect the same nothing they found when i got to their ship stone sounded unperturbed but then he usually did hed been a test pilot before he started flying in space it wasnt that nothing fazed him only that he wouldnt admit it if something did being a marine johnson had a dose of the same symptoms himself that inhuman calm was a little more than he could take right now though my ass he said and it would have been my ass if id taken the scooter over to the horned akiss youve got a lot of damn nerve pretending anything different too if you already know all the answers why do you bother asking the questions stone pushed off and glided out of the control room resisting the impulse to propel the senior pilot with a good swift kick johnson stayed where he was home spun through the sky above or possibly below him he went around the world every hour and a half more or less what would things have been like for the lizards in the days when they were exploring home seas here didnt all connect there was no worldgirdling ocean the way there was on earth the first lizard to circumnavigate his globe had done it on foot how long had it taken him what dangers had he faced the race could probably answer all those questions as fast as he could ask them it didnt matter that woolly mammoths and cave bears had seemed at least as likely as people to inherit the earth when the first lizard went all the way around home the data would still be there johnson was as sure of that as he was of his own name the race had more packrat genes in it than humanity did but johnson didnt call the horned akiss or one of the races other orbiting spacecraft to try to find out he didnt want chapter and verse he wanted his own imagination what would that lizard have thought when he got halfway around the animals and plants would have been strange so would the lizards he was meeting they would have spoken different languages and had odd customs none of that was left here any more not even a trace home was a much more homogenized place than earth lizards everywhere spoke the same language even local accents had just about disappeared from everything johnson could tell all lizard cities except maybe the capitalwhich was also a shrine and so a special caselooked pretty much alike you could drop a female from one into another on the far side of home and shed have no trouble getting along is that where were going johnson wondered even nowadays someone from los angeles wouldnt have much trouble coping in say dallas or atlanta but boston and san francisco and new york city and new orleans were still very much their own places and paris and jerusalem and shanghai were whole separate worlds thinking of separate worlds made johnson shake his head you could take that imaginary female of the race and drop her into a town on rabotev or halless and she still wouldnt miss a beat oh shed know she wasnt on home any more thered be rabotevs or hallessi on the streets but shed still fit in theyd all speak the same language theyd all reverence the spirits of emperors past she wouldnt feel herself a stranger the way a woman from los angeles would in bombay and the lizards didnt seem to think theyd lost anything to them the advantages of uniformity outweighed the drawbacks he shrugged maybe they were right theyd certainly made their society work people had been banging one another over the head long before the race arrived with no signs of a letup any time soon if the race had stayed away they might have blown themselves to hell and gone by now if the lizards had come to earth now in the twentyfirst century humans probably would have beaten the snot out of them if theyd come any earlier than they did they would have wiped the floor with people only in a narrow range of a few years would any sort of compromise solution have been possible and yet that was what had happened it was pretty strange when you got right down to it fiction has to be plausible reality just has to happen glen johnson couldnt remember whod said that but it held a lot of truth most of home was spread out before him as usual there was less cloud cover here than on earth deserts and mountains and meadows and seas were all plainly visible as if displayed on a map johnson wondered what effect homes geography had had on the races cartography back on earth people had developed map projections to help them navigate across uncharted seas hardly any seas here were wide enough to be uncharted he shrugged that was one more thing the lizards could probably tell him about in great detail but he didnt want to know in great detail sometimes like a cigar idle curiosity was only idle curiosity counting cold sleep he hadnt smoked a cigar in close to seventy years every now and then the longing for tobacco still came back he knew the stuff was poisonous everybody knew that these days people still smoked even so he laughed not that it was funny might as well be ginger he muttered except you cant have such a good time with it all things considered the indians had a lot to answer for the europeans had come to the new world and given them measles and smallpox and it didnt look as if america had sent syphilis back across the atlantic in return but tobacco was the indians revenge it had probably killed more people than european diseases in the americas the insidious thing about tobacco was that it killed slowly back in the days before doctors knew what they were doing you were likely to die of something else before it got you that meant people got the idea it was harmless and the smoking habitthe smoking addictionspread like a weed but with diseases like typhoid and smallpox and tb knocked back on their heels more and more people lived long enough for lung cancer and emphysema and smokingcaused heart attacks to do them in and kicking the tobacco habit was no easier than it had ever been once the stuff got its hooks in you hooked you were some people said quitting heroin was easier than quitting tobacco johnson hadnt had any choice he was healthier than he would have been if hed kept on lighting up he knew that he missed cigars and cigarettes even so hed never smoked a pipe he managed to miss those too then something else occurred to him humanity and the race were both liable to be lucky while european diseases had devastated the natives of the americas lizards and people hadnt made each other sick theyd shot one another blown one another up and blasted one another with nuclear weapons but germ warfare didnt seem to work out thank god for small favors he thought mickey flynn came up the access tube and into the control room a penny for your thoughts he said i know im overspending but such is life thank you so much im always glad to be around people who respect my abilities johnson said as soon as i find them you may rest assured ill respect them flynn replied noware you going to earn your stipend or not i hate to risk bankrupting you but ill try johnson said with flynn you had to fight dryer with dryer johnson expanded on his musings about tobacco and disease when he finished he asked how did i do the other pilot gravely considered well i have to admit thats probably worth a penny he said at last who would have believed it he reached into the pocket of his shorts and actually produced a little bronze cointhe first real money johnson had seen aboard the admiral peary here dont spend it all in the same place flynn flipped the penny to johnson i do hope this wont break you johnson said sticking it in his own pocket why on earth did you bring it along anyhow how did they let you get away with it i stuck it under my tongue when i went into cold sleep so i could pay charon the ferrymans fee in case i had to cross the styx instead of this other trip we were making flynn answered deadpan yeah sure now tell me another one johnson said all right i won it off the commandant in a poker game flynn sounded as serious with that as he had with the other my left one johnson said sweetly healeyd give you an iou and it wouldnt be worth the paper it was written on dont you trust our esteemed leader flynn asked johnson trusted lieutenant general healey all right that it was trust of a negative sort had nothing to do with anythingso he told himself anyhow he said when i have the chance ill buy you a drink with this as far as he knew there was no unofficial alcohol aboard the admiral peary he wouldnt have turned down a drink any more than he would have turned down a cigar flynn said while youre at it you can buy me a new car too sure why not johnson said grandly what could be more useless to a man who had to stay weightless the rest of his days a likely story whats your promise worth flynn said its worth its weight in gold johnson answered and now im supposed to think you a wit flynn looked down his rather tuberous nose at johnson ill think you half a wit if you like you filched that from the devils dictionary deny it if you can i didnt know it was against the rules johnson said theres an old whine in a new bottle flynn said loftily ouch johnson winced he was a straightforward man puns didnt come naturally to him when he went up against mickey flynn that sometimes left him feeling like a onelegged man in an asskicking contest all of a sudden he laughed the lizards probably felt that way about the whole human race when pesskrag called ttomalss the female physicist was more agitated than he had ever seen her do you know what this means she demanded do you have the faintest idea no i am not a physicist ttomalss said perhaps you will calm yourself and tell me i hope so at any rate very well it shall be done it shall be attempted anyhow in the monitor pesskrag visibly tried to pull herself together she took a deep breath and then said this has taken the egg of the physics we have known since before home was unified dropped it on a rock and seen something altogether new and strange hatch out of it each experiment is more startling than the last sometimes my colleagues and i have trouble believing what the data show us but then we repeat the experiments and the results remain the same astonishing she used an emphatic cough fascinating ttomalss wondered if he was lying can you tell someone who is not a physicist what this means to him before we understoodor thought we understoodthe nature of matter and energy we threw rocks and shot arrows at one another afterwards we learned to fly between the stars the changes coming here will be no less profound you suggested such things before ttomalss said slowly i take it that what you suggested then now seems more likely morning twilight suggests the sun then the sun comes over the horizon and you see how trivial the earlier suggestion was pesskrag might have been a physicist by profession but she spoke poetically however poetically she spoke she forgot something ttomalss said the big uglies dropped this egg some time ago what sort of sunrise are they presently experiencing i do not know that i cannot know that being so many lightyears removed from tosev pesskrag replied i must assume they are some years ahead of us they made these discoveries first from what you say they are also quicker than we to translate theory into engineering yes that is a truth ttomalss agreed if anything that is an understatement i asked you this before now i ask it again can you prepare a memorandum telling me in nontechnical terms what sort of engineering changes you expect to hatch from these theoretical changes this time pesskrag made the affirmative gesture i think i had better now we are further along than we were so what i say will be much less speculative than it would have the last time you asked me i should send it to you by the day after tomorrow that will do i thank you farewell ttomalss broke the connection he knew memoranda often hatched more slowly than their authors thought they would this one though came when pesskrag promised it ttomalss read it on the monitor before printing a hard copy once he had read it his first impulse was to conclude that pesskrag had lost her mind but she had evidence on her side and he had only his feelings he was as hed said no physicist himself he was also alarmed if she did know what she was talking about if the big uglies knew the same sorts of things and more besides ttomalss printed out the memorandum and took it to atvars chamber he was glad to find the retired fleetlord there this is something you should see exalted fleetlord he said and held out the paper what is it senior researcher atvar seemed distracted uninterested you will forgive me i hope but i have other things on my mind none of them is more important than this ttomalss insisted no atvar swung one eye turret toward him i am concerned with the survival or lack of same of both the race and the big uglies do you still hold to your claim i do exalted fleetlord ttomalss replied slowly atvars other eye turret followed the first you really mean that he observed astonishment in his voice ttomalss made the affirmative gesture atvar held out his hand in a way that suggested he was about as ready to claw as to grab very well let me see this so i can dispose of it and go on to other things here exalted fleetlord ttomalss handed him the printout atvar began to read with one eye turret as if to say the memorandum deserved no more ttomalss waited before long the fleetlord was going over the document with both eyes a sign it had engaged his interest ttomalss made the affirmative gesture again this time to himself hed expected nothing less at last atvar looked up from the printout you really believe this will happen senior researcher pesskrag has never struck me as one who exaggerates for the sake of winning attention ttomalss replied she believes this will happen so do her colleagues if it does it will be important if it does it will turn the worldseveral worldsupside down atvar said ttomalss could hardly disagree with that the fleetlord went on did i note that this is information derived from experiments modeled after those the big uglies have already carried out you did yes ttomalss waited to see how atvar would respond to that the fleetlord let out a furious hiss we are going to have our work cut out for us then are we not it would appear so ttomalss wondered how large an understatement that was atvar said do your pet physicists have an idea how long this will need to go from experiment to production this report does not state it ttomalss answered the last time i asked pesskrag the same question she gave me an estimatehardly more than a guess she saidof at least a hundred fifty years that was her estimate for us atvar asked when ttomalss showed that it was atvar asked a grimly sardonic question how long will it take the big uglies again exalted fleetlord i have no idea i am only a messenger here pesskrag would not offer an estimate for that of course she would not yes irony had its claws in the fleetlord all right what do she and her colleagues know of tosevites about what i know of physics they could hardly know less than that could they well they could know as little as i know about physics ttomalss said he startled a laugh out of atvar either way they do not know much and that is the problem would you not agree even those of us with some understanding of the big uglies too often underrate them the less the physicists knowledge the greater their tendency to do so the less the physicists knowledge of big uglies the greater their tendency to think the tosevites are just like us ttomalss replied we both said the same thing in slightly different ways atvar said ttomalss wished he could disagree with that but knew he could not the fleetlord continued we are going to have some interesting times are we not not pleasant necessarily but interesting i would think so yes ttomalss said forgive me but you seemed out of sorts when i brought you this report did i i suppose i did atvar said talks with the big uglies are not going as well as i wish they were sam yeager simply does not have a realistic view of the situation are you sure exalted fleetlord ttomalss asked from all i have seen the american ambassador is about as reasonable a tosevite as was ever hatched this has also been my view atvar replied he has also been as friendly to the race as any tosevite could be expected to be that makes his present intransigence all the more disappointing i fear he must have instructions that constrain him for he is not at all yielding even on small points how much have you yielded to him what i am allowed to atvar said he pushes the notion of formal equality to ridiculous extremes though if one believes his assumptions there is no difference between the empire and the united states in sovereignty and in obligations none whatever what is the likely result if these talks fail ttomalss asked war what else atvar sounded particularly bleak then they had better not fail or do you disagree oh no the fleetlord used the negative gesture i think you are absolutely right the emperor agrees with you too but if the wild big uglies present impossible demands what are we supposed to do yield to them i am very sorry senior researcher but i think not one more question exalted fleetlord and then i will leave ttomalss said do the tosevites think our requirements are as ridiculous as we think theirs if they do perhaps both sides should be more flexible and seek some sort of compromise solution easier to propose a compromise than to propose compromise terms both sides would find acceptable atvar said coldly farewell that was an unmistakable dismissal farewell ttomalss said and left the fleetlords chamber he had done what he could the race as a whole had done what it could the wild big uglies no doubt would loudly insist that they had done what they could and what was the likely result of all that the same disaster that would have appeared if everyone had gone into these talks with the worst will imaginable so much for good intentions the psychologist thought there was some sort of tosevite saying about what good intentions were worth he couldnt recall the details but remembered thinking that the phrase when hed heard it translated held more truth than he wished it did the elevator ride down to the lobby felt like a fall perhaps a fall straight into despair hoping to make himself feel better with some food ttomalss went into the refectory the result was not what hed hoped for oh the food would be pleasant enough the hotel had a good kitchen but kassquit and frank coffey were in there ahead of him sitting in a couple of chairs designed for big uglies it wasnt that ttomalss begrudged his former wards happiness so he told himself at any rate still seeing her so obviously pleased with the company of her fellow tosevite got under his scales if behavior sprang from biology more than from culture perhaps conflict with the wild big uglies was inevitablea conclusion he would rather not have reached just then he did his best to reach a different conclusion maybe their happiness together showed that citizens of the empire and wild tosevites could get on well despite their cultural differences that sounded reassuring but he couldnt make himself believe it it would have been a truth had all citizens of the empire been tosevites had kassquit been a member of the race frank coffey would not have been interested in her in the way he was tosevite sexuality makes cultural differences less important he judged but that was an argument for biological primacy not against it and one he wished he had not thought of the server brought his zisuili ribs they were tender and meaty the sauce that covered them tart on his tongue he savored them less than he wished he would have his mind was on other things atvar had always been on the optimistic side when it came to dealing with the big uglies if even he feared a clash was inevitable maybe it was sam yeager knew the commandant of the admiral peary was the sort of man who would have disposed of him like a crumpled paper towel for letting the lizards know who was responsible for the attack on the colonization fleet that was one reason yeager hated talking with lieutenant general healey and the commandant despised him right back he knew it as far as healey was concerned he was a traitor and a lizardlover somebody who cared about the race more than he did about humanity or his own country their mutual lack of affection had made their conversation about ginger not long before particularly unpleasant healey could have worked much more easily with the doctor nobody had ever questioned the doctors patriotism and the doctor would have figured healey was a useful tool and treated him with the respect required to keep him useful nobody yeager was convinced could have kept healey happy the capacity for happiness simply was not in the man but the usa was stuck with one sam yeager as ambassador it meant lieutenant general healey had to take him seriously for his position if not for himself and it also meant that now and again like it or not sam had to deal with healey are you sure this conversation is secure healey growled yeager might have guessed those would be the first words out of his mouth as sure as my instruments will let me be he answered of course the race would try to monitor conversations between the ground and the admiral peary the scrambling equipment was humanmade the best around in that put it a little ahead of anything the lizards owned but they had a whole solar systems worth of electronics here to try to tease signal out of noise maybe they could sam felt he had to add life doesnt come with a guarantee you know yes i am aware of that by healeys sour rasp he was wishing he were having this conversation with the doctor he muttered something sam couldnt make out which was probably just as well then he gathered himself tell me whats on your mind ambassador in his own crabbed way he was making an effort if he dealt with sam yeager the ambassador he wouldnt have to think so much about sam yeager the manthe man he couldnt stand i think you would do well to stay alert for anything unexpected sam picked his words with as much care as he could we always do healey said as if sam couldnt be trusted to know that for himself but then his tone sharpened are you telling me there may be some special reason we need to be alert he was narrow he was sour he was also professionally competent however little yeager cared to acknowledge that and yeager had to answer yes im afraid there may be suppose you tell me more the commandant rapped out there are sovereignty issues sam said unhappily freetrade issues the race has mostfavorednation status in commerce with the united states it doesnt want to see that there are reciprocity issues if tariffs keep us from carrying on any sort of trade with the planets in the empire then we have a problem healey broke in and sam couldnt disagree with him healey went on all right ambassador i suppose i have to thank you for the headsup i promise you we wont be caught napping anything else i dont think so sam said out he broke the connection it was his turn to do some muttering one reason the admiral peary had come to home heavily armed was to remind the race war with the united states didnt just mean war within the suns solar system war could come home to the other worlds the empire ruled healey was probably the right man to be up there too if he had to fight for his ship he would do it till the lizards overwhelmed him inevitably they would but theyd know theyd been in a scrap too theyd never had anybody insist on full equality with them before they didnt know how to respond no that wasnt true they couldnt see that they needed to agree that came closer to the truth shaking his head sam left his room he went down to the lobby where he found tom de la rosa and frank coffey goodnaturedly arguing about of all things a blown call in the world series de la rosa rounded on him as he came up what do you think sam was the guy safe or out beats me sam said id been on ice for years so had that stupid umpire coffey said the only difference is they ran him out there anyway yeager looked around there werent any lizards close byjust a couple of guards at the door but the race was bound to have bugged the area he would have in the lizards place any edge you could get was better than none he said come on back up to my room gentlemen if youd be so kind the lizards had bugs there too the difference was those bugs didnt worksam didnt think they did anyhow whats up tom asked yeager only shrugged pointed at a wall and tapped his own ear the lizards could have all the bugs they wanted down here but they wouldnt get everything that was going on de la rosa and coffey certainly knew what sam was saying they kept on hashing out the blown callor maybe the good call if you believed tomall the way up the elevator by the time they got off sam found himself wishing hed seen the play he wondered if people back on earth were still arguing about it too but everyones manner changed when the three of them got back to the hotel room whats up de la rosa asked again this time in a much less casual tone of voice before answering sam checked the bug sniffer only after he saw everything was green did he ask what was on his mind which is better a treaty that doesnt give us everything we ought to have or a fight to make sure we get it whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them frank coffey quoted de la rosa grinned at him youre a lot of things major but ill be damned if i can see you as a melancholy dane youre rightim too cheerful coffey said de la rosa and yeager both made faces at him its a serious question though sam got back to business it looks more and more as if the lizards arent going to give us full equality all over the empire so what do we do about that do we settle for something less or do we go to war and blow everything to hell and gone cant very well phone home for instructions can you de la rosa said not unless i want to go back into cold sleep till the answer comes in twentyodd years from now yeager answered and theres not much point to sending out an ambassador if youre going to do it all by radio is there youre the man on the spot coffey agreed in the end it all comes down to you sam knew that he wished frank coffey hadnt put it so baldly he wished the doctor had revived he wished for all sorts of things he wouldnt get the weight lay on his shoulders he was responsible for billions of lives scattered among four different species nobody since the emperor whod sent the conquest fleet to earth had borne that kind of burdenand the lizard hadnt known he bore it if we accept an inferior treaty now maybe we can get it fixed when were stronger tom said were getting stronger all the time too other side of that coin is maybe the lizards will think they have a precedent for holding us down coffey said what are your orders ambassador he was a military man to him orders were holy writ sam had lived in that world for a long time he understood it but he didnt feel bound by it not any more he said the first thing my orders are is out of date tom said it i cant phone home im the man on the spot if my orders tell me to insist on complete equality no matter what and i see that means war im going to think long and hard before i follow them are you saying you wont follow them coffey asked that was a dangerous question if he saw somebody wantonly disobeying orders well who could guess what he might do no im not saying i wont follow them yeager answered carefully but war on this scale is something nobodys ever imagined not even the people who were around when the conquest fleet landed he was one of those people there were a few more up on the admiral peary back on earth only the oldest of the old and even they would have been children back then a good many lizards whod been active then were still around that wasnt just on account of cold sleep either they lasted longer than people did but did they understand what they might be setting in motion sam didnt think so what will make up your mind one way or the other frank coffey didnt want to let it alone he was capable he was dutiful he made sam want to kick him in the teeth still picking his words with care sam said if they say you have to do it our way or well go to war with you right now i dont see that i have any choice we let them know well fight you cant let them get away with that kind of threat if they think they can theyll own us no doubt about that coffey said tom de la rosa nodded okay sam said but if they say something like we want to stay peaceful but this is the only kind of treaty we can accept that may be a different story then it might be a better idea to say well were not real happy with this but well make the deal for now and figure our grandchildren can finish picking the lizards pockets i like that or most of me does tom said it wont stop the ecological damage but a lot of thats already done coffey stayed dubious i dont want them thinking they can push us around at all theyre like anybody else whos got power and wants more give em an inch and theyll take a mile and who knows wholl be doing the pushing around fifty years from now or a hundred and fifty it hasnt come to ultimatums yet yeager said im still hoping it doesnt but you wouldnt have warned the admiral peary if you werent worried major coffey said i know you ambassador you wouldnt give lieutenant general healey the time of day if you werent worried he was too obviously right to make that worth denying when sam didnt say anything coffey asked his question again what are your orders they werent sams they were intended for the doctor he would have had no qualms about carrying them out yeager was sure of that basically to ensure our freedom and independence he answered thats what this is all about past the basics ive got a lot of discretion i have to the home office is a hell of a long way from here youre right about that tom said sure are frank coffey said but you dont get anywhere against oppression by bowing down and saying thank you to the fellow with the bullwhip no offense ambassador but that just doesnt work sam would have been happier had he thought the black man was wrong when the phone hissed for attention atvar had just come out of the shower that was a smaller problem for a member of the race than it would have been for a wild big ugly he didnt need to worry about decking himself with wrappings before he went to answer but it was an annoyance even so shaking a last couple of drops of water off the end of his snout he sat down in front of the monitor and let the camera pick up his image this is atvar i greet you he said and i greet you fleetlord the face on the screen made atvar hiss in surprise your majesty he exclaimed and began to fold into the special posture of respect reserved for the emperor never mind that the th emperor risson said holding up a hand we have serious matters to discuss atvar made the affirmative gesture as always your majesty i am at your service good risson said how seriously do you take this new report from senior researcher ttomalss and the physicists he has recruited seriously enough to pass it on in the hope that your eye turrets would move across it atvar answered i cannot fully comment on the quality of the research there i have to rely on the scholars involved but by their reputations they are firstrate males and females yes risson used the affirmative gesture too this being so what they say is probably right what do we do about that i think perhaps you should ask the physicists and not me atvar said my own view is we push ahead with this research as hard as we can the big uglies already have a considerable start on us that is also a truth risson used the same gesture again how likely is it in your opinion that we will be able to catch up there was an interesting questionso interesting atvar almost wished the emperor hadnt asked it the race had had a head start on the tosevites in technology it didnt any more the big uglies moved faster than the race did if they had found something new and the race had to make up lost ground the emperor deserved the truth indeed he required the truth with a sigh atvar answered while it may not be impossible i do not believe it will be easy either we are more sensible than they are but without a doubt they are more nimble i was hoping you would tell me something else risson said with a sigh of his own your view closely matches those of my other advisers this being so our view of negotiations with the american big uglies necessarily changes too would you not agree i would atvar said i have begun to take a less compromising line with sam yeager we are likely to be stronger now than in the future any bargains we make should reflect our current strength good very good again i agree risson said i also wonder how much the big uglies here know about the research back on their own planet our monitoring has not picked up much in the way of information on it coming from the wild tosevites on their home planet speculation is that tosevite leaders know we are listening to their transmissions and do not wish to give us any data they do not have to that strikes me as reasonable atvar said i wish it did not but it does the tosevites are more accustomed to secrecy than we are they have internal rivalries the likes of which we have not known since before home was unified so i am given to understand the th emperor risson sighed again you know i want peace with the big uglies who could not when war would prove so destructive he waited as far as atvar was concerned agreement there was automatic the emperor went on but if war should become necessary better war when we are stronger than when we are weaker just so your majestythus the harder line atvar replied i do not relish it who could but better on our terms than on the tosevites terms so far sam yeager has been intransigent when it comes to the americans demands if we cannot get what we require by other means shall we proceed to whatever forceful steps prove necessary war is only a last resort risson said always war is only a last resort but if it becomes necessary they will have some warning atvar warned when the signals from their own ship fall silent they will know something has gone wrong why should those signals fall silent the emperor asked we can continue with negotiations here as always if the big uglies in our solar system fail to detect the outgoing signals then we have many years before any come back here from tosev to alert them is that not a truth before answering atvar had to stop and think that over once he had he bent not into the special posture of respect that applied to the emperor alone but into the more general posture one gave not only to superiors but also to anyone who said something extraordinarily clever i do believe that would serve your majesty provided the big uglies do not learn about the scheme ahead of time how likely are they to do so risson asked i am not certain no one is quite certain atvar replied i would suggest though that you do not mention this any more when calling me here tosevite electronics are good enough to keep us from monitoring their conversations in their rooms and most of their conversations with their starship how well they can monitor ours is unknown but we should exercise caution what they have here can defeat our electronics risson said atvar made the affirmative gesture the emperor went on with his own thought what they have on tosev will be more advanced than what they have here that is also bound to be a truth your majesty atvar agreed our technology is stable theirs advances by leaps and bounds this is no doubt one of the reasons why they have the arrogance to believe themselves our equals indeed risson said and it is one of the reasons we should strike first if we must strike if they get too far ahead of us we have no hope of fighting them successfully again you know i would rather have peace i do your majesty atvars emphatic cough showed how well he knew it and yet my first duty is to preserve the empire and the race risson continued if the only way i can do that is through a preventive war then i must consider one no matter how distasteful i find it if we ever reach a position where the wild big uglies can dictate the terms of engagement to us we are lost another truth atvar said when i administered our lands on tosev i often contemplated preventive war against the tosevites i always held off on launching it both in the hope that we would be able to live peacefully alongside them and out of fear for the damage such a war would have caused even then perhaps i was wrong to hold back perhaps you were fleetlord risson said but it is too late to dwell on that now we have to make the best of the present situation and to make sure the future is not worse than the present just so your majesty atvar said if these physicists prove to know what they are talking about we have less time to make up our minds than i wish we did the emperor said i will do everything in my power to drive our research efforts forward i am not a scientist though all i can offer is moral suasion atvar made the negative gesture no your majesty there is one thing more and something much more important oh and that is funding risson laughed though atvar hadnt been joking yes fleetlord that is bound to be a truth and an important one as you say believe me the appropriate ministries will hear that this is a project of the highest priority it will go forward i am glad to hear it your majesty atvar said risson said a few polite goodbyes then broke the connection atvar stared thoughtfully at the monitor the emperor was worrying about the new developments which was good atvar still wondered how much difference it would make the big uglies had a lead and they moved faster than the race how likely was it that the race could catch up not very atvar feared which meant which means trouble the fleetlord muttered like the th emperor risson he vastly preferred peace unlike his sovereign hed seen war and its aftermath at first hand not just as signals sent across the lightyears more war now would be dreadfulbut more war later might be worse one of his eye turrets swung toward the ceiling somewhere up there out past all the stories above him the tosevite starship spun through space when the conquest fleet first came to tosev the big uglies hadnt been able to fly out of their stratosphere two generations before that theyd had no powered flight at all and now they were here their nuclear weapons were here too if it was possible to keep the wild big uglies on that ship from finding out the race had gone to war against the united states that might save home some nasty punishment or on the other hand it might not something might go wrong in which case the starship would strike the races home planet the big uglies might launch other starships too for that matter they might already have launched them there was one of atvars nightmares signals flew faster than ships between the stars that had been true ever since the race first sent a probe to the rabotevs system and remained true today atvar hoped he would have heard if more tosevite ships were on the way he hoped but he wasnt sure the race could keep the american starship here from knowing an attack order had gone out back in the tosevite system the big uglies might be able to keep the race from learning theyd launched ships because theyd been cheating one another for as long as theyd been more or less civilized they were more practiced at all forms of trickery than the race was and what was going on in their physics laboratories how long before abstract experiments turned into routine engineering could the big uglies turn these experiments into engineering at all could anyone well find out atvar thought he laughed before leaving for tosev hed been used to knowing how things worked what everythings place wasand everyones too it wasnt like that any more it never would be again not till the last big uglies had been firmly incorporated into the empireand maybe not even then atvar made the negative gesture one other possibility could also bring back order it might return when the last big uglies died it mightif the tosevites didnt take the race to say nothing of the rabotevs and hallessi down with them they would do their best the fleetlord was sure of that how good their best might be as atvar did so often in his dealings with the big uglies he trembled between hope and fear more often than not the races hopes about tosev had proved unjustified the races fears he wished that hadnt occurred to him karen yeager wondered why major coffey had called all the americans on the surface of home to his room hed never done that before he was the expert here on matters military if he had something to say he usually said it to karens fatherinlaw what was so important that everyone needed to hear it at least kassquit wasnt here karen had half wondered if she would be in that case frank coffey wouldnt have been talking about military affairs but about his own could he have been foolish enough to ask kassquit to marry him people far from home did strange things and no one had ever been farther from home than the people whod flown on the admiral peary even so people we have a problem coffeys words cut across karens thoughts the major paused to check the antibugging gadgets then nodded to himself he went on the lizards have come up with something sneaky he went on to explain how the race could order war to start back on earth without leaving the humans on and orbiting home any the wiser though the room was warmwhat rooms on home werent warm except the ones that were downright hot ice walked up karens back they cant do that she exclaimed she felt foolish the moment the words were out of her mouth the lizards damn well could do that which was exactly the problem what do we do about it linda de la rosa asked sure enough that was the real question whatever we do is risky sam yeager said if we sit tight the lizards may get away with their scheme if we dont we let them know were tapping their phone lines they may not like that at all what can they do throw us off the planet karen asked even if they do how are we worse off we have to make sure they dont order their colonists to suckerpunch the united states without our knowing it frank coffey said it would be nice if they didnt order the colonists to suckerpunch the united states even if we do know about it tom de la rosa said karen had a devil of a time disagreeing with that melanie blanchard said i dont see how we can stop them from sending the order secretly all they have to do is transmit from a ship thats gone outside this solar system theyd have the angle on any detectors we could put out that held the unpleasant ring of truth jonathan said all things considered were probably lucky they didnt think of this sooner they havent had to worry about these kinds of problems for a long long time theyre a little slow on the uptake so what do we do sam yeager asked we let them know we know what theyve got in mind that would show them our electronics are better than theirs coffey said it might make them think twice about taking us on who knows how far weve come since the admiral peary left and how far we will have come by the time their signal gets to earth we might make them more eager to jump us though to make sure they dont fall further behind tom said from what you told us the emperor and atvar were talking about that and what are these experiments they were talking about karen asked it sounds like theyre trying to catch up with some sort of discovery that got made on earth a while ago do we know anything about that nobody answered not right away at last major coffey said people back on earth may not have transmitted anything about it to us just to make sure the lizards didnt intercept whatever it is that made a fair amount of sense it also argued that the discovery whatever it was was important jonathan said the lizards must have spotted it on their own then has the admiral peary picked up anything that would give us a clue theres a lot of electronic traffic coming from earth to homean awful lot coffey said were the races numberone interest right now theres more than our starship can keep up with this bit might have slipped through without even being noticedor it might have been encrypted we havent broken all the lizards algorithms not by a long shot what kind of search can we run sam yeager held up a hand never mind i dont need to know right now but whatever they can do on the ship they ought to start doing it the more we know the better off well be maybe we can shame the lizards into behaving linda said then she laughed i knowdont hold my breath ill try its one more weapon whats that line conscience is the still small voice that tells you someone may be watching sam said the other thing the ship has to do is send a warning back to the states that there might be a surprise attack after pearl harbor and the strike against the colonization fleet earth has seen too much of that kind of thing major coffey stirred but didnt say anything more than a few people in the military still felt the strike against the colonization fleet had been legitimate because the united states carried it out frank coffey had never shown any signs of being one of those officersnever till now he probably still deserved the benefit of the doubt are we agreed then sam yeager asked i will protest to atvar and the emperor and anyone else wholl listen ill let them know were sending back a warning so they wont catch us napping theyll deny everything jonathan predicted we would tom de la rosa said they may not even botherthey havent had as much practice at being hypocrites as we have any which way though the more complicated we make their lives the better amen karen said several other people nodded all right then well try it like that sam yeager shook his head i wish i were talking about getting my car to start not rolling the dice for everybody on the planetfor everybody on four planets youre the one the lizards wanted when the doctor didnt wake up karen said if they wont listen to you they wont listen to anybody her fatherinlaw nodded not altogether cheerfully thats what im afraid ofthat they wont listen to anybody well well find out on that note the meeting broke up happy day jonathan said as the americans filed out of frank coffeys room uhhuh karen felt numb drained i wonder just how much trouble theres going to be she looked around as if expecting the hotel corridors to go up in a radioactive cloud any minute now that had always been possible though theyd all done their best not to think about it now it felt appallingly probable if anybody can get us out of it dads the one jonathan said you were right about that he plainly meant it at a moment like this he didnt waste time on jealousy of his father the way he often did even when jealous though he didnt try to tear down his fathers abilities he only wished his own measured up to them well see karen did her best to look on the bright side of things if there was one it sounds like a lots been going on back on earth that we dont know much about i do wonder what those experiments the lizards were talking about mean jonathan waved her to silence she bit down on the inside of her lower lip hard enough to hurt shed let her mouth run away with her the race was bound to be bugging the corridors the americans didnt even try trolling for eavesdropping devices there the job was too big theyll know we know soon enough she said oh yeah jonathan didnt argue with that and well never get a nickels worth of useful intelligence by tapping the phones again he shrugged what can you do sometimes that stuff is useless if you dont cash it in lunch in the refectory was interesting kassquit knew the americans had gathered and wanted to know why nobody wanted to tell her her face never showed anything much even so karen had no trouble telling she was getting angry why will you not let me know what you talked about she demanded of all of themand of frank coffey in particular like so many lovers through the eons she assumed her beloved would tell her everything because they were lovers karen had wondered about that herself but coffey said what he had to say i am sorry but this was private business for us when we decide to talk about it with the race we will but i am not a member of the race you of all males ought to know that kassquit said pointedly you are a citizen of the empire coffey said that is what i meant we americans often think of the empire as belonging only to the race i realize that is wrong but it is our first approximation i am also a member of the empires team of negotiators kassquit pointed out if anyone on home is entitled to know i am sam yeager made the negative gesture this is a matter for the fleetlord and perhaps for the emperor himself karen wondered if that said too much it was enough to make kassquits eyes widen in surprise one expression she did have what could be so important our talks are not going perfectly but they have not suffered any great crisis that only proved she was out of the loop for some of the things going on around her karen eyed her with an almost malicious satisfaction youre not as smart as you think you are we know things you dont she stopped herself just before she tacked on a couple of mental nyahnyah s you will hear soon enough sam said why will you not tell me now kassquit asked because high officials in the empire need to know first as i said before sam yeager answered more patiently than karen would have they will tell you what you need to know if they do not tell you enough ask me i will speak freely then until i have followed protocol though he made the negative gesture karen thought kassquit would get angry at that but she didnt she was reasonable sometimes even when being reasonable was unreasonable not letting her emotions run wild probably helped her in dealing with the race lizards operated differently from people kassquit would have been banging her head against a stone wall if shed tried getting them to respond on her terms but her chilly rationality was one of the things that made her seem not quite human now she said very well ambassador i understand the point even if i do not like it i shall be most interested to learn what your concerns are i thank you for your patience karens fatherinlaw said letting her down easy in english tom de la rosa said shes not going to wait for atvar and ttomalss shes going to try to wheedle it out of you frank he grinned to show coffey he didnt mean that seriously she can try coffey said also in english i know what i can tell her and i know what i cant karen eyed kassquit even if she didnt wear clothes she probably wasnt cut out to be a spy karen sighed life was different from the movies here was a naked woman on the other side and she didnt seem to be using her charms for purposes of espionage what was the worldwhat were the worldscoming to kassquit stared at ttomalss in something approaching horror the big uglies dared spy on the conversations of the emperor himself she cast down her eyes at mentioning her sovereign ttomalss also looked down at the floor for a moment as he made the affirmative gesture i am afraid that is a truth yes what is even more disturbing is that they were able to eavesdrop on the emperors conversation with fleetlord atvar we have had no luck listening to their private conversations that is not a matter of luck it is a matter of technology kassquit pointed out you are correct i wish you were not ttomalss told her and the technology the wild big uglies brought here is bound to be years out of date on tosev just how far out of date it may be is a matter of considerable concern to us i understand that yes kassquit agreed can you tell me what the emperor and the fleetlord were talking about or are you going to be as obscure as the wild tosevites she added the last bit as artlessly as she could with luck it would get ttomalss to talk where he might otherwise have kept quiet and it did he said in fact their conversation does relate to advancing tosevite technology they were discussing whether that advancing technology made a preventive war necessary oh kassquit said and then oh dear she tried to gather herself the race has talked about this for many years but always abandoned the idea why is it back on the agenda now ttomalss hesitated then he shrugged the wild big uglies already know this so there is no longer any reason why you should not do you remember my colleague back on tosev senior researcher felless yes kassquit said i must tell you i did not like her much felless is difficult for members of the race to like tooexcept when she has been tasting ginger of course ttomalss qualified that with a fine sarcastic eyeturretwaggling leer but he continued however difficult she may be no one doubts her abilitywhen she is not tasting ginger she noticed some unusual tosevite technological development and sent word of it here what sort of development kassquit asked we are not yet completely sure of that ttomalss answered but the physicists are convinced it will have important results at some point in the future what sort of important results how far in the future again we are not completely certain ttomalss said kassquit eyed him precisely what are you certain of superior sir ttomalss shifted uneasily in his chair what do you mean do you intend that for sarcasm oh no superior sir how could i possibly be sarcastic because you are evading my questions what do you suppose might provoke me into doing something of that sort this is not helpful ttomalss voice was thick with disapproval no it is not kassquit agreed your evasions are not helpful either the tosevites evade my questions too i can understand that they are not citizens of the empire and do not trouble their livers over its concerns but i thought you and i were on the same side until the experiments progress further i cannot offer you a report on them ttomalss said which sounded like another evasion to kassquit then he asked what questions are the big uglies evading the ones you would expect the ones that have to do with dealings between the united states and the empire as i say those evasions make sense the ones you put forward strike me as absurd you do not understand the full situation ttomalss said that is a truth i do not and the reason i do not is that you will not tell me enough to let me understand it kassquit said angrily when i am authorized to give you all the details you may be assured that i will ttomalss said oh and why may i be assured of that kassquit snapped even more angrily than before ttomalss tailstump quivered so shed succeeded in angering him too if you do not care for my choices in this matter i suggest that you take it up with fleetlord atvar or with the emperor himself i thank you superior sir i thank you so very much the way kassquit bent into the posture of respect had no respect whatsoever in it the way ttomalss tailstump quivered more than ever said he knew it too kassquit went on it shall be done perhaps one of them has a certain minimal respect for the truth she straightened turned her back and stalked out of his chamber she started to go to atvars room then she stopped in the hallway and made the negative gesture she would do that if all else failed the th emperor risson had granted her an audience perhaps he would speak to her as well and if he did she intended to hurl that right into ttomalss snout telephoning the emperor of course was not so simple as putting a call in to the palace and expecting him to pick it up on the other end of the line but it was easier for her than it might have been for a female of the race the sight of her tosevite features in the monitor got her quickly transferred from a lowlevel functionary to a midlevel functionary to herrep himself for the males and females who served the emperor remembered he had received two big uglies not long before the protocol master was made of sterner stuff what is the purpose of this call herrep asked his interrogative cough was the chilliest kassquit had ever heard to discuss with his majesty relations between the empire and the wild big uglies kassquit answered you will agree superior sir that this matter is of relevancei should say of unique relevanceto me herrep could hardly deny that she was a citizen of the empire and a big ugly no one else on home could say both those things she knew she wasnt wild she wondered if herrep would remember to him wouldnt one big ugly be the same as another wait he said i will see if his majesty wishes to speak to you a pleasant almost hypnotic moving pattern replaced his image on the monitor soft music began to play kassquit drummed her fingers on the desk in her room they did not make sharp clicks as those of a member of the race would have done her fingerclaws were short and broad and blunt she wore artificial ones to work the races switches and operate its keyboards she was beginning to wonder how patient she ought to be when the pattern vanished and the music fell silent a males face looked out at her it wasnt herreps it belonged to the th emperor risson kassquit scrambled to assume the special posture of respect i greet you your majesty i thank you for taking the time to speak with me you are welcome researcher risson replied we need not stand on much ceremony on the telephone am i correct in believing you have learned discussions with the wild tosevites have gone less well than we might have wished yes your majesty kassquit said i have learned that it dismays me what dismays me even more is that i have been unable to learn why these talks have taken this unfortunate turn there are two main reasons the emperor told her the first is tosevite arrogance over issues of sovereignty and equality under other circumstances this might be solved with patience and good will on both sides i believe such patience does exist what are these other circumstances if i may ask kassquit said the wild big uglies are pulling ahead of us technologically risson said they rubbed our snouts in this recently when they showed they could monitor our voice communications and could keep us from monitoring theirs a shocking breach of privacy kassquit said sympathetically shocking because they were able to do it risson said after all we have been trying to spy on them too but they succeeded and we failed and their technology changes so much faster than ours what do they currently have on tosev if we do not stop them now will we be able to later kassquit knew those were all good questions she also knew the race had been debating them for years why worry so much now she asked how has the situation changed for the worse in two ways the emperor said first the wild big uglies can now reach us on our own planets any war against them would be empirewide rather than confined to the system of tosev the longer we delay the more harm they can do us too kassquit used the affirmative gesture that was an obvious truth risson went on the second factor has grown more important as time passes it is the growing fear that soon they will be able to hurt us and we will not be able to hurt them as they can tap our telephones undetected till they admit it while we cannot monitor their conversations does this have to do with certain experiments that have been conducted on tosev rissons eye turrets both swung sharply toward kassquit yes that had been the right question to ask you heard of this from he asked i heard of their existence from senior researcher ttomalss your majesty i heard no more than that kassquit answered ah very well risson seemed to relax which doubtless meant ttomalss did have orders from on high not to say much about such things to kassquit the emperor went on yes important experiments have taken place on tosev just how important they are our physicists are now trying to determine we do not know how far or how fast the wild tosevites have advanced from what we know they were doing some years ago we do know we will have to try to catch up and that will not be easy since the tosevites generally run faster than we do what are the consequences if the empire fails to catch up kassquit asked bad very bad risson said that wasnt what kassquit had expected to hear but it told her how seriously the emperor took the situation she tried again in what way are these consequences bad your majesty in every way we can imagine and probably also in ways we have yet to imagine risson replied it is because of these experiments that we view the current situation with such concern can you please tell me why you view them with such alarm kassquit persisted the better i understand the situation the more help i will be able to give the empire for the time being i am afraid that this information is secret risson said we are still evaluating it ourselves also the american tosevites appear to be ignorant of what has taken place on their home planet it would be to our advantage to have them remain ignorant if they knew the full situation their demands would become even more intolerable than they already are and now researcher if you will excuse me he broke the connection kassquit stared at the monitor risson hadnt told her everything she wanted to know but he had perhaps told her more than he thought he had whatever the wild big uglies back on tosev had discovered it was even more important than shed imagined sam yeager had faced plenty of frustrations on home hed been ready for most of themhe knew what the lizards were like and what they were likely to do as well as any mere human could that along with the doctors bad luck was why he was the american ambassador today but one frustration he hadnt expected was having the race know more about what was happening back on earth than he did things had worked out that way though physicists back on the home planet seemed to be dancing a buckandwing about something did anybody back on earth dance a buckandwing about anything any more sometimes the phrases that popped into sams head made him feel like an antique even to himself the race had a pretty good idea of what it was none of the americans on home had even a clue his own ignorance made sam call lieutenant general healey one more time he relished that about as much as he would have a visit to the proctologists sometimes though he had to bend over and sometimes he had to talk to the admiral peary s commandant he consoled himself by remembering healey liked him no better than he liked healey whats on your mind ambassador healey growled when the connection went through then came the inevitable question and is this call secure as far as i can tell it is yeager answered after checking the electronics in his room one more time all right go ahead heres what i want to know has the ship picked up any transmissions from the lizards on earth about human physicists recent experiments whatever they are and have the lizards here on home been blabbing about that kind of thing anywhere you can monitor them id like to find out whats going on if i can i dont remember anything like that by the way healey said it it couldnt have happened if he didnt remember it more often than not sam would have accepted that just to give himself an excuse to get off the phone with a man he couldnt stand that he didnt now was a measure of how urgent he thought this was could you please check general could you please check as carefully as possible its liable to be very important how important is very important healey asked scornfully peace or war important i dont think it gets any more important than that do you the commandant didnt answer not for some little while yeager started to wonder if he really did think something else was more important with healey you never could tell at last though he said ill see what i can find out thanks yeager said again healey didnt answer a glance at the electronics told sam the commandant had hung up on him he laughed the man was consistent yeah hes consistently a son of a bitch jeered the little voice inside sams head talks with atvar faltered it was as if both the fleetlord and sam were waiting for the other shoe to drop sam wasnt even sure what the other shoe was but he had to waitand he had to seem to know more than he did at one point atvar said it would be better for all concerned if this turned out to be a dead end do you truly think so yeager said wondering what this was our belief is that knowledge is never wasted yes i understand that the fleetlord answered you have this notion of what you call progress of change as improvement we think differently when we think of change we think of all the things that can go wrong all the things that will need fixing we are more realistic than you sam made the negative gesture meaning no disrespect but i do not think so the race and tosevites have different histories that is all you gained your technology slowly one piece at a time and that made you notice the disruptions it caused we got ours over a couple of long lifetimes it made things much better for us in spite of the disruptions did it atvar asked would the jews the deutsche exterminated agree with you without your newly advanced technologyrailroads poisons and so onthe deutsche could not have done as they did this is not the only example will you deny it i wish i could sam answered but that was not what atvar had asked sam yeager sighed no i will not deny it it is a truth but you ignore for example the medical advances that allow most of us to live out our full spans without fear of the diseases that killed so many of us not long ago i do not ignore them atvar said yeager thought he meant they also had a black side as in the experiments nazi doctors had undertaken while they were getting rid of jews but the fleetlord went down a different road will your agriculture keep up with population growth will you regulate the number of hatchlings you are allowed to produce or will you simply start to starve because you do not think of difficulties until it is too late those were good questions sam had answers for none of them all he could say was tosevites have also predicted these disasters but they have not happened yet if progress continues perhaps none of them will atvars mouth fell open he knew sam well enough to know he would not offend him by laughing at him there is such a thing as optimism ambassador and there is such a thing as what we call drooling optimism we would say wildeyed optimism sam replied but you see optimism in general turning into that kind of optimism sooner than we do no doubt you have come out with another truth atvar said as for me i can speak only as a male of the race and one of the things i have to say is this from the races perspective your optimism leads to arrogance you think you can ask for anything you want and everything will somehow turn out all right i must tell you that that is not a truth nor will it ever be he added an emphatic cough when you brought the conquest fleet to tosev you expected to find a bunch of swordswinging barbarians sam said truth we did atvar said i do not disagree this is so forgive me fleetlord but i have not finished sam said instead of being swordswinging barbarians we were as you found us barbarians with aircraft and landcruisers atvar broke in that stung it also held some truth more than sam yeager really cared to acknowledge refusing to acknowledge it he went on as he had intended we were advanced enough to fight you to a standstill you recognized some of us as equals but you never truly meant it not down in your livers not even when we began to get ahead of you technologically as long as we could not get out of our own solar system you had some justification for this but since we are talking here in sitneff everything you have said is a truth it makes you more dangerous not less why should we not try to rid ourselves of you while we still have the chance if we do not how long will it be before you try to get rid of us there was the rub the race had always seen humans as nuisances now it saw them as dangerous nuisances we will fight to defend ourselves sam warned that is not the issue atvar said any species will fight to defend itself you will fight to aggrandize yourselves you will but you will not do it at our expense was the conquest fleet fighting in selfdefense sam asked acidly in the end it certainly was the fleetlord said and sam laughed in surprise atvar went on we hadand we paid fora mistaken notion of where you tosevites were in terms of technology we knew as much before we landed on your planet but if you had been what we thought you were would you not agree you would have been better off if we had conquered you had the lizards brought earth from the twelfth century to the late twentieth in a couple of generations materially no one could possibly say we would not have been sam answered there you see atvar said sam held up a hand excuse me fleetlord but again i had not finished the one thing you would have taken away from us forever is our freedom some of us would say that is too high a price to pay then some of you are fools atvar said with acid of his own you had freedom to murder one another starve and die of diseases you did not know how to cure it is easy to speak of freedom when your belly is full and you are healthy when you are starving and full of parasites it is only a word and one without much meaning that held some truthmore again than yeager cared to admit but just because it held some truth did not mean it was a truth sam said the greeks invented democracysnoutcounting if you likemore than fifteen hundred of our years before your probe came to tosev more than three thousand of yours they were full of diseases they were hungry a lot of the time they fought among themselves but they did it anyway they believedand a lot of us have always believed sincethat no one has the right to tell anyone else what to do just because of who his sire was snoutcounting as usual atvar filled the word with scorn my opinion remains unchanged it is nothing to be proud of and is this vaunted freedom of yours worth having when it is only the freedom to starve or to die or to impose your superstition on others by force who brought reverence for the spirits of emperors past to tosev yeager inquired that is not superstition that is truth atvar said primly sounding as certain as a missionary evangelizing an islander in the south seas evidence would be nice sam said the fleetlord winced but he answered we at least have the evidence of a long and prosperous history your superstitions have nothing whatevernothing but fanaticism i should say we are a stubborn lot sam admitted you are indeed atvar used an emphatic cough sam said what you do not seem to understand is that we are also stubborn in the cause of freedom suppose you had sent the conquest fleet right after your probe and conquered us you could have done it no one would say anything else not for a moment suppose you had as i say do you not think that once we learned about modern technology from you we would have risen to regain our independence he had often seen atvar angry and sardonic he had hardly ever seen him horrified this was one of those times the fleetlord recoiled like a wellbred woman who saw a mouse which reminded sam that the lizards had yet to exterminate the escaped rats visibly gathering himself atvar said what a dreadful idea he used another emphatic cough you realize you may not have done your species a favor with this suggestion he could only mean sam had made humans seem more dangerous which made a preventive war more likely sam wanted to scowl that wasnt what hed had in mind he held his face steady atvar had probably had enough experience with humans to be able to read expressions picking his words with care sam said whatever happens to us is also likely to happen to you you know this is a truth fleetlord i know that whatever happens now is likely to be better than what would happen in a hundred years and much better than what would happen in two hundred atvar sighed i am sorry ambassador but that is how things look out of my eye turrets i am sorry too sam used an emphatic cough of his own will it be war jonathan yeager asked his father sam yeager shrugged i dont know yet but thats about as much as i can tell you he shook his head no thats not right i can tell you one other thing it doesnt look good right now everything seemed so fine when we got here jonathan said mournfully i know his father said but that we got here its just made the lizards more nervous the longer they think about it now we can reach them we can hit them where they liveliterally theyre starting to figure that if they dont move to get rid of us now theyll never have another chance they worry well have the drop on them if they wait jonathan looked out the window of his fathers room there was sitneff the town hed come to take for granted with the greenishblue sky and the dry hills out beyond the boxy buildings it had been a comfortable place for lizards to live since the pleistocene since before modern humans replaced neanderthals a female of the race from those days wouldnt have much trouble fitting into the city as it was now a neanderthal woman dropped into los angeles might have rather more with a distinct effort of will jonathan pulled back to the business at hand saying they may be right yeah i know it doesnt do us any goodjust the opposite in fact his father said but if they do attack us earth isnt the only planet thatll suffer you can bet your bottom dollar on that do you know for a fact that weve sent ships to rabotev and halless as he usually did jonathan used the races names for the stars humans called epsilon eridani and epsilon indi do you know that weve sent more ships here know for a fact no sam yeager shook his head again the admiral peary hasnt got news of any other launchings except the molotov if the lizards have they arent talking but he sighed heavily then repeated it but the one ominous word seemed a complete sentence if we did launch warships wed be damn fools to let the lizards know wed done it if war does start theyre liable to get some horrendous surprises and i have no ideanone at allwhat the russians and the japanese and even the germans might be able to do by now there may be a fleet behind the molotov i just dont know madness jonathan said after you had your audience with the emperor i thought everything was going to fall into place wed have peace and nobody would have to worry about things for a while he chuckled unhappily naive wasnt i well if you were you werent the only one because i felt the same way his father said and i really dont know what queered the deal that experiment back on earth whatever it was i guess so his father said id like things a lot better if i knew what was going on there though the lizards who do arent talking he paused to make sure the races listening devices were suppressed then spoke in a low voice the emperor wouldnt even tell kassquit jonathan whistled softly kassquit is as loyal to the empire as the day is long or do the lizards think shell spill everything she knows to frank in pillow talk he threw his hands in the air to show how unlikely he thought that was i dont know i just dont know dammit sam yeager said thats possibleif the lizards know us well enough to know what pillow talk is but they do know we can bug their phone lines here remember that may be why risson kept quiet i cant say for sure nobody human on home can say for sure that worries me too do they have any ideas on the admiral peary jonathan asked i asked lieutenant general healey his fathers mouth twisted as if to say he considered that above and beyond the call of duty he hasnt found anything yet but theres a hell of a lot of lizard signal traffic between earth and home to sift through and sometimes try to decrypt so who knows what hell come up with once he does some real digging and in the meantime in the meantime hes sending a war warning back to the usa his father said grimly whatever the lizards do they wont pull a jap on us okay dad jonathan said that was a phrase from sam yeagers generation jonathan understood it though he wouldnt have used it himself he wondered how many americans living right now would have any idea what it meant not many he suspected wish i had better news for you son his father said so do i jonathan said if i can do anything you sing out you hear i will his father promised thats what youre along for after all right now though i have to tell you i dont know what it would be thats not a knock on you i dont know what more i can do myself i wish to hell i did sam yeager had always been a vigorous man who looked and acted younger than his years but now the weight of worry made him seem suddenly old jonathan walked over and set a hand on his fathers shoulder something will turn up i hope so his father sounded bleak ill be damned if i know what it is though of course i would have said the same thing back in when the lizards were knocking the crap out of us nobody had any idea what to do about them either not at first thats what i hear jonathan agreed of course i wasnt around then you were if i hadnt been you wouldnt be around now yeah jonathan said his father looked back across the years and if your mother hadnt been carrying you he said as much to himself as to jonathan i probably wouldnt be here right now jonathan raised a quizzical eyebrow whats that supposed to mean sam yeager blinked he seemed to realize what hed just said a long sigh escaped him you know your mother was married to another guy before she met me oh sure jonathan said he got killed when the lizards invaded right well yeah his father was staring into the past again he looked embarrassed itsa little more complicated than we ever talked about though whatever it is i think youd better spit it out dad jonathan said do i have to come ten lightyears to get all the old family scandals well it looks like you probably do sam yeager not only looked embarrassed he sounded embarrassed too when your mother and i got married in beautiful romantic chugwater wyoming we both thought her first husband was dead thats the gods truth we did but he wasnt jonathan said slowly he didnt know how to take that it was news to him his father nodded he sure wasnt he was a physicist on our atomicbomb project barbarayour momfound out she was pregnant with you and then she found out she wasnt a widowbang like that sam yeager snapped his fingers jesus you never told me any of this jonathan said its not exactly something we were proud of his father answered which was probably the understatement of the year i always figured that if she hadnt had a bun in the oven she would have gone back to the other guyjens his name was i never asked heryoud better believe i didnt but thats what i figure she did though and so she ended up choosing me and the rest is history christ jonathan exclaimed any other skeletons in the closet as long as youre in a confessing mood i dont think so his father answered i guess i should have told you this a long time ago i guess you should have jonathan said feelingly what the hell happened to this other guy do you even know yeah i know sam yeagers face went even more somber than it had been he kind of went off the deep end after that and who can blame him he shot a couple of people before they finally got him and sometimes i wonder what i would have done his voice trailed away oh for gods sake dad jonathan said you wouldnt have done anything that nutty its not your style and you know it his father only shrugged how can you tell till something happens you cant losing your mom screwed up the other guys whole life it sure wouldnt have done me any good she was something special now his voice broke for him barbara yeager hadnt been dead long at all hed gone into cold sleep not long after she passed away jonathan had waited another seventeen years he had scar tissue over the wound his father didnt but the other things his old man had told him why did you sit on all this stuff for so long didnt you think i had a right to know sam yeager coughed a couple of times well part of it was that your mother never wanted to talk about it much she always did her best to act as though it hadnt happened i think she felt bad about the way things turned out for the other guy i know i would have in her shoes how could you help it it wasnt even that she didnt love him or hadnt loved him that probably made it worse justone of those things she didnt have any perfect choices she made the one she made and then she had to live with it we all had to live with it except the other guy had turned out not to be able to jonathan had always thought his mothers first husband was off the stage before she met his father nobodyd ever said so it was just what hed assumed what his folks had wanted him to assume he saw why theyd want him toit was safe and conventional the real story seemed anything but why tell me now he asked harshly its the truth i figured you ought to know his fathers mouth tightened and i have no idea what the odds of our coming through all this are we may not have a whole lot of time a deathbed confession not quite but maybe not so far removed from one either jonathan picked his words with care it must have been a crazy time back when we were fighting the conquest fleet his father nodded you can say that again we didnt know if wed make it or if wed all get blown to hell and gone the next week or the next day or sometimes the next minute a lot of us just grabbed what we could and didnt give a damn about tomorrow why i remember remember what jonathan asked when his father broke off but sam yeager only said never mind that really isnt any of your business im the only one left alive whose business it is and ill take it to the grave with me okay dad jonathan said surprised by his fathers vehemence but that was just one surprise piled on top of a ton of others he tried to imagine his father and mother falling in love falling into bed her thinking she was a widow he tried and felt himself failing the picture refused to form they were his parents they were so much older than he was his father wasnt so much older than he was as he had been before cold sleep and once upon a time long before cold sleep his father had been younger stilland so had his mother he still couldnt imagine it he couldnt imagine war with the lizards either but that was liable to be every bit as real as his parents sex life kassquit asked frank coffey do you know what sort of experiments you tosevites are carrying out on your home planet no the darkskinned american big ugly made the negative gesture i know there are some and i know the race is worried about them i was hoping you could tell me more she let her mouth fall open in a silent laugh i went up to the emperor himself and he would not tell me and if i knew i would hurt the empire by telling you if i knew i might be hurting my notempire by telling you coffey said and yet we both keep trying to find out either we are both spies or we have become very good friends or both kassquit said the american tosevite laughed though she hadnt been joking they lay on the sleeping mat in her room both of them naked theyd made love a while ago but frank coffey hadnt shown any interest in putting his wrappings on again when even an airconditioned room on home was warmer than tosevites found comfortable wrappings made no sense to kassquit she knew wild big uglies had strong prohibitions against shedding their wrappings in public she knew but she did not understand however irrational they were the prohibitions seemed too strong to overcome shed given up trying will it be war she asked the question was being asked more and more often in the hotel in sitneff by more and more tosevites and members of the race i cannot tell you that coffey answered i can tell you that the united states will not start a war against the race for us to start a war would make no sense if the race starts a war he shrugged we will fight back we will fight back as hard as we can you may rely on it oh i do kassquit said the other part of the promise is what concerns me the deutsche tried a surprise attack against the race i remember i was a boy then coffey said that startled kassquit for a moment they seemed about the same age but shed come into adulthood when the deutsche started the second major war between big uglies and the race then she remembered shed gone into cold sleep years before the american tosevite had and been kept in cold sleep till the admiral peary neared home coffey went on they had radioactivity alerts every day depending on how bad the fallout was sometimes they would not let us go out and play that sort of thing could happen here kassquit said truth coffey agreed worse than that much worse than that could also happen here and it could happen in my notempire too kassquit cared very little about the united states she remembered only belatedly that frank coffey cared very little about the empire that struck her as strange it would have struck an average member of the race as even stranger for more than a hundred thousand years the race hadnt needed diplomatic relations with foreign empires those of the rabotevs and hallessi had fallen before earlier conquest fleets in the flick of a nictitating membrane here as in everything else the big uglies were different if there is a war tosev may not survive it kassquit said what would you do then personally i am not sure coffey answered i would not know the worst had happened for many years that is something of a relief but the question may be academic the admiral peary and whatever other starships the united states is flying by then would do their best to make sure that whatever happened to tosev also happened to home and the other worlds of the empire was he speaking as someone who was simply concerned or as an american military officer who wanted to make sure the races military officers heard his words he had to be sure kassquits room was monitored kassquit was sure of it herself she hated it but didnt know what she could do about it how much damage could tosevite starships do she asked partly as a concerned citizen of the empire and partly to make sure the races military officers heard his reply what he said though wasnt very informative how can i know for certain i have been in cold sleep a long time the state of the art back on tosev will have changed i could not begin to guess the capabilities of the united states right nowor those of the other independent tosevite empires and notempires or maybe that wasnt so uninformative after all hed managed to remind the race it might not be fighting the united states alone that was something military officers needed to think about all right if this war comes it will be the worst anyone has ever known kassquit said no one could possibly say that is not a truth coffey agreed gravely then why fight it kassquit exclaimed i speak for myself and for the united states when i say we do not want to fight it frank coffey used an emphatic cough but i also have to say again that if the race attacks us we will fight back and fight back as hard as we can he added another one where is the sense to it kassquit asked as for myself i do not see that sense anywhere the american big ugly said but i can tell you where i think the race sees it where the race fears that no matter how bad the war would be if they fought it now it would be even worse if they waited till later coffey answered this is a mistaken attitude the united states is completely happy to be a good neighbor to the empireas long as the empire stays a good neighbor to us that sounded both logical and reasonable if coffey meant it if the united states meant it the empire and the tosevites snoutcounting notempire could live side by side if one thing history had taught the race though was that big uglies were least reliable when they sounded most reasonable and logical they left it there where else could they take it after supper that evening in the refectory kassquit went over to ttomalss and said excuse me superior sir but may i speak with you for a little while certainly ttomalss answered will you come to my room kassquit made the negative gesture i thank you but no do you not think it would be more pleasant to go outside and talk in the cool evening breezes to her those breezes were anything but cool when she used the races language though she necessarily used the races thought patterns too and by the way ttomalss eye turrets swung sharply toward her face he had no trouble figuring out what she really meant if they talked outside the hotel they would notor at least might notbe talking into someones hearing diaphragm the psychologist replied naturally enough we can do that if you like maybe the evening sevod are still calling they are pleasant to heardo you not think so yes very kassquit said they walked out of the hotel kassquit towering over the male who had raised her from a hatchling homes sun had set not long before twilight deepened the western sky gradually fading toward the blueblack of night the evening sevod were still twittering in the bushes around the building though they sounded sleepier with each passing moment one by one stars came out of the sky the lights of sitneff drowned out the dimmer ones but the brighter ones still shaped the outlines of the constellations kassquit had often watched stars from the starship in orbit around tosev shed had to get used to seeing them twinkle here from space of course their light was hard and unwinking she stared and then pointed is that not the star tosev superior sir ttomalss eye turrets moved in the direction of her finger he made the affirmative gesture yes i think so strange to see it as just another star is it not truth kassquit said and then i ask you again what sort of experiments are the wild big uglies working on there ah ttomalss said i wondered why you wanted to speak behind the sand dune as it were he sounded more amused than annoyed if the emperor did not tell you why did you think i would you know what his majesty said to me kassquit said slowly i have a good notion of what he said anyhow ttomalss replied you would have rubbed my snout in it had he told you will you not believe that if i had not been the one to bring this to the notice of those in authority here on home i would not be authorized to know of it either what can possibly be as important as that kassquit asked everyone makes it sound as if the sun will go nova tomorrow on account of it anything i say right now would only be speculation on my part ttomalss told her until the physicists have spoken i can tell you nothing until then as a matter of fact there really is nothing to tell kassquit made the negative gesture i would not say that superior sir for instance you could tell me what sort of experiments the physicists are working on ttomalss used the negative gesture too i could but as i say i may not the work is important and it is secret if i were not directly involved in it i repeat that i would be as ignorant as you i wish i were the last four words made kassquit eye him thoughtfully she knew ttomalss better than she knew anyone else alive whatever the wild big uglies have found you do not think we will be able to reproduce it i never said that ttomalss jerked as if shed jabbed a pin under his scales i never said that and i do not say it now you have no right none whatsoever to make such assumptions as was the way of such things the more he protested the more he convinced kassquit she was right she consoled him as best she could whatever they do superior sir is bound to be limited to their own solar system for many years to come the star tosev is a long way away she pointed up into the sky tosev seemed brighter now that was an illusion of course twilight had faded and the sky around the star had grown darker kassquit had had to get used to that too in space the sky was always black what shed intended for consolation seemed to have the opposite effect ttomalss twitched again then he spun and hurried back into the hotel leaving her alone in the darkness outside she couldnt remember the last time hed been so rude he was worried about something all rightsomething to do with the big uglies and their experiments whatever it was kassquit realized she probably wouldnt find out any time soon if ttomalss wouldnt give her the information no one would she thought she was entitled to it if higherups in the race disagreed with her what could she do about it nothing she could see she followed ttomalss back into the hotel he wasnt waiting in the lobby for her hed gone upstairsprobably to report on her curiosity to some of those higherups kassquit shrugged she couldnt do anything about that either ttomalss peered out of his hotel window into the night that was not the ideal way to look at the stars in a crowded town like sitneff there was no ideal way to look at them even for an urban setting pressing your snout against some nonetooclean glass was less than optimal but tosev was bright enough for him to spot in spite of everything just a sparkling point of light strange to think how something that small and lovely could cause so much trouble the psychologist made the negative gesture it wasnt tosevs fault it was that of the annoying creatures infesting the stars third planet if not for them if not for that miserable world tosev would be just another star brighter than most but not bright enough to seem really special if if not but things were as they were one way or another the race was going to have to deal with the big uglies if that meant exterminating them then it did if the race didnt exterminate the big uglies werent the tosevites likely to do it to them first a star moving across the sky but that wasnt a star only a warning light on an airplane it was deep in the red to ttomalss eyes the big uglies might not have been able to see it at all their eyes could sense hues past deep blue but did not reach as far into the red as the races did tosev was a hotter brighter star than the sun tosevites were adapted to its light as the race was adapted to that of the sun hallessi now had names for colors at the red end of the spectrum that the race could not see their star was cooler and redder than the sun let alone tosev with a sorrowful hiss ttomalss looked away from the window the authorities on tosev had put him into cold sleep and sent him back to home to work toward peace with the wild big uglies hed done everything he could toward that end too and what had it got him only the growing certainty that war was on the way hed seen war on tosev and from orbit around the big uglies home world he tried to imagine that coming to the surface of home peace had prevailed here since the planet was unified under the empire for more than a hundred thousand years males and females of the race took it for granted so did rabotevs and hallessi theyd been freed from war since their worlds were brought into the empire but if war was unimaginable to citizens of the empire it was anything but to the big uglies they took it as much for granted as members of the race took peace and because they did responsible members of the race also had to if war came now it would ruin tosev and probably devastate the worlds of the empire what could be worse than that the trouble was ttomalss feared he knew the answer if war came later it might only devastate tosev while ruining the worlds of the empire how fast were the big uglies progressing what did they know that pesskrag and her colleagues were trying so hard to find out even more to the point what did they know that felless and other members of the race on tosev didnt know they knew whatever it was was it enough to tip the balance of power between the empire and the independent tosevites if it wasnt now would it be in a few years in a few hundred years what were the odds would the independent tosevites go to war with one another and not with the race theyd been fighting one another when the conquest fleet arrived since then the race had seemed a bigger threat to them than they had to one another but that wasnt necessarily a permanent condition with the big uglies no condition was necessarily permanent that went a long way toward making them as dangerous as they were so many questions so few answers or maybe the answers were there on tosev but lights laggard speed simply hadnt brought them home yet ttomalss let out another unhappy hiss there were times when he wished felless had never passed on the information shed found the american big uglies had a saying if stupidity is happiness it is foolish to be intelligent that was how it went in the language of the race anyhow ttomalss suspected it lost something in the translation whatever truth it held depended on the status of the first clausewhich suddenly seemed truer to the psychologist than it ever had before ttomalss started to telephone pesskrag then stopped and made the negative gesture he had almost been stupid to say nothing of unintelligent himself the american tosevites had shown they could monitor telephone calls inside the hotel he didnt want them listening to anything he had to say to the physicist he used an emphatic cough by itself which showed how upset he was no he didnt want that at all he rode down to the lobby and then went out into the night his mouth fell open in a laugh he did not have to worry about any of the big uglies sneaking after him they would be as inconspicuous as an azwaca in a temple dedicated to the spirits of emperors past no more soan azwaca at least would belong to this world ttomalss relished being one ordinary male among many ordinary males and females this was where he belonged these other members of the raceeven the occasional less than ordinary ones wearing false hair or wrappingswere his own kind he might have spent many years studying the big uglies but he knew them only intellectually his liver belonged with his own he found a public telephone by a market whose sign boasted it was open all night passersby might hear snatches of his conversation so what though those snatches would mean nothing to them if the tosevites listened to everything he said he made the negative gesture they wouldnt they couldnt not now before he could place the call a skinny female sidled up to him do you want to buy some ginger she asked he made the negative gesture no go away you do not need to get huffy about it do you want to buy me some ginger then you can smell my pheromones and mate with me no go away this time ttomalss used an emphatic cough no go away the female echoed mockingly you can stuff that right on up your cloaca too pal she skittered down the street he found himself quivering with anger ginger was a problem back on tosev certainly that was where the stuff came from so the scope of the problem there wasnt so surprising to get his snout rubbed in it here on home though when hed just stepped away from the hotel for a little while maybe we really ought to slag the big uglies home planet then we would not have to worry about the herb any more or was that a truth wouldnt clever chemists start synthesizing the active ingredient getting rid of the trouble tosevites caused might be even harder than getting rid of the tosevites themselves somehow that seemed altogether fitting to ttomalss his fingerclaws poked in pesskrags number he more than half expected to have to leave a message but the physicists image appeared on the screen she said this is pesskrag i greet you and i greet you this is ttomalss oh hello senior researcher good to hear from you i was just thinking of you not long ago as a matter of fact what can i do for you are you in a place where you can speak without being overheard actually i have had all my calls forwarded here to the laboratory some of my colleagues may hear what i say but without their work i would not be able to tell you nearly so much as i can all right that will do ttomalss was impressed that she was working into the night she recognized how important this research was then good the psychologist said i was wondering if you had gained any better idea of how long it might take to translate these new discoveries into realworld engineering well i still cannot tell you i am certain about that pesskrag answered i presume you are asking based on the notion that speed counts for more than safety and that the usual checks and reviews will be abandoned or ignored yes that is right ttomalss agreed my opinion is that it will still be a matter of years and more of them rather than fewer no one will walk confidently on this sand there will be errors and misfortunes and they will lead to delays i do not see how they can help leading to delays that only proved shed never watched big uglies in action they charged right past errors and misfortunes if those left dead or maimed individuals in their wakewell so what to the tosevites results counted for more than the process used to obtain them asking the race to imitate that sort of behavior was probably useless no it was bound to be useless the race simply did not and could not operate the way the big uglies did most of the time ttomalss thanked the spirits of emperors past for that every once in a while as now it made him want to curse years you say he persisted not centuries i still say it should be centuries pesskrag replied it probably will not be not with everyone pushing for speed at the expense of quality and safety but it should be there are too many variables we do not understand well there are too many variables we do not understand at all very well i thank you ttomalss broke the connection he felt slightly reassured but only slightly whatever the race could do the tosevites were bound to be able to do faster how much faster that much faster he despised the idea of preventive war but all of a sudden he stopped worrying about preventive war that gingerpeddling female was on her way back she had two large unfriendlylooking males with her one of them particularly bizarre with a mane of yellow hair that had never sprouted from his skin ttomalss did not wait to find out if their personalities belied their appearance he left in a hurry hey buddy wait we want to talk to you the male with the wig shouted after him ttomalss didnt wait he was sure the malesand that unpleasant femalewanted to do something to him he was just as sure talking wasnt it he swung one eye turret back toward them to his enormous relief the males werent coming after him the female wasnt relieved at that she was furious she clawed the male with the yellow false hair he knocked her to the sidewalk they started fighting my own people ttomalss thought sadly how are they any better than big uglies when they act like this but the answer to that was plain enough they were his like them or not he understood them he understood them even if they wanted to hit him over the head and steal his valuables if the big uglies hit him over the head and stole his valuables they werent just robbers they were alien robbers which made them a hundred times worse and the big uglies wanted to hit the whole race over the head and steal its valuables things had been peaceful and stable on home for so long it wouldnt last it couldnt last not any more maybe once the tosevites were gone for good peace and stability would return if anything was left of the empire afterwards existence or notthat is the question so some tosevite writer had put it hed been dead for hundreds of years maybe even a thousand ttomalss didnt know as much as he would have liked about tosevite chronology before the conquest fleet came but that big ugly had got right to the liver of things if existence for the race and the empire seemed more likely after a preventive war then preventive war there should be if not not ttomalss feared he knew what the answer was karen yeager nodded politely to trir i greet you she told the tour guide and i greet you trir said also politely the female had acted friendly enough lately it wasnt close to mating season her eye turrets traveled up and down karens length i had thought there might be some future in escorting you tosevites when you come to visit home now i see that is unlikely to be so the hotel lobby was as warm as ever looking out through the big plateglass windows karen could see the sunblasted hills out beyond sitneff despite all that a chill ran through her she hoped she was wrong as she asked what do you mean why that you big uglies probably will not be coming to home any more and that i cannot expect to see shiploads of students and travelers we are going to have to put you in your place or so everyone says trir took the answer for granted more ice walked up karens back who told you that if i may ask and what do you mean by putting us in our place we shall have to make certain you cannot threaten the race and the empire by trirs tone that would be not only simple but bloodless she had lived in peace all her life home had lived in peace since the pleistocene males and females here had no idea what anything else was like karen did for better and for worsemore often than not for worseearths history was different from homes and the races soldiers had played no small part in that history since the conquest fleet arrived you are talking about a war about millionsmore likely billionsdying karen said slowly i ask you again who told you war was coming please tell me it may be important she used an emphatic cough everyone around here except maybe you tosevites seems to think it will come trir replied and i do not think it will be as bad as you make it sound after all it will be happening a long way away you idiot karen didnt scream that at the lizard though she wanted to she contented herself with making the negative gesture instead for one thing war is no better when it happens to someone else than when it happens to you she said though she knew plenty of humans would have felt otherwise for another i must tell you that you are mistaken in what way trir asked this war if there is a war will ravage the empires worlds as well as tosev that is a truth karen added another emphatic cough that would be barbaric trir exclaimed with an emphatic cough of her own why would it be more barbaric than the other karen asked because this is the empire of course trir answered i see karen hoped the lizard could hear the acid dripping from her voice if you do it to someone else who is far away it is fine but it is barbaric if someone else presumes to do it to you right here i did not say that i did not mean that you are confusing things trir said i do not know what you meant only you can know that down deep in the bottom of your liver karen replied but i know what you said i know what i said and i know one other thingi know which of us is confused please believe me i am not the one trirs tailstump quivered with anger i think you have it coming for telling lies if nothing else she stalked away karen felt like throwing something at her that would have been undiplomatic no matter how satisfying it might also have been karen thought hard about flipping trir the bird that would have been undiplomatic too she might have got away with it simply because nobody here was likely to understand what the gesture meant and then in spite of herself she started to laugh could you flip somebody the bird here on home wouldnt you have to flip her or even him the pterodactyl instead however much she wanted it to the laughter wouldnt stick that trir seemed happy war would come was bad enough that she seemed so sure was worse and karen muttered a curse under her breath she hadnt got the guide to tell her who among the lizard higherups was so certain war was on the way did that matter werent all the lizards acting that way these days she knew too well that they were and if they acted that way they were much more likely to bring it on an elevator opened silently and smoothly everything the race did was silent smooth efficient next to the lizards humans were a bunch of noisy clumsy barbarians but if they went down theyd go down swinging and the empire would remember them for a long timeor else go down into blackness with them kassquit came out of the elevator she waved when she saw karen in the lobby she not only waved she came over to her saying i greet you and i greet you karen answered cautiously she and kassquit still didnt usually get along what can i do for you today would kassquit be gloating at the prospect of war too she never got tired of bragging how she was a citizen of the empire as far as karen was concerned that was one of the things that made her less than human she didnt want to be human and wished she werent but now kassquit said if you know any way to keep the peace between your notempire and the empire please speak of it to sam yeager and to fleetlord atvar we must do whatever we can to prevent a war i completely agree with you karen saidand if that wasnt a surprise it was close enough for government work government work is exactly the problem here she thought she went on from my perspective the problem is that the race thinks war would be more to its advantage than peace and how would kassquit take that kassquit used the affirmative gesture truth and a truth i do not know how to get around my superiors are convinced they will have to fight later if they do not fight now and they will be at a greater disadvantage the longer they delay by the spirits of emperors past they must be addled karen wondered if they were humans progressed faster than lizards both sides could see that but if we can destroy each other what difference does it make who has the fancier weapons both sides will be equally dead that is also a truth as usual kassquits face showed nothing but urgency throbbed in her voice under such circumstances war is madness yes karen said the united states has always held this view after its experience when the colonization fleet came to tosev and in the unprovoked attack by the deutsche the empire is not sure that is a truth kassquit said and speaking of unprovoked attacks consider the one your notempire made against the colonization fleet not long after its ships went into orbit around your world if you see a way to seize a victory cheaply and easily will you not take it this is the races fear i do not know what to tell you except that sam yeager is the one who made sure our unjust act would not go unpunished karen said i do not think we would make the same mistake twice and i cannot help seeing that you have just made a strong case for war at least from the empires point of view i know i have making the case for war is easyif one does not reckon in the dangers involved kassquit said my hope is that your notempire has indeed changed from its previous aggressive stance if i can persuade my superiors of thatand if you wild tosevites work to convince them of the same thingwe may possibly avert this fight even now would sam yeager be the american ambassador to the race if we had not changed our ways karen asked sam yeager would not be your ambassador if the doctor had survived kassquit pointed out the doctor was a very able diplomat no one would say otherwise but no one would say he was a shining example of peace and trust either she was right about that if you were in a dicker with the doctor he would have had no qualms about picking your pocket not only that he would have tried to persuade you afterwards that hed done it for your own good that talent had made him very valuable to the united states whether it had made him a paragon of ethics might be a different question do what you can with your own officials karen said i will speak to sam yeager as you say we have to try kassquit used the affirmative gesture they might not like each other but that had nothing to do with anything right now karen rode up to her fatherinlaws room and knocked on the door when he opened it he said you look like a steamroller just ran over your kitten she eyed him you dont look so happy yourself to tell you the truth im not sam yeager said the small stuff is atvar is mad as hops because the race found a rata halfgrown ratin a building a couple of miles from here he keeps trying to make it out to be our fault even though the cleaners let the darn things out a halfgrown rat so theyre breeding here then karen said sure looks that way sam yeager agreed and thats just the small stuff the big stuff is well you know about the big stuff yes i know about the big stuff thats why i wanted to talk to you karen summed up the conversations shed just had with trir and kassquit she went on what can we do we have to be able to do something to convince the lizards this wars not worth fighting somethingbut i dont know what sam yeager let out a long weary sigh if theyre bound and determined to go ahead and fight i dont know what we can do about it but hit back as hard as we can they look to have decided that this is going to be the best chance theyve got he shrugged they may even be right even if they are itll be a disaster karen exclaimed her fatherinlaw nodded i know that i think they know it too if they dont its not because i havent told em but if they think itll be a disaster now but maybe a catastrophe later he spread his hands we dont want a war with them we just dont karen said their attitude is we may not want one now but were a bunch of changeable big uglies and sooner or later we will sam yeager said i dont know how to convince them theyre wrong either and id better if i cant kassquit is trying the same thing on their side karen wasnt used to talking about kassquit with unreserved approvalor with any approval at allbut she did now good for her i hope it helps some but i wouldnt bet the house on it sam yeager said i hope something helps some if it doesnt he paused again and grimaced if it doesnt well have a war on our hands we can see its madness kassquit can see its madness the lizards are usually more reasonable than we are why not now karen could hear the despair in her voice its what i told you before they must think this is their best chance or maybe their last chance it doesnt look that way to me but im not atvar or the emperor sam yeagers scowl grew blacker im just a scared old man if something big doesnt change in a hurry four worlds are going to go up in smoke in the control room these days glen johnson felt more as if he were in a missilearmed upper stage in earth orbit or even in the cockpit of a fighter heading for action against the lizards anything could happen and probably would he knew damn well that the race could overwhelm the admiral peary his job and the job of everybody else on board was to make sure they remembered theyd been in a fight the ship had a swarm of antimissiles that were supposed to be a hair better than the best the race could fire she also had closein weapons systemsa fancy name for radarcontrolled gatling guns on steroidsto knock out anything the antimissiles missed put that together and it wouldnt keep the admiral peary alive it wasnt supposed to but it was supposed to keep her alive long enough to let her get her own licks in what do you think johnson asked mickey flynn are we ready for armageddon flynn gave that his usual grave consideration i cant say for sure he replied at last but i do know that armageddon sick and tired of worrying about it johnson groaned as he was no doubt intended to do mickey flynn looked back blandly johnson was sick of worrying about it too which didnt mean he wasnt doing his share and then some what do we do if the balloon goes up he said this time flynn answered right away well it will be over in a hurry anyhow that was what the lizards would have called a truth by the way he said it he thought johnson was a damn fool for asking the question after only a short pause johnson decided hed been a damn fool too in the background was the radio chatter among the lizards spaceships and orbiting stations and shuttlecraft johnson didnt know how much good monitoring that would do nobody was likely to give the attack order in clear language it would be encrypted so the americans wouldnt realize what it was till things hit the fan even so the traffic was often fun to listen to lizardsand the occasional rabotevs and hallessibickered among themselves hardly less than humans did their insults revolved around rotten eggs and cloacas rather than genitals but they used them with panache all at once everything stopped for about fifteen seconds the radio waves might have been wiped clean what the hell johnson said in mingled surprise and alarm he and mickey flynn had been talking about armageddon had they just listened to the overture for it but then the lizards returned to the air everybody was saying the same things what is that do you see that where did that come from how did that get there what could it be flynn pointed to the radar it showed a blip that johnson would have sworn hadnt been there before about two million miles out from home and closing rapidly what have we got here johnson said unconsciously echoing the lizards all around the admiral peary looks like it popped out of thin air thinner vacuum flynn said and johnson noddedthe other pilot was right the lizards started sending messages toward the blip strange ship identify yourself strange ship please begin communication and another one surely transmitted by a worried member of the race strange ship do you understand do you speak our language speedoflight lag for a message to get to the strange shipwhere the devil had it come from out of nowhere and an answer to come back was about twentyone and a half seconds that of course assumed the answerer started talking the instant heshe it heard the lizards which was bound to be optimistic do you think we ought to send something too johnson asked mickey flynn was senior to him it was flynns baby not his the other pilot shook his head johnson waved to show he accepted the decision he found a different question do you think its a good thing were at top alert just as solemnly flynn nodded close to a minute went by before the strange ship responded when it did the answer was in the lizards language we greet you males and females of the race the individual at the microphone had a mushy accent even as johnson realized it was a human accent the speaker went on this is the starship commodore perry from the united states of america we greet you citizens of the empire and we also greet or hope we greet our own citizens aboard the admiral peary johnson and flynn both stabbed for the transmit button at the same time johnsons finger came down on it first that was his only moment of triumph flynn as senior did the talking this is the admiral peary colonel flynn speaking very good to have company weve been out here by ourselves for a long time again there was a necessary wait for radio waves to travel from ship to ship during it johnson wondered whats in a name the admiral peary recalled an explorer whod pitted himself against nature and won the commodore perry was named for the man whod gone to japan with warships and opened the country to the outside world no matter what the japanese thought about it the lizards might not notice the difference especially since peary and perry were pronounced alike even if spelled differently but johnson did what did it mean this time the person at the radioa womanreplied in english hello colonel flynn good to hear from you im major nicholsnicole to my friends we were hoping wed find you folks here but we werent sure because of course your signals from home hadnt got back to earth when we set out i hope youve been picking up some of them as you followed our trail from earth to home flynn said and if you dont mind my asking when did you set out that was a good question here on the admiral peary johnson didnt feel like too much of an antique even if he had been in cold sleep longer than most but these whippersnappers might not even have been born when dr blanchard put him on ice how much of an antique would he seem to them do i really want to know he had time to wonder about that again then major nichols voice came back about five and a half weeks ago colonel mickey flynn drummed his fingers on his thigh in annoyance one of the few times johnson had ever seen him show it five and a half weeks subjective time sure but how long were you in cold sleep flynn asked johnson nodded another good question if the commodore perry was still slower than lizard starships that said one thing if she matched their technology that said something elsesomething important too and if she was faster even a little bit the wait for radio waves to go back and forth felt maddening after what seemed like a very long time major nichols answered no colonel no cold sleepnone total travel time five and a half weeks thereve been some changes made johnson and flynn stared at each other they both mouthed the same thing jesus christ the lizards were bound to have somebody who understood english monitoring the transmission the second that translator figured out what major nichols had just said the race was going to start having kittens or possibly hatchling befflem johnson pointed to the microphone and raised an eyebrow flynn gave back a gracious nod as if to say be my guest this is colonel johnson junior pilot on the admiral peary johnson said feeling much more senior than junior i hope you brought along some proof of that it would be really useful things are a little tense between us and the race right now he almost added an emphatic cough but held back when he realized he didnt know how people of major nichols generation would take that after sending the message he turned to mickey flynn now we twiddle our thumbs while things go back and forth flynn suited action to word he said why dont they have fasterthanlight radio his thumbs went round and round round and round they do in effect johnson said theyve got the shipsif those are what they say they are einstein must be spinning in his grave colonel johnson the voice of the woman from the commodore perry filled the control room again yes we have proofall sorts of things that we know and the race will hear about as its signals come in from earth over the next few days and weeks and we have a couple of witnesses from the race aboard a shuttlecraft pilot named nesseref and shiplord straha oh my johnson said even imperturbable mickey flynn looked a trifle walleyed straha had lived in exile in the usa for years hed been the thirdhighest officer in the conquest fleet and then the highestranking defector after his effort to oust atvar for not prosecuting the war against humanity vigorously enough failed and hed got back into the lizards good graces by delivering the data from sam yeager that showed the united states had launched the attack on the colonization fleet id like to be a fly on the wall when straha meets atvar again flynn said admiral peary do you read me major nichols asked are you there where else would we be flynn asked reasonably ah forgive me for asking major but is the commodore perry armed that is affirmative nicole nichols said we are armed she used an emphatic cough which answered that we did not know for certain that you had arrived when we departed and we did not know what kind of reception we would get when we entered this solar system can you please summarize the present political situation i do believe i would describe it as a mess flynn said a word that summed things up as well as any other for glen johnson flynn went on youll need more details than that i can put you through to lieutenant general healey our commandant and he can patch you through to sam yeager our ambassador that produced a pause a good deal longer than required by speedoflight sam yeager is your ambassador where is the doctor major nichols asked she used interrogative coughs too they couldnt revive him from cold sleep flynn said i see how unfortunate major nichols said well yes please arrange the transfer colonel if youd be so kind whoever the man on the spot has been well have to deal through him flynn fiddled with the communications controls lieutenant general healey said its about time i get to speak for myself colonel whatever he said after that he said to major nichols johnson and flynn shared a look if the commandant hadnt liked what the pilots were saying he could have interrupted them whenever he pleased but what really pleased him was complaining five and a half weeks from earth to home five and a half weeks we can go back johnson said dizzily maybe we can go back flynn said if its not weightless aboard the commodore perry i wouldnt want to try it johnson said something of a barnyard nature that hadnt occurred to him i wonder how they did it he said and then i wonder whether id get it if they told me would his own greatgrandfather have understood radio and airplanes he doubted it understood or not though the commodore perry was there the lizards were still trying to call it a rising note of panic in their voices one of them must have figured out what major nichols had said and how would they like that atvar awaited the shuttlecraft descending from orbit around home with a sinking feeling in his liver he made the negative gesture no that wasnt true as a matter of fact his liver felt as if it had already sunk all the way down to his toeclaws even in his wildest nightmares he had never imagined a day like this might come and straha had of all the males of the race the americans might have picked to rub atvars snout in his own failings straha was the prize example did they know that atvar laughed bitterly of course they did they had to faster than light the big uglies could travel faster than light the race had decided that was impossible even before home was unified and hadnt worried much about it since some tosevite physicist had come to the same conclusion and the big uglies had believed him while atvar was on tosev anyhow unlike the race the tosevites had kept worrying at the idea though the race had got a scent of some of their earliest experiments but yes but atvar thought bitterly the difference between what the race had and what the big uglies had was the difference between a scent and the beast it came from and the big uglies beast was a starship now what the fleetlord wondered blasting the commodore perry would have been temptingif another american starship might not be only days behind might escape and might bring word of war back to the united states long before the races colony on tosev could hope to hear about it that was a recipe for disaster preventive war seemed to have gone up in smoke too late too late too late again how could you hope to attack someone who knew the bite was coming long before your teeth sank inand who could bite you whenever he pleased home at least could defend itself what about rabotev and halless if the big uglies wanted to they could smash the empires other worlds before home warned them they might be in danger too late too late too late the words tolled again like a mournful gong inside atvars head after a moment he realized not all that noise was internal some came through his hearing diaphragms the terminal at the shuttlecraft port was efficiently soundproofed all the same the braking rockets roar penetrated the insulating material and filled the building the windows facing the firescarred landing field were tinted even so nictitating membranes flicked across atvars eyes to protect them from the glare the shuttlecraft settled smoothly onto the concrete crashes were vanishingly rare computer control made sure of that atvar wouldnt have minded seeing one of those rare rare accidents now no he wouldnt have minded a bit watching straha cook didnt happen the shuttlecrafts braking rockets cut off silence returned to the terminal atvar didnt quite let out a disappointed hiss he hadnt really hoped the shuttlecraft would crashor if he had he hadnt really expected it to down came the landing ladder the female who descended first wore the body paint of a shuttlecraft pilot that would not be the pilot of this craft but nesseref the traveler from tosev behind her came a male of about atvars years straha had at least not had the effrontery to wear a shiplords body paint but rather the much plainer colors of an author last off the shuttlecraft was the halless whod brought it down from the commodore perry atvar forgot about the halless right away his attention was all on the newly arrived members of the race guards surrounded them and escorted them into the terminal straha said something to one of them her mouth fell open in a laugh straha had always been charming that made atvar like him no better nesseref bent into the posture of respect as soon as she saw atvar i greet you exalted fleetlord she said and i greet you he replied as she rose hello atvar straha said well now we knowit could not have turned out worse if i had been in charge he added a sarcastic emphatic cough atvars fingerclaws started to shape the threat gesture one male used against another in the mating season he forced them to relax it wasnt easy neither was keeping his tone light as he answered oh i am not so sure of that you might have lost the war against the big uglies instead of managing a draw then we could have had this to worry about even sooner straha glared at him do not project your incompetence onto me i do not need to atvar said you have plenty of your own excuse me superior sirs nesseref said but quarreling among yourselves will not help solve the problem the race faces neither will not quarreling among ourselves straha replied and quarreling is much more fun no the shuttlecraft pilot speaks truth atvar said i thank you shuttlecraft pilot i need to know first of all how you are certain of the big uglies claims about the speed of their starship we were conscious throughout the flight nesseref said could you not have been drugged while asleep put into cold sleep and then revived the same way atvar knew he was desperately searching for any escape from the races predicament nesseref made the negative gesture i do not believe so exalted fleetlord forget it atvar straha said for one thing the big uglies already have word of things that will just be reaching home now even as we speak researchers here will be corroborating what they say for another when they go back to tosev they are willing to take more members of the race along and then return them to home they are not willing to let them communicate with the colonists in any way for fear you might do something foolish like order an attack but if the males and females get there and come back here in something less than a large number of years that should convince even the stubbornestperhaps even you atvar had not thought his liver could sink any lower he discovered he was mistaken strahas sarcasm did not bother him he and straha had despised each other for many years each occasionally had to respect the others competence but that did not and would not make them friends but the message about the american tosevites confidence that straha delivered was daunting they not only had this technique they were sure it worked well how do they do it atvar asked how do they do it neither one of us is a physicist straha said nesseref made the affirmative gesture straha went on they talk about doing things with spacetime strings about maneuvering or maybe manipulating them so that points normally distant come into contact with each other what this means or to tell you the truth whether this means anything is not for me to say here i agree with the shiplord nesseref said they are very glib as big uglies often are but whether they told us these things to inform us or to mislead us i am in no position to judge i see atvar thought about telling them that the races physicists had begun work that might eventually let them catch up with the big ugliesassuming the big uglies hadnt moved on still further by then which was not necessarily a good bet he started to yes but his tongue did not flutter nesseref and straha might blab to the tosevites they might be monitored by the tosevites who could guess how far the tosevites electronics had come these days better to keep quiet how is this world these days straha asked he then answered his own question which was very much in character not much different or i miss my guess in most ways no that is as it should be in my opinion atvar said but you will see some things you would not have before you left young males and females wearing false hair for instance and some of them even wearing wrappings really is that a truth straha laughed so just as the big uglies on tosev have imitated us we have also begun to imitate them i had not thought we possessed even so much imagination as a species the young are always unfathomable atvar did not mean it as a compliment they think the same of us do you not remember when you could hardly wait for the old fools ahead of you to hop on the funeral pyre so you could hatch the egg of the world it was all out there waiting for you and you wanted to grab with all ten fingerclaws is that a truth or is it not that is some of a truth atvar answered i do not believe i was ever quite so vain as you show yourself to be but i have long since suspected as much straha irked him by laughing instead of getting angry you are still as stuffy as you always were i see well much good it has done you this did not happen while i was in charge on tosev no one can blame me for this the ministers here on home decided reffet would do better on tosev than i could atvar said that only shows how much they knew well yes straha made the affirmative gesture next to reffet you are a genius this is not necessarily praise you understand next to reffet a beffel smashed on the highway is also a genius that startled a laugh out of atvar whose opinion of the fleetlord of the colonization fleet was not high either straha went on you should have seen him when he learned of the commodore perry he acted as if he wanted nothing more than to crawl back into his eggshell that would be the best thing for him if anyone wants to know what i think nesseref said if anyone wants to know what i think the best thing for the race would be to stop all this vituperation and backbiting we will have enough trouble catching up with the big uglies without that no doubt you are a wise female straha said but then he spoiled it by adding but you take a great deal of the enjoyment out of life we have to catch up with the big uglies and quickly atvar used an emphatic cough if we do not we are at their mercy straha broke in with a certain oppressive relish do you suppose they might be interested in revenge for what the conquest fleet did to them superior sir you are not making this situation any better nesseref scolded truth i cannot make it better not now no one can do that except possibly our physicists and they have not done anything along these lines in the past hundred thousand years straha seemed to delight in pointing out unpleasant truths all i can do is bear witness to what the big uglies have done the same way as you are at that i think i am more than good enough i will bring you both to a hotel near the one where the american big uglies are staying atvar said why not to that hotel itself straha asked it will be good to see sam yeager again a male of sense and a male of integritythe combination is too rare i will not take you to that hotel itself because the american tosevites can electronically monitor too much of what goes on inside atvar answered unhappily well i cannot say that i am surprised straha said even when their first starship set out they were even or ahead of us in most electronics that should have been a warning they are further ahead of us now i thank you for your encouragement atvar still had sarcasm as a weapon against straha but what weapons did he have now against the big uglies none that he could see ttomalss met pesskrag at an eatery not far from the hotel where the wild big uglies dwelt he hadnt been accosted going out to make the telephone call to invite her here as he had the last time hed tried speaking to her from a public phone so far as he knew the american tosevites had no idea this place existed which meant they couldnt monitor it i greet you ttomalss said when pesskrag sat down across from him in the booth and i greet you pesskrag answered this is such an exciting time in which to have come out of the egg she used an emphatic cough and i owe you an apology senior researcher i did not believe what you told me about the big uglies relentless drive i was mistaken they must be all you claimed and more a server came up and gave them both printouts of choices adding we also have a special on zisuili ribs in a sauce of peffeg and other southern spices you will enjoy it if you care for something that makes your tongue sit up and take notice that will do very well ttomalss said pesskrag made the affirmative gesture ttomalss just wanted to get the server out from under his scales sometimes such individuals made too much of themselves this male mercifully gathered up the printouts and went away pesskrag kept on gushing about the tosevites they went from experiment to theory to engineering in the flick of a nictitating membrane we would never have been so impetuousnever i tell you we are going to have to be ttomalss said the military advantage this gives them is truly appalling until our signals reach tosev we are at their mercy they have years to organize defenses against us and prepare their own surprise attack rabotev and halless would never know what hit them even home is vulnerable though less so than it was before the admiral peary arrived these are truths senior researcher i cannot deny it pesskrag said but this news holds other truths too these ships open much of this arm of the galaxy to colonization at the moment they open it to tosevite colonization ttomalss said how long will we need to get such ships of our own the physicists eye turrets swung up toward the ceiling as she calculated her tongue flicked in and out after a bit she said now that we know it can be done i would estimate somewhere between fifty and a hundred years a pained hiss escaped ttomalss that wasnt far from what hed thought himself hed hoped pesskrag would tell him he was wrong not sooner he said this is a very long time for the big uglies to have the capability while we do not if we have to do the research and the engineering that is my best guess pesskrag said i know the big uglies did it faster but we are not big uglies trutha truth that delights me most of the time here though it could spell the end of us ttomalss paused wait you say if we do these things it will take about this long what else can we do before pesskrag could answer the server brought their meals he had not been lying the sauce that coated ttomalss zisuili ribs stung his tongue he drank water to help quench the fire then ate some more the midday meal was not a gourmets delight but it was good enough of its kind that sufficed his mind wasnt fully on it anyhow after stripping the meat from a large rib with teeth and tongue pesskrag said we could save a lot of time by buying a ship from the big uglies or at least acquiring some of the engineering knowhow from them copying is faster than creating ttomalss stared at her that was also a truth and a profound one the tosevites had caught up with the race by imitatingstealingtechnology from the conquest fleet of course then the big uglies had proceeded to jump past their former mentors could the race return the favor or would the empire live forever in the tosevites rapidly spreading shadow there is one obvious problem ttomalss said pesskrag started eating another rib but gestured for him to go on he did it is not in the big uglies interest to sell us this technology the longer they have it and we do not the greater their advantage i cannot disagree with you pesskrag said but some individual tosevites are bound to be corrupt we can afford enormous rewards for information and if we cannot openly buy these secrets perhaps we can steal them perhaps we can ttomalss said you may well be right we have to try i still marvel that the big uglies made these experiments in the first place pesskrag said we had a hundred thousand years in which to try them and we never did we were convinced we knew everything worth knowing and content with what we had big uglies are never content never ttomalss said discontent is their salient characteristic this has proved to be to their advantage pesskrag observed i do not deny it i could not could i ttomalss replied do you truly understand how they have done what they have done if i truly understood it i would be able to duplicate it myself the physicist said i cannot do that senior researcher at present anyone who tells you he or she fully understands how the big uglies did this is either an optimist or a liar i think my colleagues and i do begin to grasp the theory behind what they have done begin to i stress she used an emphatic cough i remain convinced that this is a useful first step no doubt ttomalss said pesskrag finished the second rib and began on a third ttomalss wished his appetite were as good a tosevite proverb floated through his mind the condemned male ate a hearty meal he wasnt condemned himself but all the race might be he started to say something then had to lean back in a hurry as pesskrag used the new rib like a lecturers pointer and almost got sauce on his snout oh excuse me the female said but i just thought of something else before long i fear charlatans and maniacs will start crawling out from under every flat stone they will all be shouting that they know how to travel faster than light they will show us how if we transfer some large sum to their credit balance or if we name them prime minister or if the emperor balances an egg on the end of his snout an egg ttomalss said confused these males and females will be addled just about all of them will either be addled or frauds pesskrag explained but we will have to investigate at least some of their claims for fear of missing something profoundly important i see ttomalss made the affirmative gesture i think i see anyhow there will also be some who travel on the opposite side of the road did you see professor kralks memorandum in which she states that the big uglies must be frauds because fasterthanlight travel is an obvious impossibility oh yes i saw it it would be pathetic if it were not so sad pesskrag said kralk asserts this even though the signals from tosev are confirming in detail what the big uglies aboard the commodore perry said they would say pesskrag sighed it is too bad kralk was a sound female when she was younger to be unwilling to change theory without justification is the mark of a scientist to be unwilling to change theory even when there is abundant justification is the mark of someone whose thought processes have ossified they went their separate ways then pesskrag back to the laboratory to go on chasing the big uglies and ttomalss back to the hotel to report to atvar on what he had learned from the physicist a young male wearing a wig of a greenish yellow like no tosevites real hair tried to sell him ginger he snarled his rejection so fiercely he frightened the petty criminal can we change he wondered or have all our processes become ossified we are going to find out that is certain he didnt talk to atvar inside the hotel again they feared the wild big uglies might be able to listen to what they said they went over to the park where sam yeager liked to visit in the early morning or the late afternoon they sat in the sunshine not in the shade also for fear the american ambassador might have planted little electronic hearing diaphragms wherever he went that was probably close to a delusion of persecution considering what had just happened to the race though was any worry about the big uglies abilities really delusional ttomalss feared it wasnt he told atvar what pesskrag had told him the fleetlord hissed in dismay we cannot afford to wait so long the tosevites will not wait for us the other alternative as pesskrag suggested involves bribery and espionage ttomalss said it may well prove quicker as she said but it is far less certain nothing is certain any more atvar said sadly nothing ttomalss understood how he felt the empire was built on certainty and stability it had been for as long as it existed now all of that was likely to fly away like a swarm of startled evening sevod we should never have sent the conquest fleet to tosev the psychologist said this same thought has occurred to me atvar answered but who knows whether things would have turned out better or worse if we had waited longer the big uglies might have come upon us and caught us unawares that would have been even worse than this i will tell you what we should have done what is that ttomalss asked as far as i can see all of our choices were bad what we should have done when our probe showed tosev to be inhabited was send the conquest fleet at once the big uglies really were primitives and savages then we could have easily subdued them and we would not have had to worry about any of this unless they rebelled after becoming part of the empire and acquiring our technology said ttomalss who no longer had any faith in the races ability to deal with the tosevites atvar only shrugged yes i have already heard this possibility mentioned but i still believe doing that would have given us our best chance instead we delayedand the results of that are as we now see so they are ttomalss replied until we develop this technology for ourselves we are at their mercy exactly the fleetlord made the affirmative gesture i wonder if our best course might not be to fight the war anyway but they would intercept our order they would know about it years before our colony on tosev learned of it would that not be a disaster atvar sighed probably but what do we have now a disaster of a different sort we might have to sacrifice the colony we would sacrifice the rabotevs and the hallessi too and who knows what the big uglies could do to home itself ttomalss said the fleetlord sighed again i suppose you are right a war would have a certain finality to it though this way we shall have to live with a difficult dangerous ambiguous future with no guarantee that war worse war does not lie ahead anyone who has been to tosev knows that life is different dangerous and ambiguous more often than not ttomalss said and atvar made the affirmative gesture again major nicole nichols was about the cutest little thing sam yeager had ever seen she was just past thirty which struck him as young for a major but the commodore perry was bound to be full of hotshots she was a lightskinned black woman with a bright smile flashing eyes and a shape he would have expected to see on a professional dancer not a us air and space force officer shed come down to sitneff in the commodore perry s own shuttlecraft the lizards were too rattled to refuse permission for that theyd contented themselves with surrounding the shuttlecraft port with police and guards if that shuttle was packed with ginger smugglers would have a devil of a time getting to it unless some of the guards proved venal which wasnt impossible major nichols was also all business she heard yeagers summary of what had gone on since the admiral peary reached home then nodded briskly we tried to get our ship built in time to get here before you but it didnt quite happen she said and shrugged as if to say it couldnt be helped that would have been awful sam exclaimed wed have revived and found out we were nothing but an afterthought yes but we would have been in reasonably close touch with earth which you werent the major answered that plainly counted for more with her she eyed him as if he were a museum exhibit to her he probably was and he wasnt even the right museum exhibit for she went on meaning no offense but you do understand wed expected to be dealing with the doctor oh sure he nodded and im not offended i expected the same thing but when he didnt wake upsam shruggedthe lizards knew i was along and they asked for me to represent the united states ive done the best job i know how to do no one has said anything different major nichols assured him for a moment he took that as a compliment then he realized it meant the people from the commodore perry had been checking up on him he supposed they would have checked on the doctor too but probably not quite in the same way he said youre going to replace me arent you that was the plan major nichols answered someone who knows how things are now back on earth has an advantage over you im sure youve kept up with our broadcasts as best you could but that still leaves you more than ten years behind the times she spoke oddly her rhythm was different from what sam was used to and she used far more words and constructions from the races language as if they were english by the way she used them they were english to her i know as you say it cant be helped sam smiled im looking forward to finding out what the united states is like these days something changed in the majors face that may be a little more complicated than youd think sir yeager raised an eyebrow oh major nichols nodded sam said well maybe youd better tell me about it then if she were a man he would have said kiss me cause i think youre gonna screw me being of the female persuasion though she might not have taken that the right way this is more complicated than we thought it would be she repeated you have to understand our instructions about you assumed you would be acting as the doctors assistant and adviser not that you would be ambassador yourself okay i understand that its simple enough sam said so what were these instructions that were based on that assumption that you were to stay here and continue to act as assistant and adviser to the doctors successor major nichols answered i see sam said slowly and if i didnt want to do that i wasnt born yesterday you know even if you dont count cold sleep i was thinking i would enjoy retirement im still thinking that as a matter of fact the major looked unhappy sir theres no polite friendly way to tell you this you are to be discouraged from coming back to earth am i sam said tonelessly well i dont have to be an einstein to figure out why do i his voice went harsh and flat you probably dont she agreed youre not remembered kindly in certain circles in the us government people who tell the truth often arent sam said thats what i did major thats what my crime was back before you were born i told the truth theyve rebuilt indianapolis major nichols said she went on i have cousins there ive been to earl warren park the memorial to the people who died is very touching president warren himself had died by his own hand when word of his role in the attack came out sam made the affirmative gesture he spoke in the language of the race where is the monument to those our notempire wantonly destroyed do they not deserve some commemoration she went right on speaking english its because you say this kind of thing that some people thought you might be more comfortable staying here than coming back to the united states some people sam echoed that with an odd sour relish i know what kind of people toothe kind who think anybody who doesnt believe all the same things they do isnt a real american well i happen to think i am whether they like it or not major nichols didnt answer that right away she studied yeager instead he had no idea what was going on behind her eyes whatever she thought she kept to herself he wouldnt have wanted to play poker against her she would have taken the shirt off his back at last she said youre not what my briefings made me think you were going to be no horns he said no tail no fangs thats for sureive only got four of my own choppers lost the rest more than a hundred years ago if you add cold sleep into it they can do something about that now they have what they call dental implants she told him they go into your jawbone and theyre just about as good as real teeth to tell you the truth i hardly remember what real teeth are like sam said ive gone without em since i was a kid human teeth amazed and horrified the lizards they couldnt imagine why evolution made people go through life with only two sets like smalll lizards on earth they replaced theirs continuously throughout their lives and then sam smiled sourly at the major from the commodore perry besides what difference does it make you just said youre not going to let me go back to earth anyway didnt you she flushed her skin wasnt dark enough to hide it in a small voice she said me and my big mouth you and your big mouth he agreed look tell me something i want to know for a change will you how are my grandchildren do i have greatgrandchildren yet greatgreat and how are mickey and donald getting along one of your grandsonsrichardis at stanford university heading the interspecies studies department there major nichols said the otherbruceruns a company that arranges cultural exchanges with the lizards theyre both well or they were when we left you have five greatgrandchildrenthree boys and two girlsall told and two greatgreatgranddaughters bruce is divorced richard had a brief failed marriage then remarried and has stayed that way for almost thirty years lord sam said softly jonathans boys had been kids when he went into cold sleep theyd been in college when jonathan and karen went on ice it sounded as if theyd done pretty well for themselves since by the way their bodies felt theyd be older than their parents if that wasnt bizarre sam didnt know what would be and what about mickey and donald mickey is working with your grandson bruce the major said he recently published his autobiography he called it between two worlds he wrote it in english it did well in the united states and even better in translation with the lizards the translation is probably on its way here now at speedoflight theres talk of movie versions from hollywood and from the race wow sam said thats not half badbetter than i expected to tell you the truth since he had two strikes against him the minute he hatched what about donald you didnt say anything about him is he all right if its bad news for gods sake spit it out dont try to sugarcoat it donald nicole nichols hesitated again again sam had trouble reading her face was that amusement sparking somewhere deep in her eyes he thought so but he couldnt be sure she said the past five years donald has hosted something called youd better believe it its the highestrated game show in the usa and canada i wouldnt want to say whether its the bestmy tastes dont really run in that directionbut it has to be the most spectacular and donald without a doubt is the most spectacular thing in it sam stared then he started to laugh then he started to howl donald had always been the more outgoing little lizard now he wasnt a little lizard any more and he was evidently more outgoing than sam had ever imagined ill be a son of a gun he said he still felt funny about swearing in front of a woman even if she was a major too should i want to shake his hand or horsewhip him thats not for me to say major nichols answered we ought to have a disk with some of the shows on it aboard the ship they knew you and your son and daughterinlaw would want to see it well good sam said thats something anyhow once i see the shows i wouldnt mind going back and telling him what i think of them my grandsons and mickey probably have a lot to teach me too major nichols face froze back into a perfect unreadable mask shed acted amazingly lifelike there for a little while when she was talking about sams family by blood and adoption no more she said as i told you sir that isnt in our present plans im sorry ill bet sam thought once upon a time i read a story called the man without a country he said darn good story seems as if im in that boat now except the fellow in the story didnt want his country but it looks like my country doesnt want me im sorry nicole nichols said again a polite meaningless phrase in fact the united states is grateful for everything you and the rest of the crew of the admiral peary have done here on home just not grateful enough to want me back sam didnt bother trying to hide his bitterness circumstances are not just what we thought theyd be when we got our orders she said maybe the commandant will see that as justification for changing them i must tell you though i doubt it and i certainly dont have the authority to do so if you will excuse me sir she left his room before he could say whether he excused her or not he stared around the place live here or somewhere much like here for the rest of his life live here while other humans zipped back and forth between the stars had any man ever had a crueler prison karen yeager slid the skelkwank disk into the player disk and player had been manufactured more than ten lightyears apart by two different species but the one fit perfectly into the other humans had borrowed the lizards standards along with their technology a lot of what they made was interchangeable with what theyd taken from the race this ought to be fun jonathan said this ought to be terrible sam yeager said a gameshow host my god why didnt donald just go out and start robbing banks ill tell you what i want to see karen said i want to see what the clothes and the hairstyles look like weve been out of touch for a long time well be a bunch of frumps when we do get home melanie blanchard said then she shrugged we would have been even worse frumps if wed gone back in cold sleep all the americans from the admiral peary crowded into karen and jonathans room to watch the disk of youd better believe it the ice cubes karen was so proud of were chilling a lot of lizardstyle vodka frank coffey said at least we got here by god we were awake and doing our jobs when the commodore perry came in there are bound to be ships behind us full of people in cold sleep what theyll think when they wake up he shook his head little bit of a surprise sam yeager said he seemed subdued he was drinking more than karen would have expected too or am i just imagining things she wondered she didnt want to ask if anything was wrong not there in front of everybody her fatherinlaw had almost as strong a sense of privacy as a cat instead karen said shall i fire it up yeah do it tom de la rosa raised his glass in salute lets see what we came all these lightyears to escape everybody laughed play karen said in the races language that was one difference between local machines and those back on earth these didnt understand english they didnt always understand a human accent either this time though the disk started spinning music swelled it sounded raucous and tinny to karen but what she listened to would have sounded the same to her grandparents the computer graphics for the opening credits were at least as smooth and at least as fancy as anything the lizards used sam yeager looked impressed that hadnt happened when he went into cold sleep in by the time karen did seventeen years later people had pretty much caught up and now the announcer said in the slightly greasy tones of announcers everywhere and everywhen here are the lovely rita and donald and youd better believe it the audience applauded frantically the lovely rita strutted out onto the stage she was lovely a statuesque brunette with a profile to die for karen though didnt think her husband or any of the other american males in the audience was paying attention to ritas profile the sparkling gown she wore trailed behind her on the floor but was cut minoanstyle on top holy jesus tom said howd you like to put makeup there id like it fine frank coffey said the guys bayed goatish laughter karen wanted to kick jonathan he hadnt said a word but he was paying close attention to the screen when the camera went to the studio audience for a moment karen saw about half the younger women were topless some of them wore lizardstyle body paint some didnt that had been coming in karens time but it hadnt got there yet plainly it had now back to rita she flashed a millionwatt smile now folks she said heeeeeres donald he bounded out to center stage the audience went nuts all the americans in the room in sitneff started howling with glee donald was wearing a tuxedoa paintedon tuxedo perfect right down to the redcarnation boutonniere even his hands had been painted to make them seem a caucasiansthough not a whole lot of caucasians had fingerclaws hello people he said energy came off him in waves welcome to another session of youd better believe it the audience shouted they applauded themselves thats right donald couldnt grinhis mouth wasnt made for it but he gave the impression that he was grinning he was a performer right down to the tip of his tailstump now were going to find out how much tonights contestants dont knowand how much theyll pay for it it was a throwaway line the studio audience broke up anyway karen felt herself smiling too she couldnt help it donald pulled a smile out of her the way a magician pulled a rabbit out of a hat she looked around the room she wasnt the only one smiling donald had even managed to distract the men from the lovely rita if that didnt prove he had what it took nothing ever would out came the first contestant a short dumpy grayhaired woman from great falls montana donald contrived to grin at her too hello mrs donahue he said whats your excuse for being here with us tonight exhibitionism or just greed mrs donahue blushed a little of both maybe she said youd better believe it the audience roared she had to know that was coming but she flinched anyway well here we go donald said why dont you climb into the hot seat and well give you a whirl the hot seat had a seat belt karen rapidly discovered why donald had meant that whirl literally the seat could spin on all three axes it could also give electric shocks and do a wide variety of other unpleasant things mrs donahue had to answer questions while the chair and some really horrible sound effects discombobulated her not surprisingly she didnt cover herself with glory too bad donald said when her ordeal was over no allexpensepaid trip to the moon for you im afraid but you do have the new refrigerator and five hundred dollars in cash so this didnt turn out too bad after all youd better believe it mrs donahue said gamely and the audience gave her a big hand later on a young man did win a trip to the moon and just about passed out from excitement back on earth going to the moon evidently still wasnt something people did every day here from the tau ceti system it didnt seem quite such a big deal karen glanced over at sam yeager hed been to the moon hed had a photo on his wall to prove it karen never had if you lived in southern california going to home and not the moon was like going to madagascar without ever visiting long beach at the end of the show donalds eye turrets followed the lovely ritas visible assets as if he were a human male with some special girlwatching equipment then one of them swiveled back toward the camera for a moment i know the real reasonreasonsyou watch you crazy people out there you cant fool me well see you tomorrowand youll see us too so long the screen went dark pause karen said in the races language for a wonder the player listened to her twice running she went back to english do we really want to watch another episode right away if its got rita in it ill watch it tom said linda planted a good solid elbow in his ribs he yelped overactingbut he didnt overact half as much as donald did well sam yeager said its nice to know hes making an honest living you call that honest jonathan asked hes paying his own bills the older man answered if thats the most popular game show in the country hes probably making money hand over fist of course if thats the most popular game show in the country its probably a judgment on us all but thats a different story but its not illegal no matter what else you can say about it i think weve got the idea of what he does frank coffey said i wouldnt mind leering at rita some morejust dont tell kassquit about itbut it can wait ritas a knockout and donalds pretty damn funny but the show he shuddered and knocked back his drink then he walked out of the room karen wondered if he realized he was whistling the theme song from youd better believe it the de la rosas and dr blanchard also left sam yeager got up too but only to fix himself another drink whats up dad jonathan askedhed noticed something was out of kilter too then youre not just down in the dumps because donalds making a buffoon of himself on national tv you were low before we got the disk now that you mention ityes his father said he stared down at the glass in his hand as if expecting to find the answer there karen had never seen him do that before it alarmed her after a moment still looking down into the glass sam went on they dont want to let me go home what why not as soon as the words were out of karens mouth she knew how silly they were she knew damn well why not she just hadnt imagined it would still matter not after all these years jonathan had no trouble figuring it out either thats outrageous dad he said you were right by god youd better believe it his father said and laughed a sour laugh but whats that got to do with the price of beer what exactly did major nichols tell you karen asked first off they didnt expect to find me the ambassador they figured id be minding the doctors ps and qs for him sam yeager said they were going to have me go on minding ps and qs for whatever young hotshot theyve brought to take over here told me there were still hard feelings back home over what i did i wonder how big a villain i am in the history books he swigged the almostvodka you shouldnt be karen said the people who ordered the attack on the colonization fleet were the villains her fatherinlaw shrugged i think so too but if the powers that be dont he finished his drink i wonder if the commodore perry brought any real live air conditioners for the new ambassador and his people we should have thought of that ourselves but we were too dumb his mouth twisted of course even if they do have em they probably wouldnt give me one oh for the love of god dad jonathan said yes for the love of god sam yeager sounded like something straight out of edgar allan poe karen wondered if he did it on purpose she said talk to their captain maybe hell change his mind maybe her fatherinlaw sounded dubious in the extreme he also sounded furiousjust how much so she didnt really understand till he went on id rather stay here than beg though why should i have to beg for what i darn well deserve anyway he held out his glass to her fix me another one would you after all ive got so much to celebrate atvar climbed out of the shuttlecraft at the preffilo port males and females in the body paint of the imperial court met him in the terminal and whisked him away to the palace he hadnt been summoned to the capital for an audience with the emperor but for a working meeting with him the ceremonial was much less involved the honor might have been greater a meeting with the emperor meant he really wanted your opinion an audience could mean anything at all champions at the biennial games got audiences with the emperor since it was only a meetingif only was the right wordatvar didnt have to worry about the imperial laver and limner his own body paint would do the courtiers whisked him into the palace through a side entrance no reporters waited to shout asinine questions at him word had got out that a second tosevite starship had come to home word on what kind of starship it was hadnt not yet he wondered just how the males and females in charge of such things would get that across he wondered if they could do it without touching off a panic he would have panicked if hed got news like that in fact he had panicked when he got news like that the race was at the big uglies mercy if they had any if that wasnt worth panicking about what would be the th emperor risson sat in a conference room not much different from the ones in the hotel back in sitneff though the furniture was of higher quality atvar folded himself into the special posture of respect reserved for the emperor alone rise risson told him the overhead lights gleaming from his imperial gold body paint now that you have done that fleetlord let us forget about ceremony for the rest of this session just as you say your majesty so it shall be done atvar replied that had been a truth for emperors for a hundred thousand years how much longer would it stay a truth the answer wasnt in the races hands by the way rissons eye turrets waggled the same thought had occurred to him oddly that relieved atvar he would not have wanted the emperor blind to the consequences of what had happened here risson said well we have not seen an egg like this one since the days when home was unified and we did not fight the last war among ourselves after all i wish i could say you were wrong your majesty instead of saying that atvar made the affirmative gesture i only hope this one hatches as successfully it will not be easy no risson clicked his fingerclaws on the tabletop as any thoughtful and not very happy member of the race might have done by everything we can tell the big uglies are not lying about what this new ship of theirs can do i wanted to think they were i did not really believe it atvar said my reaction exactly risson said neither straha nor the shuttlecraft pilotnesserefappears to have been drugged and deluded in my opinion straha has long been deluded but he thinks the same of me atvar said i know something of the feuds that plagued the conquest fleet i do not care to know more from either side they do not matter now the emperor said the only thing that matters is verifying the big uglies claims straha and nesseref tend to do that so does the information we are receiving at speedoflight from tosev the american tosevites already know what we are hearing for the first time your majesty however much i tried to keep from doing so i thought i had to believe them as soon as that ship arrived atvar said for one thing it seemed to come out of nowhere for another it is the culmination of something toward which the big uglies have been reaching for some time our physicists are behind theirs but they are at least beginning to reach in the same direction we are behind the big uglies we change more slowly than they do this does not bode well for us risson said the same thought has occurred to me atvar said i would be lying if i said it filled my liver with delight immediate war might still be our best course risson said i do not want it i do not think our chances are good but if they only grow worse perhaps we should send that message no matter how many years it takes to arrive atvar made the negative gesture no your majesty he said and used an emphatic cough this same thought occurred to me but it would be a disaster consider the big uglies must see this is one of our options if they put one of their ships in line between our solar system and the star tosev they can intercept our signal return to tosev and be ready to attack or defend against whatever we send from here whichever suits them better years before the colonists have any idea they are supposed to help us go to war risson did consider for some little while at last with obvious reluctance he made the affirmative gesture well fleetlord that is a truth it is not a palatable truth but a truth it is i can see one way around it atvar said if we were to have a passenger on their starship that male or female could deliver a message to fleetlord reffet and fleetlord kirel that way the delay would be overcome you are clever fleetlord unfortunately the big uglies have thought of the same thing risson said they will let us have passengers but they will not let them communicate with members of the race on tosev in any way citing exactly the danger you named with an unhappy hiss atvar said that cursed straha told me the same thing i had forgottenmy apologies your majesty we have been too naive for too long deceit does not come naturally to us any more instead of what we call diplomats maybe we should have sent a shipload of azwacahide dealers to tosev the emperor said they always have an eye turret on the main chance and might have done better at getting what we need out of the big uglies you should tell that one to your diplomatic aides your majesty it holds much truth atvar said until the conquest fleet faltered on tosev emperors had not needed diplomatic aides since home was unified the very word ambassador was obsolete in the empire preserved only in historical fiction on tosev it had hatched out of the eggshell of dormancy once more i would not wish to make them unhappy risson said they try their best we have all tried our best sometimes sometimes things do not fall out as we wish they would i have no idea what is to be done about this except to go on doing the best we can if we do not do that we will fail atvar said of course even if we do we may well fail anyhow this thought has also crossed my mind risson said it is one of the reasons i have not slept well since this new starship came here having the other one in orbit above me knowing some missile was bound to be aimed at this palace was bad enough but this one this one we cannot imitate let alone surpassthis is very bad and do you know what else no your majesty what else atvar asked the th emperor risson let out an indignant hiss you will not be surprised to learn we have tosevite encyclopedias here on home he said what better way to learn about the big uglies than through their own words some of our scholars who read english have investigated the american tosevites after whom these two starships were named he hissed again even more irately than before and atvar asked as the emperor surely meant him to do and the first ship the admiral peary is named for the big ugly who first reached the north pole on tosev risson said that was surely a big ugly who went into the unknown and so his is a good name to give an early starship but the commodore perry he hissed one more time this commodore perry traveled by sea from the united states to the islands of nippon where he forced the nipponese into concluding trade agreements with him because of the strength of his warships is this a deliberate insult to us do the americans reckon us similar barbarians to exploit as they please today your majesty the nipponese are no moreand no lessbarbarous than any other wild big uglies atvar replied and he broke off not soon enough yes risson prodded atvar wished hed kept quiet now he had to go on with his thought such as it was i was going to say your majesty that i understand the analogy the big uglies may have been drawing commodore perry could travel by sea to the nipponese they could not travel by sea on their own to the land he came from we are in a like situation in regard to that second starship risson stiffened atvar wondered if he would be sent away never to see his sovereign again then to his vast relief the emperor laughed well fleetlord you have made your point i must say that analogy has more teeth than i wish it did until we can match the tosevites prowess maybe we are in truth no better than semibarbarians for many millennia we have believed ourselves to stand at the pinnacle of biological and social evolution atvar said and why not our society was successful and stable we easily overcame the other intelligent species we met and remolded their cultures and their worlds in the image of ours who could oppose us who could show us there were other ways of doing things he laughed too bitterly well now we know the answer to that yes now we know rissons voice was heavy with worry but thinking we were superior to all around us helped make us that way in fact for a long time now that we see we are not at the pinnacle as you said will we begin to view ourselves as permanently inferior to the big uglies that could also become a selffulfilling prophecy you know the fleetlord didnt answer right away hed had more experience worrying about big uglies than perhaps any other member of the race what worried him more than anything else was that they needed to be worried about when the conquest fleet first landed the tosevites had used numbers and appalling heroism and even more appalling deceit to make up for their technological deficit more appalling still was how fast that deficit had shrunk and now yes and now atvar thought as you said your majesty we have to do the best we can he said at last they learned from us for a while now we will have to learn from them and then with a little luck we can learn from each other one thing this breakthrough will do it will mean both the tosevites and we can colonize much more widely than ever before both sides are vulnerable now because we are so concentrated if we have colonies on hundreds of worlds rather than a handful the situation changes it was rissons turn to stop and think the empire would not be the same it would not it could not hope to hold together probably not your majesty atvar said but the race would survive in the end is that not the most important thing risson thought again then used the affirmative gesture now that kassquit knew what ttomalss had not wanted to tell her about she also understood why her mentor and the emperor had been so unwilling nothing would ever be the same again for the empire the race convinced fasterthanlight travel was impossible hadnt seriously looked for it for the big uglies impossible seemed nothing but a word to get around and now theyd got around it if the race couldnt it would find itself in deadly peril shed wondered if she would have mixed feelings about what the american tosevites had done they were after all her own kin far more than any members of the race could have been she might have shared some of the pride at their achievement she had before over smaller things but she didnt not because of this this terrified her she could see the danger it represented to the empire as long as the big uglies had this technology and the race didnt the planets of the empire lived on tosevite sufferance do not worry not on account of this frank coffey told her after she poured out her alarm to him in her room one afternoon remember this is the united states that has this technology my notempire will not do anything to touch off a war against the race no kassquit said i am sure the millions your notempire killed in the attack on the colonization fleet would be ever so relieved to hear that coffey did have the grace to wince he spread his hands palms up the paler skin there and on the soles of his feet so different from the rest of his body never failed to fascinate kassquit he said that was a long time ago we would not do such a thing now oh are you certain if your notemperor gave the order would your soldiers disobey it kassquit asked or would they do as they were told our notemperor would not give such an order coffey said though he didnt tell her how he knew such a thing and if heor shedid give it not all soldiers would obey remember sam yeager is our ambassador to the race he was a soldier who disobeyed yes and was sent into exile because of it kassquit said he would not be ambassador if the doctor had lived and he will not stay ambassador now that the new ship is here nor will the newcomers allow him to go back to tosev so much for the respect he won for disobeying orders you do not understand frank coffey insisted kassquit made the negative gesture on the contrary i fear i understand much too well she pointed toward the door i think you had better go otherwise this conversation is all too likely to put an end to our friendship it was more than a friendship of course but that was the strongest word the language of the race had we might do better to talk things out coffey said no kassquit used the negative gesture again what is there to say you are loyal to your notempire as you should be i am loyal to the empire this is also as it should be i believe we will not change each others minds we will only quarrel and what is the good of that coffey inclined his head kassquit understood that it was what big uglies sometimes did instead of sketching the posture of respect no doubt you have found a truth i will see you another time he said he put on the few wrappings american tosevites insisted on wearing in public even in the warmth of home then left her room only after he was gone did kassquit let tears start sliding down her face she had known he was unlikely to make a permanent mating partner she had expected him to return to tosev when the admiral peary left but the commodore perry changed everything now he might leave within days or tens of days when she found happiness did she always have to see it jerked out from under her feet she remembered the attack by the reich when jonathan yeager was up in the starship orbiting tosev with her actually for a little while that had worked out well on a personal level it meant theyd stayed together longer than they would have otherwise because he couldnt go back down to the united states while the war lasted but it had only made parting harder when the time finally came all at once kassquit wished she hadnt thought about the reich and the deutsche the race would be doing everything it could to learn to travel faster than light but so without a doubt would the deutsche they were formidably capable engineers and as far as she cold tell their notempire was governed by an equally formidable set of maniacs what would they do if they succeeded before the race did maybe frank coffey had a point were the commodore perry a deutsch starship wouldnt it have announced its presence by launching missiles at home the united states could have been better but it also could have been much worse kassquit yawned she didnt feel like thinking about it now she felt like curling up and taking a nap she lay down on the sleeping mat and did when she woke up she still felt more weary than she thought she should have that had been happening more and more often lately she wondered if something was wrong with her had she caught some tosevite disease from nicole nichols or one of the other wild big uglies whod come down from the commodore perry she went down to the refectory for a snack that turned out to be a mistake shed always enjoyed spiced chopped azwaca and niihau beans but not today they didnt smell right they didnt taste quite right either and they sat in her stomach like a large heavy boulder then quite suddenly they didnt want to sit there at all any more she bolted from the refectory with the plate of meat and beans still half full she got to the cloacal station just in time she bent over one of the holes in the floor and noisily gave back what shed eaten she couldnt remember ever doing that before it was one of the most disgusting experiences of her life it brought a certain relief but the taste and the way it came out through the inside of her nose as well as her mouth she rinsed and spat rinsed and spat that didnt help as much as she wished it would have i am diseased i must be diseased she said and used an emphatic cough no one who was healthy could possibly do something so revolting she thought about going back to the refectory and finishing the chopped azwaca and beans then with a shudder she made the negative gesture she didnt believe she would ever want that dish again it tasted much better going down than it did coming up instead she went to her room and telephoned dr melanie blanchard i would like you to examine me please she said when the physicians face appeared in the monitor i would be happy to dr blanchard said may i ask what has made you change your mind her interrogative cough was a small masterpiece of curiosity no member of the race could have done that better i am unwell kassquit said simply all right dr blanchard said come to my room and i will see if i can figure out why you are it shall be done kassquit broke the connection with no more farewell than that i greet you the american female said when kassquit pressed the door hisser before i start poking you and doing the other things physicians do please tell me your symptoms kassquit did in harrowing detail dr blanchard nodded all rightnausea and fatigue anything else now kassquit hesitated i am not sure it is relevant tell me and let me be the judge melanie blanchard urged the more data i have the better my diagnosis is likely to be yes that does seem reasonable kassquit made the affirmative gesture though still hesitantly my other notable symptom is that the blood which flows from my reproductive organs has not done so when it normally would have really the doctor said in tones of strong surprise kassquit used the affirmative gesture again dr blanchard reached out and squeezed one of her breasts kassquit yelped dr blanchard asked are they unusually tender why yes kassquit said how did you guess this set of symptoms is familiar to me sooner or later it becomes familiar to most tosevite females regardless of whether they happen to be physicians unless i am very much mistaken you are gravid kassquit stared but that is impossible frank coffey uses a sheath whenever we mate he has not failed to do so even once i am glad to hear that it speaks well for himand for you melanie blanchard said but what you have described are the textbook early symptoms of gravidity sheaths are good protection against such accidents but they are not perfect what kassquit felt was irrational fury the sheaths failure struck her as typical slipshod tosevite engineering wild big uglies just did things they didnt bother to do them right or maybe considering that the prime purpose of mating was reproduction frank coffey had done it right there are other possibilities the physician said all of them involve serious illness and all of them are much less likely than simple gravidity some time not quite a local year and a half from now i believe you will lay an egg she laughed and used the negative gesture that is the first phrase that occurred to me in the races language it is not what will happen you will have a hatchling a hatchling kassquit still struggled to take that in i know nothing about caring for hatchlings i am sure the american tosevites here on home with you whoever they turn out to be will be glad to help you melanie blanchard said or if you would rather there is a medical procedure to terminate your gravidity it is not very difficult especially when done early do you recommend medically that i do this kassquit asked no dr blanchard said you are on the old side to be gravid but you do not seem to be dangerously so i will have to monitor you more closely than i would if you were younger that is all the procedure may become medically necessary but i do not anticipate that it will but other factors besides the merely medical are involved in whether you wish to rear a hatchling this may be more true for you than for most tosevite females you have less practice at being a big ugly that is a truth kassquit said still if anything will teach me this is likely to be the experience that would you do not need to decide at once dr blanchard said during the first third of your gravidity the procedure remains fairly simple after that as the hatchling grows inside you it does become harder and more dangerous for you kassquit set the palm of her hand on her belly i will think about it she said but i believe i wish to go forward with this after kassquit bolted from the refectory and came back looking wan two or three times none of the americans on home had much doubt about what was ailing her frank coffey sighed he was careful to speak english i wonder how you say broken rubber in the races language congratulationsi think jonathan yeager told him thanksi think coffey said that isnt what i had in mind hey youve given us something to talk about besides the commodore perry tom de la rosa said and they said it couldnt be done major coffey sent him a slightly walleyed stare thanksi think he said again in the same tones hed used with jonathan everybody laughed jonathan said is she ready to be a mother nobodys ever ready to be a mother till it happens to her karen yeager spoke with great conviction some people may think they are but theyre wrong its baptism by total immersion some people are less ready to be mothers than others though dr melanie blanchard said no offense frank but i cant think of anybody who strikes me as less ready than kassquit karen nodded at that jonathan didnt but hed been thinking the same thing frank coffey said we didnt intend for it to happen he held up a hand yeah i knownobody ever intends anything like that but it happens all the time anyway he sighed shes got nine monthswell most of nine monthsto get used to the idea and there will be more humans here to give her a hand another sigh shell need one heaven knows i just hope he broke off silence fell among the humans smiles faded from their faces jonathan knew what hed started to sayi just hope we dont go to war that or something like it if they did go to war what was one pregnant woman no more than one pregnant woman had ever been in all the sad and sordid history of mankind the lizards wouldnt be that stupid not now tom said nobody answered maybe he was right on the other hand maybe he wasnt the lizards had just got the biggest shock in their whole history they probably didnt know how they were going to react to it how could any mere humans guess along with them on the other hand how could humans keep from trying people filed out of the refectory in glum silence jonathan looked out of the hotels big plateglass windows he imagined the sunbright flare of an exploding warhead right outsideand then darkness and oblivion penny for em karen said he shook his head you dont want to know she didnt push him maybe shed had thoughts like that herself ah excuse me that was in the language of the race an untidylooking lizard whose body paint could have used a touchup went on are you the big ugly i had the honor of meeting a while ago forgive me but your name has gone clean out of my head i really am a fool about such things i greet you inspector garanpo yes i am jonathan yeager jonathan said all at once a visit from a lizard detective hot on the trail of ginger seemed the least of his worries inspector let me present my mate karen yeager karen this is inspector garanpo i told you about him the last time he visited us oh yes of course karen said i am pleased to meet you inspector if she wasnt very pleased the lizard cop wouldnt know it garanpo bent into the posture of respect it is an honor to make your acquaintance superior female yes indeedan honor now i have met three of you tosevites and you seem pretty well civilized you truly do not at all the sort of creatures i thought you might be when i found out there was a connection between your kind and the ginger trade there is also a connection between members of the race and the ginger trade jonathan pointed out does that turn all males and females of the race into monsters and criminals well no i would not say that it does i certainly would not say that garanpo made the negative gesture jonathan watched him with an odd sort of fascination hed never before seen a lizard who reminded him of an unmade bed why are you here inspector karen asked has there been more ginger smuggling more oh no superior female not that we have been able to find garanpo said what we do have though is more information on the ginger smuggling that previously took place we have detected traces of ginger aboard the horned akiss where the little rocket from your starship paid a call is that supposed to prove something inspector jonathan said for all you know there are ginger tasters in the crew here is what i know garanpo said i know that a shipment of ginger came down to home not long after you big uglies and the race traded little rocketships and i know that you were going to trade them back again but then there was a delay after that delay you did send back the one you got from us there was no ginger inside it or none to speak of but we did detect traces of the herb inside some of the structural tubing what have you got to say about that superior tosevite he flicked out his tongue for all the world like one of his small earthly namesakes what have i got to say that were lucky their scooter only had traces of ginger in it and not enough to choke a horse those people upstairs came close as could be into walking into a buzz saw none of that seemed like anything the lizard detective needed to hear jonathan put the best face on things he could i am sorry inspector but this proves exactly nothing can you tell how old those traces of ginger are how long has the horned akiss orbited home how many of your starships has it met how long has ginger smuggling been going on he could even have been right with his guesses too he didnt think he was but he could have been a lawyer would have called it creating a reasonable doubt he wasnt sure the races law had ever heard of the idea well there has been ginger smuggling ever since starships started coming back from tosev garanpo admitted but there has never been any so closely connected with the source of supply you might say until now you do not know there is any such thing now jonathan said sharply you assume it but you do not know it we would except that the officers on your ship refuse to let us do a thorough search and analysis of their little rocketship garanpo said that suggests a guilty conscience to me it suggested the same thing to jonathan again he wasnt about to say so what he did say was why should they you yourself have told me that this little rocketship was in the races hands for some length of time if you wanted to discredit us you had the chance to do it inspector garanpos eye turrets swiveled every which way before finally coming to rest on him again how are we supposed to show guilt when all you have to do is deny it the lizard asked grouchily how are we supposed to show innocence when all you have to do is claim we are guilty jonathan asked in return garanpos eye turrets started swiveling again he turned and skittered off muttering to himself you did that very well karen said thanks jonathan said i wish i didnt have to and you know what else i wish i wish like hell i had a cold bottle of beer right now the race unfortunately had never heard of beer karen said you can get their vodka at the bar or if you want it cold weve got a bottle and ice cubes in the room jonathan shook his head thanks hon but its not the same did that strange shabby lizard have any idea what he was talking about of course not jonathan said a little louder than he needed to he cupped a hand behind his ear to remind karen that they were in the lobby and the lizards could monitor whatever they said her mouth shaped a silent okay to show she got the point jonathan went on on second thought maybe vodka over ice isnt such a bad idea after all you want to fix me one sure karen answered i may even make one for myself while im at it they rode up to their room as soon as jonathan got inside he checked the bug suppressors when he was convinced they were working the way they were supposed to he said youd better believe we were smuggling ginger if you want all the gory details you can ask dad good way to start a war karen observed she made him the drink once it was in his hand he was damn glad to have it karen did fix one for herself too after a long pull at his jonathan coughed once or twice it didnt taste like muchvodka never didbut it was strong enough to put hair on his chest he said there have been wars like thatthe opium wars in china for instance opium was just about the only thing england had that the chinese wanted and when the chinese government tried to cut off the trade england went to war to make sure it went on we wouldnt do anything like that karen said jonathan would have been happier if he hadnt heard the question mark in her voice it wasnt quite an interrogative cough but it came close i hope we wouldnt he said but its a weapon no two ways about it the admiral peary wouldnt have carried it if it werent and if were going to be able to start going back and forth between earth and home every few weeks instead of taking years and years to do it well the chances for smuggling go up like a rocket and if we smuggle lots of ginger and the empire decides it doesnt like that karens voice trailed away she got outside of a lot of her drink as jonathan had she coughed a couple of times we could see the opium wars all over again couldnt we its crossed my mind jonathan said as long as we can go faster than light and the lizards cant theyd be like chinese junks going up against the royal navy whether they understand that or not is liable to be a different question though and we have no idea what things are like back on earth these days not really we can find out though karen looked out the window but her eyes were lightyears from home grandchildren greatgrandchildren our own sonsolder than we are she shook her head not many people will have to cope with that jonathan said the bottom just dropped out of the market for coldsleep stock it did didnt it karen said so many things well have to get used to if dad doesnt go back i dont know that i want to jonathan said if all the people here decided to stay behind if the commodore perry wouldnt let him aboard that would show the moderns how much we thought of him i dont know what else we can do to change their minds that might work karen said slowly shed plainly been seeing los angeles in her mind and didnt seem very happy about being recalled to homeespecially about being told she might do better staying here jonathan gulped the rest of his drink she was sam yeagers daughterinlaw the other americans were just his friends would they sacrifice return tickets for his sake will i have to find out jonathan wondered the commodore perry excited glen johnson and the other pilots whod come to the admiral peary from the lewis and clark much less than most other people what the hell difference does it make if we can go back to earth in five weeks or even in five minutes johnson said we cant go home any which way wouldnt you like to see all the newest tv shows mickey flynn asked frankly scarlett i dont give a damn except maybe about the lovely rita johnson answered with feeling what male couldnt like the lovely rita wouldnt you like to see some new faces flynn persisted he pointed to walter stone the old faces are wearing thin not that anyone asked my opinion stone glowered i love you too mickey id like to see some young pretty girls in person johnson said the only thing is i dont think any young pretty girls would be glad to see me speak for yourself johnson flynn said that was his johnson speaking stone said johnson and flynn both looked at him in surprise he didnt usually come out with such things he went on i want to know what theyll do with the admiral peary we figured this crate would go obsolete but we never thought it would turn into a dodo the comparison struck johnson as only too apt next to the commodore perry the admiral peary might as well have been flightless shed crossed more than ten lightyearsand except for her weapons and the ginger she carried she was ready for the scrap heap they ought to put her in a museum johnson said so our grandchildren can see how primitive we were flynn inquired thats what museums are for johnson said our grandchildren are going to think were primitive anyhow my grandfather was born in i sure thought he was primitive and i didnt need a museum to give me reasons why listening to the old geezer go on about how us moderns were going to hell in a handbasket and taking the whole world with us did the job just fine and here he was right all the time walter stone said way it looks now weve got four worlds going to hell in a handbasket not just one biggest goddamn handbasket anybody ever made you really think the lizards are going to jump us johnson asked he didnt get on well with stone but he had to respect the senior pilots military competence what worries me is that it might be in their best interest to try stone answered if they wait for us to build a big fleet of fasterthanlight ships their goose is cooked or we can cook it whenever we decide to throw it in the oven how many ftl ships will we have by the time their attack order reaches earth mickey flynn asked not as many as if they wait twenty years and then decide theyre going to try to take us stone said they usually like to dither and look at things from every possible angle and take years to figure out the best thing they could do well here the best thing they can do is not take years figuring it out i wonder if theyve got the brains to see that it would be out of character johnson said theyve been worrying about us for a long time stone returned they were nerving themselves for something before the commodore perry got here would yeager have had us send a war warning back to earth if he werent worried the question is will the commodore perry make things better or worse flynn said will it make them think they cant possibly beat us and so theyd better be good little males and females or will they think the way you think theyll think walter and strike while the iron is hot stone didnt answer right away glen johnson didnt blame him how could you help pausing to unscramble that before you tried to deal with it when stone did speak he confined himself to one word right yes but which flynn asked one of them thats for damn sure stone said the other interesting question is what sort of a wild card is the commodore perry when it comes to weapons i know what weve got our stuff is a little better than what the lizards usenot a lot but a little enough to give us a good fighting chance of making them very unhappy in case of a scrap we had junk on the lewis and clark johnson said stone nodded compared to this youd better believe it well the commodore perry is more years ahead of us than the lewis and clark is behind us so what is she carrying and how much can she do to home if she gets annoyed johnson whistled softly think about the difference between world war i biplanes and what we flew when the lizards got to earth theres another one stone agreed flynn pointed downup toward the surface of home as it happened the admiral peary was flying over preffilo even from so high in the sky johnson could pick out the palace complex at a glance flynn said have the lizards wondered what the commodore perry is carrying we havent had any intercepts indicating that they have stone said maybe they arent wondering maybe they are but theyre keeping their mouths shut about it somebody ought to whisper in their hearing diaphragms johnson said the more they wonder about whatll happen if they get cute the better off well be thats actually a good idea by the way stone said it hearing a good idea from johnson was a surprise we can arrange it too the ambassador should be able to do it johnson said if the lizards will listen to anybody theyll listen to him they may be the only ones who will flynn said i understand that thats the purpose of an ambassador and all but when your own side wont healey johnson said in the tones he would have used to talk about a fly in his soup walter stone stirred he was and always had been in the commandants corner he was about as decent a guy as he could be while ending up there which said a good deal about his strengths and his weaknesses before stone could rise to healeys defense before johnson could snarl back and before the inevitable fight could break out mickey flynn went on ah but it isnt just healey theres a difficulty you might say with the people from the commodore perry too why for gods sake johnson asked the people on that ship either werent born or werent out of diapers when he went into cold sleep call it institutional memory flynn said call it whatever you want but they dont want to give him a ride back to earth hes not like ushe could go home again he could except that he cant where did you hear that johnson asked one of the junior officers who was touring this flying antiquity flynn said only goes to show the brass hats back home havent changed the opinion of the powers that be in the united states that johnson expressed was not only irreverent but anatomically unlikely he went on yeager saved our bacon back there in the s he let us come talk with the lizards now with our hands clean indianapolis stone pronounced the name of the dead city like a man passing sentence anyone who was in lieutenant general healeys corner wasnt going to be in sam yeagers yeah indianapolis johnson said how many lizards in cold sleep did we blow to hell and gone we say pulled a jap the lizards must say pulled an american but we were the ones who fessed up too and they paid us back and now things are pretty much square those were americans stone said stubbornly theyd been round this barn a good many times before okay have it your way suppose yeager kept his mouth shut like a good little german johnson said stone glared at him but he plowed ahead suppose he did that and its now and were heresomebody else is ambassador natch because yeager wouldnt have been anybody special then were here and the commodore perry gets here and the lizards are dithering about whether to make peace or go to war and suppose they find out just now that we were the ones who fried their colonists all those years ago what happens then goddammit what happens then four worlds on fire thats what sure as hell you think they could ever hope to trust us after they learned something like that so i say hooray for sam yeager and if you dont like it you can stick it up your ass stone started to say something he stopped with his mouth hanging open he tried again failed again and left the control room very suddenly mickey flynn eyed johnson your usual suave debonair charm is rather hard to see he remarked johnson was breathing hard hed been ready for a brawl not just an argument now that he wasnt going to get one he needed a minute or two to calm down some people are just a bunch of damn fools he said a lot of people are fools flynn said ask a mans nextdoor neighbor and youll find out what kind of fool he is we have to do something to get yeager aboard the commodore perry if he wants to go home johnson said we have to flynn pointed at him i advise you to have nothing visible to do with it youre under the same sort of cloud as he is ouch johnson said that was altogether too likely if his name showed up on any kind of petition lieutenant general healey would do his goddamnedest to blacken it for that matter healey would probably do the same fortoyeager the commandant of the admiral peary was a son of a bitch all right of course the hotshots on the commodore perry might not want to pay attention to any of the geezers whod made the trip before them they were bound to be sure they had all the answers themselves johnson did some finger pointing of his own how about you mickey you going to try and give yeager a hand he asked the question with real curiosity he knew where walter stone stood on yeager hed never been sure about the other pilot flynns deadpan wit made him hard to read flynn didnt answer right away he didnt seem happy about having to stand up and be counted at last he said they ought to let the man go home they owe him that much i wouldnt leave a halfwitted dogor even a marineon home for the rest of his days and i love you too johnson said sweetly he was bound to be the longestserving marine in the history of the corps if you do that proves youve been in space too long yes flynn kept jabbing and feinting and falling back johnson wasnt going to worry about it however reluctantly the other man had given him the answer he needed it also happened to be the answer hed wanted so much the better he thought he hoped yeager got back to earth and wondered what the place was like these days two lizards walked into the hotel in sitneff sam yeager sat in a humanstyle chair waiting for them he got to his feet when they came in i greet you he called i greet both of you it is good to see you again shiplord and it is also good to see you again shuttlecraft pilot you remember nesseref said in surprise yeager made the affirmative gesture i certainly do you took my hatchling and me up to one of your ships in orbit around tosev truthi did i remembered because i did not fly tosevites very often especially back then that you should also recall the time we did not go up there all that often each time was interesting and exciting enough for every bit of it to be memorable touching straha said dryly using the language of the race then he switched to english it is very good to see you old friend i hope you are well as well as i can be all things considered sam answered good i am glad to hear it and here we are together again the two biggest traitors in the history of several worlds no we did what needed doing even though sam was speaking english he added an emphatic cough strahas mouth dropped open in amusement sam went back to the races language so nesseref could follow too and how is tosev these days the two of you have seen much more of it than i have lately that would be a truth even if you had come in cold sleep since i came out of cold sleep myself i have watched tosevite technology change nesseref said this is astonishing to me i never would have expected to see the way individuals live change visibly in the course of part of a lifetime straha laughed again the change in the years between the coming of the conquest fleet and that of the colonization fleet was in some ways even larger i think that may well be a truth sam said we were adapting the races technology in those first few years and stealing it you mean straha broke in if you like sam didnt argue not when that held so much truth but we did adapt it too and use it in ways you never thought of you also have to remember that our technology had been changing rapidly even before the race came to tosev if it had not been you would have conquered us well that is a truth straha said we should have conquered you toothat is another truth atvar will tell you differently but it is a truth had i been in command we would have done it but our officers were afraid of change and so they went on doing the same old thing he laughed again look how well that worked out hed been saying the same old thing ever since he went into exile in the united states maybe he was right maybe he was wrong sam suspected he was wrong to him the only way the race could have conquered earth was by using enough nuclear weapons to leave it unfit for anyone to live on with the colonization fleet already on its way the lizards couldnt have done that sam didnt argue with straha what point to it all he said was no one will ever know now atvar knows in his liver he knows this is his fault no one elses straha spoke with a certain dour satisfaction again what point to arguing yeager knew atvar would deny everything straha said how sincere would the fleetlord be when he did that was hard to tell even with people let alone with lizards sam said come into the refectory with me both of you we can eat together and you can tell me about tosev these daysand about your trip here on the commodore perry it shall be done and on your expense account too straha said i shall order something expensive something i have not tasted since before i went into cold sleep for the journey to tosev go ahead sam said be my guests both of you as a matter of fact the imperial government is picking up the tab for us for the time being i suspect that will not last too much longer banking between solar systems will become much more practical if news of transactions does not require a goodsized part of someones lifetime to go from one to another no doubt that is a truth superior sir nesseref said i do not care whether it is a truth straha declared all i care about is that i shall eat welli shall eat delightfully welland someone else will pay for it if this is not the ideal in such affairs i do not know what would be spoken like a male who has spent too much time on the lecture circuit sam said there is a truth straha used an emphatic cough the only difference is meals on the lecture circuit are usually not worth the savoring this does not stop me from eating them you understand only from enjoying them as much as i might he hadnt been so cheerfully mercenary when sam first knew him had life in the united states changed him or had living as a celebrity rather than a military officer after he returned to the race done the job sam didnt know he wondered if straha did they have made furniture for your shape i see nesseref said as she walked into the refectory with yeager and straha they have tried sam agreed it is not perfect but it is better for us than what you use our backs and hips align differently from yours and our fundaments have a different shape lizards didnt have much in the way of buttocks and did have tailstumps humans could sit in chairs made for them but the experience wasnt enjoyable a server brought menus ah plerkappi straha said i have not had plerkappi for a very long time no tosevite seafood comes close to them have you tried them sam once or twice sam answered the flavor is a little too strong for my taste they reminded him of clams that had started to go bad if straha fancied them he was welcome to his share and sams besides nesseref ordered them too so maybe they really were something travelers coming back after a long time away would crave yeager stuck to azwaca cutlets straha sneered sam didnt care straha also sneered when he ordered unflavored alcohol all you want to do is poison yourself with it the lizard said you should enjoy it i do not enjoy your flavorings sam yeager said and you were not fond of whiskey either but that is different straha said who would want to drink burnt wood you might as well drink paint or cabinet cleaner sam thought the races flavorings every bit as nasty as paint no accounting for taste he said and let it go at that well there is a truth straha agreed the way his mouth fell open and the way his eye turrets moved were the races equivalent of a sly laugh look at my choices in friends for instance i will try not to hold it against you yeager said and straha laughed again sam tried for the third time so how is tosev these days it is a very strange place straha said nesseref made the affirmative gesture straha added even those parts of it ruled by the race are strange these days nesseref agreed again this is interesting but it tells me less than i might like to know sam said in what ways is tosev strange part of the strangeness is staying the same ourselves while we watch the big uglies change all around us nesseref said this is not only strange it is frightening she is right straha said it is as if we are a big pot in water when we first came to tosev the water outside was say halfway to the top we had no great trouble holding it out it has climbed up and up and up ever since now it is lapping over the edge and will flood everything inside and the big uglies know it too who was that male from the sssr some years ago nesseref asked we will bury you he said and he might well have been right i remember that it was before i went into cold sleep sam said his name was khrushchev and he was a nasty piece of work no doubt he was straha said that does not necessarily mean he was wrong sometimes i think the nastier a big ugly is the more likely he is to be right this is not a reassuring thought for a male of the race to have when i was first revived on tosev we could do many things you wild tosevites could not nesseref said your military could come close to matching ours but our civilian life was far richer and more pleasant one by one you acquired the things you did not have now you have things we do not and for the most part we are not acquiring them straha made the negative gesture nowe are acquiring them by purchase from the big uglies we are not making them ourselves that is not good and now this nesseref said here we are back on home and in days rather than years this i gather you decline to sell to us straha put in well yes sam said i cannot blame you straha said if i were a big ugly i would not sell this technology to the race either we tried to conquer you thanks to atvar we did not quite succeed but we tried i would not blame you for returning the favor we do not want to conquer anyone sam used an emphatic cough the refectory was bound to be bugged all we want to do is live in peace with our neighbors both the other independent tosevites and the empire yes the empire is your neighbor nowyour near neighbor straha said it is no longer the monster down the hall that stuck a clawed paw into your room but now to the race you are the monster down the hall we are not monsters any more than you are sam insisted before we could reach you and you could not reach us that made us monsters to you straha said now you can reach us in a way in which we cannot reach you believe me sam yeager that makes you monsterslarge scary monstersto us he added an emphatic cough of his own we are not monsters we are only neighbors sam said straha laughed what makes you think there is a difference we have become your near neighbors you are still not our near neighbors that by itself is monstrous at least as seen through our eye turrets he was bound to be right even so whenever you say these things you make a war between the empire and the united states more likely is that what you want shiplord if it is you will find some here who feel the same i will find quite a few i suspect even aboard the commodore perry straha said do i hear truly that they wish to exclude you from returning to tosev some of them do yes yeager said some of those in power in the united states would like to do the same are there none here on home who would rather you had stayed on tosev no doubt there are straha said the american tosevites did not consult with them though and so they are stuck with me that sort of trip is not open to me yeager said i know this is most unfortunate in my opinion straha said nesseref made the affirmative gesture straha went on you should do all you can to get them to change their minds i am sam answered just how much good any of that will do though i have to tell you i do not know atvar did not enjoy his meeting with the tosevite officer called nicole nichols the big ugly from the commodore perry spoke the races language as well as any of the americans from the admiral peary that did not make her any more accommodating on the contrary it only emphasized how differentand how difficultshe was when atvar presumed to speak up for sam yeager major nichols just looked at himlooked through him reallywith her small immobile eyes well exalted fleetlord i thank you for your opinion but i am afraid this is the business of the united states not that of the race i must say i do not completely agree with you atvar replied sam yeager is your notempires ambassador here what affects him affects us the tosevite looked through him again you must be kidding was what he thought he saw in her manner the big uglies from the admiral peary had takendid takethe race seriously they were not sure the united states was the empires equal atvar hadnt been sure of that either major nichols assumed the united states was more powerful than the empire she might have been right even so the way she acted grated on atvar he was used to looking down his snout at big uglies he was not used to their doing it to him she said we have our orders from little rock we may have some discretion but no onelet me repeat no oneis going to tell us what to do she added an emphatic cough you would do well to remember whose world you are on atvar said you would do well to remember how we got here the wild big ugly replied we can form our own judgments on what needs doing and what does not we can and we will is there anything else exalted fleetlord she sounded polite enough when she used his title but she didnt take it seriously only one thing atvar said heavily you would do well to remember that we can still devastate your planet even if we cannot do it right away this may be a truth major nichols said then again it may not you would do well to remember we can devastate all the planets of the empire before half a year passes whether we could do the same to a fleet moving against us at half of light speed well i admit i am not certain of that but the state of the art is bound to improve in the next few years what we cannot do now we probably will be able to soon she showed that chilling confidence again what made it all the more chilling was that the big uglies had earned the right to use it their technology did keep getting better and better the races didnt or hadnt now it would have to or the empire would go under major nichols added in any case we can certainly deal with your ships once they decelerate in our solar system we can certainly deal with your ships when the conquest fleet came to tosev the wild big uglies hadnt even been sure its ships were there till the fighting started theyd thought the scoutcraft were electronic faults in their radar systems now who could say what they could do now but atvar said suppose they do not decelerate excuse me the american tosevite replied suppose they do not decelerate atvar repeated a large ship at half light speed is a formidable projectile weapon would you not agree nicole nichols didnt say anything for a little while when she did it was one cautious word possibly atvars mouth fell open he knew what that meant it meant the answer was yes but the american big uglies hadnt worried about the question till now but even though he laughed he also watched as the wheels began to spin behind major nichols eyes the tosevite female was starting to calculate ways by which her notempire could knock out starships that were also projectiles she said they still would not arrive for some time i believe that we would probably be able to intercept them once they got there and i should also point out that you would have a hard time aiming them precisely you would be more likely to hit areas on tosev that you rule than you would be to hit the united states so what atvar answered by then we would be out to destroy all tosevites enough impacts of that sort might well render tosev uninhabitable which would be the point of the exercise for many years we have considered the possibility that this might become necessary we never thought it was urgent enough to attempt if you launch a war against us though he wondered if that would surprise nicole nichols if it did she didnt show it not so he could see she said no doubt you would try whether you would succeed that is a matter for doubt exalted fleetlord many things are atvar said we did not think so not till we made the acquaintance of you tosevites you taught us there are no certainties in matters military you should remember it too especially when a mistake in these matters could lead to the destruction of a world or of three worlds major nichols said or of four atvar said that would be a disaster for four species the empire will not go down alone he used an emphatic cough did the wild big ugly finally begin to believe he was serious believe the race was serious again he had a harder time judging than he would have for any citizen of the empire tosevites were alien biologically and culturally nicole nichols said i will take your words back to my superiors you may be sure we will treat them with the importance they deserve how much importance did the tosevite female think that was a little a lot she did not say atvar almost asked her the only thing that stopped him was the suspicion that she wouldnt tell him the truth after she left atvar took notes on their conversation and his impressions of it he wanted to get those impressions down while they were still fresh in his mind he was about twothirds of the way through when the telephone hissed for attention he hissed too in annoyance he thought about letting whoever was on the other end of the line record a message but the hissing got under his scales as much to shut it up as for any other reason he said this is fleetlord atvar i greet you kassquits image appeared on the screen she sketched the posture of respect and i greet you exalted fleetlord may i come to see you there is something of some importance that i would like to discuss with you give me a little while researcher atvar answered i am finishing up some work after that i would be glad to hear what you have to say i thank you it shall be done kassquit broke the connection a wild big ugly would probably have come to atvars room too soon the tosevites notion of a little while was shorter than the races what that said about the two species atvar would rather not have contemplated kassquit though was a citizen of the empire and understood its rhythms a moment after atvar finished his notes the door hisser announced that she was there when he opened the door kassquit came in and gave him the full posture of respect she rose they exchanged polite greetings what can i do for you atvar asked exalted fleetlord i would like you to speak for sam yeager to the american big uglies from the commodore perry kassquit replied i have done it atvar said much good has it done me the crewfemale from the commodore perry is full of her own rightness to the choking point she becomes offensive to those around her because they do not share in what she reckons her magnificence he was going to add that even the name of the american tosevites new starship was an affront to the empire he was going to yes but before he could kassquit murmured how very much like the race both of atvars eye turrets broke off from their usual scan of his surroundings and swung sharply toward her his voice was also sharp as he snapped if that is a joke researcher it is in questionable taste a joke exalted fleetlord kassquit made the negative gesture not at all by no means in fact ever since the race conquered the rabotevs it set itself up as the standard of comparison the standard of emulation now the glove is on the other hand is it not but we atvars voice trailed away again he didnt get the chance to say what hed planned to that the race having the most advanced civilization and technology had earned the right to tell other species what they ought to do and how they ought to live somewhere up in the sky the commodore perry laughed at his pretensions the big uglies had pretensions of their own hed resented those what had the rabotevs and hallessi thought about the races pretensions before they were fully assimilated into the empire how long had it been since a member of the race thought to ask the question had a member of the race ever thought to ask it his silence told its own story quietly kassquit said do you see exalted fleetlord i think perhaps you do i think perhaps i do too atvar answered also quietly humility is something we have not had to worry much about lately he laughed not that it was funny from anyones point of view except maybe a tosevites lately another laugh this one even more bitter we have not had to worry about it since home was unified from this we concluded we did not have to worry about it at all change has returned to the race change has come to the empire kassquit said we had better embrace it or soon there will be no more empire she was a citizen of the empire she was a big ugly if that did not make her a symbol of change what would and she was right anyone with eye turrets in his head could see that it is a truth atvar said not a welcome truth mind you but a truth nonetheless you spent many years on tosev you can see this kassquit said will those who have lived all their lives on home and who are not familiar with wild big uglies and what they can do oh yes oh yes atvar made the affirmative gesture if the big uglies can fly between their sun and ours in a fifth of a year while we take more than forty years to make the same journey they will see they will have to see for the empires sake i hope so kassquit said which could only mean she wasnt completely convinced and i do thank you for speaking up for sam yeager whether it did all you hoped or not in his case the wild big uglies should not be allowed to match the races highhandedness we agree there atvar said the american tosevites from the admiral peary also agree on it whether we and they can persuade the newly hatched americans from the commodore perry may be a different question arrogance lets you think you can do great things kassquit said to that extent it is good but arrogance also makes you think no one else can do anything great that i fear is anything but good again we agree atvar said i do not see how anyone could disagreeanyone who is not very arrogant i mean did that include the crew of the commodore perry did it for that matter include most of the race atvar could pose the question knowing the answer was something else again actually he feared he did know the answerbut it was not the one he wanted jonathan yeager and major nicole nichols sat in the refectory in the americans hotel in sitneff jonathan was finishing an azwaca cutlet people said every unfamiliar meat tasted like chicken as far as he was concerned azwaca really did major nichols had ordered zisuili ribs she had enough bones in front of her to make a good start on building a frame house she wasnt a big woman and she certainly wasnt fat she was in the hard good shape the military encouraged she sure could put it away though a sheet of paper lay on the table between them jonathan tapped it with his forefinger you see he said major nichols nodded yes so i do very impressive no matter what she said she did not sound much impressed if you dont take my father home the rest of us dont want to go either jonathan insisted how readily hed got the other americans to put their signatures on the petition surprised and touched him it had been much easier than hed worried it would be when he first thought about taking the step she looked at the paper then up at him she was a strikingly attractive woman but she had a snipers cold eyes forgive me mr yeager but you and your wife cant be objective about your father that only made jonathan angry he did his best not to show it im sure youre right he said i wouldnt want to try to be objective about him but youre pretending not to see something my signature and karens arent the only ones there every american on home has signed it that includes major coffey anyone would expect him to be on your side not ours if my dad had done anything even the least little bit out of line and shiplord straha and shuttlecraft pilot nesseref signed it too and you were the ones who brought them to home theyre lizards major nichols said of course theyd be happy enough to stay on home come on we both know better than that jonathan said nesseref has lived on earth for the past seventy years her friends are there friends count with lizards the way family does with us and straha straha would complain no matter where he was staying in some ways his situation is a lot like your fathers nicole nichols said she drummed her nails on the white plastic of the tabletop hes not particularly welcome no matter where he goes looks to me as though youre saying being right is the worst thing you can do jonathan said tightly have it your way mr yeager major nichols folded the petition and put it in her handbag besides with the lizards its academic they arent going back to earth with us for fear they might pass on a message to the races authorities back there and the choice about your father isnt mine any which way i will take this document back to the commodore perry and let my superiors decide yeah you do that jonathan said it wouldnt look so good if you came back to earth with none of us aboard would it she only shrugged she was a cool customer wed handle it she said we can handle just about anything mr yeager she got to her feet no need to show me the way out i already know away she went jonathan muttered under his breath this younger generation struck him as a mechanical bunch for a nickel he would have kicked major nichols in the teeth he would have tried anyway he suspected she could mop the floor with him and probably with any other three people here who werent frank coffey he got up too and slowly walked out of the refectory hed done everything he could do so had everybody else on home he saw that major coffeys john hancock didnt much impress major nicholsnot that anything much did impress her but coffeys signature sure impressed him even if frank was going to be a daddy he didnt want to spend the rest of his life on home hed signed anyway to keep an injustice from being done to jonathans father a lizard came skittering up to jonathan his body paint proclaimed him a reporter jonathan immediately grew wary the races reporters were much like those on earth too many of them were sensationseeking fools how does it feel to travel faster than light this one demanded shoving a microphone at jonathan i do not know jonathan answered i have never done it the race evidently couldnt keep secret any longer what the commodore perry had done the reporter gave jonathan what was obviously intended as a suspicious stare but you are a big ugly he said as if challenging jonathan to deny it how could you be here without having traveled faster than light because i am a tosevite from the admiral peary not from the commodore perry jonathan said resignedly we flew here in cold sleep slower than light the same way your ships travel you do remember the admiral peary do you not he made his interrogative cough as sarcastic as he could that might have been lost on the lizard after some thought the reporter used the affirmative gesture i think perhaps i may but the admiral peary is old news i am sure of that i want new news he hurried away old news jonathan said in english he sighed it wasnt that the lizard was wrong in fact there was the problem the male was right the americans from the admiral peary were old news in more ways than one had major nichols heard the reporter she would have agreed with him jonathan found himself hoping the nonetoobright lizard did end up running into nicole nichols he would infuriate her and she would horrify him as far as jonathan was concerned they deserved each other one of the elevators opened up tom de la rosa came out jonathan waved to him tom came over jonathan said beware of idiot lizard reporters running around loose sounds like a good thing to beware of tom agreed and speaking of bewares have you talked with the gal from the commodore perry i sure havei just finished lunch with her in fact i gave her the petition too jonathan set a hand on toms shoulder for a moment thanks for signing it de la rosa shrugged hey what else could i do right is right those yahoos have no business marooning your old man here you know that and i know that but ill be damned if im sure they know that jonathan said and you know youre taking a chance with that thing theyre liable to call us on it if they do none of us goes home from home yeah well tom shrugged again linda and i hashed that one out if theyre the kind of stiffnecked bastards who wont bend even when they ought to i dont think i want to go back to the usa any more it wouldnt be my country you know the companyd be better here tears stung jonathans eyes he blinked several times he didnt want tom to see that pride he thought and laughed at himself we can be expatriates sitting in the sleazy bars in sitneff and all the earnest young american tourists who come here can stare at us and wonder about all the nasty things weve done there you go tom laughed out loud the lost generation hell were already the lost generation if you dont believe me ask anybody from the commodore perry those people are convinced weve got no business being alive any more youd better believe it jonathan used the catch phrase with sour glee major nichols told dad they tried to get here before we did wouldnt that have been a kick in the nuts for us oh yeah sweet jesus yeah de la rosa made a horrible face wedve been like the dead atheist decked out in a suit all dressed up with no place to go as it is we get into the history books whether our ungrateful grandchildren like it or not jonathan said and tom nodded jonathans thoughts traveled the lightyears far faster than the commodore perry could hope to i do wonder what things are like back on earth well from what ive been able to pick up the politics are the same old yakyakyak de la rosa said the ecology he looked revolted its about as bad as we figured it would be lots and lots of species from home crowding out ours wherever its hot and dry earth isnt the place it was when we left jonathan sighed like you say its not a hot headline i dont know how were going to be able to put that genie back in the bottle again the place i feel sorry for is australia he used an emphatic cough its had its ecology turned upside down twice in two hundred years isnt that the sad and sorry truth tom said you hate to see something like that because theres just no way in hell to repair the damage too many native species have already gone extinct and more are going all the time when you add in rabbits and rats and cats and cane toads and cattle and azwaca and zisuili and befflem and plants are just as bad or maybe worse i know i dont know the way you doyoure the expertbut ive got the basic idea jonathan said and de la rosa nodded i hope we get to see for ourselves thats all me too de la rosa looked fierce his piratical mustache helped if we dont im going to blame you and ill have all the time in the world to do it too because well both be stuck here for the rest of our lives well if we start throwing missiles back and forth with the lizards that wont be real long jonathan said tom looked unhappy not because he was wrong but because he was right he went on of course thats liable to be just as true back on earth as it is here you think the lizards can still hurt us back on earth tom asked people from the commodore perry dont seem to im not sure im not sure anybody else is sure either jonathan answered ill tell you this though for whatever you think its worth the last time major nichols came out of a meeting with atvar shed had some of that upyours knocked out of her whatever he told her it didnt make her very happy maybe the race has figured out how to do something even if theyve got to do it in slow motion i almost wouldnt mindalmost tom emphasized where one side figures it can lick the other one easy as pie thats where your wars come from if both sides figure theyll get hurt theyre more likely to take it easy on each other jonathan nodded that makes more sense than i wish it did he thought back to earth again before too long maybe it wont matter so much well have colonies all over the place eggs and baskets you know what i mean oh hell yes tom de la rosa said we will and one of these days maybe the lizards will too if we dont kill each other off first and the germans will and the russians and the japanese lord that took some more contemplating jonathan said i hope the nazis and the reds dont end up with colonies on the same planet theyd start banging away at each other same as they were doing when the conquest fleet came yeah thatd be fun wouldnt it tom said jonathan nodded though fun wasnt what either of them had in mind he said the nazis owe the race one too if i were a lizard id worry about that if you were a lizard youd have other things to worry about like not looking right tom pointed out jonathan made a face at him people had much more mobile features than lizards did the race used hand gestures to get across a lot of things humans did with their faces and heads de la rosa went on i wonder how kassquit feels about being pregnant now this isnt the best time to bring a kid into the worldany world shell do okay i think jonathan said theres always been more to her than meets the eye and even if she is knocked up i had nothing to do with it and karen cant say i did he thought kassquit did not enjoy dr melanie blanchards examinations which was putting it mildly the wild big ugly had warned she would poke and prod and she did in kassquits most intimate places for that matter kassquit enjoyed next to nothing about being gravid which was also putting it mildly she wanted to sleep all the time her breasts were constantly sore and she went on vomiting dr blanchard called that morning sickness but it could strike her at any time of the day or night hoping to distract the doctor from her probings and pushings kassquit asked what possible evolutionary good is there in these disgusting symptoms i do not know dr blanchard wasnt distracted a bit kassquit hadnt really thought she would be i do not believe anyone else does it is a good question though i thank you so very much kassquit packed as much irony as she could into her voice instead of getting angry melanie blanchard laughed a loud tosevite laugh i am sorry not to be able to give you more help about this she said some doctors claim that women who have morning sickness are less likely to produce a hatchling that cannot survive than those who do not but i am not sure this has been proved produce a hatchling that cannot survive the phrase sounded awkward to kassquit english has a term for thismiscarry dr blanchard spoke the word in her language if you miscarry you discharge the hatchling from your body long before it would come out if everything were normal miscarried hatchlings usually have something wrong with them that would not let them live i see they are like eggs that are fertile and laid where conditions are good but that do not hatch kassquit said the doctor made the affirmative gesture yes i think that is a good comparison she said i must tell you researcher i do not know as much as i might about how the race develops keeping track of how tosevites work is a fulltime job in itself i believe that kassquit said good it is a truth dr blanchard used an emphatic cough she peeled off the elastomere glove shed been wearing and tossed it into a trash can for now i am glad to say you seem as healthy and normal as any female could this is good to hear kassquit said do you have any idea how long the morning sickness will last it usually ends after the first third of your gravidityabout half of one of homes years after your egg was fertilized dr blanchard answered bear in mind though that is not a promise each female is different some never have morning sickness at all some have it much more severely than you do and suffer from it until the hatchling comes out i am sorry but you will just have to wait and see i am sorry too kassquit felt like using an emphatic cough of her own have you finished inspecting me for this time yes dr blanchard nodded then used the affirmative gesture as i say you have earned the stamp of approval she mimed applying the stamp to kassquits left buttock kassquits mouth fell open that was funny but not funny enough to make her laugh out loud the way the wild big uglies did laughter or no she was anything but sorry to escape the doctor getting examined took her back to the days of her hatchlinghood members of the race had constantly poked and prodded at her then in a way she couldnt blame them for that they were trying to find out as much as they could about tosevites in another way she shrugged no doubt she would have been addled no matter how the race raised her one species simply could not fill all the needs the hatchlings of another had that was all the more true when the first was imperfectly familiar with the needs of the second part of her wished she could go back to tosev on the commodore perry she would have liked to meet mickey and donald if anybody on four worlds could understand her and what shed gone through over the years the males the yeagers had raised were the ones by all accounts they had done well for themselves in the united states but they were also surely caught between their biology and their culture mickey had said as much in the title of his autobiography had they learned the races language or did they speak only english if they had learned the races tongue did they speak it with an accent they would have the right mouthparts to speak it properly yes they wouldnt have the mushy tone tosevites couldnt help but they would have grown up using very different sounds the sounds of english how much difference would that make i should have learned english she thought but she had a pretty good idea why the race had never taught it to her the males and females in charge of such things must have feared learning a tosevite language would make her too much like a wild big ugly and maybe theyd even been right who could say for sure if she did ask to go aboard the commodore perry and visit tosev what would the american tosevites say kassquit paused and then made the negative gesture that was the wrong question the right question was how was she worse off even if they said no if they did she would be where she was now if they said yes she would be better off than she was now as was true most of the time asking was the right thing to do here but whom could she ask the formidable female officer named nichols kassquit hadnt seen her around the hotel lately she hadnt seen anyone from the commodore perry around the hotel lately maybe that meant nothing maybe it meant the fasterthanlight ship was about to bombard sitneff how could you tell what wild big uglies would do next kassquit knew she couldnt she went to see ambassador yeager he laughed you want me to get them to take you he said i cannot even get them to take me i know that superior sir i am sorry for it i think it is altogether unjust kassquit added an emphatic cough now that you mention it so do i sam yeager said i hope you will not be angry but i have to tell you that i do not think traveling on the commodore perry would be good for you at least not in the near future why not kassquit demanded there were times when she thought everyone on four worlds joined together in thwarting her she knew such thoughts were not true but that did not always keep her from having them well for one thing you would keep company with many more wild big uglies than you ever have before the american ambassador answered you would have a much greater risk of disease than you ever had before who can say how you would respond you have never been exposed to diseases before and remember you are gravid disease could also affect the hatchling growing inside you so could traveling faster than light i do not know that it would but i do not know that it would not either i do know that hatchlings growing inside females are often more sensitive to changes in environment than adults are if i commanded the commodore perry i would not accept you as a passenger simply because you are gravid i see kassquit had expected sam yeager to argue in terms of politics and statesmanship instead hed talked about biology that was harder to refute or get around kassquit wasnt sure she should try to get around it either she said would dr blanchard confirm what you say i think so by all means ask her the ambassador replied and ask a member of the race who has studied tosevites i am not a physician he tacked on an emphatic cough to stress the not all i can tell you is what a reasonably welleducated wild big ugly thinks he knows experts know better than i do talk to them it shall be done kassquit pointed accusingly at yeager you make entirely too much sense he laughed again on the same sour note hed used the first time i am glad you think so i am glad somebody thinks so there are a good many who think i am nothing but an old fool i have never been one of those kassquit said the way you think has always interested me ever since the days when we both pretended to be members of the race on the computer bulletinboard system back on tosev she pointed at him again you should not have been able to gain access to that system now sam yeagers laugh held real amusement i know i had a friend who got the necessary programming for me a friend kassquit echoed she had no trouble figuring out what that meant not another wild big ugly not that long ago you mean a male of the race someone from the conquest fleet well what if i do yeager answered even then plenty of males decided they would rather live in the united states than in the lands the race ruled we released all the prisoners of war we held who wanted to go the rest became what we call naturalized citizens of our notempire it sounds like treason to me kassquit said darkly but sam yeager made the negative gesture no not at all you are a citizen of the empire you are loyal to the race and the emperor your species does not matter when members of the race become naturalized citizens of the united states they give it their loyalty their species does not matter either maybe kassquit said but i am suspicious of those who change their loyalty after they are adult there is some truth in that but i think only some yeager said the history of tosev shows that there can be more reasons for changing ones loyalty than somebody familiar only with the history of the race might think i would guess the history of tosev also shows more treason than the history of the race kassquit said and i would guess you are right the american ambassador said which surprised hershed been trying to make him angry he went on the race has been politically unified for all these years that leaves small room for treason on tosev we have had and do have all sorts of competing sovereignties an individual may work for one while loyal to another we may be barbarousa lot of the time we are barbarousbut we have more complicated more sophisticated politics than the race does more complicated anyhow kassquit was in no mood the praise wild big uglies sam yeager only laughed again have it your way researcher i would like to see you come back to tosev one of these days mickey and donald would be glad to meet youyou have a lot in common with them he could think along with her shed seen that before even when neither of them knew the other was a big ugly she said that is one of the reasons i want to go back i would love to speak with them if the doctor says you should not go yet you could send them letters yeager said with the new ships you ought to have answers before too long that is a truth kassquit said thoughtfully it was one that had not occurred to her would you be kind enough to deliver such letters you might do better asking my hatchling and his mate yeager replied they are more sure of a place on the commodore perry than i am they say they will not go if you do not kassquit said yeager only shrugged she left his room wondering what that meant more complicated tosevite diplomacy she wouldnt have been surprised a shuttlecraft from the empire had brought karen yeager and the other americans down from the admiral peary now another one would take them up to the commodore perry that probably suited her fatherinlaws taste for irony the americans werent heading back to earth not yet they were traveling as a group to try to persuade their younger countrymen to let sam yeager go back are all you tosevites strapped in asked the shuttlecraft pilot a darkskinned rabotev named pellakrenk one by one the americans said they were pellakrenk made the affirmative gesture good heshe said the launch corridor rapidly nears humans would have spoken of a launch window the image in the races language worked just as well it made karen think of the shuttlecraft flying along a hallway connecting sitneff to the commodore perry i commence countdown pellakrenk announced and did when the rabotev got to zero the shuttlecraft roared away from the field karen felt as if several large unfriendly people were sitting on her chest each breath was a struggle through the roar of the rocket motor jonathan asked you okay dad yeah sam yeager answeredas much a grunt of effort as a word after a pause for breath he asked a question of his own how you doing melanie one gravity was bad enough melanie blanchard said this is worse soon no gravity at all pellakrenk said in fair english unlike the rabotev whod brought the first load of americans down to home this one didnt pretend ignorance of the humans language when acceleration cut out karen gulped she sternly told her stomach to behave itself it did after a few unpleasant minutes when she wondered whether it would listen she wouldnt have wanted to go weightless if she had morning sickness that thought made her sympathize with kassquit which wasnt something she did every day everybody okay dr blanchard asked ive got airsick bags if you need em dont be shy speak up we dont want the nice folks whore giving us a ride to have to clean up this shuttlecraft what you mean pellakrenk asked maybe rabotevs didnt suffer from nausea in weightlessness it troubled the race much less than it did humans nobody answered the pilot nobody asked dr blanchard for an airsick bag either frank coffey and jonathan kept gulping for a while after karens stomach settled down but all they did was gulp karen turned her head and looked out a window the sky had turned black she could see the curve of home if she craned her neck a little columbus was right she thought planets are round commodore perry calling the shuttlecraft from sitneff do you read me shuttlecraft from sitneff the voice that of a human speaking the language of the race crackled from the speaker near pellakrenks head this is the shuttlecraft from sitneff the pilot answered your signal is loud and clear good the human said your trajectory looks fine let me speak to ambassador yeager if you would be so kind it shall be done pellakrenk said and passed sam yeager the microphone im here were all here karens fatherinlaw said in english nice of you to want to talk to me pellakrenk probably wouldnt notice the jab there karen did she was sure the other americans on the shuttlecraft did too if the radioman on the commodore perry did it didnt faze him glad to hear it was all he said karen had trouble figuring out what was bothering him if the shuttlecraft carried explosives instead of passengers it could get past the starships defenses yes but the little ship could carry explosives and passengers without any trouble if the empire wanted to start a war it wouldnt worry about the lives of the diplomats whod been in sitneff docking was smooth the rabotevs odd hands danced over the controls for the maneuvering jets the shuttlecrafts docking collar engaged with the air lock on the commodore perry with a smooth click we are here pellakrenk announced i shall wait for you if your plans change and you decide not to return with me i trust you will let me know of this it shall be done shuttlecraft pilot karen promised the outer airlock door to which the docking collar was connected swung inward one by one the americans unstrapped and glided into the air lock when theyd all left the shuttlecraft the door closed behind them tom de la rosa said my god the airs the right temperature and it was for the first time since going down to sitneff karen wasnt too damn hot when the inner airlock door opened a blond woman in coveralls with a captains bars on the shoulders floated just inside hello she said politely im captain benn please follow me to lieutenant general chesneaus office no guided tour jonathan asked captain benn just shook her head no she answered what karen saw on the way to the commandants office were corridors they looked a lot like the corridors in the admiral peary they were painted light green instead of gray but so what they had handholds so people could pull themselves along while weightless they had convex mirrors at intersections to help prevent collisions they had doors set into them all the doors were closed the americans up from sitneff saw not another living soul besides captain benn have we got the plague karen asked were only following orders captain benn answered which probably meant yes an open doorway was a surprise stenciled on the door were the words office of the commandant oh boy sam yeager said were here they went in another surprise was the appearance of lieutenant general chesneau karen had expected a j edgar hooverjowled bulldog of a man stamped from the mold that had produced lieutenant general healey but chesneau was small and thinfaced and didnt look as if he bit nails in half for fun his voice was a light tenor not a bass growl mildly enough he said hello pleased to meet all of you so youre the people whove made my life so much fun since i got here are you he couldnt have been more disarming if hed triedand he no doubt was trying sam yeager said well general no offense but youve made my life a whole lot of fun since you got here too chesneau looked pained when he said ambassador i am sorry about that he sounded as if he meant it but he went on you wore the uniform for a long time sir im sure you understand the need to follow orders he also understands when not to follow them karen said do you in that sense i hope so the commandant answered not raising his voice at all yes he was trying to be disarming whether that sense applies here may be a different question and its because the ambassador chose not to follow them on one particular occasion that i have the orders i do something tightened in his jawline however soft he sounded steel lay underneath i did it ill stand by it sam yeager said heres a question for you general suppose back in the s that the lizards found out wed done what wed done to them without finding out any of us gave a damn about it what do you think they would have done to us you ask me the answer is whatever they wanted to back then we werent strong enough to stop them slow them down maybe but not stop them will chesneau believe that karen wondered the commandant was somewhere around fifty which meant hed been born in the early s hed grown up with the usa pulling ahead of the race not struggling desperately to get even did he understand what things had been like twenty years after the conquest fleet arrived all he said now was maybe he looked at the people from the admiral peary one after another then spoke to sam yeager you must inspire tremendous loyalty in those who know you ambassador its not a small gift thanks but i dont think thats whats going on here karens fatherinlaw answered whats going on is your orders are such a bad mistake everybody can see it but you no offense sir but the ambassadors right frank coffey told lieutenant general chesneau what hes done here is plenty to earn him a ticket back home all by itself those other things a long time ago you can argue about them i admit thatyou can but for one thing arguing means theres lots to be said on both sides and for another nobody can argue about what hes done here the race was thinking hard about a preventive war against us it might have started by the time you got here if not for him meaning no disrespect to the doctor but i dont think he could have held it off as long as sam yeager did chesneau pursed his lips we did not expect that we would find colonel yeager holding the position he does he admitted then his jawline tightened again soyou say youll all stay on home if the ambassador doesnt go back to earth i am going to tell you this is your one and only chance to change your minds anybody he waited he very visibly waited karen knew she and jonathan werent going to say anything coffey the de la rosas dr blanchard how could you be sure how could you blame anybody who didnt want to die on home but no one said a word chesneaus jaw tightened once more this time karen judged as a bulwark against astonishment the commandant inclined his head to sam yeager what i told you before still holds ambassadordouble id say thanks yeagers voice was husky he nodded to his colleagues thanks he repeated more huskily still you did the right thing karen said we should be able to do the same touching lieutenant general chesneau said dryly last chance people going once going twice gone if dads not going anywhere were not going anywhere either jonathan said one by one the men and women whod come down from the admiral peary nodded lieutenant general chesneau eyed them in bemusement sam yeager said just for the record you ought to know this wasnt my idea truth karen said in the lizards language and added an emphatic cough her colleagues made the affirmative gesture she eyed chesneau plainly he did understand the word the cough and the gesture that was something anyhow he let out a long sigh you are a bunch of obstreperous hooligans truth karen repeated with another emphatic cough the rest of the americans used the affirmative gesture again by their grins they took it for a compliment just as she did chesneau saw that too if you think you can blackmail me he paused and grimaced and finally started to laugh its possible youre right if i showed up in the solar system without any of you i suspect i would get some fairly sharp questions so would the administration that sent me outand unlike you i cant go into cold sleep and outlast it karens hopes soared chesneau eyed her fatherinlaw well ambassador are you willing to go back to a country where you may not be especially welcome no im not willing sam yeager answered karen stared but then he went on im eager general what im willing to do is take my chances all right then chesneau said ill use altered circumstances here on home as justification for disregarding my ordersand well see which of us ends up in more trouble he started to add something but found he couldnt the oldtimers crowding his office were clapping and cheering too loud for anybody to hear another word he said as the american tosevites from the admiral peary got ready to return to tosev ttomalss waited for kassquit to come wailing to him shed done it before when jonathan yeager returned to the united states from her starship orbiting tosev now she was losing not only a mate but the sire of the hatchling growing inside her and frank coffey wasnt just traveling down through the atmosphere he would be lightyears away but kassquit did nothing of the sort she began striking up acquaintances with the wild big uglies the commodore perry was leaving behind the new physician seemed surprised to have a gravid patient but also seemed confident he would be able to cope with whatever difficulties arose finally ttomalss curiosity got the better of him he came up to kassquit in the hotel refectory one morning and said may i join you she made the affirmative gesture of course superior sir provided my nausea does not make me leave more quickly than i would like a server came up and offered ttomalss a printout he declined after so long he had the refectorys choices graven on his liver and needed no reminders he ordered the server sketched the posture of respect and skittered away ttomalss swung his eye turrets toward kassquit how are you feeling he asked about the same as before she answered the wild big uglies assure me these symptoms are nothing out of the ordinary i have to believe them that is not exactly what i meant ttomalss said how do you feel about losing your mating partner he may come back to home one day or i may visit tosev kassquit said with the new ships such journeys will not be impossible i am sad he will go i am sad yes but i am not devastated losing a mating partner was harder the first time i did it i had no standard of comparison then and no prospect of staying in contact with any other big uglies things are different now i see ttomalss broke off for the server brought in kassquits order just then after the male left the psychologist resumed you are more mature now than you were then maybe i am kassquit began to eat fried zisuili and fungi this is an excellent breakfast she said plainly trying to deflect his questions i am glad you like it ttomalss wondered what tone to take with her no usual one was right and he knew it he could not speak to her as one friend did to another among the race too much lay between them for that except for not physically siring and bearing her he had been her parent in the full ghastly tosevite sense of the word and yet as hed said himself just now she was more mature than she had beentoo mature to take kindly to his using the sort of authority hed had when she was a hatchling his mouth fell open in a sour laugh did big uglies ever know these ambiguities or did they understand instinctively how such things were supposed to work he supposed they had to if they didnt wouldnt their whole society come tumbling down is something wrong superior sir kassquit asked she must have noticed how unhappy his laugh was he wouldnt have thought a big ugly could but as he was the races leading student of matters tosevite so kassquit knew the race more intimately than any other big ugly even sam yeager no nothing is really wrong he replied i was thinking about how you respond to stress now as opposed to how you did when you were younger you said it yourself superior sir i am more mature than i used to be kassquit replied i am also more used to the idea of belonging to two worlds than i was before i desperately wanted to be part of the race and if that meant abandoning my biological heritage well then it did and that was all there was to it but i have discovered that i cannot abandon my biologyand i have also discovered i do not want to you will find your counterparts autobiography interesting ttomalss said so will i i look forward to the day the translation reaches home truth kassquit used the affirmative gesture the server brought ttomalss his food as he began to eat she went on i would give a great deal to meet mickey and donald i have already told the tosevites as much those two of all people should understand some of what i have experiencedthough they at least had each other ttomalss crunched a plump roasted grub between his teeth he said there are times when i feel guilty because of what i have done to you you are not a normal tosevite and you never can be but you may not be worse off on account of that the lot of a normal tosevite especially at the time when i ah found you all too often proved unfortunate yes frank coffey has pointed out the same thing to me kassquit said because her room was electronically monitored ttomalss knew that he also knew better than to show he knew kassquit went on i still think i would rather have been as i would have been if you take my meaning i think so ttomalss said of course you have not experienced the disease and the hard labor you would have known had i chosen another tosevite hatchling you are comparing what you have now against some ideal existence not against the reality you would have known perhaps kassquit said i have certainly learned more of bodily infirmity since become gravid than i ever knew before these are lessons i do not care to expand upon further she looked at her almost empty plate this morning things seem willing to stay down i am glad to hear it ttomalss said i gather your gravidity has persuaded you not to travel on the commodore perry kassquit made the affirmative gesture none of the wild tosevites seemed to think it was a good idea no one knows how traveling faster than light affects developing hatchlings and no one seems to want to find out by experiment i do not care for this conclusion but i must say it makes sense i agree ttomalss bit down on a ripe ippa fruit tart juice and pulp flooded into his mouth there will be time enough for such things later i hope so kassquit said this is one of the occasions though when i notice that your likely span is longer than mine she shrugged it cannot be helped if you will excuse me superior sir she rose and left the refectory as ttomalss finished breakfast he wondered what his likely span was kassquit meant that an average member of the race lived longer than an average big ugly she was right about that of course but it held true only in times of peace of stability if the missiles started flying if the hydrogen bombs started bursting no one of any species was likely to live very long the race and the big uglies hadnt blown tosev skyhigh theyd come close when the deutsche reached for something they werent big enough to grab theyd come close but they hadnt quite done it both sides there had got used to the idea that they were living on the edge of a volcano now all the worlds of the empire were living by the same crater most males and females on home didnt realize it yet but it was true rabotev and halless were blissfully unaware of it or were they had tosevite fasterthanlight starships appeared out of nowhere in their skies for that matter had the big uglies bombarded or conquered the other two planets in the empire if they had home wouldnt find out about it for yearsunless more tosevite starships brought the news that thought reminded ttomalss just what a predicament the race found itself in the big uglies could know things sooner than his own species could and could act more quickly on what they knew for years the race had tried to decide whether tosevites were enough of a menace to be worth destroying and had never quite made up its mind even if it had doing anything would have taken years and years if the american big uglies decided the race was still enough of a menace to be worth destroying how long would they take to act on their decision not long at all both because they were generally quicker to act than the race and because they now had the technology to match their speed of thought involuntarily ttomalss eye turrets looked up toward the ceiling even if he could have looked up through the ceiling he couldnt have seen the commodore perry in orbit around home not in daylight if the starship launched missiles he would never know about it till too late one eye turret swung down to the grubs and fruit hed been eating he was glad hed just about finished his meal before such thoughts occurred to him they would have robbed him of his appetite after he left the refectory he thought about going out into sitneff to call pesskrag and see how her research team was coming hed taken several steps toward the door before he stopped and made the negative gesture what good would that do shed said the research would take years asking her about it mere days after hed last spoken to her wouldnt gain him any new information he would just be tugging at her tailstump annoying her for no good reason but he wanted reassurance he laughed not that it was particularly funny back when kassquit was a hatchling hed constantly had to reassure her that everything was all right that he would go on taking care of her that she was a good little female sometimes it had almost driven him mad hatchlings of the race being more independent from their earliest days didnt need that constant reinforcement hed probably been illequipped to give it whatever psychological problems kassquit had were in no small measure of his making and now he understood kassquit in a way he hadnt while he was raising her in the huge frightening world of interspecies rivalries and new technologies what was he but a tiny hatchling calling out for someone anyone to help make him feel safe he didnt think pesskrag could do for him what hed once done for kassquit he didnt think anyone couldnot atvar not even the th emperor risson himself he suspected they were all looking for reassurance in the same way he was and for the same reasons that didnt make him crave it any less change was here for millennia the race had insulated itself against such misfortunes everyone had praised that as wisdom countless generations had lived peaceful secure happy lives because of it now though like it or not change was hissing at the door if the race couldnt change if the race couldnt change then in a certain ultimate sense those hundred thousand years of peace and stability might not matter at all ttomalss shivered few males or females had ever bumped snouts with the extinction of their species that was what he saw now maybe it was nothing but panic over the arrival of the commodore perry on the other hand maybe panic was what the arrival of the commodore perry demanded however much he wished it didnt the second seemed more likely than the first the wild big uglies hadnt panicked when the conquest fleet arrived theyd fought back more ferociously and more ingeniously than the race dreamt they could now the race had to respond in turn could it ttomalss shivered again he just didnt know there was home spinning by as it had ever since the admiral peary went into orbit around it the sight had raised goose bumps in glen johnson here he was eyeing the scenery as his spacecraft circled a world circling another sun the admiral peary was still doing the same thing it had always donebut the starship had gone from historymaker to historical afterthought in the blink of an eye when johnson said that out loud walter stone shook his head not quite yet he said we still have another few weeks of serious duties to perform till the commodore perry goes to earth and then comes back here were the ones on the spot up to us to keep the lizards from doing something everybody would regret he was right he usually was and yet his being right suddenly seemed to matter very little yes sir johnson said sorry about that were not a historical afterthought right this minute but we will be any day now stone gave him a fishy stare you never have had the right attitude have you johnson shrugged there in the control room the right attitude i dont know anything about that all i know is were about the most obsolete set of spacemen god ever made we spent all those years weightless and now we cant be anything else and we made a fine successful crew for a coldsleep starshipthe only problem being that they wont make any more of those buggy whips slide rulesand us what do the russians call it the ashheap of history thats what it is and thats where were at brigadier general stones gaze got fishier yet if we are johnson youre still a pain in the ash aiii johnson looked back reproachfully and here i thought you were you and not mickey flynn is someone taking my name in vain flynn asked from the corridor that led into the interior of the admiral peary he came out into the control room a moment later how did i get into trouble without even being here native talent johnson suggested flynn shook his head his jowls wobbled cant be that why not stone asked it makes sense to me as if that proved anything flynn said with dignity he pointed to the planet they were circling how can i be native talent in this solar system hes got a point johnson said stone shrugged this time well what if he does without waiting for an answer he pushed off slid gracefully past flynn and vanished down that corridor was it something i said flynn wondered nope he just doesnt care to be last years model but he cant do anything about it johnson answered anybody who can remember when rockets to the moon were the province of pulp magazines is not going to be right up to date flynn observed for that matter neither is anybody who can remember pulp magazines thats true johnson said i was never on the moon were you and here we are in orbit around home its pretty peculiar when you think about it the moons not worth going to this place is flynn said he wasnt wrong about that either the lizards had been amused when humans flew to the moon since the race was used to flying between the stars that first human journey to another world must have seemed like the smallest of baby steps and when people went to mars the lizards were just plain perplexed why bother the place obviously wasnt worth anything heck johnson said they didnt even get all that hot and bothered when we went out to the asteroid belt in the lewis and clark at least they were curious then flynn said we had a constantboost ship that made them sit up and take notice and they wondered what the dickens we were up to those spy machines of theirs johnson laughed oh yeah i remember spoofing one of them when i was in a scooter i signaled to it just the same way as i had to some of the bases wed set up on the rocks close by the ship that should have given some lizard monitoring the signals the spy machine was picking up a case of the hives flynn said well i hope so i dont suppose ill ever know for sure though johnson said what i do know for sure is it gave our dearly beloved commandant a case of the hives he called me into his lair uh office to grill me on the weird signal id sent somehow he never appreciated my sense of humor he probably thought it lacked that quality of mirth known as being funny flynn said thanks a hell of a lot mickey ill remember you in my nightmares johnson wished he could have left the control room in a display of at least medium dudgeon the way walter stone had but it was still his shift he did everything required of him he always had he always would for as long as he was physically able to he was damned and doubledamned if he would give lieutenant general healey the excuse to come down on him for something small like that he laughed out loud are you attempting to contradict me flynn inquired in moderately aggrieved tones how can i know whether something is funny unless you tell me the joke johnson explained finishing of course healey doesnt come down on me for the small stuff he comes down on me for big stuff instead after grave consideration flynn shook his head i dont think youd make bob hope quake in his boots or jack benny either i should say not johnson replied theyre dead i dont even think youd get them worried enough to start spinning in their graves flynn said imperturbably neither would that lizard called donald the one who runs the quiz show hows he going to spin in his grave hes still alive johnson said and so is that gal called ritaoh yeah recordings of youd better believe it had made it to the admiral peary some people found donald funny johnson didnt or not especially but like every other male on the ship he admired the lovely ritas fashion statements one more reason to be sorry im not going back to earth two more reasons id say mickey flynn paused to let that sink in then went on however much you might like looking at her you dont suppose shed look at you do you you were not born yesterday mon vieux except for the minor detail that gravity would quickly kill him johnson was in reasonably good shape for his age which was about the same as flynns but the other pilot wasnt wrong neither one of them had been born yesterday even subtracting cold sleep after some thought johnson said ive been accruing pay since the s and i havent had a goddamn thing to spend it on i may not be pretty but i might do for a sugar daddy maybe you wouldif they still have sugar daddies back on earth flynn said they will that im not worried about johnson spoke with great conviction as long as old guys have more money than they know what to do with pretty girlsll give em ideas hmm on those grounds i might even qualify for sugar daddyhood myself flynn said ive been accruing pay longer than you have since i joined the crew of the lewis and clark on the up and up instead of stowing away and ive been a bird colonel longer than you have i could outbid you he seemed to like the idea johnson laughed at him if were back on earthor in orbit around it anywaytherell be enough girls to go around you get one ill get another one hell get more than one if you want to an embarrassment of riches and probably a richness of embarrassments flynn said but then a richness of embarrassments is what sugar daddies are for i should endeavor to give satisfaction how did he mean that johnson refused to give him the satisfaction of asking instead he said its pretty good weightless from what i remember of course its pretty damn good any which way there for once i find i cannot disagree with you flynn looked aggrieved what an unfortunate development who could have imagined it johnson patted him on the shoulder dont worry it wont last flynn seemed suitably relieved when johnsons shift ended he went down to the refectory a couple of doctors were in there talking while they ate about how they could reacquaint themselves with the state of the art once they got back to earth theyd been weightless only since reviving aboard the admiral peary johnson was jealous of them he couldnt go all the way home again he got himself a choppedmeat sandwich and a squeeze bottle full of rhubarb juice the juice wasnt badwas damn good in fact he wouldnt have been surprised if somebody on the starship were fermenting it the meat was full of pepper and cumin and other spices that helped keep people from thinking about what it was rat or guinea pig the admiral peary hadnt brought along any regular domestic animals and the frozen beef and pork and lamb was long gone the rodents could livecould thriveon the vegetable waste from the hydroponic farm better just to contemplate them as meat in came lieutenant general healey that did more to spoil johnsons appetite than remembering that he was eating a rat sandwich how many steaks could you carve off of healey or would he prove inedibly tough that was johnsons guess the commandant hadnt missed any meals his face was full his body was round if what he ate ever bothered him he didnt let it show johnson eyed him again in a different way this time healey was bound to have even more pay saved up than mickey flynn did but with that scowl on the commandants face all the money in the world wouldnt turn him into a sugar daddy johnson quickly looked away when healeys radar gaze swung toward him not quickly enough thoughthe commandant got his food and then glided toward a handhold near the one johnson was using well healey asked why are you staring at me is my fly unzipped no sir johnson said tonelessly the trousers they wore didnt have flies well then im not lana turner either healey hopelessly dated himself with that crack johnson also hopelessly dated got it with no trouble did anyone on the commodore perry even know who lana turner was they leered at the lovely rita these daysnot that she wasnt worth leering at herself no sir johnson said again leering at healey for any reason was a really scary thought then keep your eyes to yourself the commandant snapped the only other reason youd stare at me that way is to figure out where to stick the knife he took a big bite of his sandwich but johnson shook his head oh no sir ha healey jeered a likely story its true sir johnson insisted i dont need to figure it out ive known for a long time they eyed each other in perfect mutual loathing no matter what kassquit had told ttomalss about her emotional state she clung to frank coffey now i hope you come back she said and used an emphatic cough so do i he answered and used one of his own i will do everything i can i want to see you again and i want to see our hatchling and if i have trouble coming back for any reason perhaps you and the hatchling can come to tosev you and that little male or female are bridges between the empire and tosevites truth kassquit said tears ran down her cheeks i wish you were not going we both knew i would sooner or later coffey said the coming of the commodore perry has made it sooner that is all he shook his head i did not think i would be leaving as a sire though i will say that it makes things more difficult do something for me if i can she said what is it try not to hate me after i am gone i would not do that she said i hope not he said sometimes though after these things end it happens it is a way of telling yourself he is gone so he could not have been any good while he was here remembering how shed felt after jonathan yeager returned to the surface of tosev and especially after he formed his permanent mating alliance with karen kassquit made the affirmative gesture she saw how doing as frank coffey said might make her feel better in a small voice she told him i will try not to good coffey said and one other thing when the hatchling comes try to let it get to know both members of the race and wild tosevites there will be a good many males and females from the commodore perry here their physician no doubt did not expect to take care of a hatchling but i think he will do a good job he probably knows more than dr blanchard does just because the state of the art has moved forward since she went into cold sleep he said such things as if they were as natural as sunrise or as stars coming out at night even as kassquit had that thought she made the negative gesture shed grown up in space there the stars were always out shed had to get used to their being gone during the day to the wild big uglies change and technical advances were natural were that untrue they never would have built the commodore perry for a whole swarm of reasons kassquit wished they hadnt i will do that she said the hatchling will be a citizen of the empire but it will know more of its biological heritage than i ever did and i will do my best to make sure that it does not become an experimental animal the way i did she added an emphatic cough to her words good frank coffey caressed her and kissed her believe me i like your biological heritage he had a way of showing enthusiasm without an emphatic cough they lay down together the last time kassquit thought she did her best to make the most of it the next morning the american tosevites from the admiral peary got into the bus that would take them to the shuttlecraft port atvar got on the bus too he was going to tosev as final proof that the commodore perry was what the wild big uglies claimed it was no one on home really doubted it any more the tosevites on the new starship already knew about things speedoflight transmission from tosev was just now revealing here but the race wanted to see for itself and the big uglies had agreed shiplord straha and shuttlecraft pilot nesseref also boarded the bus they would not be going back to tosev they were colonists no more the american tosevites could not be sure they would not deliver a message ordering kirel and reffet to start a last desperate war and kassquit got on too up till the last moment she had not been sure whether she would but she did she would stretch things out to the very end if that made the hurt that would follow worse then it did that was all much of the talk aboard the bus was in english even straha spoke the language well i should have learned it kassquit thought once more my hatchling will learn it a tosevite should know a tosevite language after a little while frank coffey told her i am sorry this must be boring for you i wish it were boring kassquit said i do not understand what you are saying but that is not the same thing i do not know how long it will be before i see you again i do not know if i will ever see you again it is hard but it is not boring i am sorry he repeated this is a chance to go home again i understand kassquit said i do understand but it is not easy for me whether i understand or not atvar and straha got into a shouting match which distracted everyone else they seemed to be trying to decide which of them was the bigger idiot by the way they were behaving it was a contest they both wanted to lose atvar had made it very plain he did not like straha straha seemed to be doing his best to show it was mutual enough nesseref exclaimed after a while you will scandalize the big uglies truth atvar said with such dignity as he could muster it is enough straha straha only laughed at thata huge rude tonguewagging laugh you say that because you know you are in the wrong there is no other reason if you thought you were right you would tell me so i do think i am right and in a moment i will put my toeclaws up your cloaca to prove it atvar retorted i am not afraid of you straha said enough that wasnt nesserefit was sam yeager both of you are my friends and both of you are acting like hatchlings the two prominent males hadnt really listened to the shuttlecraft pilot any more than theyd listened to each other they did heed the departing american ambassador straha said perhaps this is not the ideal time or place perhaps it is not atvar agreed after i return after you return i will be at your service straha said when you get to tosev you will also see the other ways the wild big uglies have got ahead of us if we had only done as i wanted enough this time all the american tosevites shouted it together a volley of emphatic coughs rang out when they got to the shuttlecraft port the row threatened to break out anew the american tosevites got between the two angry males of the race jonathan yeager spoke to atvar i am bigger than you are exalted fleetlord and my sire is bigger than the shiplord between the two of us i hope we can keep the two of you from disgracing yourselves and the race i think you have just called us barbarians atvar said mournfully what have you been acting like jonathan yeager asked after that atvar and straha really did subside embarrassment was a weapon more potent than many females and males in the body paint of security examined everything that would be going up on the shuttlecraft we cannot be too careful they said over and over a darkscaled rabotev pilot awaited them eyestalks turning this way and that nesseref went up to himor perhaps herand started talking shop kassquit turned to frank coffey do you see they still worry that a member of the race might smuggle ginger he found it less funny than she did if lots of our ships are going to come from tosev to home they are going to have to worry about it either that or they will have to start to accept ginger the way the race has on tosev more changes kassquit said sadly more changes coffey agreed a male whose body paint proclaimed him a security chief bawled final check all boarding the shuttlecraft form a line here he pointed reveling in his petty power along with atvar all the tosevites except kassquit formed a line there the security males eye turrets swung toward her what about you i am not going i am a citizen of the empire she answered the male started to challenge her but atvar spoke quietly to him he hissed in irritation then he shrugged one of the few gestures the race and tosevites shared frank coffey stepped out of line the security male hissed again coffey ignored him he came up to kassquit for one last embrace take care of yourself he said i will be back if i possibly can i know i believe you kassquit said in a way she was lucky she had no idea how many tosevite males had made that same promise to gravid tosevite females without the slightest intention of keeping it some of course did but not all she added i hope everything goes well for you so do i he said and smiled what even she recognized as a tight little smile here he washere all the american big uglies weretrusting to a technology that was anything but proved the race was more sensible and would never have allowed anything so risky that was one reason the big uglies now had fasterthanlight travel while the race had never even looked for it very hard the rest of the americans and atvar started out of the terminal building and toward the shuttlecraft frank coffey let kassquit go i have to leave i know she said again i will not cry in front of him that was her last determination she managed to hold on to it as he let the security male wave a metaldetecting wand around him one more time then he hurried after the rest of the wild big uglies the door to the field closed and kassquit dissolved in tears the males and females of the race in the terminal stared at her they had no idea what to make of the display or what to do about it she wished for a soft cloth to wipe her snout it always dripped mucus when she cried the plumbing between it and her eyes was crossconnected in some strange way here the back of her forearm had to do as it did for her eyes when her vision finally cleared she found straha standing in front of her she started to bend into the posture of respect straha made the negative gesture no need to bother with that foolishness not for me he said i am only a writer these days not a shiplord i just wanted to tell you that you have turned out better than those who took you have any right to expect kassquit did not feel better she felt worse shed known she would but knowing didnt help she tried to think of something that might make her less miserable to her surprise she did when you were on tosev superior sir did you ever meet the males called uh donald and mickey she pronounced the strange names with care now straha used the affirmative gesture i did i can see why you would want to know they are also luckier than they might have been but they make very strange males of the race their mouthparts can form all the sounds our language uses but they have accents anywaythey are used to speaking english they know of you by the way i have heard them say they would like to meet you i would like to meet them too kassquit said that is why i asked the shuttlecraft took off riding an almost colorless plume of hydrogen flame despite the soundproofing a dull roar filled the terminal misery filled kassquits liver she burst into tears again the chamber sam yeager got aboard the commodore perry was cramped but comfortable the starship accelerated out of homes solar system at a tenth of a g so he didnt have to get used to weightlessness again were heading off to where space flattens out one of the crew a woman told him casually that was evidently supposed to mean something but it didnt not to him he liked the little bit of weight he had it was enough to keep his feet on the floor and liquids in glasses though theyd slop out if he raised or lowered them too suddenly it also made him feel light and quick which was something he hadnt felt for yearsmaybe not since that broken ankle ruined his chances of making the big leagues even better than the low weight was the lower temperature hed spent too long in air that never got below the eighties and was often a lot warmer than that as southern californians were fond of saying it was a dry heat that made it more tolerable than its alabama equivalent would have been even so there was a difference between tolerable and pleasant he rediscovered long pants and long sleeves aboard the commodore perry he also thanked god that he wasnt a nineteenthcentury british diplomat doomed to wear full victorian formal finery no matter what tropical hellhole washington dc for instance he found himself in those nineteenthcentury british diplomats had died like flies he suspected the americans on home would have done the same if theyd gone around in tuxedo jackets and heavy wool trousers the most he ever said to any of the crew was it could be worse if you dont believe me ask your colleagues on home when you get back there he didnt even add an emphatic cough he reveled in fried chicken and real hens eggs and orange juice and pineapple and ice cream and string beans and carrots and pork chops and mashed potatoes and coffee and cocacola and all the other familiar things hed done without for too long quite a bit of what hed eaten on home had been tolerable some of it had been pretty good but all of it had been exoticliterally so in that it and he had evolved separately for several billion years part of him knew that every time he took a bite little by little he began to realize he was almost as alien to the crew of the commodore perry as smoked zisuili ribs were to his taste buds and digestive tract that wasnt just because of what hed done in the s and what had happened to indianapolis either some of them thought he was an ogre for that others didnt like him they saw lizards no less than human beings as people but he remembered the days before the conquest fleet came to earth he not only remembered them hed been shaped by them to the crew of the commodore perry that made him a neanderthal the very language they spoke was subtly different from his hed started noticing that with major nichols oh the crew understood what he said but the way he said it often made them smile and he mostly understood what they said toobut only because he was also fluent in the races language a lot of it wouldnt have been english when he went into cold sleep such changes had already started before he went on ice people had begun peppering their sentences with emphatic and interrogative coughs and using them by themselvessomething the lizards always found barbarous but theyd gone further since words and phrases from the races language got treated as if they were english by all the signs they were english now even word order occasionally shifted the commodore perry s crew didnt notice they were doing anything out of the ordinary we just talk one of them said as far as she was concerned the emphatic cough she added was as much a part of the language as the words that had gone before it little by little sam realized he was the one who was out of the ordinary had shakespeare read hemingway the bard would have felt the same jolt he would obviously have been reading english he would have been able to make sense of most of it just as obviously it wouldnt have been the language he was used to using most of the time people didnt notice how language changed around them because they got the changes one by one piece by piece they all fell in sams lap at once he didnt have the time he needed to get used to them he wasnt the only one from the admiral peary to feel the same way its a good thing we didnt have to go back into cold sleep dr blanchard said at supper one evening wed be like ancient romans trying to deal with italian sam suspected they might be like romans trying to deal with the modern world in other ways too he didnt even try to use some of the controls in his room because he couldnt figure out what they were supposed to do one of caesars legionaries behind the wheel of a chevy could have been no more confused when he said as much jonathan asked why havent you asked one of the crew about them because i dont want to look like a rube sam answered have you asked what is that button with the gold star what does it do does it change the air conditioning or is it the emergency switch theres no label on it youre just supposed to know and i dont his son didnt answer him neither did anyone else from the admiral peary sam smiled to himself unless he was very much mistaken none of the other rip van winkles knew what that button with the gold star was for any more than he did they hadnt wanted to look like rubes either he did eventually find out but not from the brisk polite halfforeign young crewfolk of the commodore perry atvar happened to tell him it controlled the softness of the mattress the lizard hadnt been embarrassed to ask his countrymen hadnt built the ship he said i never have understood why so many tosevites prefer to sleep on a raised area from which they might fall that aside though the arrangement is comfortable enough i am glad you are satisfied fleetlord sam said hoping atvar hadnt figured out that he hadnt known about the button is the food to your taste tolerable atvar answered of course i ate tosevite food before the colonization fleet brought our own domesticated animals and plants as long as i add enough salt it is not too bad what the race thought of as enough salt was too much by human standards lizards put salt on bacon after some meals in sitneff sam had felt like a piece of beef jerky dr blanchard had clucked about what all that sodium was doing not only to his blood pressure but to everybody elses if the humans ate local food though they had no choice but to eat the salt that went with it this whole starship i find fascinating atvar said how do you mean because it can go faster than light sam asked noand yes the fleetlord replied the males and females here have made sure i have nothing to do with that as is only sensible from their point of view but our starships are all like your admiral peary they are designed to take passengers in cold sleep this one has passengers and crew who are all fully awake and has to have facilities for feeding them and bathing them and keeping them entertained oh by the way i find your showers too weak and puny to do a proper job of cleaning and what you call soap does not deserve the name well fleetlord when i was in sitneff i always wondered whether your showers or your soap would do a better job of flaying the hide off me sam said it all depends i suppose on whether you have scales any proper creature but atvar caught himself no that is not so you tosevites have taught us otherwise he aimed an accusing fingerclaw at sam you tosevites have taught us all sorts of things we had not known quite a few of them we would have been just as glad not to learn too you cannot always pick and choose about what you would learn and what you would not yeager said that too is a truth atvar agreed just how bitter a truth it is we are still in the process of discovering he skittered down the corridor his gait was even odder in low gravity than humans gliding leaps sam was not given access to the commodore perry s control room neither was anyone else from the admiral peary so he didnt have to take that personally he couldnt look out into space instead he had to make do with what the monitor in his chamber showed him the image was very fine but it wasnt the same home had rapidly faded behind the starship lost in the skirts of its sun tau ceti itself went from a sun to no more than the brightest star in the black sky but sam could have seen the same kind of thing from the admiral peary as it left the solar system if he hadnt been in cold sleep when he asked the crew what going faster than light felt like he got different answers most said it didnt feel like anything one shrugged her shoulders and said id been on duty till an hour before i slept through it a few though a few said things like it was very strange when he tried to press them further he got nowhere whatever the experience was it wasnt something they could put into words two of them said the same thing maybe youll find out one spoke matteroffactly the other with a certain somber relish sam wondered whether he ought to hope he was one of the majority who went through whatever it was without even noticing he also wondered whether lizards might feel the transition differently from humans when he mentioned that to atvar though the fleetlord said straha and nesseref made this journey without harm neither told me of noting anything unusual at the transition had the crew not informed them of it they would not have known it had taken place i see i thank you sam said well in that case i do not suppose you have anything to worry about atvar made the negative gesture there i must disagree with you ambassador i have a great many things to worry about it is only that that does not happen to be one of them you are right of course yeager said please forgive me no forgiveness is necessary atvar replied i thank you for your concern i wonder what the sky will look like when we make the switch sam said this has also occurred to me atvar said i would rather see it for myself than on a monitor there it could all too easily prove to be nothing but a special effect but if we suddenly find ourselves in the neighborhood of tosev then that concern will fall by the wayside do you doubt that we will sam asked i cannot doubt that this ship traveled from tosev to home in the time described atvar answered but this is tosevite technology which means it is bound to be inadequately tested can i doubt that it will work perfectly twice in a row oh yes ambassador i have no trouble doubting that none at all except for the elevated bed instead of a simple sleeping mat atvar found nothing to complain about in the accommodations the big uglies had given him they did a better job of taking care of members of the race than the race did for tosevites of course theyd had more practice than the race had too how long will that be so atvar wondered he could easily see swarms of big uglies coming to home either simply as tourists or armed with the getrichquick schemes they hatched so effortlessly if the race didnt learn how to take care of them theyd take care of themselves they probably wouldnt try to colonize home not the way the race had colonized tosev but with their furious energy they might end up taking big bites out of the races world anyway or this ship might blow up instead of doing what it is supposed to do atvar hadnt been joking when he mentioned the possibility to sam yeager the big uglies always took big bites out of things that was a great part of what made them what they were sometimes though they bit off more than they could swallow days crawled by one after another then there were only tenths of a day leftor since this was a tosevite ship hours why the big uglies divided days into twentyfour parts each of those into sixty and each of those into sixty instead of sticking to multiples of ten had always perplexed atvar but then a lot of the other things they did perplexed him much more he waited in his cabin for the change he did not want company not even sam yeagers whatever happened would happen he would deal with the consequences if he lived he hadnt been afraid either time he went into cold sleep hed been sure he would wake up again cold sleep at least for the race had tens of thousands of years of development behind it going faster than light how many times had the big uglies tried it it had worked once that was all atvar knew english came out of the intercom someone was announcing something atvar hadnt learned much english on tosev and had forgotten most of that the american big uglies from the admiral peary spoke the races language so well he hadnt had to worry about english with them but now he was on an american ship people on the commodore perry spoke the races tongue too but english was the ships routine language and then apparently for him alone came a sentence in the language of the race transition with come in one tenth of a daytenth so please find somewhere comfortable to sit or lie down it shall be done atvar said aloud he assumed the big uglies monitored his cabin he noted no one instructed him to strap himself in that made sense if something went wrong here a safety belt around his middle would do him no good he waited a tenth of a daytenth wasnt a long time but hed never known what the big uglies would have called fifteen minutes to pass so slowly he kept wondering whether the time had already gone by but glances at the watch on his wrist kept telling him the answer was no the watch wasnt his the big uglies had given it to him they wanted to make sure he had nothing that could signal reffet and kirel when he got to tosev herethis really was the zero moment he felt noth no sooner had the thought started to form in his head than he knew an instantno more than an instantof being mentally turned upside down and inside out he let out a startled hiss but the moment had passed by the time the sound escaped it was far and away the most peculiar sensation hed ever felt he wondered if it was real or if hed just imagined it then he wondered if for something like this there was any difference more english came out of the intercom then again for his benefit the big ugly at the microphone switched to the races language transition was successful we are now shaping course for tosev the image of the big uglies home planet appeared in the monitor its large moon off to one side images in monitors proved nothing no one knew that better than atvar but he also knew nothing hed experienced before was the least bit like the moment the tosevites called transition he believed in his belly that the commodore perry had leaped across the lightyears someone knocked on the door to his chamber to him that was a tosevite barbarism he vastly preferred a hisser but the big uglies had built this ship to please themselves not him when he opened the door he found sam yeager standing in the corridor i greet you the whitehaired american said did you feel anything yes atvar made the affirmative gesture not vertigo what vertigo would feel if it felt vertigo maybe yourself something like that i think yeager answered you put it better than i could have what vertigo would feel yes that comes as close as anything the funny thing is though i talked to several crewmales and females as i came over here and only one of them felt anything at all i have no idea what that means or whether it means anything i prefer to think it means you and i are highly superior to those insensitive louts atvar said and sam yeager laughed loudly the fleetlord went on i do not know whether that is a truth but i prefer to think it fine i will think the same thing i do not know whether it is a truth either but i like it fine yeager said how soon will the ship go into orbit around tosev atvar asked you are asking the wrong male i fear sam yeager said i am only a passenger and not privileged to know such things one of the crewfolk would surely have a better idea than i do perhaps but i do not care to talk to them atvar said well fleetlord to tell you the truth neither do i sam yeager said of course i have no doubt they feel the same way about me they are three or four generations younger than i am and our customs and ways of thinking have changed from my time to theirs i do not believe all the changes are for the better but they would disagree customs and ways of thinking had changed very little among the race for millennia even something so small as the fad for a tosevite appearance among the young had taken atvar by surprise when he came back to home he knew yeager was talking about much more important differences hed seen them himself one reason big uglies changed faster than members of the race was that they didnt live as long that made a hundred of their years seem like a long time to them hardly anyone hatched at the beginning of such a span would be alive at the end of it which was far from true among the race new tosevites could quickly come to prominence and bring new ideas with them atvar let free a mental sigh shortening the lifespan was not a solution the empire would embrace i thank you ambassador he said aloud i shall just have to wait and see for myself whenever he looked at it in a monitor tosev got bigger and closer after his long absence he was struck again by how blue and watery the big uglies world looked he had come to take land outweighing ocean for granted again that was how things worked on home and the other two worlds belonging wholly to the empire not so here of course everything he was seeing could be just some clever special effect the race could have produced this atvar had no reason to doubt that the americans could do the same the only way he could be sure was to go down to the surface of the planet the crewmember he had to talk to about that was major nicole nichols he did not look forward to talking to her about anything he wondered if she would refuse just for the fun of it but she did not she said you go right ahead exalted fleetlord as usual she sounded sarcastic when she used his title we want you to be sure you have come to tosev we do not want you to think we are trying to trick you in any way shape form color or size then we will send you back to home and you can let everyone there know that you made a round trip i thank you atvar was not really feeling gratefulon the contrary he wished the big uglies were trying to fool him then they would not have this stunning technology but they all too plainly did except for the pilot he went down to tosev alone in the shuttlecraft the american tosevites from the admiral peary stayed behind going first was an honor he could have done without especially when he saw that the shuttlecraft pilot was a big ugly he told himself hed just come lightyears with a big ugly at the helm of the starship getting down from orbit to the planetary surface should be easy telling himself such things helpedsome i greet you the pilot told him after that most of what she said on the radio was in incomprehensible english every so often she would use the language of the race to talk to an orbiting ship or a ground station the big uglies could have faked the responses coming back from those ships and stationsbut it wouldnt have been easy as the shuttlecraft came down out of orbit deceleration pressed the fleetlord into his seat it was made to conform to the contours of a member of the race and did the job well enough everything seemed routine the only difference he noted was that he would have understood more of the chatter with someone from his own species piloting the tosevite seemed highly capable tosevites were highly capable in no small measure that was what was wrong with them he watched the monitor a large city swelled below him there was the shuttlecraft port rockets fired one more time killing the shuttlecrafts velocity the grounding was as smooth as any a pilot from the race might have made well exalted fleetlord here we are in los angeles the big ugly said yes atvar said in a hollow voice here we are the pilot opened the hatch cool moist outside air poured into the shuttlecraft as it flowed over the scent receptors on atvars tongue he smelled odors both alien from billions of years of separate evolution and familiar because he had smelled such things before down deep in his liver he knew he was on tosev go on out exalted fleetlord the pilot said i thank you atvar said meaning anything but when he poked his head out of the hatch his eyes confirmed what logic and his scent receptors had already told him he was on tosev the color of the sky the shapes of the buildings and carsthis was not his world big uglies in wrappings that covered almost their entire bodies ran toward him from all directions some of them had guns in their hands come with us exalted fleetlord one of them called should i surrender first atvar inquired that will not be necessary the american tosevite replied taking him literally we are here for your protection i did not realize i needed so much protecting atvar remarked as he came down the ladder instead of answering that the big ugly continued we are also here to make sure you do not communicate with members of the race here before you go back to home do you need so many to do the job the fleetlord asked as his toeclaws clicked on concrete it seems more as if you are putting me in prison call it whatever you please the tosevite sounded altogether indifferent with the commodore perry gone from the sky with atvar and the americans from the admiral peary gone on the astonishing new starship home suddenly seemed a backwater to ttomalss even though big uglies from the commodore perry remained behind this was no longer the place where things happened in ancientest history the race had believed that the sun revolved around home males and females had known better for well over a hundred thousand years even though they knew better the idea had kept a kind of metaphysical truth ever since not only the sun seemed to spin around home so did the stars rabotev and halless and the worlds that spun around them and so had the star tosev and its worlds most notably tosev no more now events had literally left the homeworld behind the most important things that happened for a while wouldnt happen on home they would happen on tosev even now not many members of the race realized that most males and females went on with their lives neither knowing nor caring that events might have passed their whole species by mating season was coming soon if they worried about anything it was getting ready for the spell of orgiastic chaos ahead as for ttomalss he did what any academic will do when faced with a stretch of time when nothing else urgently needs doing he wrote reports and analyses of the dealings between the race and the diplomats from the admiral peary even as he wrote he understood that much of what he was recording was already as obsolete as one of the races starships he wrote anyhow the record would have historical value if nothing else no matter how dedicated an academic he was he couldnt write all the time when he went down to the refectory for a snack one afternoon he found trir there ahead of him the tour guide was in a foul temper those big uglies she said a couple of tosevites sat in the refectory though some distance away trir made not the slightest effort to keep her voice down what is the trouble with them ttomalss asked he spoke quietly hoping to lead by example a forlorn hopetrir didnt seem to notice the example he set what is the trouble she echoed at the top of her lung they are the most insulting creatures ever hatched they insulted you ttomalss asked i hope you did nothing to cause it no not me trir said impatiently they have insulted home how did they do that why did they do that ttomalss asked why because they are barbarous big uglies that is why trir still did nothing to keep her voice down how they had the nerve to complain about the lovely weather sitneff enjoys and that all the architecture here looks the same as if it should not we build buildings the right way so they look the way they should i have some sympathy at least in the abstract for their complaints about the weather it is warmer here than it is on tosev what is comfortable for us is less so for them ttomalss said i should say so trir exclaimed the air conditioners they brought down from this new ship of theirs chill their rooms until i think i am back at the south pole or maybe somewhere beyond it ttomalss tried to figure out what on home might be beyond the south pole he gave it up as a bad job trir didnt care whether she was logical ttomalss said you see you dislike the weather they prefer as much as they dislike ours but ours is proper and normal trir was not the sort to think that several billion years of separate evolution could produce different choices she judged everything from the simplest of perspectives her own as for architecture they have more variety than we do ttomalss said they enjoy change for its own sake i told you they were barbarians as if sure shed made a decisive point trir got up and stormed out of the refectory ttomalss sighed trir came closer to the average member of the race in the street than any other male or female he knew her reaction to the big uglies wasnt encouraging how would the race react to tosevite tourists here on home could simple dislike spark trouble where politics didnt the tour guide hurried back into the refectory as angry as when shed left it she pointed a clawed forefinger at ttomalss and the horrible creatures had the nerve to say we were backward backward she added and stormed out again did they ttomalss said but he was talking to trirs retreating tailstump his eye turrets swung to the big uglies in their specially made chairs theyd paid no attention to trirs outburst did that mean they hadnt understood it or hadnt heard it he didnt think so not for a moment it meant they were being diplomatic which was more than trir could say who was the barbarian then ttomalss head started to ache he hadnt wanted that thought right now whether hed wanted it or not hed got it so the big uglies thought home was backward had the americans from the admiral peary presumed to say such a thing ttomalss would have been as furious as trir the tosevites from the commodore perry hadnt they earned the right from a tosevite perspective home probably was a backward place but it had proved it could prosper and stay peaceful for tens of millennia if the big uglies dragged their competing notempires and empires and the empire into a string of ruinous wars what price progress the psychologist could see what the price of progress would be higher than anyone in his right mind wanted to pay but now he could also see what the price of backwardness was having moved forward technologically at such a slow pace over the millennia the race was vulnerable to a hardcharging species like the big uglies with hindsight that was obvious but no one here had imagined a species like the big uglies could exist we knew ourselves and we knew the rabotevs and hallessi who are like us in most ways and we extrapolated that all intelligent species would be similar that was reasonable based on the data we had it was logical and oh how wrong it was he glumly finished his food and left the refectory no histrionics from him his swiveling eye turrets noted the big uglies turning their heads so their eyes could follow him out oh yes theyd heard what trir had to say to him all right escaping the hotel was a relief as it often was he walked down the street toward the public telephone hed used before every time he passed a male or female wearing a fuzzy wig or what the big uglies called a tshirt he wanted to shout members of the race had taken to imitating tosevites out of amusement would they keep on doing it now that the tosevites were no longer amusing but powerful he thought the races power was the main reason so many big uglies on tosev had shaved their heads and started wearing body paint that showed ranks to which they were not entitled would power attract more males and females here now that the situation was reversing he wouldnt have been surprised monitoring such things would make an interesting experimentfor someone else when he got to the phone he swung his eye turrets in all directions if that gingertasting female and her hoodlum friends were around he would take himself elsewhere as fast as he could go he did not see any of them feeling safe because he didnt he telephoned pesskrag impatience and worry overwhelmed the careful logic of a few days before the phone hissed several times in his hearing diaphragm he was afraid he would have to record a message but then she answered this is pesskrag i greet you and i greet you this is ttomalss he said ah hello senior researcher the physicist said let me tell you right out of the eggshell we have made no dramatic breakthroughs since the last time i talked with you all right ttomalss might have been hoping for such a breakthrough but he hadnt counted on one he gave himself that much credit anyhow science seldom worked so conveniently i hope you have not gone backwards though well no or i also hope not pesskrag answered we may even have taken one or two tiny steps forward once we devise some new experiments we will have a better notion of whether we have we have opened a door and entered a new room so far it is a dark room we are trying not to trip over the furniture the big uglies charged all the way through to the other side ttomalss said why can we not do the same it is less simple than you think pesskrag said what we have are only the early hints that appeared in the tosevite literature i gather the big uglies stopped publishing after that we have to reconstruct what they did after they stopped giving us hints no matter how provocative the early experiments this is not an easy matter we do not want to waste time going down blind alleys and so we waste time being thorough ttomalss said the physicist let out an angry hiss i fear i am wasting time talking to you senior researcher good day she broke the connection as ttomalss was unhappily walking back to the hotel a male wearing the body paint of a bus repairer accosted him hello friend the stranger said so heartily that ttomalss suspicions kindled at once want to buy some ginger if you do not mind selling to an officer of the police ttomalss answered the repairmale disappeared in a hurry ttomalss wished he were a police officer he would have been glad to arrest the petty criminal kassquit was standing in the hotel lobby when ttomalss came in i greet you superior sir she said sketching the posture of respect and i greet you he said i hope you are feeling well i am as well as can be expected anyhow kassquit answered this new tosevite physician says the same thing dr blanchard didmy gravidity seems normal to them however nasty it is for me how are you emotionally ttomalss said you do seem less distressed at frank coffeys departure than you did when jonathan yeager first returned to tosev i am less distressed she said most of the time i am anyhow my moods do swing the wild big uglies say this has to do with hormone shifts during gravidity but i have experience now that i did not have when jonathan yeager left me and frank coffey may come back where jonathan yeager entered into that permanent mating contract so yes i remain more hopeful than i was then good i am glad to hear it whatever you may think i have done my best to raise you so that you would become a fully independent person ttomalss said i know i have made mistakes i think that is inevitable when raising someone of another species i am sorry for it ttomalss said your biggest mistake might have been to try to raise someone of another species at all kassquit said i understand why you did it the wild big uglies did the same thing no doubt you and they learned a great deal that still does not make it easy for the individuals who have to go through it when shed been angry before shed said worse things to himand about him i am afraid it is too late to change that now ttomalss said for what has happened to you you have done very well kassquit didnt quarrel with that which left him more relieved than hed thought it would the shuttlecrafts rockets roared deceleration shoved up at karen yeager the pilot said final approach now the rockets are radarcontrolled they fire automatically and nothing can go wrong go wrong go wrong go wrong on the couch beside karens jonathan grunted funny he said funny like a crutch karen nodded that took effort after onetenth g and weightlessness she felt heavy as lead weighing more than she normally would the rockets fell silent three soft bumps meant the shuttlecrafts landing struts had touched the ground earth one earth gravity normal weight karen still felt heavy as lead she said i could use that funny crutch right now you said it sam yeager agreed from beyond jonathan are you all right she asked him he was spry no doubt about it but he wasnt a young man what was hard on her and jonathan had to be worse for him ill do he answered we had to twist their arms to get them to let me come back here ill be darned if ill give em the satisfaction of keeling over the minute i get home there you go dad jonathan said the pilot undogged the hatch and flipped it open the air that came into the shuttlecraft was damp and cool and smelled of the sea the way it usually did around the los angeles international air and spaceport karen smiled before she even knew she was doing it to her this was the feel and smell of home she and jonathan had grown up in the south bay only a few miles from la international all ashore thats going ashore the pilot said determined to be a comedian im not going first this time sam yeager said if i fall off the ladder i want you youngsters to catch me maybe he was trying to be funny too more likely he was kidding on the square ladies first jonathan said so karen took the ladder down to the tarmac jonathan followed a moment later whew he said when he got to the bottom full gravity was pressing on and oppressing him too his father descended then karen tensed to help sam if he had any trouble but he didnt if anything he stood more easily than she and jonathan did well well he said weve got a welcoming committee only thing i dont see is the brass band karen didnt see a brass band either what she did see were cops and soldiers all around pistols and rifles at the ready the soldiers uniforms looked something like the ones shed known in but only something the same applied to their weapons a captainher rank badge hadnt changed anywaywho surely hadnt been born in came up to the yeagers please come with me folks she said like weve got a choice jonathan said she gave him a reproachful look do you really want to stand on the cement for the rest of the day she added an interrogative cough since you put it that way no karen said just dont go too fast weve been light for a while the shuttlecraft terminal was a lot bigger and fancier than karen remembered some of the columns supporting things looked as if theyd fall down in a goodsized earthquake karen hoped that meant building techniques had improved not that people had stopped worrying about quakes she and her husband and her fatherinlaw didnt have much luggage customs officials pounced on what they did have were going to irradiate this one of them declared for gods sake why karen asked who knows what sort of creatures youre bringing back from home the woman answered isnt that locking the barn door after the horse is gone sam asked we dont think so the customs inspector replied the lizards have brought in what they wanted here thats been bad enough but who knows what sort of fungi or pest eggs youre carrying we dont want to find out and sointo the xray machine everything goes do you want us to take off what were wearing karen inquired she intended it for sarcasm but the inspector turned and started talking with her boss after a moment she turned back and nodded yes i think you had better do that you come with me mrs yeager a couple of male inspectors took charge of jonathan and sam thatll teach me to ask questions when i dont really want to know the answers karen thought she stripped and sat draped in a towel till they deigned to give her back her clothes she half expected to see smoke rising from her shoes when she finally did get them back but they seemed unchanged the inspector led her out of the waiting room her husband and fatherinlaw emerged from another one five minutes later boy that was fun jonathan said wasnt it just his father agreed are we all right now he asked one of the inspectors riding herd on him we think so sir the man answered seriously were going to take the chance anyhow he sounded like a judge reluctantly letting some dangerous characters out on parole signs and painted arrows led the yeagers to the reception area waiting there were more cops and soldiers some of them were holding reporters at bay which seemed a worthwhile thing to do others kept a wary eye on karen and jonathan and sam what do they think well do karen wondered this time she didnt ask somebody might have told her also waiting in the reception area were two men about halfway between jonathan and sam in age and two lizards karen saw that the lizards were mickey and donald a heartbeat before she realized the two men had to be her sons shed known time had marched on for them shed known yes but she hadnt known now the knowledge hit her in the belly it hit richard and bruce at the same time and just about as hard they both seemed to go weak in the knees for a moment before they hurried forward mom dad grandpa they sounded disbelieving mickey and donald followed them then they were all embracing people and lizards alike tears ran down karens face and not hers alone everybody kept saying things like my god and i dont believe it and i never thought id see the day where are the grandchildren where are the greatgrandchildren karen asked add a generation for me please sam said and everybody laughed theyre at my house bruce answered im living in palos verdes south of where your house was sam pointed at donald you have a lot to answer for buster they drugged me donald said they held a gun to my head they waved money under my nose how was i supposed to tell them no he always was a ham mickey said sadly you always were a bore donald retorted and they always liked you best we did not karen jonathan and sam all said it at the same time karen and jonathan added emphatic coughs donalds face couldnt show much expression but his body language did what it showed was scorn i pretend to be human better than you people pretend to be lizards he said youve had more practice karen said mildly bruce said lets go to the cars shall we we can wrangle about this some more when we get back to my house the kids will want to get in on it and throw rocks too he sounded more weary than amused how often had this argument played itself outor more likely gone round and round without getting anywhere its a family of course it has squabbles karen thought two different sets of bodyguards formed up around them as they went to the parking lot one bunch belonged to donald celebrities had needed protection from their fans in karens day too she wasnt surprised to see that hadnt changed the other contingent kept an eye on her fatherinlaw that worried her the two groups of hardfaced men and women affected not to notice each other cars reminded her much more of the ones shed seen on home than those she remembered from before she went on ice the designs were simpler more sensible less ornate are any gasolineburners left she asked bruce shook his head richard held his nose karen wasnt surprised the cleaner air had made her suspect as much she hadnt been quite sure though with its constant sea breeze the airport had always had some of the best air in the la basin the ride down to palos verdes was strange it went through parts of town karen knew wellor had known well some of the buildings were still there others had vanished to be replaced by some that seemed as strange as the shuttlecraft terminal karen noticed sam doing even more muttering than she and jonathan were hed gone into cold sleep seventeen years earlier than they had the south bay had to look stranger to him than it did to them its not even like ive been away since he said after a while i only remember the time since i woke up in orbit around home and i keep thinking it couldnt have changed that much since then and it didntbut i have to keep reminding myself so do we karen said bruces house impressed her to her eye it seemed almost as big as the hotel where the americans had stayed in sitneff she soon realized that was an exaggeration but her son had done well for himself so had the other people whose large houses loomed on nearby large lots palos verdes had always been a place where people whod made it lived both sets of bodyguards piled out of their cars they formed a defensive perimeteror was it two people karen had never seen came spilling out of the house having children calling her grandmother would have been strange enough having grownups shed never seen before grownups approaching middle age calling her that felt positively surreal jonathan looked as shellshocked as she felt its a good thing they figured out how to go faster than light he said otherwise lots of people would have to try to get used to this and i think theyd go nuts it gives the lizards trouble and they live longer and change slower than we doand they dont have families the way we do either sam said but a lot of their males and females who travel from star to star have their own clique they understand how strange it is and nobody who hasnt done it can i know what i understand karen turned to her younger son who seemed to wear more years than she did i understand that i could use a drink she added an emphatic cough well that can be arranged bruce said come on in everybody and have a look around jonathan yeager felt besieged by relatives his grandchildren and greatgrandchildren seemed to know everything about him up till the minute he and karen went into cold sleep but that was almost forty years ago now and he didnt know anything about these people to him they might almost have been so many friendly strangers that went even for his sons richard and bruce still had the same basic personalities he rememberedrichard a little more like him bruce more outgoing like karenbut they werent college kids finding out about the world any more theyd had all those years to grow into themselves they seemed to have done a good job of it but he couldnt say he knew them the same went for mickey and donaldespecially donald he walked over to his father who was sitting with his legs crossed and a drink balanced on his right knee hi dad jonathan said congratulations oh yeah sam yeager looked up at him how come because of all the people here youre the only one whos even more out of it than i am jonathan answered oh his father thought that over then he said if it werent for the honor of the thing id rather walk only trouble is its a darn long walk back to home yeah that occurred to me too jonathan said were here well just have to make the best of it they wont throw us in the poorhouse anyhow weve got a lot of back pay coming to us hot diggety his father made a sour face do you suppose theres anybody else on the face of the earth who says hot diggety any more the more i listen to people nowadays the more im convinced i really do belong in a museum me and the neanderthals and the woolly mammoths and all the other things you wouldnt want to see in your driveway at three in the morning bruces daughter jessica was sitting a couple of feet away she smiled dont be silly greatgrandfather you can show up in my driveway any time you want thanks for all of that except the greatgrandfather sam yeager said it makes me feel a million years old and im notquite what do you want me to call you she asked how about sam its my name jonathans father pointed at him you can call this guy gramps though thanks a lot dad jonathan said any old time kiddoand i do mean old his father answered jessica looked from one of them to the other amusement danced in her eyes she was somewhere in her thirties a blueeyed blonde with strong cheekbones jonathan tried to see either himself or karen in her face and didnt have much luck maybe she looked like her mother the woman bruce hadnt stayed married to she said youre quite a pair arent you you should see us on tv jonathan said were funnier than donald and we dont have to paint ourselves into tuxes nopejust corners sam agreed jessica made a face at him he got to his feet i need another drink now that you mention it so do i jonathan followed him over to the bar his father picked up a bottle of bourbon he poured some into a glass then added ice cubes alcohol with flavorings i like by god and i dont have to get into a brawl with the lizards to get ice he raised his glass mud in your eye jonathan built a drink for himself same to you he said they both sipped jonathan wasnt so sure he liked bourbon any more it did taste like home though home with a small h richard came over to the two of them he made his own drinksomething with rum and fruit juice jonathan wouldnt have wanted it anywhere this side of a beachfront hotel at waikiki but his son was entitled to his own taste richard kept staring now at jonathan now at sam this is crazy youre going to laugh at me he said and added an emphatic cough you both look just the way i remember you but its been a hell of a long time you were a little kid when i went on ice sam said accusingly how come youre not a little kid any more richard hadnt been a little kid when jonathan went into cold sleep but he hadnt been older than his father by body time either they didnt look like father and son these days they looked like brothers and richard was definitely the more weathered of the two jonathan knocked back a good slug of bourbon im not laughing at anything right now he said its just starting to hit me that the country i grew up inthe country where i lived my whole lifeis almost as alien to me as home everything here seems strange to me so i dont know why i ought to be surprised that i seem strange to you thats fair enough i suppose his son said i hadnt really thought about what all this must be like from your point of view jonathan put a hand on his fathers shoulder its got to be even weirder for dad he went into cold sleep quite a while before i did thats only half the problem sam said the other half is i was born quite a while before you were all my attitudes are ancient history now ive tried to outgrow some of the worst ones but theyre still there down underneath i felt like a geezer in im worse than a geezer now christ its more than a hundred years since i tore up my ankle and turned into a minor leaguer for good that was in birmingham alabama and nobody thought anything of it when they made colored people sit by themselves in the lousy seats blacks jonathan said african americans richard said jonathan shook his head like a man in a bridge game whos been overtrumped three generations of yeagers three men whose births spanned more than sixty years by body time fewer than twenty years separated them and the one who should have been youngest was in the middle jonathan shook his head again such things shouldnt have been possible here they all were though richards wife came over to them diane yeager was younger than jonathans sonsay about the same age he was himself she didnt say a whole lot but jonathan got the impression she was hard to faze family group she remarked now her eyes going from her husband to his father to his grandfather family group jonathan agreed he suspected his voice sounded ragged so what though by god hadnt he earned the right to sound a little ragged just now three generations for the price of one she said you could all be brothers by body time they could have been not many sets of brothers were spread as far apart as the three of them but some were and yet youd have to go some to find three brothers as different as we are jonathan said cant be helped richard said we are what we are thats all and we have to make the best of it the fault dear brutus is not in the stars but in ourselves sam quoted except thats not true not this time if it werent for tau ceti everything would be normal he sipped from his drink of course i wouldnt be here so im not about to complain strictly by the calendar jonathan would turn ninety in december so he wasnt about to complain either can you imagine how strange it would be if there were thousands and thousands of families trying to sort this out he pointed to his father how much fun are you going to have trying to renew your drivers license when you tell a clerkor more likely a computeryou were born in sam winced hadnt thought of that yeah it ought to make some electronics start chasing their own tail how do the lizards handle it diane asked and started to laugh ive got three of the worlds best experts here to answer my question richard yeager looked to his father and grandfather i defer to the people whove been on the spot which i havent you know more about it than we do son jonathan said we were either stuck in a hotel trying to be diplomats or we were out being tourists which isnt exactly a scientists dream either thats about the size of it his father agreed besides since your wife asked only fair you should show off in front of her im sure shes never heard you do it before diane yeager snickered richard turned red he said the two big things the race has going for it are its longer lifespan and its different social structure it doesnt have families to be disrupted the way we do we were talking about this in the car on the way down in fact truth jonathan said in the races language he went on even so theres a clique of star travelers who stick together because they arent so connected to the present i suppose that would have happened with us too probably richard said better this way though now we dont have to spend some large part of our loved ones lifetime traveling from star to star before jonathan or his father could add anything to that donald came up to them he aimed one eye turret at jonathan the other at sam did the two of you have any ideaany idea at allwhat you were doing to mickey and me when you decided to raise us as people he demanded no jonathan and his father said at the same time sam went on do you know of kassquit the girl the race raised weve heard of her donald answered wed like to meet her one of these days if anybody would understand some of the things weve been through growing up shes the one shes said the same thing about the two of you jonathan said the race tried to raise a human as much like one of their kind as they could his father said we did the same thing with you when we met kassquit we realized how unfair that was to you but we were committed to doing it national security donald said scornfully he stuck out his tongue this for national security you ruined our lives for the sake of national security things could be worse jonathan pointed out youve made a lot of money people admire you millions of them watch you every night and mickeys prosperous too even if hes less public about it yes we have money you know that old saying about money and happiness its true donald said all the money in the world cant make up for the simple truth were sorry excuses for males of the race and were even sorrier excuses for humans you want to know how sorry i really do leer at rita because thats what a man would do i cant do anything with her even if i smelled pheromones from a female of the race and got excited i couldnt do anything with her but i leer anyway there they are hanging out and i stare at them what could you say to something like that jonathan looked to his father who didnt seem to have any idea either im sorry jonathan said at last we did the best we could i know that i never said you didnt donald answered but theres a goddamn big difference between that and good enough he used an emphatic cough it didnt sound like the one an ordinary lizard would have made he had most of the same accent a human englishspeaker would have all by itself that went a long way toward proving his point jonathan wondered again if coming home had been such a good idea after all of all the things glen johnson had looked for while orbiting home boredom was the last he didnt know why that was so hed spent a lot of time on the lewis and clark bored maybe hed thought seeing the lizards home planet would make sure he stayed interested no such luck this wasnt entirely bad he realized as much he and everybody else on the admiral peary could have had a very interesting time trying to fight off missiles from however many spaceships the lizards threw at them they wouldnt have lasted long but they wouldnt have had a dull moment still he had to fight not to go to sleep on watch back in the civil war they would have shot him for that when he was a kid hed known an old man who as a boy had shaken hands with abraham lincoln he wondered if anyone else still breathing a third of the way through the twentyfirst century could say that when he mentioned it to mickey flynn the other pilot said well i cant i had ancestors who fought in it people were willing to have irishmen shot to keep the country in one piece but not to give em a job once theyd managed to miss the bullets american generosity knows no bounds i dont know sounds fair to me johnson said and what could i expect from a sassenach flynn didnt put on a brogue but his speech pattern changed dont let it worry you johnson told him as far as the lizards are concerned were all riffraff they are a perceptive species arent they flynn said thats one word johnson said the commodore perry should be back on earth by now i wonder when itll come here again sooner than anything else is likely to flynn said johnson clapped his hands give the man a cigar not necessary the other pilot said modestly a small act of adoration will suffice adoration my johnson broke off with a snort he started a new hare i do wonder when the russians and the germans and the japanese will start flying faster than light the lizards are probably wondering the same thing i would be if i were in the shoes they dont wear flynn agreed johnson started to reply to that then he started trying to work through it after a few seconds he gave it up as a bad job right was all he did say mickey flynns nod announced anything else was unthinkable home spun past the reflectionless windows the admiral peary was coming up on sitneff clouds covered the city though the americans from the commodore perry were saying it might rain that didnt happen every day johnson hoped the johnnycomelatelies got wet it would serve them right he had little use for the greatgrandchildren of his oldtime friends and neighbors they struck him as intolerably arrogant and sure of themselves maybe theyd earned the right but even so no matter how much you influence people having friends is better johnson said and what inspired this burst of profundity flynns voice was gravely curious the punks downstairs johnson pointed to the clouded city where the americans lived oh them mickey flynn also spoke with noticeable distaste they arent the most charming people god ever made are they he answered his own question of course they arent all the people like that are aboard the admiral peary the intercom crackled to life colonel johnson colonel glen johnson report to the commandants office immediately colonel johnson colonel glen johnson over the noise johnson made a wry face and some who arent the most charming too oh well see you later alligator out of the control room he went as usual lieutenant general healey looked as if he wanted to bite something when johnson glided into his sanctum took you long enough the commandant growled reporting as ordered sir johnson replied blandly i would have been here sooner except for the traffic accident on route i had to wait till they towed away a station wagon and cleaned up the spilled gasoline healey looked more baleful than ever he probably wasnt thrilled at being stuck in command of the most obsolete starship the united states owned bullshit he said and waited for johnson to deny it when johnson just hung silently in midair healey scowled and went on i need you to fly a scooter to the horned akiss sir the lizards will search it eight ways from sunday johnson said i want your word of honor in writing in english and the races language that im not trying to smuggle ginger there is no ginger on the scooter healey spoke in a hard flat voice that defied johnson to contradict him johnson didnt he also made no move to leave the commandants office he kept waiting after some dark mutters healey grabbed an indelible pencilmuch more convenient in weightlessness than pens which needed pressurized ink to workand wrote rapidly he scaled the sheet of paper to johnson it flew through the air with the greatest of ease there are you satisfied to fit his personality healey should have had handwriting more illegible than a dentists he didnt instead it would have done credit to a thirdgrade teacher the commandants script in the language of the race was just as neat johnson carefully read both versions they said what he wanted them to say try as he would he found no weasel words yes sir this should do it ill take it with me to the scooter lock when they retire this ship colonel ill no longer have to deal with the likes of you healey said even growing obsolete has its benefits i love you too general johnson saluted then brachiated out of the commandants office as usual he stripped down to tshirt and shorts so he could put on his spacesuit when he stuck the folded piece of paper in the waistband of the shorts the technician on duty at the lock raised an eyebrow whats that he asked love letter to a lizard oh yeah johnson agreed their eye turrets drive me nuts he sighed as if in longing the tech snickered after boarding the scooter he ran through the checklist the technician had already cleared everything johnson did it anyhow the technician wasnt going to take the scooter out into hard vacuum and he was everything checked green he passed the word to the tech who opened the outer door to the air lock johnson used the scooters attitude jets to ease the little rocketship away from the admiral peary before firing up the main engine he called the horned akiss to make sure he was expected healey hadnt said word one about that but the answer came back in the language of the race yes scooter from the tosevite starship we await your arrival stop well away from the ship so that we may inspect you before you enter the air lock it shall be done johnson said that inspection wouldnt be for ginger the lizards would be making sure he wasnt bringing them a bomb the admiral peary did the same thing when lizard scooters approached nobody really expected trouble now but nobody took any chances either he aimed the scooter at the horned akiss then fired the rear motor away the little rocket went he liked nothing better than flying by the seat of his pants even if he did have radar to help a burn from the front motor killed the scooters velocity and left it hanging in space a couple of miles from the lizards ship one of their scooters came out to inspect it all appears to be in order a spacesuited member of the race radioed to him when they were done you may proceed to the horned akiss i thank you johnson answered can you tell me what this is all about not i the lizard replied the commandant will attend to it when you have gone aboard have it your way johnson said they would anyhow once in the horned akiss air lock he had to get out of his spacesuit with the heat the lizards preferred tshirt and shorts had a good deal going for them as a uniform males and females of the race went over the spacesuit and the scooter he showed them healeys pledge one of them said very nice we will continue the examination even so not worth the paper its written on he thought if healey had lied though maybe they wouldnt blame the mere pilot so much everything appears to be as it should a different lizard said after more than an hour we will escort you to medium spaceship commander henreps office i thank you johnson said once more for someone his size the corridors were narrow the handholds small and set at awkward intervals he managed even so when he got to the skippers office he found another lizard in there with henrep the captain said inspector this is the tosevite called glen johnson colonel johnson here we have police inspector second grade garanpo i greet you johnson said thinking unkind thoughts about lieutenant general healey healey hadnt lied to himoh no but even if the scooter didnt have any ginger aboard it this time he was still in trouble and i greet you garanpo said i am very glad to make your acquaintancei certainly am he took out a recorder which escaped from him and floated around till he caught it again johnson watched with interest a clumsy lizard was out of the ordinary having snagged the little gadget garanpo went on you have flown your scooter to this ship before is that not a truth yes that is a truth johnson wished he could deny it well well so you admit it then the male said why should i not i have done nothing wrong johnson said did i say you had inspector garanpo asked archly now thendid you ever bring gingerthis herb you tosevites haveto this ship no and i can prove it johnson answered i never knew i was bringing it anyway he didnt get into that as far as he was concerned the best defense was a good offense the proof is your males and females always inspected the scooter and you never found any ginger well that is a truth just as you say it is garanpo said but is it a proof that may be a different question if the inspectors were corrupt they would say they found nothing even if they lied and did they not find traces of ginger on the scooter from this ship after it was returned from its exchange i do not know anything about that inspector so you may claim whatever you please johnson answered oh my would i have been set up with that one if you check your records you will see i did not bring this ships scooter back here that is also a truth henrep said it is unusual in that this tosevite does most of their scooter flying but it is a truth why did you not fly the scooter that time garanpo asked because my commandant ordered someone else to do it johnson answered garanpo was welcome to make what he wanted of that would your commandanthealey is the name is it not speak to me about this business garanpo asked he might act like a clumsy buffoon but that didnt mean he was one oh noit didnt mean that at all i cannot say inspector johnson replied how can i speak for my superior you would have to ask him i have seen that you tosevites are good at hiding behind one another garanpo observed lieutenant general healey could not hide behind me johnson said which was literally truehealey was twice as wide as he was most unsatisfactory most unsatisfactory i will get to the root of this inspector garanpo used an emphatic cough i wish you luck whatever your problems with ginger are i had nothing to do with them the first part of that was truth the second part should have been as far as johnson was concerned that made it effectively true too somehow he suspected inspector garanpo would have a different opinion the imperial laver scrubbed off ttomalss old body paint the imperial limner painted on the new the psychologist absentmindedly made the correct responses to what the two old females said and to the guards who made as if to bar his path as he approached the emperors throne he hadnt expected this summons to an audience which made it all the more welcome he bent into the special posture of respect before the th emperor risson whose gold body paint gleamed in the spotlights that shone on the throne arise senior researcher ttomalss the emperor said ttomalss stayed hunched over i thank your majesty for his kindness and generosity in summoning me into his presence when i am unworthy of the honor he probably sounded more sincere than most males and females who came before the emperor if only because hed given up hope of ever gaining an audience until the order to come to preffilo dashed out from behind a sand dune arise i say again risson told him this time ttomalss did the emperor said the race owes you a debt of gratitude for bringing senior researcher felless alert to the attention of our physicists we would be much further behind the big uglies than we areand we would not know where to begin to catch upif you had not i thank you your majesty i thought felless had come upon something important i turned out to be right when it might have been better for the empire had i turned out to be wrong felless deserves more credit than i do she was the one who noticed what the tosevites were sayingand then suddenly what they were not he didnt much like felless he never had even before her ginger habit made her a whole different sort of nuisance but he couldnt try to rob her of credit here not when anyone with an eye turret half turned toward things could tell she deserved it she will have what she deserves the emperor said unfortunately the speed of light still imposes delays for us so she will not have it right away i hope she is still living when our signal of congratulations reaches tosev you being here on home i can congratulate you on the spot i thank you for the kindness your majesty ttomalss said why thank me for what you have earned and richly deserve risson straightened on the throne signaling the end of the audience ttomalss made a retreat as formal as his advance had been herrep the protocol master waited for him in the bend in the corridor just outside the audience chamber proper you did pretty well senior researcher especially on such short notice herrep said i thank you superior sir ttomalss said this was my first audience with an emperor i have long hoped for the honor and now it is here his majesty spoke highly of your work and of what it means for the race herrep said you will of course be lodged at his expense this evening and our budget naturally covers the shuttlecraft fare back to sitneff everyone at the palace has shown me great kindness ttomalss said that was polite if not altogether true he doubted whether the imperial laver and limner had ever shown anyone great kindness or even a little the two horrid old females got their fingerclaws on him again after he turned away from the protocol master the laver cleaned off the special body paint suppliants wore before the emperor the limner replaced ttomalss usual paint she did it perfectly without checking any reference books ttomalss wondered how many different occupations and ranks she knew had she not intimidated him so much he might have asked the hotel put to shame the one in sitneff in which ttomalss and the american big uglies were staying the refectory was as fine as any in which ttomalss had ever eaten the sleeping mat in his room was almost as soft as a squashy tosevite bed it stopped just this side of being too soft the psychologist wouldnt have minded spending much more time there he had an excellent breakfast the next morning the ippafruit juice was as tangy as any hed ever tasted a car from the palace waited outside the lobby to whisk him to the shuttlecraft port as he got out he remarked to the driver i could get used to feeling important she laughed you are not the first who has had an audience to tell me that no i do not suppose i would be had ttomalss come to preffilo just a little earlier he likely would have mated with her but the season was over and he could think clearly again flying back to sitneff was routine he wondered how many shuttlecraft hed flown in over the years he couldnt begin to guess a lothe knew that he wondered why he bothered going back to the hotel nothing of substance was happening there these days the wild big uglies were just waiting for the commodore perry to get back so they could finish rubbing the races snout in its inferiority to them he was just another male just another lizard he thought the tosevites had an insulting nickname for his folk as the race did for them but sitting in the lobby was the shuttlecraft pilot the americans had brought back to home from tosev she got up and came over to him i greet you senior researcher she said and i greet you ttomalss answered can i do something for you nesseref started to make the negative gesture but checked herself maybe you can she said can we talk for a while i am at your service ttomalss said shall we go to the refectory and eat while we talk i had a snack in the shuttlecraft port but i could do with a little more what he ordered here wouldnt be as good as what hed had in the hotel in preffilo he sighed he wasnt rich enough to eat there very often he and nesseref both chose zisuili cutletshard to go wrong with those the shuttlecraft pilot said the american tosevites do at least try to act civilized what will become of us if the deutsche learn to travel faster than light before we do you are not the only one to whom this unpleasant thought has occurred ttomalss said i do not believe anyone has a good answer for it this is also my impression nesseref said and it worries me the americans as i say do make an effort when the deutsche find a group they do not care for they set about exterminating it i have seen this at first hand living as i did in the part of the main continental mass called poland my memory of tosevite geography is not all it might be ttomalss said the point is that poland borders the reich nesseref said it also has a large number of jews living in it you are familiar with the tosevite superstition called judaism and with how the deutsche react to it oh yes ttomalss used the affirmative gesture that was one of the first great horrors the conquest fleet found on tosev if the deutsche had it in their power they would do the same to us nesseref insisted and if they can travel faster than light they gain that power they could appear out of nowhere bombard one of our worlds and flee faster than we could follow our defenses are ready here ttomalss said we have sent messages to rabotev and halless ordering them to prepare themselves i suppose we could also send ships to help them though they would take twice as long as the messages to arrive what we have the technology to do we are doing i can only hope it will be enough and done soon enough nesseref said and then paused while the server set cutlets in front of ttomalss and her after the male left she continued i had a friend who was a jewa tosevite male named mordechai anielewicz he had been a guerrilla leader when the conquest fleet came sometimes opposing the deutsche sometimes opposing the race he eventually decided he could trust us he never trusted them now his grandchildren are fully mature but they like the deutsche no better and i cannot blame them the jews are unlikely to be objective ttomalss pointed out after swallowing a bite of zisuili meat it was all right they have no reason to be truthbut the behavior of the deutsche leads me to mistrust them too nesseref also took a bite she ate with more enthusiasm than ttomalss felt do you recall the deutsch pilot who attacked your ship during the war between the reich and the race i flew him back down to tosev his name was drucker i did not recall the name i recall the big ugly ttomalss used an emphatic cough what about him his hatchling belonged to one of the bandit groups the deutsche set up after their defeat to resist the race covertly nesseref said wait ttomalss let out a sharp hiss there was a big ugly called drucker who served as the reich s minister for air and space when the deutsche began to admit they had such a position again that is the same male nesseref said he was good at what he did and cautious about putting his fingerclaws where they did not belong his hatchling later rose to a high rank in the military of the reich a pity the deutsche never quite gave us the excuse to suppress them altogether ttomalss said a great pity nesseref agreed but then one could say the same about the rest of the tosevites they were trouble enough when they managed to come to home by any means at all now that their technology has got ahead of ours she didnt go on she didnt have to either ttomalss made the affirmative gesture he said we are doing what we can to catch up with them he didnt go on either the wild big uglies were too likely to monitor what went on in the refectory nesseref might not have realized that but she did grasp the problem facing the race for she asked can we endure until we do i hope so ttomalss answered as you say the americans do approach civilization at any rate he didnt think the big uglies would be offended to hear that they already knew what he and most members of the race thought of them but as nesseref had pointed out the americans were not the only big uglies as for the deutsche well if they attack us here on tosev our colony can strike back at them as soon as it learns of what they have doneand either the deutsche themselves or the americans would bring word to tosev before our signals got there the reich is not large it is vulnerable its notemperor must realize this must is a large word to use when speaking of big uglies nesseref said but i dare hope you are right so do i ttomalss said so do i when the big uglies decided it was time for atvar to return to his own solar system they didnt fly him back on the commodore perry the starship setting out for home this time was called the tom edison that the united states had built more than one ship that traveled faster than light worried him the race would have refined the first one till it was exactly the way they wanted it before making more tosevites didnt worry about refinement they just went ahead and did things and it worked he did ask who tom edison was learning that the big ugly had been an inventor came as a small relief at least they werent naming all these ships for warriors he didnt know how much that said about their intentions but it did say something sam yeager came to the hotel room where hed been politely and comfortably imprisoned to say goodbye i am surprised they let you in to see me atvar said do they not fear you will relay the secret orders i do not have to reffet and kirel and so touch off our colonys attack on your notempire some of them were afraid of that yes the whitehaired big ugly answered i managed to persuade them otherwise it was not easy but i managed we have known each other a long time you and i we are not on the same side but we are not enemies either or i hope we are not not through my eye turrets atvar said and who knows maybe we shall see each other again now that cold sleep is no longer necessaryfor your folk anyhowit could happen well so it could yeager said if not for cold sleep though i would have died a long time ago even with it who knows how much time i have he followed the interrogative cough with a shrug however long it is i aim to try to make the most of it will you do me a favor when you get back to home if it is anything i can do i will atvar replied i thank you i think you can send kassquit my best and my hatchlings it shall be done atvar said shall i also add a greeting from your hatchlings mate sam yeager laughed in the noisy tosevite way if you like he answered but she would not send it and kassquit would not believe it if she got it the two females did not get along as well as they might have this is unfortunate atvar said well i think i will send it perhaps being lightyears apart can bring peace between them perhaps it can yeager said i cannot think of anything else that would the fleetlord endured another ride in a tosevitemade shuttlecraft with a big ugly at the controls the hop up to the orbiting tom edison was as smooth as it would have been going up to a ship orbiting home the pilot seemed perfectly capable atvar was nervous even so tosevites just didnt take proper care in the things they made but they made things the race couldnt the looming bulk of the tom edison as the shuttlecraft approached rubbed atvars snout in that i greet you exalted fleetlord a uniformed american big ugly said when atvar came through the air lock let me take you to your room i thank you atvar replied it is my pleasure exalted fleetlord the tosevite male said atvar didnt care for the way his title sounded in the big uglys mouth like nicole nichols back on home the male didnt take it seriously atvar stared as he followed the guide not being under acceleration the ship had no gravity and they both pulled themselves along by the handholds in the corridors the tom edison struck atvar as being better finished than the commodore perry if the race hadnt been satisfied with the commodore perry the ship never would have flown the big uglies let it go out hoped for the best and improved the next one their way produced more progressand every now and then disasters the race would not have tolerated here we are the tosevite said this room will be yours please stay here until we are under acceleration you can access entertainment in your language through the computer food will be brought to you if you want any special refreshments you may request them but in the meanwhile i am a prisoner atvar said the big ugly used the negative gesture a guest atvar used it too if i were a guest i would be able to move freely with a shrug the american tosevite said i am sorry exalted fleetlord but i have my orders he sounded not the least bit sorry when atvar tried the door after going inside he discovered it would open which surprised him he wasnt quite a prisoner then that made him decide to stay where he was he would have caused more troubleas much as he couldif he had been locked up not till later did he wonder whether the big uglies would anticipate that a day and a half later it stopped mattering with a deep rumble he felt in his bones the tom edison left its place in orbit and began the journey out to where it could leap the gap between tosev s solar system and the one of which home was a part full acceleration took a while to build up atvar thought he was a trifle heavier than he had been aboard the commodore perry but he could not be sure one of the first big uglies he saw on emerging from his chamber was frank coffey his dark skin made him easy to recognize his leaf emblem had changed color which meant he was a lieutenant colonel now so you are returning to home atvar said that is a truth exalted fleetlord i am coffey said i managed to talk my government into sending me back i would like to be with kassquit when my hatchling comes forthand i have more experience on home than anyone there now while the second reason would have influenced the race the first was exclusive to the big uglies atvar did not know who had sired him or who had laid his egg except for the emperors line and the possibility of inherited diseases such things mattered little to the race it will be good i think for the american tosevites on home to have someone from your generation there with them atvar said i mean no offenseor not much anyhowwhen i say they make too much of themselves i have no idea whether they will pay any attention to me once i get there coffey sounded wryly amused atvar thought so anyhow though big uglies could still confuse him the american officer went on my government says they are supposed to but even with these new ships my government is a long way away he shrugged well we shall see what we shall see however that works out i am going back to home and i will be there when the hatchling comes forth we shall see what we shall see atvar thought about that after he went back to his room it was a truth but not for him a comfortable one what he feared he would see if he lived long enough was the ruination of his species and he did not know what he could do to stop it the journey back to home was as boring as the one to tosev had been part of him hoped the tom edison would have a mishap even if it killed him then he wouldnt have to admit to everyone on home that hed crossed between stars twice in much less than a year even counting the time hed spent on the big uglies native world waiting for them to get ready to send him back was it five and a half weeks till the starship got ready to jump the lightyears again atvar thought not but he wasnt quite sure he had to translate the awkward tosevite term into the races rational chronology to have any feel for how long it truly was he hadnt kept exact track on the journey to tosev so he couldnt properly compare now not keeping track had been a mistake he realized as much but he didnt see how he could have avoided it hed assumed he would go back on the same starship not a revised model as the race so often was in its dealings with the big uglies hed been wrong when the time for the crossing came the captain warned everyone in the ship to take a seat first in english then in the races language atvar obeyed for most of the travelers it wouldnt matter most tosevites felt nothing that seemed to be true for the race too at least neither straha nor nesseref had reported anything out of the ordinary then that turnedinsideout feeling interrupted his thoughts it lasted for a timeless instant that seemed to stretch out longer than the history of the empire he was everything and nothing nowhere and everywhere all at once and then it endedif it had ever really begunand he was nothing but himself again he didnt know whether to be sorry or glad the captain spoke in english atvar waited for the translation we are inside homes solar system everything performed the way it should have we expect a normal approach to the races planet two ships noat least two ships how many more did the big uglies have they surely knew just as surely atvar didnt were they visiting rabotev or halless even now if they were they would outrun news of their coming they would find the empires other two worlds undefended they could do whatever they wanted home wouldnt learn of it for years not unless the tosevites themselves chose to talk about it we shall see what we shall see he thought again whatever it was he couldnt do anything about it now he knew when the tom edison went into orbit around home because he went weightless before long a tosevite female came to escort him to the air lock we will take you down to sitneff now exalted fleetlord she said i thank you so very much atvar replied if she heard his sarcasm she didnt show it you are welcome she said i hope you had a pleasant flight atvar didnt dignify that with an answer a hundred thousand years of peace security and dominance shattering like glassand she hoped he had a pleasant flight not likely his shuttlecraft trip down to the surface of home was routine in every way and also less than pleasant so was the discovery that straha waited for him in the shuttlecraft terminal i greet you exalted fleetlord straha said and bent into a mocking posture of respect i trust you enjoyed yourself on tosev then you are a trusting fool atvar snapped i knew you were a fool but not one of that sort straha only laughed at him still charming as ever i see any residual doubts remaining the signals arriving from tosev would kill them if there are no no residual doubts atvar said they can do as they claim and that means hating him atvar said it means you are not only a trusting fool but a gloating fool straha just laughed again bruce yeager had settled his parents into a twobedroom apartment in torrance not far from where theyd lived before going into cold sleep the furniture or most of it was even their own the government had stored it against the off chance theyd come back the stove and the refrigerator were new and much more efficient than the ones they replaced jonathan yeager didnt much care about efficiency what mattered to him was that karen should like them she did also new was the computer the one that had gone into storage was a hopeless antique this one this one would do everything but tie jonathans shoes as a matter of fact it could do that too if he fitted it with a waldo attachment such things were common and cheap these days they made life closer to tolerable for handicapped people and had countless industrial uses besides before very long jonathan realized he was a handicapped person in this los angeles he knew exactly what his handicap was too he was missing almost forty years knowing didnt help he had no idea how to fix it when he complained karen said its nothing we have to worry about right away we may be missing the years but were not missing the money from them we wont miss any meals eitheri promise you that i know he said but i dont want to sit back and twiddle my thumbs the rest of my life i want to do something useful and it doesnt look like anything i can do is useful any more we both still know the race well karen said he shook his head here we knew the race well we know it well on home were up to date there were most of a lifetime behind here whod want to pay us to catch up karen started to say something but she didnt jonathan had a pretty good idea of what shed swallowed yes their son would doubtless put them on his payroll that stuck in jonathans craw he didnt think hed mind working for bruce but he would mind getting a sinecure and anything he would do would only be worth a sinecure i think id rather try to write my memoirs he said theyd be up to the minutewell pretty close nowand i can tell a story hardly anybody else will ever be able to can you do it well enough to get people to pay money for it karen said ive been asking myself the same question weve both done plenty of writing jonathan answered we ought to try anyhow i think we can do it he managed a wry grin its our story what could be more interesting to us than we are to us yeah karen said how about to anyone else all we can do is give it our best shot jonathan laughed out loud maybe we should ask mickey who his literary agent is yes i think we should karen said and she wasnt laughing at all she sounded bleak in fact as she went on for one thing that may help us for another mickey doesnt hate usor if he does hes more polite about it than donald he gives us more credit for doing the best we could jonathan wondered how good that best had been i think we did better with them than ttomalss did with kassquit not a fair comparison karen said we knew a lot more about the race when we started than ttomalss did about us when he started and mickey and donald had each other for company that had to help too jonathan might have known his wife wouldnt cut kassquit any slack but then karen surprised him by adding shell have her baby before too long so she will jonathan said i think frank was smart to go back over there hes not behind the times he helped make the arrangements the new people are dealing with the new people karen tasted the phrase they really do feel like that dont they like they just started out and everythings ahead of them i mean even when theyre our age theyve got that feel to them i dont know whether to be jealous or to want to pound some sense into their stupid heads theyre like the people who went west in covered wagons jonathan said they can taste the wide open spaces in front of them and do they ever have them jesus lightyear after lightyear of wide open spaces no wonder theyve got that look in their eye and they dont want to pay any attention to us were the city slickers who just want to stay back in phillyand that even though we went traveling yeah his wife nodded what we did hardly counts these days it was all the lizards had for all those thousands of years its still all they have and its as obsolete as we are jonathan nodded too melanie will have to go back to school if she wants to keep on being a doctor they know so much more now than they did when she went on ice tom and linda are as out of date as we are and dads got it even worse hes older and he spent all those extra years in cold sleep i think hell do fine though once he gets his feet on the ground karen said hes had to adapt before look how much things changed for him when the lizards came but he did okay then better than okay in fact hope youre right jonathan answered again he didnt much feel like arguing with his wife he didnt have much from which to argue only the lost look he thought he saw in his fathers eyes he suspected his old man would have indignantly denied it if anyone called him on it he also suspected the denial would mean nothing or maybe a little less instead of arguing jonathan said want to go to a movie tonight sure karen said and then with a wry smile of her own this is supposed to help us fit into the hereandnow well it depends on which one we pick jonathan said when he and karen were dating films showed things they hadnt when his father was a young man when his sons started taking girls out films showed things they hadnt in his day the trend hadnt slowed down while he and karen went to home and back a lot of what ordinary people lined up to see now would have been blue movies in the s they didnt have driveins any more either jonathan had fond memories of the one on vermont but apartment buildings stood where the lot and the big screen had been boys and girls these days didnt seem to feel the lack so they must have had other ways to find privacy when they wanted it karen flipped through the los angeles times just about all the photos and ads in the paper were in color which they hadnt been in we dont want the sappy kiddy shows she said those are just as bad as they ever were maybe worse jonathan didnt argue with that either she pointed to one movie ad and started to giggle here the curse of rhodes a horror flick how can they mess that up isnt that why were going jonathan asked karen raised an eyebrow he explained to find out how they can mess it up oh karen laughed sure but we know from the start that this is hokum she pointed to the ad again a bronze statue strode across what was presumably the aegean with a naked girl in its arms a few wisps of her long blond hair kept things technically decent works for me jonathan said solemnly karen made the kind of noise that meant she would clobber him if she werent such an enlightened tolerant wife a noise only a little less effective than a real set of lumps would have been jonathan mimed a whiplash injury and pointed out you were the one who suggested it well lets go she said we can always throw popcorn at the screen if it gets too awful she paused we may pick different times heres hoping jonathan said and laughed when she made a face at him most of the people buying tickets for the movie were in their teens or twenties most of the ones who werent had ten or twelveyearold boys in tow jonathan and karen looked at each other as if to ask what are we getting ourselves into they both started to laugh maybe a really bad horror movie was just what they needed jonathan bought popcorn and candy and cokes the smells of the concession stand hadnt changed a bit since before he went into cold sleep prices had but not too badly even back then theaters had gouged people on snacks the slope of the rows of seats was steeper than it had been back in a twentiethcentury theater that let each seat have a proper back without interfering with childrens views of the screen some unknown genius had thought of putting a cup holder in each armrest the rows were father apart than they had been jonathan could stretch out his feet he closed his eyes good night if you cant stay awake to leer at the naked girls dont expect me to shake you karen said he sat up very straight she poked him down went the lights there were more ads and fewer coming attractions than jonathan remembered maybe that meant he was turning into a curmudgeon but by body time it hadnt been that long ago so maybe the folks who ran things were trying harder to squeeze money out of people the sound was louder than he remembered too he had as much trouble enjoying the music as his father had had with what hed listened to when he was young that same pounding noisy beat suffused the curse of rhodes for a while he hardly noticed it the special effects were astonishing a lot of them would have been impossible or impossibly expensive in the twentieth century computers could do all sorts of things that had been beyond them in those days and then jonathan noticed something that wasnt a special effect he stared at the elderly archaeologist who was trying to calm the frightened young hero and heroineand who was bound to come to a bad end before long look at that guy he whispered to karen ill be damned if thats not matt damon she eyed the actor my god youre right he used to be just a little older than our kidsand he still is she squeezed his hand weve been away a long time the curse of rhodes showed that in other ways too the violence was one thing gore and horror movies went together like pepperoni and pizza but some of the doings between the hero the heroine and the resurrected badtempered colossus of rhodes jonathan wouldnt have taken a tenyearold to see them in he wasnt so sure he would have gone himself the heroine was either a natural blonde or very thorough she was also limber enough for an olympic gymnast though he didnt think they gave gold medals in that as the colossus sank beneath the wavesgone for good or ready to return in a sequel depending on how the curse of rhodes didand the credits rolled the house lights came up what did you think karen asked i know what the curse of rhodes is now jonathan said the screenwriter or maybe the director karen stuck out her tongue at him he went on it was really dumb and really gory and really dirty she nodded thats what we came for was it jonathan wasnt so sure he thought theyd come not least to try to forge some link between the time in which theyd lived and the one in which they found themselves the movie hadnt done itnot for him anyhow instead it reminded him over and over what a stranger he was here and now with a shrug he started for the parking lot maybe time would help maybe nothing would hed have to find out day by day that was all some things didnt change the building in downtown los angeles where sam yeager faced a colonel whod been born about the time he left for tau ceti was the one where hed worked a generation before that before he got saddled with the responsibility for mickey and donald the office furniture hadnt changed much either he wondered whether that battered metal desk could possibly date from the s colonel goldschmidt said no you are not permitted to see any lizards you might pass intelligence from fleetlord atvar to them you bureaucratic idiot sam didnt say it he was ever so tempted but he didnt what a good boy am i he thought even if he didnt have a plum on his thumb clinging to shreds of patience he said colonel you or somebody gave me permission to see atvar im sure you or somebody listened to what we said if id wanted to do that i could have gone to a pay phone the minute i got out of his hotel room but you didnt do that you didnt telephone any lizards from your place of residence either goldschmidt had a narrow face with cold blue eyes set too close together he wore a wedding ring which proved somebody loved him sam wondered why so youve been monitoring me he said goldschmidt nodded sam asked if you people thought i was that big a menace why did you let me see him in the first place there were discussions about that goldschmidt replied he gave no details even though the discussions had been about yeager the hatchetfaced colonels view was that they were none of his business it was decided that the risk was acceptable it was decided maybe that meant god had sent down a choir of angels with the answer more likely it meant no one wanted to admit hed done the deciding no some things didnt change sam said seems to me you people didnt think this through as well as you might have now that i have seen atvar how are you going to keep me away from lizards for the rest of my life when i take an elevator down to the lobby and walk out on the street its better than even money that i bump into one or two or three were only a few blocks from the races consulate you know colonel goldschmidt looked as if his stomach pained him i have my orders mr yeager you are not permitted to travel to any territory occupied by the race or to contact any members of the race then you can lock me up and throw away the keysam was careful to use the human idiom not the lizardsbecause ive already done it what where how now goldschmidt looked horrified had something slipped past him and his stooges my adopted sonsmickey and donald sam said oh them relief made the colonels voice sound amazingly human for a moment they dont count theyre us citizens and are considered reliable what about other lizards who are us citizens there are lots of them sam took a certain malicious glee in being difficult as we have not made determinations as to their reliability they are offlimits for you at this point in time colonel goldschmidt said yeager got to his feet he gave goldschmidt his sweetest smile no i beg your pardon its a technical term meaning well no sam answered i suppose you can keep me from leaving the country if you dont issue me a passportlord knows my old ones expired but if i want to see old friends i will or if i bump into a lizard on the street ill talk to him you may decide you made a mistake letting me see atvar but you went and did it you cant very well unpoach the egg there will be repercussions from this goldschmidt warned thats what i just told you sam said you people forgot there would be repercussions when you let me see atvar and now youre trying to get around them if you really thought i was a traitor you shouldnt have let me do it if you dont think i am why cant i see other lizards you cant have it both ways you know by goldschmidts expression he wanted to he said i am going to have to refer this to my superiors thats nice sam said meanwhile im going to do what i think is right hed been doing that for a long time yeah and look at the thanks ive got he thought he got some more now the last time you did what you thought was rightgoldschmidt all but spat the words at himit cost us indianapolis fuck you colonel sam said evenly the horse you rode in on too he walked out of goldschmidts office as he headed for the elevators he wondered if the army man would shout for mps to head him off hed already been held incommunicado once in his life and hadnt enjoyed it much the real irony was that hed told goldschmidt the exact and literal truth atvar hadnt given him any message to pass on to the lizards here on earth and he wouldnt have done it if the fleetlord had he was and always had been loyal to his country in spite of what seemed to be his countrys best efforts to make him change his mind no shouts came from behind him he stabbed at the elevators down button with unnecessary violence even so and clenched his fists while waiting for a car to arrive part of him the part that kept forgetting he wasnt a kid any more wanted a fight the rest of him knew that was idiotic one soldier in the prime of youth could clean his clock without breaking a sweat let alone two or three or four all the same the sigh that escaped him when the elevator door opened held disappointment as well as relief sure as hell lizards were on the streets when sam headed for the parking structure a couple of blocks away they seemed as natural to him as the hispanic men selling plastic bags of oranges and the british tourists festooned with cameras who exclaimed about how hot it was that made him want to laugh after home los angeles seemed exceedingly temperate to him one of the lizards almost bumped into him excuse me the lizard said in hissing english it is all right you missed me yeager answered in the races language he grinned fiercely hed taken less than a minute to violate colonel goldschmidts order and he loved doing it the lizards mouth fell open in a startled laugh you speak well he said in his own language please excuse me i am very late off he skittered for all the world like a scaly white rabbit i thank you sam called after him but he didnt think the lizard heard he was tempted to yell something like rosebud at the male just in case sitting in goldschmidts chair had been enough to plant a listening device on him that would give the army conniptions by god in the end though he kept his mouth shut he didnt want or didnt suppose he wanted to make these moderns any more paranoid than they were already his car was a threeyearold ford it wasnt enormously different from the ones hed owned before he went on ice the styling was plainerreal streamlining had taken a lot of individuality out of design one years models nowadays looked like anothers and one companys like anothers too the engine was smoother the radio sounded better but making cars had been a mature technology even in the changes were refinements not fundamentals he had no trouble driving it traffic was worse than he remembered the los angeles area had more than twice as many people as when hed gone into cold sleep and it didnt have more than twice as many freeways too many cars were trying to use the roads at the same time but things did thin out as he rode down to the south bay his apartment wasnt far from the one where karen and jonathan were living that was convenient for them in case he got sick it was also convenient for him they were two of the very few people he could talk to in any meaningful way where cold sleep separated him from the vast majority of mankind it had brought him closer to his son and daughterinlaw because hed been in it longer than they had i meant it colonel goldschmidtyou and the horse both he said when he walked in the door he assumed the apartment was bugged what could he do about it nothing he could see he sat at the computer for a while like jonathan and karen he was working on his memoirs he wondered if anyone would want to read his once he finished very few people these days remembered how things had been back in the s instead they knew what theyd learned in school about that time what theyd learned in school wasnt kind to one sam yeager he shrugged and typed some more if he couldnt persuade an american publisher to print the work he could still sell translation rights to the race the lizards would want to hear what he had to say even if his own people didnt and fasterthanlight travel might mean he could sell the rights not only on earth but also on home rabotev and halless and see the money now instead of in the great by and by that would be nice he had no guarantee hed be around for the great by and by odds were against it in fact he jumped when the telephone rang hed got used to phones on home that hissed and he was going well at the keyboard he said something unkind as he walked over and picked it up hello hello sam this is lacey nagel mickeys literary agent had taken him on and jonathan and karen as well he hadnt met her in person but gathered she was about the apparent age of his son and daughterinlaw shed been or at least seemed more optimistic about the project than he was some of that no doubt was professional necessity an agent who wasnt optimistic wouldnt stay in business but sam hoped some was real hi lacey he answered now whats up we have a deal with random house she said crisply sams jaw dropped then she told him how much it was for his jaw dropped farther all the way down onto his chest i hope thats satisfactory she finished my god he said and she laughed out loud he tried to come up with something more coherent the best he could do was how did you manage that well i didnt do anything to the acquiring editor that left a mark she said which made him laugh in turn she went on theyre excited about it in fact they must be or they wouldnt have made that offer they said it was high time you told your own story he couldnt very well have told it before this unless hed done it before he went into cold sleep that hadnt even occurred to him back then now the book would feel like history to everybody who read it my god he repeated i hope that means youre pleased lacey nagel said im more than pleasedim flabbergasted sam told her now theres a word i havent heard in a while she said im not surprised sam said without rancor i know the way i talk is oldfashioned as all getout these days saying all getout was oldfashioned these days too dont worry about it lacey said no matter how you say it what you have to say will be right up to the minute i hope so he still felt a littlemore than a littledizzy i was working on it when you called ohoh she said that means you want to wring my neck for interrupting you he shook his head lacey nagel couldnt see that his phone didnt have a video attachment which only proved how oldfashioned he was oh no he said if youve got news like that you can call me any old time thank you i dont think i said that before thank you he added an emphatic cough when he walked back to the computer his feet didnt touch the carpet once karen yeager walked softly around jonathan the two of them and sam yeager all had book deals now but jonathans dad had got his more than a month before either one of them that didnt bother her much but she could see how it got under her husbands skin she laughed at herself shed almost thought of it as getting under jonathans scalesproof as if she needed proof shed spent too much time around the race jonathan hadnt said much about the way he felt but he didnt need to spells of alternating gloom and bad temper said it for him hed come in second to his old man again and he didnt like it one damn bit hearing the doorbell came as a relief whos that what does he want jonathan said grumpy still one easy way to find out karen opened the door oh hello mickey come in thanks mickey said karen waved him to a chair theyd bought a couple adapted to a lizards shape but mickey sat down in an ordinary armchair im more used to these damn things he swung one eye turret toward karen the other toward jonathan and whose fault is that well we could blame the federal government karen said its a handy targetand it is where jonathans dad got your eggs mickey shook his head he did that as naturally as most lizards shaped the negative gesture too big a target i need to blame people not a thing weve already apologized jonathan said theres not much else we can do about it now and youll have the last laugheven with our cold sleep odds are youll outlive us by plenty your father already told me the same thing mickey said most of the time that would have been fine now now jonathan made a noise down deep in his throat he didnt want to hear that his father had got there ahead of him one more time mickey went on yeah ill live a long time but what will i live as a curiosity hell im a curiosity even to myself would you like to be a curiosity with a drink karen asked sure rum and coke mickey said as she went to the kitchen he added you yeagers all of you youre my familyall the family ive got except for donald the only problem with that is i shouldnt have any family and if i did have a family it shouldnt be full of humans karen brought him the drink and scotch for her and jonathan well well try not to hold it against you she said both his eye turrets turned sharply toward her then he realized she was joking and chuckleda rusty imitation of the noise a human would make donald would have bitten you for that he said sipping donald may resent people but hes piled up a hell of a lot of money making them laugh jonathan said mickey shrugged ive piled up a hell of a lot of money too ive got nothing against moneydont get me wrong lifes better with it than without it but donald was right about what he told you the day you came down from the commodore perry the fellow who said it cant buy happiness knew what he was talking about that makes donald angrier than it does me instead of biting them he makes them laughand then he laughs at them for laughing at him jonathan caught karens eye he nodded slightly so did she that made more sense than she wished it did it also went a long way towards explaining the urgency of donalds performance on youd better believe it something not far from desperation surely fueled it do you laugh at us too karen asked sometimes not quite so often i still want to be one of you more than donald does mickey answered yeah i know thats silly but its how i was raised i speak english as well as i can with this mouth but i have an accent when i use the races language aint that a kick in the head kassquit speaks the races language as well as she can with her mouth jonathan said its the only one she knows she never learned any of ours thats a damn shame mickey added an emphatic cough but a lot of human englishspeakers these days would have done the same thing you could have done worse ive never said anything different donald may havebut donald doesnt always even take himself seriously so why should you before either karen or jonathan could answer the doorbell rang again grand central station around here karen said when she opened the door she found donald out there on the walkway well what can i do for you may i come in he asked please mockery danced in his voice of course karen stepped aside youre always welcome here were not angry at you we never have been no matter what youve decided to think about us how christian of you that was more mockery now flaying rather than dancing but donald started slightly when he saw mickey ah my siamese twin the only lizard on four planets as screwed up as i amexcept he wont admit it oh i admit it mickey said how could i do anything else its true for christs sake the difference is i dont think we can do anything about it now and i dont think theres much point to getting upset about the way it happened why not theyre to blame donald pointed to karen and jonathan them and old sam well take some of the blame for the way you turned outsome but not all jonathan said you have to blame yourself too dont hold your breath mickey said donald let out an angry hiss like some of the purely human noises kassquit made when she was furious or surprised that one seemed instinctive in the race can i fix you a drink to go with everyone elses karen asked donald she gave him her sweetest smile no need to check it for rat poison i promise meow he said most of the time i get paid for being rudethough there are some people for whom id do it for nothing id love one thanks whatever hes having he pointed to mickeys rum and coke you yeagers made damn sure our tastes would be the same didnt you in a word no karen answered over her shoulder as she went back into the kitchen it did work out that way a lot of the time but not always it often does with two brothers especially when theyre the same age brothers how do you know were brothers donald said all we were when you got us was a couple of eggs they could have come from anywherefrom two different anywheres for all you know they did now karen and jonathan looked at each other in consternation they and jonathans father had always assumed the eggs theyd got from the government came from the same female karen realized donald was right they had exactly zero proof of that she wondered if the people whod got the eggs from the lizards had any idea whether they belonged together after seventy years she couldnt very well ask odds were none of those people was still alive if you want to know bad enough theres genetic testing jonathan said ive talked about it the race thinks im some kind of a pervert for caring one way or the other donald answered but i do careand theres one more thing thats your fault im a goddamn human being with scales thats what i am i already told you i watch ritas tits didnt i yeah i thought so i shouldnt give a damn i know i shouldnt give a damn but i do i cant help it its how i was raised thanks a lot both of you he raised his glass in a scornful salute then gulped the drink i watch women too mickey confessed i keep thinking theyre what i ought to want even though i cant really want anything unless i smell a females pheromones even then half of me thinks i ought to be mating with a pretty girl not with a lizard oh lord theyre even more screwed up than kassquit is karen thought miserably as far as she knew kassquit had never wanted to lie down with a lizard but then the race didnt parade sex out in front of everybody and use it to sell everything from soap to station wagons the way people did except during mating season lizards were indifferentand after mating season they tried to pretend it hadnt happened with humans the titillation was always out there mickey and donald had responded to it even if they couldnt respond to it and if that wasnt screwed up what the devil would be donald thrust his glass out to her may i have a refill please now he didnt even give her the excuse of rudeness to say no all right she wasnt all that sorry for a chance to retreat we do have a lot to answer for i know that jonathan said we went ahead even after we knew what kassquit was like that should have warned usit did warn us but we went ahead anyway mickey slid a sly eye turret in donalds direction dont beat yourselves up about it too much for all you know he would have been crazy if the lizards raised him too donald used a negative gesture that didnt come from the race but that nobody in the usa was likely to misunderstand you just give them excuses he snarled enough karen said suddenly enough with all of this we did what we did it wasnt perfect it couldnt have been by the nature of things but it was the best we knew how to do and its over we cant take it back if you want to hate us for what we did donald go right ahead we cant do anything about that either well well if anything ever fazed donald he didnt let it show and i thought i was the one with the sharp teeth letting his lower jaw drop he showed off a mouthful of them arent you afraid ill make nasty jokes about you on the show go ahead if thats what you want to do karen answered theyll make you look worse than they do us and youll just give me more juicy bits for my book or would you rather i put you over my knee and paddled you she hadnt done that since donald was much smaller sometimes as with human children it had been the only way to get his attention he rose now with what might have been anger or dignity no thanks he said however messed up i am i dont take pain for pleasure take it no karen said give it donald spun and sped out of the apartment he didnt even slam the door behind him congratulations i think mickey said ive never seen anybody do that to him before karen got herself another scotch as she put ice cubes into the whiskey she said i dont want congratulations i want to go back into the bedroom and cry rip van winkle didnt know what to do when he woke up either and we were asleep a lot longer than he was o brave new world that has such difficult people int jonathan misquoted now that you mention it yes karen turned to mickey nothing personal he shook his head its all personal if it werent you wouldnt be so upset he was right of course and karen knew it shed thought they could come back to america and fit in better than theyd managed in the few months since theyd come down from the commodore perry maybe things would improve as time went by she hoped so it wasnt the country shed left close to forty years earlier she hadnt changed and it had and she had trouble getting used to it who was right was she for thinking things had been fine the way they were was the rest of the country for going on about its business without her was it even a question of right and wrong or just one of differences she knew shed be looking for answers the rest of her life the refectory was the only chamber in the admiral peary big enough to gather most of the crew together even lieutenant general healey came to hear the presentation by the officer from the tom edison seeing healeys bulky form did nothing to delight glen johnson but he stayed as far away from the commandant as he could lieutenant colonel katherine wiedemann carried a mike the size of a finger that let her voice fill up the hall they hadnt had gadgets like that when johnson went into cold sleep i want to thank you for your interest and attention she said and tacked on an emphatic cough ever since the commodore perry got here and found youd arrived safely weve had to work out what would be best for you this was especially challenging because so many of you are restricted to weightlessness but now we have the answer for you not we think we have the answer not we have an answer either mickey flynn murmured oh no we have the answer hush johnson said but he took flynns point these twentyfirstcentury americans were a damned overbearing lot they thought they could lord it over the twentiethcentury crew of the admiral peary by virtue of owning forty more years of history the evidenceand the powerwere on their side too you will have a choice lieutenant colonel wiedemann said she was blond and sternlookingif anyone argued with her she was liable to send him to the woodshed you may stay here aboard the admiral peary if you like or you may return to the solar system in the tom edison no matter how stern she was she had to pause there because everybody in the refectory started talking at once three people shouted the question that was also uppermost in johnsons mind how how do we do that with the help of her strong little wireless mike lieutenant colonel wiedemann answered if youll listen to meif youll listen to me ladies and gentlemen ill tell you she waited the hubbub didnt stop but it did diminish at last she nodded thank you for your attention she would have made a hell of a sixthgrade teacher we intend to send the tom edison off to the transition point at a lower acceleration than normaljust g our medical experts are confident that this will not be dangerous even to those of you who have been weightless the longest the journey will take longer because of the lower acceleration but it will be safe again she left no possible room for doubt this time johnson was one of the people calling questions what do we do when we get there maybe he was very loud or maybe she was going to answer that question next anyhow when you arrive in earth orbit you will have another choice she declared you may stay in orbit in weightlessness on one of the us space stations for the rest of your lives the stronger of you may also choose to settle at moon base alpha or moon base beta the gravity on the moon is g permission to settle there will be granted only with the approval of physicians at the space stations johnson tried to imagine himself with weight again the trip back on the tom edison didnt worry him so much his effective weight there would be about eight pounds he exercised regularly and was sure he could deal with that but if he tried to go live on the moon hed weigh about twentyfive pounds that was enough to notice some peopleflynn stone and lieutenant general healey toohad been weightless even longer than he had because theyd gone into cold sleep later but it had still been close to twenty years by his body clock since hed felt gravity what do we do if we stay someone asked in that case you will remain aboard the admiral peary lieutenant colonel wiedemann replied we will send replacements across from the tom edison to handle the jobs of those who elect to return to the solar system we want to continue to have an armed presence in the tau ceti systemand a monitoring presence too this ship is the only choice available for that until we have more ftl craft in service that day is coming but it is not yet here more questions followed but those were the ones that mattered most what do you think johnson asked flynn as the gathering broke up interesting choice the other pilot answered we can be obsolescent here or obsolete there that was about the size of it johnson said new faces back there flynn twisted his notsonew face into a notsohappy expression by what ive seen from the commodore perry and the tom edison new faces are overrated theyre an improvement on yours sure but thats not saying much gee thanks a bunch johnson said mickey flynn regally inclined his head lieutenant general healey zoomed past as usual a bull in a china shop no im not going anywhere he said to anyone who would listen my assignment is commandant of the admiral peary and i aim to carry it out when i leave this ship ill leave feet first johnson hadnt been in much doubt about what he would do hearing that removed the last traces of it going back to earth would be strange seeing it and not being able to land on it would be frustrating spending the rest of his life with lieutenant general healey would be like going to hell before he died he didnt know how much that particular worry bothered other people but a majority of the crew on the admiral peary mickey flynn among them applied to go back to the solar system johnson wondered if healey would try to hold him back but the commandant didnt healey probably wanted to be rid of him as much as he wanted to be rid of healey when a shuttlecraft took johnson to the tom edison his first thought was that the new starship felt much more finished than the admiral peary did the admiral peary was a military ship first last and always and had no frills or fanciness of any sort the tom edison s accommodations though cramped were far more comfortable and computers had come a long way since the admiral peary left the solar system johnson discovered he had access to an enormous library of films and television programs including a whole great swarm that were new to him because theyd been made since he went on ice he hoped that meant he wouldnt be bored on the way back to earth no matter what lieutenant colonel wiedemann said he had worried about what owning any sort of weight again would do to him but the toughlooking officer turned out to have known what she was talking about the only time he really noticed he had weight was when he missed a handhold as he brachiated through the starship then hed slowly glide to the floor instead of just floating along to the next one his legs proved plenty strong to push him on to the next gripping point mickey flynn weighed more than eight pounds but he also seemed to be coping well enough nice to eat new meals he remarked in the galley one day then raised his hand in selfcorrection i should say new styles of meal we didnt eat the same supper over and over on the admiral peary after all no it only seemed that way johnson agreed of course these ships dont have to recycle as much as we did they can get resupplied whenever they come back to the solar system we were out there for the long haul it certainly seemed like a long haul flynn said and johnson couldnt very well argue with that he dutifully lay down on his bunk when the ship neared the transition point the warning announcement said that some people felt what it described as unusually intense vertigo that didnt sound like a whole lot of fun what he felt when the tom edison leaped the lightyears was exactly nothing he shrugged anyone who suffered from vertigo wasnt going to make it as a pilot that evening in the refectory he asked flynn whether hed felt anything not me the other pilot replied im normal god help us all in that case johnson said flynn looked aggrieved he did it very well johnson wondered if he practiced in front of a mirror seeing earth again even if only on a video screen brought a lump to johnsons throat hed got occasional glimpses of the home planet when he was out in the asteroid belt on the lewis and clark but a blue star near a shrunken sun wasnt the same as seeing oceans and clouds and continentsand there by god there was the united states clouds covered most of the eastern half of the country but he didnt care he knew it was there when the tom edison s shuttlecraft took him to a space station he found a tall mound of paperwork to remind him in another way that hed come home he formally retired from the marine corps and discovered just how much money he had to draw on this doesnt include the living allowance youll have here said the functionary handling his case this is accumulated pay and interest its mighty interesting johnson allowed he really could be a sugar daddy down belowif it werent for gravity up here he wasnt so sure about that finding out could also be mighty interesting though the functionary looked pained do all you rip van winkles make bad puns ah youve been dealing with mickey flynn johnson said and surprised the man all over again will you want to stay here in weightlessness or would you rather settle in one of the bases on the moon the modern asked i dont know yet do i have to decide right away johnson replied reluctantly the other man shook his head no not yet but the longer you stay weightless the harder it will be for your body to get used to the moons gravityif it can at all ive been weightless for years and years johnson answered i dont think a few days to make up my mind will kill me or my chances the longer he stayed at the space station the less inclined he was to leave it was a much busier operation than any hed known in space before leaving earth orbit of course that was almost seventy years ago now in those days space travel had been almost exclusively military nowadays this place was a tourist trap he shopped he spent money in stores and bars that felt strange after doing without cash and credit cards for so long in one of those bars he met a woman from cincinnati who hadnt been born when he went into cold sleep donna thought he talked a little funny he thought everybody these days talked a little funny but she thought he was interesting too one thing most enjoyably led to another ive never done it weightless before she said in his chamber its different yeah it had been a hell of a long time since johnson had done it any other way it had in his opinion been too damn long since hed done it at all what do you think about being back after all the things you did and all the places you went to she asked well right this minute i like it fine he answered that made her laugh though he was kidding on the square in an odd way the encounterwhich lasted only a daymade up his mind this wasnt earth but it was the next best thing hed stay here kassquit stared down at the little female hatchling in her arms shed already known that tosevite hatchlings were much less able to fend for themselves than those of the race in the twenty days since hers came forth shed seen that again and again for herself but the hatchling did know how to feed itself and sucked greedily now kassquits breasts were still tender but she was getting used to nursing it wasnt anything the race would doit wasnt anything the race could dobut it had a satisfaction of its own and she was convinced it helped forge the emotional attachment between mother and hatchling that formed such an important part of tosevite society along with things like that she was finally learning some english having a word to describe nursing instead of the long circumlocution she would have needed in the races language came in handy and since the hatchling hadnt exactly hatched baby seemed more precise because it was female it was a daughter had it been male it would have been a son that puzzled her because she thought son was also the word for a star sooner or later she hoped it would make sense as with a lot of things that had to do with wild big uglies though she recognized that it might not someone knocked on the door that had to be a tosevite a member of the race would have used the hisser come in kassquit called it is not locked shed hoped it would be frank coffey and it was i greet you he said and then to the baby and i greet you too julia and i greet you kassquit answered and so does yendys even if she cannot tell you so because her mouth is full that wasnt the only reason the baby couldnt talk of course coffeys chuckle showed he knew shed made a joke they both agreed the baby should have two names since it had two heritages how are you feeling asked julia yendys father another english word kassquit had come to know day by day i get stronger kassquit answered she would much rather have laid an egg than gone through what tosevite females did to produce an offspring unfortunately she hadnt had the choice the tosevite physician had seemed capable enough but he couldnt make the process any too delightful and afterwards as soon as it was finally over shed felt as if a herd of zisuili had trampled her little by little that crushing exhaustion faded but only little by little the baby swallowed wrong choked and started to cry having one word for the horrible noises a baby made was useful toonot pleasant but useful kassquit put a cloth on her shoulder and raised julia yendys to it she patted the babys back till it expelled the air it had swallowedand some sour milk that was what the cloth was for bare skin didnt do the job shed got the cloth from the american big uglies they used such materials much more than the race did and were better at manufacturing them just as the race knew things about paint that the tosevites hadnt imagined she patted julia yendys face with the cloth are you done now she asked as usual the baby gave not a clue let me hold her coffey said kassquit passed him the baby he was bigger than she was and could comfortably hold his daughter in the crook of his arm he had had no offspring till this one but he still seemed more practiced with her than kassquit did he crooned vaguely musical nonsense to the baby what is that song kassquit asked we call it a lullaby he answered sometimes it helps make a baby go to sleep since she has just had some food and she is still dryi stuck a finger in there to checkmaybe this will be one of those times and julia yendys eyes did sag shut coffey also had an easier time than kassquit at getting her to go to sleep kassquit sometimes resented that right now it came as a relief the baby stirred when coffey eased her down into the cribwhich had made the trip from tosev on the tom edison but did not wake kassquit stared down at her she is halfway between the two of us in color she said not surprising coffey said we both have something to do with her you know kassquit made the affirmative gesture truth but i am used to the race all the subspecies that used to exist here have mixed together till it is practically uniform i know that is not true for tosevites but here i see a beginning of such blending frank coffey shrugged our subspecies were mostly isolated till much more recently than those of the race and we are also more particular about whom we mate with than the race is males and females of one tosevite subspecies often prefer a partner from that same group not always kassquit set a hand on his arm he covered it with his own hand i did not say always i said often i know the difference between the two but that also helps make mixing slower with us i understand kassquit said do you suppose tosevites will ever become as blended as the race is now before the commodore perry came to home i would have said yes coffey replied now i am not so sure some of the groups that form colonies will all come from one kind of tosevite or another on their new worlds they will breed only with themselves colonies are much easier to start now which also means that isolation of subspecies is easier to preserve that is not good especially when members of some of your subspecies think they are better than others kassquit observed the wild big ugly laughed though he did not seem amused members of all our subspecies think they are better than others he said and added an emphatic cough i think that is too bad but i have no idea what to do about it how will it affect the empire kassquit asked i have no idea about that either he told her anyone who says he knows now is lying we can only wait and see it depends on many things how soon the race learns to travel that way kassquit said how soon the deutsche do too whether you americans decide on a preventive war against us and whether the race decides to try to destroy tosev coffey added kassquit made the affirmative gesture that did also enter in the american went on too many variables not enough data we have to find out i already said that kassquit wanted certainty shed learned that from the race she couldnt have it every time tosevites touched her life certainty exploded every time the wild big uglies touched the race its certainties from millennia past exploded she looked down at julia yendys whod exploded the certainty that she would never breed she still didnt know what to think about that raising a tosevite hatchling was an astonishing amount of work she began to understand why family groupings loomed so large among the wild big uglies without them hatchlingsbabies would die it was as simple as that wait until the baby begins to smile frank coffey said it will not be too much longer that is a day to remember maybe but i cannot return the smile i never learned how kassquit imagined herself as a hatchling trying again and again to bond with ttomalss through facial expressions but ttomalss wasnt biologically programmed to respond and so her own ability to form those expressions had atrophied she didnt want that to happen to julia yendys her own baby should be a citizen of the empire yes but should also be a complete and perfect tosevite do not worry too much coffey said i promise i will smile lots and lots for my daughter after an emphatic cough he pulled back his lips and showed his teeth in a big grin and there will be plenty of other wild big uglies to show her how to make funny faces he made a very funny one crossing his eyes and sticking out his tongue it startled kassquit into a laugh that is good she said i was just thinking the baby should have more of its tosevite heritage than i do that made the american big ugly serious again well you were raised to be as much like a member of the race as possible i would not want that for julia yendys and i am glad you do not either what i want for her is the chance to grow up and live out her life in peace and happiness how likely do you think that is frank coffey sighed and shrugged kassquit i already told youi have no better way to judge that than you do i just do not know all we can do is go on and hope and do all we can to make that happen even if we know it may not if we do not tryif the united states and the race do not trythen we are much too likely to fail what would you do if there were a war kassquit asked probably die he answered she gave back an exasperated hiss one that might have sprung from the throat of either a tosevite or a member of the race he shrugged again i do not know what else to say it would depend on what happened on where i was on a thousand other things i cannot know ahead of time that was reasonable kassquit had hoped for a ringing declaration that he would never fight no matter what but a little thought told her that was too much to expect he served the united states with as much dedication as she served the empire and he was a military male if his notempire required him to fight fight he would he said you should have the baby immunized against as many of our diseases as you can she will meet many more wild tosevites at an earlier age than you did i have already talked about this with the new doctor kassquit said he agrees with you that this would be good i will follow his advice he also urges me to get more immunizations for the reason you mentioned fasterthanlight travel will mean more tosevites coming to home which will mean more chances for disease to spread good not good that disease may spreadgood that you and the doctor have thought about it coffey said he does seem to know what he is doing call me oldfashionedi cannot help it considering when i was hatchedbut a lot of the moderns get under my scales and make me itch he had no scales to get under but used the races phrase all the same kassquit made the affirmative gesture this doctor knows much more than melanie blanchard did i am sure of that but i liked her while when i see him it is all business he is a better technician but a poorer person coffey said truth that is what i was trying to say you do what you can with what you have i do not know what else there is to do coffey said the other choice is not doing what you can with what you have and that is worse if you do not make the most of what you have why live truth kassquit said once more have i made the most of what i have she wondered looking back she didnt see how she could have done much more some things she did not have and never would she could rail at ttomalss for that but what was the point her upbringing was what it was she couldnt change it now she remained bright even by tosevite standards she remained within hissing distance of sanity and shed hadshed really hadan audience with the emperor she looked down at julia yendys once more now she also had a chance to make her babys life better than hers had been that was a chance members of the race didnt get not in the same way she intended to make the most of it when the telephone rang sam yeager jumped like a startled cat hed been deep in workdeeper than hed thought obviously well it wasnt going anywhere he walked over to the phone hello hi dad what are you up to oh hello jonathan i was reading the galleys for safe at home as a matter of fact theyve got a tight deadline and i want to make sure i get em done on time good for you his son said catch any juicy mistakes i think the best one was when american helmet came out as american hamlet that would have spread confusion far and wide if it got through jonathan laughed youre not kidding are you too busy to come over for dinner tonight i hope notkarens got some mighty nice steaks twist my arm sam said and then what time about six jonathan answered see you then sam hung up he looked at his watch it was a quarter past four he worked on the galleys for a little while longer spotting nothing more entertaining than form for from like the one hed told jonathan about that passed muster on a computerized spelling program most of the errors he found were of that sort the rest came on words and place names from the lizards language terms that werent in spelling programs to being with with those typesetters could inflict butchery as they had in years gone by he set down the red pen put on a pair of slacks instead of the ratty jeans hed been wearing and went down to his car on the way to jonathan and karens place he stopped in a liquor store for a sixpack of beer he remembered being disappointed with budweiser ninety years ago when it started reousting local beers after the first round of fighting between humans and lizards ended things hadnt got better up till he went into cold sleep bud and miller and schlitz and a couple of others had swept all before them they were available they were standardized they were cheap and they werent very interesting but while hed been on ice beer had had a renaissance oh the national brands were still around even their packaging hadnt changed much but to make up for it swarms of little breweries turned out beer that cost more but made up for it by not only tasting good but by tasting good in a bunch of different ways who wanted to drink fizzy water with a little alcohol in it when porter and steam beer and barley wine were out there too jonathan laughed when sam handed him the mixandmatch sixpack itll go with what i went out and bought he said fine if i get smashed you can put me on the couch tonight sam said if i get smashed karenll put me on the couch tonight his son said you can sleep on the floor if im smashed enough i wont care sam sniffed besides ill be full of good food he pitched his voice to carry into the kitchen youre a nice man karen called from that direction the steaks were as good as promised buttertender and rare enough to moo what we had on home wasnt bad sam said after doing some serious damage to the slab of cow in front of him it wasnt bad at all we didnt have any trouble living on it but this tastes right in a way that never could ive heard lizards say the same thing but with the opposite twist jonathan said they dont mind what they get here but to them the good stuff is back on home im not convinced karen said put us in japan and well think japanese food is weird too japanese people feel the same way about what we eat a lot of it has to do with cooking styles and spices not with the basic meat and vegetables a lot more has to do with whether were used to eating whats in front of us sometimes different is just different not better or worse or right or wrong sam thought about that after a few seconds he nodded ive been used to eating my words for years so they dont taste bad at all youre right im sure of it no matter what hed said to jonathan he didnt get drunk back when he was a kid hed thought tying one on was fun he wondered why part of it he supposed was coming to manhood during prohibition he was one of the last men alive who remembered it and wondered if they even bothered teaching about it in us history these days it would be ancient history to kids growing up now the way the presidency of john quincy adams had been for him but hed gone right on getting smashed after drinking became legal again a lot of his teammates had been hard drinkers that wasnt enough of an excuse for him though and he knew it hed enjoyed getting loaded he hadnt enjoyed it so much the morning after but that was later he wondered why hed enjoyed it because it gave him an excuse to get stupid that didnt seem reason enough not looking back on it jonathan and karen also held it to a couple of beers he knew theyd done their share of drinking before he went on ice and stopped being able to keep an eye on them he laughed at himself no doubt theyd missed that a lotjust the way a frog missed a saxophone theyd done fine without him which was of course the way things were supposed to work he drove home with no trouble at all his head was clear enough to work on the manuscript for a while before he went to bed when he got up the next morning he didnt have a headache he didnt have any memories of stupidity or worse holes where he needed to find memories arent i smug and superior he thought as he sipped his morning coffee the next day he was more sober than he had been once upon a time so what all over the world people by the millions needed no excuse at all to drink as much as they could hold or a little more than that hed just come out of the shower when the phone rang that made him smile whoeverd tried to catch him in there had missed hello yes is this sam yeager that i have the honor to be addressing alertness tingled through sam though speaking english that was a lizard on the other end of the line yes this is sam yeager whos calling please talking to members of the race once one of sams greatest pleasures was fraught with risk these days they still hoped he might have a message from home for them the american government still feared he did he didnt and wouldnt have delivered it if he had nobodynot lizards not american officialswanted to believe him when he said so i am tsaisanx the races consul in los angeles sam whistled softly tsaisanx should have known better hed been consul here for a human lifetime and was a veteran of the conquest fleet if he didnt know better than to call here maybe it was a mark of desperation i greet you consul sam said using the races formula but sticking to english you do know i hope that anything we say will be monitored you had better tell me very plainly what you want tsaisanx let out a hissing sigh i would rather talk in greater privacy i wouldnt sam used an emphatic cough i have nothing to say that others cant hear nothingdo you understand me i cannot believe that tsaisanx said you aided us before why not now i helped you when i thought we were wrong sam said im not going to help you when i think were right so we know something the race doesnt all i have to say is good for us we didnt do anything we shouldnt have to learn it all we did was make experiments and see where they led if you want to do the same thing okay fine go right ahead you are not showing a cooperative attitude the races consul complained tough sam used another emphatic cough im very sorry but i dont feel like cooperating here not only that i damn well cant am i plain enough or shall i draw you a picture he was about to hang up on the lizard a bit of rudeness he couldnt have imagined before coming back to earth on the commodore perry you are painfully plain tragedy trembled in tsaisanxs voice what is also plain is that my civilizationindeed my entire speciestrembles on the brink of extinction and youyou do not feel like cooperating im afraid i cant be polite about this so i wont bother trying sam said when the conquest fleet came you intended to do to us what you did to the rabotevs and the hallessi you were going to turn us into imitations of the race and rule us forever if we didnt like it too bad you were ready to kill as many of us as you needed to get the message across i was there too i remember if you think im going to waste a hell of a lot of sympathy on you now youd better think again thats all ive got to tell you rabotev and halless are both better happier healthier worlds than they were before they became part of the empire tsaisanx said tosev also would have been we would have made sure of it take up the white mans burden sam thought he didnt doubt that tsaisanx meant it the lizard was nothing if not sincere all the same he said the united states is a better happier healthier place than it was before you got here and we did it all by ourselves how much of our technology did you steal acid filled tsaisanxs voice a good bit sam admitted but we would have done it without that too if youd never come wed be better and healthier and happier than we were ninety years ago we wouldnt be the same as we are now but we wouldnt be the same as we were back then either you think progress is something to squash we think its something to build on and we would have with you or without you we really have nothing to say to each other do we tsaisanx said sadly and here all this time i thought you understood i door i think i do anyhow sam replied i just dont agree theres a difference farewell tsaisanx hung up so long sam said though the lizard couldnt hear him he put the handset back in the cradle shaking his head he returned to the galleys of safe at home a minute later he stood up again he couldnt concentrate on the words in front of him all these years all these upheavals and what did it mean his own people thought hed betrayed them and now the lizards thought hed betrayed them too he wondered if he should have called the book a moderates story what was a moderate but somebody both sides could shoot at but he still thought hed had it right with tsaisanx even if the race hadnt come the united states would be a better place now than it was in the rest of the world might be better too in ways it had never had a chance to show with the lizards sitting on half of it he shrugged and returned to the galleys hed already seen so much happen more than almost any man alive hed gone from horse and buggy to spanning the lightyears one way in cold sleep the other in the wink of an eye and what would the next chapter be he could hardly wait to find out about the author harry turtledove was born in los angeles in
